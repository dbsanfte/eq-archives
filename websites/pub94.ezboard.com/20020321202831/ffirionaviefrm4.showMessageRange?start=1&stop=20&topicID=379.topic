<br>
I first tried to buy the rings off this person, and the only way he would do the deal is if I ran from halas to the umbral plains, somewhere in luclin.  Kookee/Drus insisted that he wouldn't meet anywhere else, only the umbral plains...<br>
<br>
No big deal, I figured maybe Kookee/Drus just had something shoved up his butt that day..  So I figured Id try contacting him/her next day.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so I contacted Kookee/Drus the next day, about buying the rings.  Kookee/Drus was again too lazy to meet up in a mutually easily accessable place, so I decided to go meet Kookee/Drus in the place HE wanted to meet at, the nexus in luclin.  <br>
<br>
So I left my group, ran to north karana, waited to get ported up, then I get to the NEXUS, the place this IDIOT told me to meet him, I got there only 10 minutes after we set up the meeting time, and hes gone.  He gives some lame excuse about he needs xp and phat loots, and that hes now busy to meet me.<br>
<br>
So I've left my group, went to Luclin nexus to meet Kookee/Drus, taking less than 10 minutes to get there, and hes gone.  After I get ported there, he tells me &quot;oh, I had to leave&quot;.<br>
<br>
I try talking to him further, asking this moron why the heck he would leave, when this was the place HE chose to meet at, and I was there in less than ten minutes, but I got no further response.  I guess even he didn't have an answer for why he did the idiotic things he did...<br>
<br>
Some friends of mine tried talking to him, since he seemed to be ignoring me, and he started swearing at them and shooting off his 5 year old mouth at them, which made me way madder.  This idiot has the nerve to screw me over, then go around shooting his mouth off and swearing at my friends that are trying to help?  Can Kookee/Drus act like any more of an idiot?<br>
<br>
So all I have to say, is Kookee/Drus is a complete moron.  Set up a time and place to meet, that HE wanted, then after im there he decides to change his mind and go pull his pud somewhere else. <br>
<br>
Im summary, Kookee/Drus, moron of the new millenium.  Deal with this 5 year old with your own discretion.<br>

Most Jewelers out here are just making stuff for there guilds or close friends. <br>
<br>
My suggestion to you is to go to Temple of Sol and buy a fire opal and either a platinum bar or Velium bar (Thurgadin) and take it to either North Free Port jem shop or the Jem shop in Thurgadin.<br>
<br>
Flaming someone who has 230  Jewelry Craft Skill and can enchant Velium bars and make  6 ac,  65 hit point rings on a public board is not going to get you a good Jewelry deal. )<br>

I get a tell from Daytona, I say be at Nexus when the spires go up so I can sell them to you. She/he missed the port up and I couldnt wait there so I told Daytona to not come because I have to join a group somewhere. Next thing I get is a tell after tell of namecallings from Daytona's sidekick friends and later Daytona, just ranting and spewing obsenities. All I could do is to put them all on ignore. Funny thing is, Daytona still insisted to trade after all that verbal abuse. <br>
Amusing, but no thanks, don't want to deal with immature people.<br>

Most people don't want to pay the price needed for them because they think it cost too much.  Well for a never trivial 262pp + 52pp 5gp attempt I think I am going to have to charge you more than 300pp a ring even though your good friend out there will sell them to you for 250pp<br>

<br>
If the person got to Nexus in 10 minutes (notice I said if here) then they COULD NOT have missed the &quot;next&quot; nexus port.<br>
<br>
Also a minor point....... There is no shout or announcement that people have been Teleported TO Nexus. And seldom do the portals from and to Norrath have much in common or can you judge by them when the opposite effect will occur.   MY point?   How do you know someone missed a portal ride? Friends coming up?<br>
<br>
On to the comment about not reporting personal experience with a craftsman......  Well I would agree that if you still want an item from a specific Craftsman, dont bad mouth them in a public forum.  I will not, can not, agree with the simple statement that because they are a very talented craftsman NEVER report any precieved problems with them. The rest of us can judge the worthwhileness of such testemonials and complaints on our own. The lack of them because someone thinks the mere fact someone chose a craft skill prevents info on that character doesnt help (did that make ANY sense?)<br>
<br>
And excuse me, but telling someone to come to Umbral planes to buy Jewelry? Come on that is a death sentence, The creatures near the entrance have a HUGE agro range and spawn (or used to anyway) back fairly routinely.<br>
<br>
Just tell someone NO, dont tell them to come to some death Trap. Unless of course the purpose of such a tell is to be snide with your no, but that can get people killed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/17/02 9:28:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=379.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kookee/Drus, What a moron</span><hr size=1> Twotribes I might be wrong but I think this post was put up because of things in the Market Square where someone was trying to buy these rings.

So what you're saying is that because someone can provide an uncommon service that entitles them to behave like a jerk? <p><b>Tresjoli Louveteau<b>

I'm just say flaming someone who does provide this rare service because you perceive them to be a moron on a public board will not help you get what you want.<br>
<br>
Like I also said I will not comment on the details.  If the person in question paid money for something and is getting ripped off,  I could see why you would be mad.  If your just mad because A jeweler is not willing to walk to you and give you that nice little trinket you desire, then I think your your reason is lame.<br>

<br>
I know whats its like to be pestered for a service. I used to play a cleric and getting rezz requests was really starting to annoy me.<br>
<br>
If you want something from someone you have to remember that they are giving up THEIR time to accomodate you. Even if its for a trade of goods or services. If you want something from someone I would really suggest you try to make it as easy as possible for them and if you agree on a place or time, be there on time. I know this is just a game, but if someone showed up for an interview with me 10 minutes late they got major, major strikes against them. If this jeweller had other folks waiting for him, why should he make them wait an extra 10 minutes for you? Are those people less important than you? It would be arrogance to think so.<br>
<br>
Now I don't know what got said to who or who said what after the fact, but if you're bitching about this person not waiting around to provide a service for you, and you admit you were 10 minutes late, well.. you're not getting much sympathy from me. Even if the jeweller was a complete ass.<br>
<br>
Now I have had bad experiences with jewellers on this server, but believe me there is no monopoly on folks with the JC skill. I know 5 people (3 out of FF) with JC of 200 or higher and one of them is a mule character, not even a main. If you want something from someone do what I did. Post on the market place board. Agree on a time and place, then BE there. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>
