STORY #1:  A CASE OF QEYNOS VENGEANCE<br>
<br>
&quot;The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die<br>
nobly for a cause, whereas the mark of the mature man<br>
is that he wants to live humbly for one.&quot;  --W. Stekel<br>
<br>
How could I, Rhaxalygen, live humbly for vengeance? <br>
<br>
I had joined up with the League of Antonican Bards to<br>
disguise my real purpose for living in Qeynos--staying<br>
there long enough to kill Grennet Stormhand, a Knight<br>
of Thunder. I had a very dark score to settle with him. <br>
<br>
Normally, I would leave the Paladins of Karana alone, <br>
but this one, unfortunately, had killed my own brother, <br>
Sirrius Schwarzek. &quot;Black&quot; was the first part of our<br>
surname, blackness like the sky at midnight, and &quot;zek&quot;, <br>
of course, referred to Rallos Zek, the Warlord that our<br>
entire family had fearlessly served.  Black War! That<br>
was us. Our purpose was to give our lives in combat.    <br>
<br>
Our battle deeds were viewed as noble, except by one Grennet Stormhand. He held a grudge against us for our one flaw, the one mistake we had all made, when we charged into Blackburrow and ended up killing dozens<br>
of hapless and innocent adventurers by mistake.   <br>
<br>
It wasn't our fault, though!  The gnolls swarmed on them!<br>
<br>
Sirrius was the leader of our hunting party, the ill-fated<br>
&quot;Blackburrow Butchers&quot;, as we were then called.  This was not an ignoble name.  Rather, it was an honor, for <br>
the Sabertooths of Blackburrow, who worshipped our<br>
enemy, the Plague Lord, were Qeynos' biggest foes. <br>
<br>
So, here we are: Sirrius, my brother, and I, and our<br>
father, the Champion, Vallon Schwarzek, storming <br>
into the caves of the Gnolls without a second thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN!&quot; we heard some people scream. <br>
<br>
Instantly, a swarm of gnolls came thundering down upon the adventurers in the cave, stinking up the air with their putrid breath and ever-present piles of dung!  Sirrius, it<br>
seemed, had stirred up a whole nest of these beasts<br>
through his presence, and so Grennet Stormhand, <br>
when he heard of the news, blamed my brother for the<br>
untimely deaths of several bystanders, including four<br>
Thunder Knights in training.  Grennet was very angry!<br>
<br>
Thus, it came to pass that he slew my brother for his recklessness.  I, since I had not been the leader that day, was not punished, but the Knights of Thunder let<br>
me know it would only be a matter of time before the<br>
hot arrogance of my brother seeped its way into me! <br>
<br>
Too late.  It already has. <br>
<br>
So, I seek vengeance for the death of Sirrius Schwarzek,<br>
and as for me, I serve War, and no other futile cause! <br>
<br>
Yours, <br>
Rhaxalygen Schwarzek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sweetumsofakanon>Sweetums of Ak Anon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/5/03 12:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.leagueofshadows.net/sigs/Sweetums1.gif width=90 height=90></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Three Stories--YOU PICK my next Avatar!!!</span><hr size=1> Sorrys tas interrupts, but mes gots tas votes for da gnomes.

<br>
Bellatrix kissed the diseased blade of her Scourge<br>
Knight Saber, once, near its razor-sharp point. <br>
She knew what such a sword had cost her--her<br>
good standing with the citizens of Qeynos, the <br>
respect of noble Paladins and Clerics, and,<br>
most of all, her neutral faction with all Norrath. <br>
<br>
Everyone had loved her when she was seriously ill.<br>
Now, thanks to Bertoxxulous, she was well, yet<br>
almost all of Qeynos spurned her company. <br>
<br>
She had been blessed with Erythrosepsis, a<br>
plague of terminally diseased blood, which had<br>
caused weakness, bouts of unconsciousness,<br>
and the most terrible side effect of near-deadly fever. <br>
Back when she was a good and humble citizen of<br>
Qeynos, preparing to enter the maidservant's trade,<br>
Bellatrix had thought she had been utterly cursed. <br>
<br>
Now she knew better. Bertoxxulous had given<br>
her disease in order to teach her to appreciate<br>
health--the health that only he, the Plague Lord,<br>
was prepared to bestow upon young Bellatrix. <br>
<br>
For a price. Bellatrix ventured boldly into the sewers. <br>
<br>
She declared, &quot;I have gone to Nife. I have knelt before<br>
his highest priestesses, Jahnda and the paladin Suuspa Clanim, and all they could give me was an admonition to remain meek and modest, for the gods had willed my plagued blood. Similarly, I have gone to all the Knights<br>
of Thunder, together with Karana's Clerics,  and they, too, said that Karana had destined my blood to remain<br>
impure, so that I would learn the value of healing arts.<br>
<br>
None of them would relieve me. Will you, Bloodsabres?&quot;<br>
<br>
They nodded. Every one of them was prepared to accept this young maidservant-in-training as a servant of their<br>
own, sentimental platitudes and admonitions be cursed!<br>
<br>
&quot;We hear you, Bellatrix,&quot; said Nomaria Doseniar, high<br>
female Cleric of Bertoxxulous, &quot;and we'll answer your<br>
tortured cries. Your disease is a blessing of the Plague<br>
Lord, Norrath praise him, and this means that if you <br>
surrender to the shadows that have haunted and chased you for your entire life, you shall be well and strong!&quot; <br>
<br>
Bellatrix nodded. It was her last chance, so it seemed. <br>
Her heart, too, had always had a trembling side that yearned to embrace the Plaguebringer and all his ways. <br>
&quot;If disease comes directly from Bertoxxulous,&quot; she had<br>
thought deep in her secret heart, when all of Norrath was<br>
asleep, &quot;then perhaps he will liberate me from my Erythrosepsis if I will but serve him.&quot; Thus she did...<br>
<br>
...and all of Qeynos wished her exile or death itself! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 7:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Story #3</span><hr size=1> STORY #3: A TEENY PALADIN<br>
<br>
Zatatine was a hot-blooded Gnome, with a heart<br>
a thousand times stouter than Brell's Blessed Ale,<br>
yet no one would take her seriously when she told<br>
them she was a Paladin. A holy knight--so small?!<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I am a holy knight,&quot; she would declare, <br>
holding her platinum-blonde head high, her voice<br>
sounding exactly like Brittany from &quot;Alvin and the<br>
Chipmunks&quot;, &quot;and I can heal you right now!&quot; <br>
<br>
She did heal, as best as she could, though her<br>
natural Wisdom was exceedingly low. Lay on Hands<br>
was her bread and butter, and mana be darned, Zata<br>
did her absolute darndest to make sure all the kobolds<br>
in Steamfont met her small, sneaky, slashing sword!<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready for anything!&quot;, she'd declare to all Norrath.<br>
<br>
Anything, of course, except an unexpected kidnapping!<br>
<br>
She'd been shanghai'ed by [name of guild], and she served [name of guild] until her final days, even though<br>
[name of guild]'s opinion of Brell Serilis was decidedly<br>
low. Seeing no way of escape for her small self, Zata<br>
decided that humility and serving her captors with <br>
kindness were more in tune with the ideals of the<br>
Duke of Below than was killing them for the Underfoot.<br>
<br>
Plus, they gave her lots and lots and lots of protection.<br>
<br>
Small paladins needed big guardians! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elyta@firionavie>Elyta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>Illusions of a Storm<b></span><br>  Posts: 408<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/14/03 9:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Story #3</span><hr size=1> hmm... story 3....<br>
