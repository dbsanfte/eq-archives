We have discussed the population of this server and its wierd economy several times.  I will not beat the dead horse.<br>
<br>
What I am going to rant about is related to my first rant on manners.<br>
<br>
If I am selling a good say a Chared Guardian Shield for 400p and you ask the price and that is what I give, I dont mind if you say the following...<br>
<br>
1  I dont have that much right now.<br>
2  That was more than I was looking to spend<br>
3  wow that is expensive<br>
4  I have never paid that much for one<br>
<br>
or something similar<br>
<br>
What I dont want to hear....especially if I have to travel a long distance to bring it to you is the following...<br>
<br>
1  Why are you charging so much for it?  Its not worth that much.<br>
2  I never paid that much on my old server<br>
3  What a rip off<br>
4  Im not paying your over inflated prices<br>
<br>
That is just RUDE.  If you dont want it fine.  But dont insult me.  Dont insult my intelligence.  Dont make little of the amount of time i spent trying to get this item.  And most of all dont waste my damn time travelling all over the place to bring you something if you were never gonna buy it in the first place!!<br>
<br>
So my advice to all you would be buyers, if you ever want to buy something from me in the future or from any of the other very nice and non-tolerant sellers out there, is show some damn respect for people.  Your better off on this small server being nice to people, even when what they are selling seems a little more expensive than usual, than being a jerk and ending up alone here. <br>
<br>
Nuff saidd.<br>

to be honest i think that is a fair price, even cheaper than what i would suggest.<br>
considering you have to kill &quot;good&quot; creatures to attain it, and a &quot;good&quot; person would not want to for RP reasons, it would only make sense that they would have to pay higher for it.<br>

<br>
My character states his price and sticks to it.  That's because he sets fair prices, and most of what he sells are crafted goods anyway so he knows right off what he can sell it for reasonably.  If anyone tries to bargin down his fair prices, he explains exactly what he is doing and why and almost everyone understands.  That's why he has a reputation as a fair and reasonable jeweler.<br>
<br>
The only person who ever objected in any way to this practice stated it was natural to try and &quot;jew someone down.&quot;  That person is on permenent ignore, one of only two names I've ever put there.  I hope that wasn't you, Ebine, because I didn't see a name attatched to your post.<br>
<br>
For Tunare's sake (and all the other gods) don't tell people what is and isn't appropriate to role-play.  If any people do it in the real world (and lots of people in the real world set firm prices and stick to them) then chances are it's entirely appropriate to role-play someone with the same personality in Norrath.  The only exceptions being things that people do in the real world that suck and would make Norrath less enjoyable for everyone.  But I don't think firm pricing falls into that catagory.<br>

I was just informing you that some people may try and chew you down for a roleplaying purpose. On the other hand if you say no and they start giving you tells as you posted that is harassment to me not roleplaying.  <br>

Norrath is not Carmax.  There is no set price tag (until the bazaar comes on-line anyway), and people will often tell you that you are totally daft for charging X and then offer Y.  If you get offended every time someone takes an issue with your prices, you may find yourself talking yourself out of a 350pp sale.<br>

<br>
This post isnt here to tell people exactly how they should roleplay or that a CGS is worth 350 or 400....believe me 400 is a fair price for the wait and the faction hits for goods.<br>
<br>
Its here to say stop being blatently rude to people who are selling.  They are taking time away from levelling, hunting and other things to not only make money for themselves but provide stimulus to the FV economy and much wanted goods to players.  <br>
<br>
If you think selling is easy then you are kidding yourself.  Its a bugger.  You get 50 tells and sell two things.  You get mostly nice people and the occassional jerk.  I could do without the jerks.  Its hard enough as it is.  I make more pp off of killing things and selling to the vendor than I ever do off of selling Straw spun belts, tizmak tunics, split hide gloves etc etc.  But ill stand and wait for 30 minutes for people and travel to them for 30 minutes etc etc because I like to help them out, get them some level appropriate gear.<br>
<br>
Does anyone not see the generous aspect of this???  What time is worth.  I mean i could just sell 90% of what I loot to the vender but I enjoy the interaction with the 98% of people who want to buy lesser items.  I just wish (probably unrealistically) that the jerks would dissappear.<br>

I can see that you (like myself) do not enjoy the economic aspect of the game as much as some others do.<br>
<br>
Like yourself, I would much rather be fighting than selling, and when I do sell, I want to get a price that I feel is commiserate with the time and effort I put into getting the item.  I want the other guy to feel that he has gotten a good deal and to be equally pleased with the transaction.<br>
<br>
Sadly, Norrath is much like &quot;real life&quot; in that the items vary with the seller.  You may have taken a bad faction hit and had to wait around for hours to get the CGS, while some Dark Elf necro may have waltzed in and gotten it on the first try, surprised and amused that the gnomes could like him less than they already did.<br>
<br>
There are guys out there that adore the economic game-within-a-game that EQ provides.  I know a guy that spent three weeks gleefully turning a Langsaxe into a FBSS.  He stood around in the auction zone, bought low and sold high in the best capitalistic tradition, and loved every minute of it.  Guys like him have no intention of paying what an item is worth - they are looking for people who are clearing out their banks or who are in desperate need of cash.  He is very willing to buy your item, but not for what you think it is worth.<br>
<br>
Moreover, a buyer at the appropriate level will rarely be pleased with the retail value.  I, an 18th level cleric, would LOVE to get my hands on a CGS... but I don't have 400.  If I did have 400, I probably would not want to part with all of it just to get one item.  If I had more than 400, I'm probably high enough to go and kill the silly clockwork myself.<br>
<br>
But I'm not trying to convince you that you didn't run into a jerk.  Anyone who comes out and barks in your face that you are trying to rip them off is a jerk, no question about it.  On the other hand, someone who is trying to talk you down may say something like &quot;that's too expensive, you'll never sell it for that much,&quot; and not mean it as a reproach.  Remember that &quot;chat&quot; does not convey feelings too well.<br>
<br>
Personally, I hate selling stuff so much that I will actually turn down halfway valuable items that I can't use simply because I don't want to have to go through the annoyance of /auction.  I am hoping that the Bazaar will be the salvation that people like you and I are craving - a zone where you can just set up shop, go AFK for a few hours and come back to find that much of your unwanted crap has been mysteriously replaced with platinum.<br>

The other day I had an item that had been sitting in my bank for a while and had asked multiple times of the guild if anyone needed or wated it.  Deciding no one did and that it would be easy enuff to get something better if someone needed I went to G-fay and auctioned a Flowing Black Robe for 20pp.  It was sold withing 2 seconds of my hitting enter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

To add to his rant, I saw a weapon for sale that I got in a trade for an item worth 500 tops here and then I sold it for 99 plats to a friend, yet the person was asking ~1000 plats, I felt very much like posting something to say like wtf, are you totally insane, but I refrained. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukan1301.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kan1301</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/02 5:58:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=197.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: My second rant</span><hr size=1> This is nothing compare to &quot; Give me an offer&quot;.

 You are not an homest person to me if you are hiding your price.

Someone bought some jewelry from me, and I happened to have a Spear of Foresight which, as an enchanter, I had no need of. It's a nice weapon, 9/29, 5 wis, 10 mana, 2 to all resists, primary or ranged, rogue or shaman. Perfect for a shaman, really. I told him to offer me what he could afford, he gave me 29 pp I think, and that was fine.<br>
<br>
So, if I say make me an offer, I know *I* am not trying to rip anyone off. Assuming that that phrase means the person is trying to rip you off could very well end up making you lose out on a very nice item at a generous price. So, make those assumptions if you wish, up to you, but it's certainly not always a valid assumption, that 'make an offer' means ripoff.<br>
