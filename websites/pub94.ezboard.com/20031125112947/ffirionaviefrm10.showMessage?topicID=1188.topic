Please note that he is in no way related to Necropolis, the RP city created by Shintou, et al.  He is a member of a Terris Thule cult that operates a necropolis near the desert shores of Ro.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This may be kind of graphic at points</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ))<br>
<br>
<br>
The warm light spilled out of the thick leaded windows, stenciling a warped orange pattern on the cobbled streets of Neriak.  From his vantage point across the alley, he was able to observe his quarry undetected; the brightly lit interior intensified the already gloomy shadows, making it almost impossible to see the darkly clad stranger casing the mansion. <br>
<br>
He had spent several weeks tailing his target, learning his behavior and cataloging his habits, exposing his fatal weaknesses.  He was patient; he had all the time in the world.  He found this fop’s arrogant self-assurance amusing, though nothing so much as a grin ever crossed his face.  To him, this was a grim business.  There was no place for levity in his profession.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> His father had told him his name once, as a child, as soon as he was able to understand its power.  His father inked the name on a piece of leathery parchment, showed it to the boy and had him commit it to memory.<br>
<br>
“Your name,” he explained to the wide-eyed child, “is the source of great power.  Protect it.  Never reveal it to anyone, ever, for the demons are hungry for your spirit.  If they know your name, the sap your soul.  Learn it now, and never again speak it to anyone.”<br>
<br>
Obedient as always, the boy stared at the henna etchings on the hide, letting the letters burn themselves into his memory before – at his father’s urging – swallowed the scrap to hide his name inside himself forever.  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He knew the target’s name: Kandalor D’rova, a dealer in arcane antiquities who serviced the social elite of Neriak.  In addition to the usual trade in totems, amulets, and curios D’rova also peddled older, darker artifacts that were obtained illegally.  His customers paid a premium for these rare items, as their sinister origins added great prestige – a vital commodity in a vain society built on competing houses jockeying for social position.<br>
<br>
D’rova maintained a small army of personal guards, henchmen, and advisors – more as a symbol of his wealth than out of any real necessity.  His success in the black market and his creature comforts had made him greedy for more, as the former shopkeeper had clawed his way to the inner circle of Neriak’s elite.  His humble past was a closely guarded secret, a stigma that was a sure path to social ruin, and D’rova was ruthless in acquiring more wealth in an attempt to shore up his claim to fame.<br>
<br>
His avarice had led him to make one mistake, however; a mistake that tonight would ultimately prove fatal.  D’rova had broken the taboo.  He had stolen from the stranger’s people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Since he was old enough to stand, the boy had been trained.  His family had long served the city, and the tradition would continue with him.  His days were long and arduous, from sun up to sunset, as he was molded to fit the position he would assume when he reached manhood.<br>
<br>
From his father, he learned the paths and ways of the Otherworld, from the passage of the soul beyond to the proper charms and wardings to protect oneself from the wrath of ghosts and demons.  He learned how to prepare and dress the corpse for its final journey, and he grew familiar with the many rites and rituals that his people used.<br>
<br>
He was trained in the ways of death as well, learning countless ways to end a life and a thousand methods of bringing the subject back from the brink long enough to interrogate.  He was trained in knife, sword, and staff, practicing in the sun-baked sand until he grew numb from the effort.<br>
<br>
At night, he’d retire to his small room, poring over the ancient texts his father would assign to him, learning philosophy, science, and arcane mysteries until the candle guttered and he dropped into a deep sleep at his desk.<br>
<br>
One day, he approached his Master on the training ground, clad only in a loincloth and his sparring gloves.  Instead of the dueling knives however, his trainer held only a robe and a circlet of vicious thorny branches.  His preparation was done.  It was time for him to pass on. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The stranger watched D’rova through the panes of glass.  The feast had gone on for hours, and appeared now to be winding down.  D’rova was draping a fat, flabby arm around the shoulder of one of his shapely female guests, whispering excitedly into her ear his foul intentions.  She giggled and blushed, coyly playing along, but from his remote vantage point the assassin could see the look of frightened revulsion beneath her come-hither mask; the shuddering disgust at the greasy purple lips that hovered so close to her cheek.<br>
<br>
She would sell herself to him this night, he was sure of that.  Despite her instinct to run, despite her obvious loathing of this revolting creature, she would bed him in a bid to improve her standing among the vacuous idle nobility of the city.  She would lie still and make all the right noises as he pawed grotesquely at her with his greasy fingers, his blemished face twisted into a rictus mask of fear, hatred, and lust.  She would sell herself to this beast for the price of a fantasy.<br>
<br>
The stranger sneered at the depravity of it all.  This city was soft.  The nobility so debauched and decadent that they never even realized how ludicrous they’d become.  Their false airs and pathetic social politicking did nothing more than refresh the façade of success while their grand Houses slid into a slow, irreversible rot.  <br>
<br>
D’rova dragged the lithe beauty to her feet, leading her up the curving staircase near the back of the room while the party guests gorged themselves on the rich feast in front of them.  Several of the attendees made surreptitious note of D’rova’s departure, no doubt cataloging the event in the hopes that they could play the card in the future to advance their own position.<br>
<br>
The assassin waited a moment, then slid out of the alley as silent as a ghost.  He walked down the streets until he was sure he was not being observed before doubling back down a rubbish-strewn alley.  Flitting from shadow to shadow, he worked his way to the cellar door of D’rova’s mansion.<br>
<br>
It was time to work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The preparation chambers were cold, much colder than he remembered.  He had been in these rooms a thousand times during the lessons with his father, but they seemed strange and alien to him this time.  The shadowy corners, thrown into sharp contrast by the whale oil lanterns, seemed to house an army of malevolent spirits, peering excitedly at his vulnerable form.  The giant, looming statues of the gods glared down at him from on high; red, angry eyes staring out of the heads of jackals and hawks.<br>
<br>
He knelt inside the painted circle, a small wooden bowl placed carefully on a copper tray in front of him.  At his father’s signal, he lifted the simple vessel and quaffed the thick, foul tasting concoction within.  <br>
<br>
Almost immediately, his head began to swim.  His throat constricted and his breathing became quick and shallow.  The shadows of the room seemed to reach out towards him, inky black fingers seeking out his warmth.  He felt the strength seep from him, flowing from his fingers and toes and running like rivers of black mercury to feed the hungry shadows.  Darkness crept in from the corners of his vision.  With a final lurch, all went black.<br>
<br>
When he awoke, he had been stretched out on the ancient limestone altar in the center of the chamber.  Stripped naked, he could feel the chill stone beneath him and the distant warmth of the smoky, oily lanterns.  He felt disconnected from his own body, yet he was more aware of every inch of skin that he had ever been.  Every sensation had been heightened beyond normal endurance, but yet he remained an impartial observer.  He could not move, could not speak, could not will his body to rouse itself from the altar and head to the safety of the city.<br>
<br>
The crown of thorns stabbed cruelly into his shaved head, lancets of pain arcing through his body as every breath forced them deeper into his skin.  The chilling cold of the slab burned with an unbearable intensity, setting his hair on end and making his skin crawl unnaturally.<br>
<br>
Saryn’s Kiss, he realized, recognizing the textbook effects of the poison, an effective aid to interrogation and torture.  The mind was removed from the body, preventing the subject from passing out from the unbelievable pain to follow, for the proper application of the poison heightened the five senses beyond reason.  The Kiss’ hallucinogenic properties heightened the brain’s activity, keeping the subject’s mind flooded in a massive sensory overload while preventing him from taking the easy way out.<br>
<br>
His father entered the room, dressed in his ceremonial robes and wielding a long, curved knife.  From the shadows behind him trailed a tall, elegant woman shrouded in a smoky grey cowl.  He could not make out her face, but her dark piercing eyes burned with an intense excitement as she glided easily across the stone floor.<br>
<br>
The attendants began lighting incense in the censers, filling the room with a thick, heavy perfume.  The woman reached out slowly, dragging her cruel fingers against his flesh.  Rivers of agony followed in their wake, as the frigid cold of her hands burned against him.  His heart began to beat wildly in his chest.  She leaned in closer to him, the thick cowl hiding her features in inky black shadows.  He struggled to breathe, feeling his very life being drawn out of him and into the coal-black pits of her eyes – almond-shaped abysses that seemed to swallow any light in the room. <br>
<br>
Silently, she touched her ice-cold fingertips to his lips, leaving blisters on his face where they lay.  She retreated again into darkness as his father slowly advanced on him with the cruel glint of the sacrificial blade. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The revelry above masked his passing.  All of the guests were either half-blind with drink or else too occupied plotting against their neighbor to take notice of him passing through the servants’ corridors, swiftly and silently, and heading up the narrow service staircase.  He eased open the door to the storage room he had prepared before, slipped inside, and quietly closed and locked the door.  Moving to the back corner of the cluttered room, he climbed atop a barrel of rum to move aside a ceiling tile.  Hoisting himself into the hole in the roof, he replaced the tile, plunging the attic crawlspace into darkness.<br>
<br>
Pinpoints of light flared up with narrow javelins of light from below, tiny peepholes he had cautiously bored over the course of the past weeks.  With well-practiced steps, he picked his way across the jumbled maze of ceiling joists to the far corner of the attic.  The roof sloped to a sharp angle here, forcing him to crawl along like a spider, clinging precariously to the woodwork around him.<br>
<br>
He brought his eye to one of his peepholes, dimly lit from below by the ambient light of a streetlamp outside.  The room itself was dark, the window open to allow the stink of his lustful exertion to pollute the air of the city.<br>
<br>
Looking onto the bed below, he could see D’rova and his consort tangled in the twisted sheets, spent already.  Regret was already beginning to etch itself on the woman’s face – she realized that she had sold herself too cheaply, realized that the pig of a man would not give up power or wealth so easily.  Revulsion was clearly visible in her eyes, but she seemed determined to save face, to continue this obscene farce in order to save some shred of dignity in the eyes of the people downstairs.  D’rova seemed to take delight in her discomfort, staring at the ceiling with half-closed eyes, leisurely stroking his chest while taking long drags on his opium pipe.<br>
<br>
The assassin was pleased.  Smoking the pipe was one of D’rova’s hidden vices.  He had correctly identified it as a potential way to get to his target, and it seemed his intuition had paid off.  Two nights before, he had dared to enter the room below to lace the stem of the pipe with a powerful poison, not altogether dissimilar from Saryn’s Kiss.  In a few moments, both whore and pig would be locked in a living nightmare.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The knife entered his body, just below the sternum, sending a lightning bolt of pure, unadulterated agony through his body.  He watched as the attendants rushed forward to hold down his arms and legs, as he began to thrash with the pain.  The effects of the drug amplified every noise, every contact, and every smell… the stink of their sweat and of his fear and blood drove him into a frenzy, while their firm, calloused hands threatened to crush his bones in their vice-like grips.<br>
<br>
With the sound of tearing canvas, the blade dragged down the length of his abdomen, and he watched with horror as his own innards burst forth from the wound as if they were trying to escape.  The woman, watching the procedure with intense interest, was rubbing her hands in anticipation.<br>
<br>
He tried to scream, but he couldn’t open his mouth.  Eyes wide with fear and shock, he pressed his tongue forward, feeling the coarse hemp thread that had sewn his mouth closed.  <br>
<br>
Deep in his gut, he felt the curved shears of his father’s trade snipping away at him, casually removing his organs as if from a corpse.  Only he was not dead, and he did not die.  The pain and agony was overwhelming, yet the drug kept him alert.  Death and unconsciousness were escapes forbidden by this darkest of rituals.  He would live through this, he was sure of that, or at least what was left of him would.<br>
<br>
Panting, heaving, he watched in terror as his life essence was lifted from his body in bloody clumps.  His father placed the organs in small stone jars arrayed on the side table, white limestone urns with jade inlays.  The cold air of the chambers flooded into his open wounds, stealing his warmth and filling him with a chill dread that made his bones ache.<br>
<br>
After an eternity, his father stopped.  Dipping his hands in a shallow bowl of water, his father surveyed his handiwork while the young man lay hollowed out on the slab, panting desperately to fill lungs that no longer existed.  His head swam, the loss of blood causing him to lose focus, the terrible acuity of the procedure’s pain receding into a dull, throbbing ache that caused his ears to pound and his jaw to grind behind his bound lips.<br>
<br>
“Sew him up,” his father said, “and seal him in the sarcophagus.  He must now dream.”<br>
<br>
Hurriedly, the aides worked to stitch together his wound, the skin and muscle sagging sickeningly into the hollow void of his empty abdomen.  His father left the room, accepting the somber congratulations from the attendants.  The procedure had been a success, and now his only son was going to be an offering to their Great Mistress.<br>
<br>
They transferred him from the slab to a narrow canvas stretcher.  Moving silently and with great skill, they carried him out of the preparation chamber and into the canal room next door, where a long curved boat sat waiting in the narrow channel.  Two attendants loaded him into the boat and prepared to embark.<br>
<br>
Unable to move his head, he lay staring at the high, dark ceiling inlaid with pearls to reflect the night sky over the necropolis.  The canal was narrow and shallow, filled with the flowing seawater that encircled their ancient city.  Dark red sandstone, untouched by the blistering sun, reflected the greasy light cast down by the oil lanterns, revealing the deep black mouth of the tunnel on the far side of the room.  Through there the canal ran, where the dead would be taken to their final resting place, taken to their eternal slumber, and delivered into the waiting arms of Terris Thule.<br>
<br>
The woman in grey crossed the chamber and boarded the narrow ship, seemingly floating over the ground as her dark, ethereal dress reached the very floor.  She sat on a small stool by his head, and touched a gentle finger to his lips.<br>
<br>
“Sleep,” she said quietly, her voice a mere whisper across his fevered brain.  “Sleep, my son, and dream.” </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
D’rova and his woman were awake, he knew that.  But he also knew that the terror scenes that they were seeing were twisted caricatures of reality, tempered by their deepest and darkest fears.  Their own minds were dredging up years of fear and loathing and hate and repressed emotion and weaving them all into macabre mindplays that they were helpless to escape.<br>
<br>
He regretted having to entrap the woman in such matters as these, but it could not be helped.  He was to eliminate the target, and any who got in the way.  She was an unfortunate obstacle… she would live, but the lingering effects of the poison, combined with what she was about to see, would likely shatter her rational mind.  She came to his bed in an attempt to gain notoriety, he mused, but she would leave in infamy.<br>
<br>
He moved a ceiling tile aside and dropped to the ground silently.  Wrapped in their own nightmares, the D’rova and the woman hardly reacted, merely flinching and cowering as he was assimilated into their visions.  He quickly checked the door to make sure it was bolted from the inside before pulling a small vial of a foul green liquid from his belt.  He ripped off the cap of the vial, exposing a short hooked needle at the end.<br>
<br>
Jabbing the vicious needle violently into D’rova’s neck prompted an immediate reaction.  He gasped loudly, reaching his around his throat and arching his back as his body was wracked with agonizing pain.  The woman curled up into a tight fetal ball, attempting to hide from the horrible visions the drug had wrenched out of her dark subconscious.  But there was no such escape for D’rova, as the stranger grasped his jaw roughly and twisted his face to his own.  Eyes open wide, whites showing all around, D’rova was looking into the assassin’s expressionless face.<br>
<br>
“Kandalor D’rova,” he said quietly, lowering his face to D’rova’s, “you are going to die tonight.  You – and others in your employ – have desecrated the tombs of my people.”<br>
<br>
The Tier’Dal on the bed began to bleat in protest, but the assassin squeezed his jaw tightly.  Reaching back into his pack, he withdrew a small stone vase, artfully engraved with jade and gemstones.<br>
<br>
“You sold this, as well as other funerary goods, to individuals in Neriak, Paineel, Freeport, and Highkeep.  I’ve tracked most of them down Kandalor D’rova, and they all came from your organization.  Your greed has deprived my people of their eternal dreams.  And for that, you will die.”<br>
<br>
The girl whimpered, having slid off the bed and huddled in the corner.  D’rova simply paled.  It was inevitable.<br>
<br>
He pulled the long, curved knife from his scabbard slowly.  Ritual requires precision and attention to detail.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He had no idea how long he was sealed in the tomb.  It could have been months, it could have been days.  It could have been an eternity.  Time had no meaning to him.  Endless moments stretched out into infinity as his life played out in front of him in an eternal puppet show of twisted scenery and misshapen freaks as the actors.  His mind opened itself, and a lifetime of forgotten horrors spilled into the empty space of the sarcophagus; frozen in time like bugs in amber.<br>
<br>
The stone lid of the sarcophagus slid aside, and the sudden light of the lanterns blinded him.  Standing at the coffin edge was his Great Mistress, Terris Thule.  Draped in a dark grey shawl, she appraised him as he lay before her, her empty eyes measuring his worth.  Her featureless face belied no emotion.<br>
<br>
She extended one hand down to him, a gentle hand to lift him out of his early tomb.  He stood in the middle of the room, empty and naked, shivering in the subterranean gloom.  She stood behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist and running her fingers along the long, angry welt of his ravaged abdomen.<br>
<br>
Laying her chin against his shoulder, she explored his sutures with searching hands, plunging her fingers into the empty cavity.<br>
<br>
“You are mine now,” she said, a soft voice inside his head, “trapped between life and death.  You will never know either again, my dear.  You are doomed forever to walk in the mists of eternal dreams, forever hungering for the warmth of the life that was sacrificed to me.  Forever longing for the sweet embrace of a final death.  <br>
<br>
You are now Sohkar.  As thousands have been before you, now you are.  You are no longer bound to the living, nor are you entombed as the dead.”<br>
<br>
She chuckled, a sound that sent a shiver up his spine.  “Go forth, Sohkar, and be my Champion.  Walk the shadows and bring dread to those that hear your name.  Forever you will seek to slake the thirst inside you; forever you will seek to fill the void inside your body.  Go forth and bring to your foes eternal nightmare.” </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The early morning patrol responded to the call.  Kandalor D’rova, a wealthy and well-known art dealer, had last been seen going to his private chambers with a young female from one of the minor houses.  D’rova had not responded to his servants the next morning, though the woman could be heard crying inside.  The door, bolted on the inside, had to be knocked down with a battering ram.<br>
<br>
The carnage inside was beyond description.  The woman, in hysterics, could only point to the tangled mess that was D’rova, ripped open from sternum to groin, with his entrails strewn about the room.  Amazingly, D’rova was still alive at the time, though any hope of recovery was out of the question.<br>
<br>
D’rova was put out of his misery by the captain of the guard.  The woman was put in the care of her parents, with the strong advice that she be surrendered into the care of the proprietress of the Maiden’s Fancy, where at least she could be put to some use.<br>
<br>
There remain no clues as to the identity of the killer, or any signs of a motive.<br>

Lances of white-hot pain streaking from his ruined abdomen as countless eager fingers tear back the stitches, exposing the black emptiness, the bottomless nightmare pit within.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sohkar sat bolt upright in bed, gasping in sudden agony as another spasm of pain clutched him roughly.  His body doubled over, sweat-sodden sheets wrapping around him, clutching his limbs as he struggled to catch his breath through grinding teeth.  He fought against the grinding, blazing sensation in his gut, grabbing at an invisible wound to hold in phantom entrails.  Sweat poured off his face as small noises escaped from his clenched jaw.  The crippling pain slicing through him like a scythe through grain; he dug his fingers into his sheets, trying to expel the pain through sheer force of will.<br>
<br>
Another wave of agony sent him sprawling to the floor, dragging his linens and his thin mattress to the bare floorboards.  The demons inside him laughed at his suffering, clawing eagerly at his stomach with jagged talons.  Whimpering, fighting the urge to scream in pain, he dragged himself to the end table, desperate hands searching frantically for the cool, cruel comfort of his pipe.  His hands danced along the tabletop, knocking over the shrouded lantern, upending a small stone charm he used to ward off evil spirits, and sending his water glass crashing to the floor.<br>
<br>
As his clambering fingers finally closed around the short, clay pipe and the weather-beaten oilskin pouch, tears sprang to his eyes.  Agonizing bands of pain wracked his body with sudden, vengeful thrusts but he managed a tortured smile as he crawled haltingly to the corner with his precious implements.  Face screwed up in absolute, defiant concentration against the shuddering pain, Sohkar carefully crammed the aromatic weed into the small hollow at the top of the pipe.<br>
<br>
Fumbling with the flints, he finally managed to light the twisted leaves; a dull red glow shining from within the body of the pipe glaring balefully back at him through the darkened room.  Part of him fought in vain against the overwhelming urge to inhale, to quell the demons within in a wave of soothing forgetfulness; part of him screaming against the roaring winds that scoured his insides like a vicious sandstorm.<br>
<br>
But he could not resist.  The was pain too great, and salvation too near.<br>
<br>
The clay touched his lips and the pain subsided; thick grey smoke rushing into his chest to fill the hungry void in the pit of his stomach.  Sohkar leaned against the cool walls, feeling the weight of the smoky waves smother the pain; the paroxysms slowed as the agony was slowly pressed into a dull throbbing ache.  He began to shiver in the unnatural subterranean cool of Neriak, the sepulcher gloom creeping into his bones.<br>
<br>
He took another deep drag off of the pipe, willing the harsh smoke to warm the emptiness inside; one more hit and he surrendered himself to the gentle relief of the Sheppen.  Heavy lidded eyes watched with detached interest as the room lost focus in subtle passes, quietly blurring into a blue-green haze until….<br>
<br>
Oblivion.<br>

His neck and back were torturously stiff, complaining loudly every time he so much as shifted his weight in his chair, but the pain in stomach had retreated to a dull throbbing ache that he could easily ignore.  Harder to ignore, however, was the thin, anemic dirty water that passed for coffee in this accursed city.<br>
<br>
Never did he feel so alienated from the rest of his race than when he sat down to eat his morning meal. In Dayr al’Madinah, breakfast was limited to the thick, fragrant coffee, strips of dried, salted fish and perhaps a small handful of dates or dried apricots.  Here, however, the daily spread was incredibly lavish – eggs, bacon, toast, bowls of cereals and fruits, slabs of sausage meats, and anything else he could imagine.  Of course, he had to suffer through cup after cup of the tasteless dishwater they called coffee, but he considered it a small price to pay for such a bountiful feast every morning.<br>
<br>
They may hole themselves up in this dank self-imposed dungeon, and their society may be slowly rotting from the inside out with the self-indulgent games between noble houses, but the Teir’Dal of Neriak certainly knew how to start a day off right.<br>
<br>
Sohkar halfheartedly scanned the newssheet someone had left on the table, far more absorbed in the taste of his eggs than in the breathless reports of the shallow posturing of one noble house against another.  He did read, with some interest, that there had been a third murder in the city in the style he had used to dispatch D’Rova.  Sohkar didn’t know whether to be amused or horrified that some psychopathic assassin out there was glomming onto the ritual sacrifice of a tomb robber as some form of a personal calling card.<br>
<br>
Shoveling more eggs onto his fork with his third piece of buttered toast, he chuckled to himself when he thought of how the Ebon Mask would react when the copycat was finally caught.  Sohkar had taken great care to cover his tracks with the guildmasters here, knowing how sensitive they could be about foreign agents in their midst.  He was well aware that he was being followed now, which served his purposes well enough – he had an alibi that would distance himself from the unrest caused by this self-styled public menace.<br>
<br>
Tossing the dregs of his tasteless coffee into the pot of a nearby fern – much to the consternation of his landlady, who glared at him openly from behind the bar – he pushed himself away from his corner table and swept his cloak from the back of his chair.  He had a long day ahead of him, and now that his work was done it was time for him to head back to the desert and away from this dismal place.  <br>
<br>
He fastened the hooded cloak around his shoulders as he weaved through the tables that were scattered throughout the inn’s great room.  He ostensibly wore the heavy drape to protect him from the gloomy chill of the cavern-city, but he felt relief in the way the dark cowl allowed him a sense of anonymity in this nest of idle intrigue and curious plotters looking for any advantage they could use to climb their infernal social ladders.  And Sohkar – a rare visitor from the isolated Tier’Dal settlements in the Southern Desert of Ro – certainly drew more attention than he was comfortable with.  Gaunt and darkly-colored, even by Neriak standards, he stood out as an outsider even before one noticed his shaved head and the malachite he wore around his eyes.  At home, he’d be considered non-descript and hardly worth notice.  Here, he was an oddity; a curious object to be displayed at cocktail parties.<br>
<br>
He had played up his assumed role as a peddler of antiquities to get close enough to D’Rova to make good on his assignment.  He made a point of wearing the formal robes of the priests of the necropolis, as these tended to draw the attention of the vain and fashion-conscious fops he was forced to pump surreptitiously for information.  He wore the malachite, used to protect his people’s sensitive eyes from the harsh glare of the sun, even indoors.  Jewelry clattered noisily on his wrists and his outrageously thick accent sounded like a cruel parody to his ears.<br>
<br>
He felt like a right ass, and he was more than happy to be getting out of the city.  He wanted nothing more than to strip himself of these ridiculous trappings – to cease being a caricature among a throng of self-absorbed fools – and get back to Dayr al’Madinah, a small hamlet in the desert where everybody worked together for the good of the necropolis, an artisans’ village dedicated to the art and craft of the Eternal Sleep.<br>
<br>
The warmth of the great room vanished the second as he opened the door to the gloomy street, as the clinging mists of Neriak rolled over him like a great wave.  Grimacing at the sudden cold, Sohkar felt the pressing weight of the rock walls of the cavern and the creeping chill of the subterranean air.  Hissing a silent curse, he pulled the cloak tighter around him and made a beeline for the Blind Fish, where he was hoping to find notice of a caravan heading south.  To think that this unchanging gloom and damp cold permeated the city while outside it was breezy and sunny!  <br>
<br>
At least the Foreign Quarter was warm, he thought as he strode past the waterfall that filled the Commons with its blasted grey mist.  So what if it’s just the heat of forge fires and bitter resentment, he chuckled grimly, who cares if it has all the atmosphere of a troll’s armpit?<br>
<br>
There were only a scattered handful of people in the pub, but whether they were finishing off last night’s revelry or picking over the scant breakfast offerings Sohkar could not tell.  It was too early for most of the city to be up and about yet, and the few people who were awake bore every sign of wishing they weren’t.  <br>
<br>
Inwardly, he smiled.  Many of the cities famous nocturnal activities had been curtailed over the recent weeks, as authorities cracked down on the copycat killer that had been picking off wealthy merchants and traders.  HIS copycat, he noted with a flush of pride.  Though by what he could gleam from the reports, the imposter was clearly an amateur who attacked without any real planning, but he was doing a masterful job of avoiding both the city guards and the Ebon Mask.  The Mask was certainly the more dangerous of the two, he thought; there was nothing quite like a bunch of territorial professionals exacting vigilante justice.<br>
<br>
He paused in front of the message board, tapping his teeth with his thumbnail.  In retrospect, he was glad that he had gone to the Ebon Mask as soon as he had arrived in Neriak.  His absurd disguise and cover story of a traveling importer may have fooled the city’s upper crust, but he’d have been targeted very early by the suspicious and diligent agents of the Mask.  But he was here under their graces, and under their surveillance.  D’Rova was a sanctioned kill, though his … exuberance… in the method was met with some raised eyebrows at the end.<br>
<br>
Still, the copycat was creating a rock-solid alibi for him and for the Ebon Mask.  Now both parties could deny any culpability as the public outcry got louder.  In a city built on murder and treachery, it surprised Sohkar how quickly the nobles got antsy when a few of their own were being hunted by someone not playing by the inane rules of their lofty games.  But one or two high officials wake up with their entrails tacked to the ceiling, and the whole city shifts into mass paranoia.  He loved it.  He could only imagine the nightmares and shaking terrors these people had, cowering under their cover in their silken nightshirts, terrified that their creature comforts would come to naught when faced with the cold steel edge of mortality.<br>
<br>
But that was neither here nor there.  Not any more.  He was going to sign on to one of these outbound caravans and put this place behind him.  He was going to go back to the warm stone temples of the necropolis - Biban el-Muluk – and the comfortable houses of the artisans’ village.  He was finally leaving, and he was going back home.<br>
