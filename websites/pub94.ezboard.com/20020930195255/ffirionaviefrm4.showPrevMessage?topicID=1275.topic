<br>
What is it that causes a person to think that flaming another person will resolve anything? By insulting them publically, calling them childish names...what is this going to prove?<br>
<br>
Me? I see someone go on a flame-fest, and I think &quot;Child.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think immature child, to be honest. After all, a mature child would at least try to reason a LITTLE, even if they haven't developed the capability to hold a logical and fact-based argument.<br>
<br>
I also notice that those who flame tend not to read what others are saying, nor do they tend to accept that the others might have a point or two.<br>
<br>
They don't read what the person they're flaming said...they just dig into it.<br>
<br>
I've been called a &quot;bish&quot; which we know what he means...because of an idea I have which might be able to help others. Not once have I mentioned names in the posts, not once have I publically called him a &quot;jerk,&quot; &quot;ass,&quot; or any of the other names that truthfully belong to him in public. Privately...I've called him a jerk. To his face. That's not flaming. That's exploding at an utterly arrogant person who was making not just me, but several others who I also won't name unless they grant me permission, very angry.<br>
<br>
And only after trying to reason with him (which proved to be an impossible task, but that's not surprising, considering the guild he comes from.)<br>
<br>
Even now I won't name names. He'll probably do it for me anyhow.<br>
<br>
What I want to know is what makes him think that it would make him a &quot;better man?&quot; Why would anyone look up to someone who would intentionally pull out the flamethrowers with intent to slander and harm another?<br>
<br>
Is it just a bid for attention? <p><html>

Honestly, I can say this board is a kiddy pool compared most of the other servers. For example, you want a serious flame try zeb's &quot;Flame Forum&quot;. I've seen people make name for themselves via flaming or lose all their integrity. <br>
<br>
Most of the time flaming begins with a disagreement. Person X believes the community should know about their dealings with person(s) Y.  I'll have to disagree on some points. I have read some very articulates flames. <br>
<br>
For example, <br>
Hegan's recent post<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=1248.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...1248.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is a  very well written flame. You don't have to cuss and say childish words to flame. I refuse to say all flamers are a certain way because that leads to stereotyping... which leads to more flaming. <br>
<br>
Quite frankly, I am not at all too worried about flaming, people choose what to be angry about. If he/she wants to become upset and flame away that is their choice. The board admins will deal with the situation as they see fit. I do not believe that flaming has any direct effect on the game. People merely express opinions they have here that they have already established in game. <br>
<br>
I think we need to remember that Everquest is a game. We are many different people thrown into one server. I do not expect anyone to agree with me nor will I lead a campaign in character assassination. Nor do I think anyone should anyone get upset if they are called mean names. This is an ezboard not real life. If people do not like this kind of interaction, then why participate? It's called the &quot;Soap Box&quot;.....<br>
<br>
People have different ways of expressing views. Some I don't care for, but if one comes to this type of environment expect the unexpected. People do not share the same values in communication or opinions on subjects. Do not expect anyone to act or think like oneself, that is unrealistic.<br>
<br>
I have said my peace. <p>~Adalina~

<br>
All I know is I made a trade with one of your guildmates over a month ago and the couple of times I see him on, he is afk in bazaar.  I gave him items that a former guildmate of yours gave me before quitting.  They were mine to keep and sell.  I didn't want money since I wanted to stay away from twinking but I just didn't want to give it away.  So I trade a ghoulbane, adamtite epoplets, parts of the soulfire quest (first 2 parts I think), some armor pieces, 2hs, etc.  <br>
<br>
Inexchange, even though I was in my 10th season or so, all I asked for was the Summon Corpse spell.  Something I could get eventually but that was not hard cash.  Bartering!  Being from another server, I have been down there and know that it isn't that difficult once you invis by most of the gnolls.  When I was in my low/mid 50's with a 50 SK, we killed everything in the room so I know a group can handle it in their 40's.<br>
<br>
I am don't believe in giving anything away for free nor do I try and charge for something I didn't earn.  I thought it was a fair trade and your guildmate accepted.  I have posted on your guild board and have gotten a response from Aadmer who is most kind to say they are looking into it.  Also, I talked with Qualvin and he is aware of the deal and will look into it.  Most kind.  <br>
<br>
However, stupid or not, I put faith in fellow players and it was my initial test with players of this server.  For keeping these items that I later traded to your guildmate, I was asked by the retiring player to pass on a weapon, gauntlets and specific enchanter pages to your guild which I did prior to this trade taking place.  I kept my word.  Yes, Necromancers do keep their word.  I am far from using the spell still but that is beside the point.<br>
<br>
So, I don't think of this as a flame but waiting over a month with no response from your guildmate that made the deal makes me worry.  Again, a couple of your guildmates seem very reputable as does your guild from what I have heard.  I saw this thread and thought it was as good a forum as I will ever see to post.  <br>

<br>
It's when you all out blast a single person and call them a bunch of names without point out (with any form of evidence or specific cases) what they actually did wrong.<br>
<br>
When I insulted that guild it was based on (and I mentioned) two times they'd trained my guild, one time they KSd from my guild (all in one day)...as well as the fact that I wasn't surprised about the behavior with Fuvi. Not to mention the fact that people who would intentionally destroy the game for other people are accepted and admired within the guild, and the reputation sinks, from more than just me, in fact. The harsh criticism of the guild was based upon several incidents. Nor did I call any specific person by names...<br>
<br>
Because that's where I draw the line between &quot;Voicing grievances&quot; and &quot;Flaming.&quot; Flaming is all-out bombardment without style, in my opinion, of people...without having ANY actual basis for it, or rather, more than the slightest thing (which is usually proven wrong.)<br>
<br>
Now, I know 11 others who were victim and witness to what I insulted that guild for at the same time I was. And many others who said the same thing about the Fuvi episode.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a flame, by my question or standards, therefore...but an angry opinion and reaction to a wrong done.<br>
<br>
And I agree...some do &quot;flame&quot; without cusses. I consider that creative insulting, not flaming.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
FLAME: &quot;Boogaboo is an ass because he farts at me. Kill him!&quot; (Just a bunch of childish vulgarity and tries to get others to be childish as well)<br>
<br>
NOT FLAME: &quot;Boogaboo has a rectal disorder that seriously impedes any from focusing on anything but his buttocks, therefore, people may assume he is nothing but anus.&quot; (Comic stance which informs others of the bone of contention, but in a way that is almost humorous)<br>
<br>
NOT FLAME: &quot;While going through Freeport, Boogaboo farted at us, causing us to lose our balance and die. I tried to gain an apology from him, but instead he merely sneered. Suggestions?&quot; (Factual statement of their side of the story. Nothing else.)<br>
<br>
NOT FLAME: &quot;I agree, Boogaboo has some serious rectal problems, as he farted at my group as well. I avoid him now at all costs.&quot; (Agreement to another comment, without calling Boogaboo names is just voicing your opinion. To say &quot;I agree, Boogaboo is an ass&quot; would be a flame.)<br>
<br>
It's all in a matter of HOW you present your view...whether there's anything behind it.<br>
<br>
My argument with that specific guild is 100 percent based upon actual incidents and experiences I have had with them. If any doubts my incidents, I can give them specifics in a private e-mail. byteoart@attbi.com Any rude or inflammatory e-mails will be deleted mostly unread, any that expresses opinions opposite mine in a mature manner will be read and responded to with equal respect.<br>
<br>
Gamili, I thank you for your very respectful and intelligent response. You're right. I did generalize too much...but that was because I mistakenly made the assumption that others made the distinction between &quot;disagreement&quot; and &quot;flame&quot; that I did. Mine's a very fine line distinction, and I suppose not everyone shares the same one. Some might even say &quot;Any who voice opinions opposite mine are flaming me.&quot; Which I disagree with...Thank you for pointing out my mistake, there. I hope this previous post clarifies what I meant.<br>
<br>
Graves: I apologize deeply for your situation. I know the person who you respond to, and he's not been around often due to RL issues. I will see to it you get the spell as agreed to within the next two weeks. Just send me an e-mail so we can make arrangements. <p><html>

Not to hijack the thread, but Ledenyetz Troupe is a guild of craftsmen and traders, so our reputation is VERY important to us, especially in terms of honesty in commerce.<br>
<br>
I see from your post that Qualvin and Aadmer are looking into the issue, and I will follow up in the guildhall to see what is going on. But if you feel you (or anyone else) have been treated unfairly by a Trouper, please feel free to contact me or any of the other Troupe Managers, and we will deal with the issue.<br>
<br>
Your problem is especially disturbing since your part in all of this was an act of kindness (given very difficult RL circumstances for the person who gave you the items).  My educated guess is that some RL stuff is interfering with you getting the spell that was promised to you, but I'm not sure of that at this time. If you feel that this issue is not being resolved in a timely manner, or is resolved in an inappropriate manner, let me know.<br>

But then again I could be wrong. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As some know, the paladin quit.  His wife was ill I was told.  I was asked to pass on some items and I did.  I sold a couple very cheap to another of your guildmates before I realized the connection.  Then I met this person and transferred the 3 items to be given to Rosemarie.  I assume she got them.  I never got an answer.<br>
<br>
I made comment about a ghoulbane and he said he wanted to buy it.  At this point, I had over 100 pp and was way ahead of where I should be so I thought of this trade.  He agreed.  My intentions were to have these items distributed amongst Goodkin's (sp) old guildmates.  Especially since I assume they would be getting the spell.<br>
<br>
What concerned me was the lack of communication.  He was not afk one night but didn't return messages.  Hey I may smell but a deal is a deal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

Person 1 flames person 2.  possibly exagerating things.<br>

Then person 1's friends post on their behalf flaming person 2 and person 2's friends post on their behalf flaming person 1.<br>

So... its ok to flame an entire guild for the actions of a few, yet its not ok to flame a single person? <br>
<br>
you need some skills in logic and common sense. <br>
<br>
so what you do is right, and what others do are wrong... is that it? Or are they wrong just because you don't agree with them? or don't like them? <br>
