She has made great progress in getting the two guilds attention but now will be the hardest test. She sits back and recalls the day when she was given this quest.<br>
<br>
The paladins life was a long one and she lived cleanly. After she had passed and took her side next to Karana, for she was rewarded for being kind to all and still upholding the values of her god. She was gifted with the name Raven for her hair was as black as that of a raven. Long has she watched from above, but this day her god had wished her to sit beside him to observe his chosen. He showed Raven the woman, blond, tall and very strong. &quot;Her name is Blayse she is the one who will be my chosen, observe her and tell me what you think my Raven.&quot; As I sat and watched it made me sick to see how paladins have changed. &quot;She eats the blood of others? Is that dark elf flesh she eats, OH she eats the flesh of others.&quot; As I looked over I had seen Karana's face, he was greatly disappointed. I continued to watch and saw the most repulsive trait of all. She brings down others paladins, warriors, clerics, why? For they CHOOSE to be with others of the evil side, that is for the gods to punish not her! &quot;These are not the actions of a paladin she has great hate My Lord Karana.&quot; I should have kept my mouth shut! &quot;My dear Raven would you bring the one they call Denerion and Blayse my Chosen together so they may mend the fence that is broken and work together to help in the fight?'<br>
I looked at Karana and saw the look of hope in his eyes. &quot;I have never said no to you my Lord Karana and I will not say it now. Of course I will help, but promise me that I can do it in my own way.&quot; The Rainmaker nodded his head and sent me back.................here. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is nice to be back, but I cannot wait to get back and rest. My time is over and the sooner I get those two back in good graces the sooner I can leave! My Lord Karana forgive me but he has chosen a pretty sorry excuse for a paladin. **she scoffs** Feasting on the flesh of others how repulsive!&quot; <br>
<br>
The woman gets out of her armor and her clothes and heads to her bed. &quot;I need rest, it has been a long day.&quot;<br>

I do not care for the way that you choose to correct it. <br>
<br>
Accusations are flying and peoples reputations are now in question.  I do not feel this is warranted, ShadowsMistress.  It sounds to me as though this is quite one-sided.  Remember, there are two people involved and both are responsible for at least trying to work out their differences. <br>
<br>
Making it public and putting people on the defensive is not the way to resolve it. Wouldn't it be better to remain impartial and not accuse or belittle others?  By being impartial you may be able to make more progress.  Why should either party speak with you when you have already created an &quot;uncomfortable&quot; situation?  <p>DriaAnn Windrose<br>

Just MAYBE, you might want to try a little ego-reducing and a bit of a reality check before you get yourself in the middle of a situation you obviously know nothing about. And it IS OBVIOUS that you know NOTHING about Blayse and little or nothing about Denerion.<br>
Blayse Thunderwraith is one of the kindest, most generous paladins that I have ever met. She has died rather than train others who might not survive it - she has rezed me personally for free so many times I have lost count, never once asking for even so much as a donation; unlike Denerion who requires a donation to do a rez (unless you're in his guild).<br>
Blayse takes her personal hunting time to help train young characters, this I have seen myself. And if you EVEN hint to her that you need help - she is ready to give it at a moments notice. And I have never heard of her idly belittling someone in any form of chat; unlike Denerion who was caught in the act of idly belittling myself and my husband (so I have personal knowledge here).<br>
That some lowlife like yourself; that is afraid to even make yourself known to the guilds you are presently insulting and infuriating; should come onto our guildboards and claim to sit at the Hand of Karana, and judge Blayse, makes me sick to think that I might actually one day share the same air on the same planet as you. <br>
Oh, nevermind I won't have to worry about sharing the air with you - I am sure that slime like you more naturally exists off the noxious fumes eminating from an orcish outhouse.<br>
And in case you ever get the backbone that Tunare gave to even the lowest critters in the world; you can find me - Kiltla Oakmate  on Firiona Vie - And I will speak these words to your face.<br>

It doesnt surprise me that is the way of evil to run with its tail between its legs. I challange you Shadowmistress to meet my mother face to face. I know that you will not do this because you have no honor hiding in shadows. By the response and support of others that know the true Blayse it seems that all these acusations were false. Like there was any doubt. My mother has always stood for what is good and standing by what is right. The evil and the lies that this Shadowhussy was trying to spread are not true and he or she has proven this by hiding in the shadows yet again. I am proud of you mom and know this you have many friends that will stay by your side as i will. Thank you all for the support that you have given Blayse.<br>

OOC on behalf of the Crusaders of Thunder i would like to aplogise for Shadowmistress posting here on a public board. He or she does not have the knowledge of roleplay or they would not have placed a post here. This personal attack should not have happed hear.

Reasons why Raven should have just left Well Enough alone!<br>
<br>
1. You drink to much.<br>
2. People who think this game is RL should seek mental help!<br>
3. You shoot your mouth off and the wrong person and you just might get it slapped...............HARD!<br>
4. YOU DRINK TOO MUCH!<br>
<br>
Any way you better hope I never find out who you are because I will hunt you down BIRD and pluck you like a chicken.....TRUST me you don't want ME to find you. Cause what the rest of these people will do to you will seem like a walk in the park compared to what I will do. Even though I am not really directly in the roleplaying, if you want to call it that, Blayse IS MY FRIEND and what you say offends ME. I DARE YOU Raven to find ME. And another thing **grins** Don't Sing it babe! Bring it!! I don't care what character I am playing I will take you on you name a TIME and a PLACE and I will be there with Bells on. You picked the Wrong person to mess with babe! I am not hard to find so look me up!<br>
<br>
And the last reason why Raven Should have left Well Enough alone.............<br>
<br>
Pissing off Blayse's friends in Real life is dangerous to ones health!!!! Especially when you piss off THIS ONE!<br>

                   I, Kiltla Oakmate<br>
 - now over the initial anger at the hateful words spoke against the wonderful soul that is Blayse would like to say:<br>
We are looking at this attack wrong and this thread should be left here, and on the guilds boards. My reasons are as follows:<br>
<br>
The responses to the attack on Blayse stands as the MOST moving testament to her character, not one of us who defended her could have done better without the prompting of anger and the flow of Love that we all obviously feel for Blayse.<br>
<br>
Everyone of us that is blessed with the friendship of Blayse, and was infuriated by the attack on her - should go back and read what her friends said - and glow in the warmth that being a friend of Blayse brings. Our words in defence of her are quite a testament of the Lady and what better way for the whole world to find the beauty of Blayse then to see the base and cowardly attack on her and THEN to see dozens of people defend and praise her worthiness.<br>
<br>
Nay; Blayse, and all of us should let the pathetic shadowmistress (whomever the soul behind her is) go; because someone like that will NEVER have a friend like Blayse and thus will NEVER know the joy, gifts, and love that having a friend like Blayse brings to your life. Also, a loser like the shadowmistress will never be defended so lovingly by so many people as Blayse has been - on three different webboards.<br>
<br>
I think we should all just shake our heads at the shadowmistress for the pathetic excuse for a person that he/she is and go on about our lives knowing that we have the best gift that ANY of the Gods can give - we are friends with <br>
                          Blayse Thunderwraith.<br>
<br>
Thank you Blayse for being my friend - you have enriched my life in ways to numerous to mention. I will always be your friend and I will ALWAYS be at your service. It is a profound joy knowing you, Blayse.<br>

<br>
I have always tried to do what is right and just, seeing it as my duty as a Paladin to protect and serve the young, the good, and the innocent.  I do spend alot of time helping others it is true.  But I do not do this for praise, I do this because I like to help.  It is a very satisfying thing to watch another grow, and sometimes very quickly, to watch the joy on their face as they become stronger and gain the gifts of their Gods (skills, spells).  This is what being a Paladin means to me.... helping.  It is why I became one when my Lord Karana chose me to walk in his life-giving rain.  <br>
<br>
I have always known that I have friends that care for me, but I had no idea how much, obviously, nor how far my helping ways had reached.  I thank you all for your support in this attack upon my person and upon my Family.  The Crusaders of Thunder give me joy daily, and I will happily die for any of you if it means you live.  The same can be said for my friends in the Emerald Family.  Some of you who have spoken here, you do not know me overwell.  I thank you.  I am proud to call you friends.  This Raven.... this carrion eater..... well, he or she has made no effort to get to know me or what I'm about.  (in game or out)  I seriously doubt that my blessed Lord Karana would have such a creature by His side.  For He does not stand for accusations, lies, and malicious doings.  My Lord stands for truth, integrity, honesty and valor.  I have seen none of these things in this Raven.... this scavenger of dead flesh.<br>
<br>
In closing, I wish to say two things.  First, The Emerald Family has shown themselves to be noble and honorable.  I should like to have a meeting with your leaders to discuss an alliance.  We of Crusaders are honored to have such wonderful friends.  Second,  Denerion... this must stop.  I request a meeting here, in front of all, you and I must put our differences aside and put an end to all of this petty bickering.  This Raven has sided with you, it seems, and I would like to know your thoughts on why such a creature would choose to leave one of us alone, while trying to ruin the other so maliciously.  Meet me, Den.  This must end.  This is up to you now, to help me close the circle.<br>

((p.s. OOC.... I was shocked that someone would try to do this to my guild.  I can handle a personal attack in game.  That is a part of roleplaying.  But to come to the server-wide message board to try to cast doubt upon the reputation that I've worked so very hard for, that was just a cruel and malicious thing.  I think this thread should indeed stay here, as a testament to said reputation.  Even an &quot;evil&quot; has come to my defense.  This is saying something.  Everyone can always expect the support of one's friends.  But for an in-game &quot;enemy&quot; to come to your aid, well, let's just say I was a mite surprised.  I thank you all, goods and not so very good, for your support that you have shown.  It proves that, indeed, I have gained what I sought to with Crusaders.  We are a good only roleplaying guild with a reputation for helping others.  It is apparent that my hard work has paid off when I hear how quickly and, sometimes violently, others came to our aid.  I thank you all.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=driaann>DriaAnn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/11/03 5:53:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=882.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~smclynch/images/dria.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: born </span><hr size=1> ((OOC)) <br>
<br>
Blayse,<br>
<br>
You have my support. I despise attacks of this type on anyone. I have experienced attacks IRL with jealous people who have tried to destroy my reputation. They did not succeed. I take exception to that kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
I read your boards and I noticed that Raven (another made-up name, I believe) kept getting more and more personal with their attacks. There is NO place for that in this game! If people take this game so seriously and begin to inflict nastiness on others, then they should consider doing something else with their time. <br>
<br>
Anyway, please feel free to visit our boards anytime Blayse. <br>
<br>
I'd like to say one more thing. This did not drive a wedge between our two guilds. I can see that this is actually bringing us closer. I would be honored to be in an Alliance with the Crusaders of Thunder. Count me in.<br>
