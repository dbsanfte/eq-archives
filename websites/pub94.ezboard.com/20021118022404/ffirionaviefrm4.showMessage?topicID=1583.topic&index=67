For the most part, Xarpolis is really a good guy, and has been carrying a cross ever since he decided to be the guild leader of Awakened Souls. In all seriousness, you wouldn't believe what he has gone through. I cannot even put into perspective the things that have been done/said to or about him and not just recently, this has been since AS' creation.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm going to just copy/paste my retirement post that I made in the Awakened Souls members forum. This might not see the approval of a few people, but hopefully it will serve to shed some light onto a topic that apparently everyone is confused about. If you blame Xarpolis for disbanding the guild and ruining the spirit, you could just as easily have blamed Icewolve for disbanding and causing animosity, or me for leaving when the guild depended on Taiil to raid, or Groggle for having to go inactive for real life reasons, or Xixsis for doing the same, etc. You could lay the blame anywhere really, but since the majority of you don't know the circumstances or history behind the guild, you'd only be touching upon a small part of what was actually a variety of events/players which caused the downfall of this guild.<br>
<br>
It really was the players that made AS so much fun. For the most part we were the tightest group of people than I have ever seen, at least the founding members/officers. I guess that is what happens when you play with a group of people for that long. <br>
<br>
At any rate, here is most of my post in the member's section of the AS board. This post will probably confuse more people than anything, but hopefully it will give some understanding as to why things happened the way they did. Actually looking over my post, I wonder if it will be deleted because I do use a few real life names, but they are the names of myself, my brother, and one of our friends who played here. Oh well, let's see what happens. Here goes:<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
Jesus sorry guys, I started writing this last Friday, but I've been really busy in real life lately. Midterms have been going on and we've been doing a bit more at work recently with the sudden overseas interest in the wheat market, along with having to go to a funeral for my grandma's more or less estranged brother... anyways, you get the point. I've been busy . Ev just called my attention to the fact that I haven't posted anything yet, so here's the finished product of what I intended to post that Friday but didn't get around to:<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
I would have posted this yesterday night, but I had to devote my time to a midterm project due today. I'll try to type this as best I can and I hope that you will at least understand my actions, perhaps even agree with them.<br>
<br>
Where to begin, I'm not sure. I think that it should immediately be said that I am sorry. I apologize for the situation this puts the guild in and for further dampening the spirit of the guild as a whole. I regret asking people to help me finish my 8th shawl. If I had known that things were to go this way I wouldn't have asked for your time. Mainly I'm just sorry that everything didn't turn out the way it should have.<br>
<br>
Just a touch over 6 months ago, me and my brother started up on this server with absolutely nothing. This was mostly as a result of Ev's desire to play again since he felt he wasn't done with game yet after the Brell Serilis incident. I was against the idea just because of all the leveling and work involved, but eventually I gave in. At the time it was nearing the end of my freshman year in college and I wasn't working anywhere but Old Navy *yikes*, so I had a decent amount of spare time on my hands. I figured that we would just use our acquired knowledge of the game and my excessive amount of free time to move up and eventually join FaF or Reso.<br>
<br>
Sometime around then at level 20 on both characters, Ev and I ran into Xarpolis and Temeilion in Solb. Xarp was PLing Teme and Ev decided to work his way into it. He got us grouped and we hit it off after they discovered that we <br>
both had 60s from other servers and knew the game well. Xarpolis asked us to join him and we were hesitant to join at first, not really knowing Xarp and being unsure of the realistic plausibility of the plan of creating a new power guild with characters that were all currently level 20-30. Ev and I debated it, but eventually we pledged our devotion to the cause after meeting the newly merged people from Intrepidity (Lacus, Diggle (Grog), Xixsis, etc.). <br>
<br>
Anyways, what I'm really getting at here is that we've been playing for 6 months hardcore and have about a 97% raid attendance from our first ToFS raid up until the present. I honestly enjoyed nearly every minute of it. Watching us go from PoH to PoG to ToV, then finally taking Vindi down and making all our work worth it. Remember the excitement then? It was great. That's what I play for. <br>
<br>
If everything had gone as planned by the leaders, I have no doubt that we would be the premier guild of this server. We had people who cared more and had prior experience in all the high end areas we were targeting (I know Lacus, Grog, myself, Stab, Eld, etc all have raided NToV/ST on their home servers). So needless to say, we knew how the end game had to be done and what was required to do it. Unfortunately, everything didn't work out as it did conceptually. A few people got into trouble and left the guild, others let minor personal squabbles with members/officers upset them enough to make them leave or quit the game entirely, others became upset about loot distribution and didn't understand the concept of equipping a MT so that the guild would be capable of doing other things and doing different encounters, others left or became inactive because of real life obligations, and still others used this guild only as a transition guild to try to better maneuver themselves to get into another &quot;better&quot; place.<br>
<br>
I still remember something Xixsis said to me on our first Plane of Hate raid. Not word for word of course, but it was said in a flurry of excitement immediately after taking out the warrior boss there for the first time. It was something along the lines of &quot;we will be better than all of the other guilds here. We're working together like a team more than I've ever seen&quot;. Like I said above, I was unsure about Awakened Souls at first, but after awhile I really started seeing and believing what Xixsis stated above. This guild was missing a lot of the mistrust and problems I had seen in my guild experiences on Brell, and we all really did work together to accomplish our goals. We helped each other and understood that by doing so we were only strengthening ourselves as a whole. People unselfishly gave up their account info (fully knowing the potential danger of this) just so that others could raid and have fun, or, perhaps to the point where it became slightly excessive: allowing other people to use the officer's personal characters to power level themselves. This was done no doubt with the thinking above, that what betters one member of the guild betters the guild as a whole. It's just upsetting for me to then see people upset about grouping within the guild, and then seeing Erollia's comment on how she refuses to group with anyone and expects them to find their own cleric when she really shouldn't have had that advantage in the first place... is just slightly upsetting . It just perhaps shows how the good intentions were lost and problems were created instead. <br>
<br>
Oh well, apparently I started rambling. I'll get to the reason I ebayed so suddenly. After the reformation of Awakened Souls to Souls Arisen, I just felt like things weren't the same. Yes, there was that night when we did Ikatiar and everything looked good, but it proved to be only a fleeting moment, a last hurrah of a dying guild. When SA was finally reformed Temeilion, one of the advocates of recreation didn't want to rejoin, people couldn't really agree on what the new guild wanted to do and the direction it was to go in, and others were harboring hidden resentment for whatever reasons - be it not being picked for a new officer or having a taste of being unguided with no obligations and liking it better than working as hard as everyone did in the past. And for the most part, I think that all of our active members did work hard, especially our officers. Most of them had to DC at least one character and I know of several raid instances where Lacus was playing at least 4 characters, Groggle 2, and myself 3 (Taiil/Strete/Stabb or Xix or random). And that's not counting any other DCing that I probably didn't know about happening by Xarp or whoever. At any rate, it's taxing trying to play 3 characters as well as 3 people would play them. I felt I got the shaman/monk down pretty well, but throwing a third one into the mix made things slightly more complicated. All that hot keying out of the windows to reposition one character and then cast on another, and then backstab on Stab and then kick with strete and move him, and then start casting again on Taiil... it was quite a bit to do . I don't claim to be the best player around, and in fact I don't even consider myself a good one. But I do think that I did a decent job playing the roles that I needed to, or playing them well enough for us to raid and get along. That goes for all of those people who DC'd really, because of you we were able to do so much more than we really should have. <br>
<br>
Basically, I quit last week after seeing waning interest by the majority of the guild and after doing some reflecting on my interest in Everquest on my own. First off, I don't think anyone quit trying, I don't want anyone to feel like I'm labeling them as quitters. I just felt that the spirit of Awakened Souls was gone for the variety of reasons I mentioned above and others I didn't touch, and other people were feeling it too. More than that, I just think everyone got tired of working and trying so hard only to see people leave or complain or log off. At least I did, but I got upset whenever anyone left the guild from Lethux to Shayde to Iyceries to even Norok, I just thought that it was a mutual feeling among the members that we are a cooperative team that works together through the bad and the good, and through our efforts will eventually pull through. It hurts _everyone_ when people leave or don't log on or stay /anon to hide from guild events, it's one less person to raid and perform the tasks necessary to hold a successful raid and have fun, and it's more work for the officers and anyone who has to step up to fill your spot... but I'm sure if you're actually reading up to this point you already know all this . <br>
<br>
Last week, one of my friends at school came into my room and heard me complaining about shit here and said, &quot;Do you even play that game for fun anymore? I think it's more out of obligation to whoever those people are.&quot; Really though, not to sound like an asshole, I feel that his observation is true. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret anything. I wouldn't go back and change any of it if I was given the chance. I play to raid, not to sit in a camp and experience for 100 AA points. I'd rather eat shit than go through 100 level 50-51's. For me, it's always been about raiding: seeing people happy getting their new toys and gear, testing the limits of the raid crew by figuring out how to pull or work the rotation etc, and basically just seeing a group of people who have never really met come together and accomplish something great. That's where I have fun, which is why I never really was a fan of the Luclin expansion, and I surely won't be a fan of PoP. I mean, it's a great idea to be able to augment your character and give him special abilities, I just don't have the interest or time anymore to even want to do it. I mean, I've been 60 on both characters for how long now? 2 months? 3? I don't remember, but I've gotten less AA points in that time than Nalr got in one weekend. Says something about the player I guess, though I'm not sure what.<br>
<br>
Once again I've managed to digress, so I guess I'll finally get to the point. I ebayed because I wanted out, because I was tired of the game and needed a binding way to get myself off EQ and not to come back. Ev has all but quit the game himself, aside for playing it rarely and casually when I'm absent on the weekends, George deleted his character, and everyone else I know in real life who played the game has long since moved on. It was time for me to go too. <br>
<br>
As far as how much money I got for the characters or whether I could have gotten more, it really doesn't matter to me. If I wanted more money I'd go out and get a second job on top of going to school full time and working at the CBoT already. I didn't want the characters to go to anyone in the guild because I would feel obligated to sell them for next to nothing, putting me in the position to be able ask to buy them back or play them if I ever had the desire to check out PoP in the future or raid with the guild, etc. Plus I don't want to take anyone's money from the guild, you guys that sent me offers about what you would have paid for my chars should be saving it and not blowing it on some video game...<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
That's most of my post, at least the important parts anyways. Perhaps this will take some of the heat off Xarpolis  <br>
