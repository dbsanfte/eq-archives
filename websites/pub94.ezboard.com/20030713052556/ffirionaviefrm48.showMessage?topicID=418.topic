<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Absence of Light</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
An ancient book is reviewed as the aged Wizard goes over the arcane runes within it. He notes several keys in the wording and looks up at the crystal ball the size of 10 ogre heads. The crystal ball swirled with purples and other hues of red and gold. The old Wizard began to chant and the ball began to swirl with many colors. The candles began to die down with their light and a fluttering of pixie wings began to sound off as the Wizards familiar made its way to him with the dust requested. <br>
<br>
&quot;Cast the dust upon the ball as I say the next words&quot;<br>
<br>
The female pixie nodded to her master and the spell was completed. The clouds of the ball parted and a truth began to appear. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah look at this! Look at this!&quot;<br>
<br>
For many hours he gazed long into the crystal and then with a feint look at the pixie he was finished and walked from the room into his den. The pixie covered the crystal ball with a large black cloth and fled off into the den after her master. <br>
<br>
Thought wandered around in the aged Wizard's mind. Behind those eyes were answers others would never know. The pixie waited to hear of what information the old Wizard might reveal to her. Long has she served her master well and long has her knowledge grown with his teachings. <br>
<br>
&quot;An exodus has taken place. On a vast scale all that was has fled the lands. I had thought it so strange a thing to see so many leave but a seed has been in their hearts since the days when our world became like so many others. Requests and arguing with each other of the next steps to be taken. In the throne room a vast challenge had been placed onto the table and the King said, &quot;We must follow our hearts where ever the road will take us&quot;. Then in the night a gathering of the true company put their wills in order and their things together. One by one each came to the soul room and freed their flesh from their souls. In one voice all that was, followed the King and each of their lights entereing the night sky and drifting towards the heavens. Those that remained behind saw the trail of light dim in our world and entreat them to follow their friends. In a great terrible moment of sorrow the last remaining gazed lastly at the world they knew. With a great moment of pain they walked to the soul room and placed the crown upon the floor and all the hope that had been left, vanished. The dreams of the gateway and all it was meant to create and the gathering of all against common evils was placed into the hands of those that where left to witness the exodus. On that fated day the last hero of the Immortal Kindred removed his flesh and released his soul to follow the trail of lights leading to the other world of hope.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old Wizard sighed at this and looked troubled. He knew that the world had been changing long ago. That in his lands evil and good began to work together more and more. In his own lands languages became easier to learn and less important. In his world was a flood of new youths and more shouting in his forest and more greed and more hate. While deep in the throngs of the throne room of this guild were loyalist that had heard enough. He noticed the last relics of the ancient clan. He noticed the trail of lights which still appeared above the soul chambers near the library of their now darkened home. His mind crept past the cobwebs and past the discarded belongings and he gazed at the only thing missing that ever mattered; those within the armor and those that carried the swords.<br>
<br>
Those that held the cups of wine and those that laughed with good cheer.<br>
<br>
As he gazed on ever further with his sight he began to understand clearly that the worst fate of all is to be left alone. All the wealth in the world can not matter if you are alone with it. What joy in the world is there, without anyone to share it with? <br>
<br>
&quot;There is a noble idea, young pixie, that was created long ago here. A flood of youth was brought here when it was a young world. This noble idea separated our plane from all others. It made our world a star above all others. A place where those who understood it could appreciate what being in it meant. It was not a linear place and it was not a place of simple ideas. It was a land where emotions matter and your stories were to be told. A place where history would be recalled and the legend would never die. Where teaching and helping your brother and sisters was a common thought. That Noble idea has since become tainted and spoiled. Harvesters took the place of the planters. Reapers took the place of the growers. Greed took the place of adventure. Lust took the place of love. Corruption took the place of purity.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Pixie had never heard her love speak so. Now she would question him on all this. Such pain in him meant something horrible. This was always an elf of foresight. So damaged could he be?<br>
<br>
&quot;Master, what can be done to bring back the light and return us to what we once had? Master? Master please tell me that I might let the children of the Fae know!&quot;<br>
<br>
The old Wizard looked closely at the Pixie. His eyes tired and red now with thoughts. <br>
<br>
&quot;Rebirth my child.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled slowly and then drifted away from consciousness. The Pixie moved this way and that about the aged Wizard and watched the last bit of color fade from his face. The most powerful force known to her was passing away before her eyes willingly. Like he knew it was his time. Slowly his light drew from him and the Pixie watched on as his soul fled his form. <br>
<br>
&quot;Master? Good journey to you. Master I will always love thee!&quot;<br>
<br>
The room darkened as the light fled. Only the Pixie shined and she was leaving the home. Past the old scrying stone that held so many secrets and past the doorway she would clean so often. Past the old cobble stones that her Master once trotted and past the small well she used to fetch him water from. This would be her last flight from her Masters home. For the Master was dead and she was released of him and on her own. The stories and the words from him told to her over the years have become a part of her soul. Yes, most were very sad but they told of virtues and spoke of heroes. She did not know if all that was spoken was the truth for who would know the truth from a lie from the lips of a Wizard? <br>
<br>
But inside she felt a new dawn was approaching. Now that someone had heard the story in the completion then maybe a difference had been made. Maybe the absence of light would only be for a small time and never forsaken, but that was not in her hands to tell now. After all not everyone is a Wizard and can see what the Master saw. There are many unawakened souls that do not notice the loss. How would all those that do not understand gather and face rebirth with those that do? Her head hurt from all the thinking. Best to leave this up to those minds greater then hers. <br>
<br>
[ There was a sound of destruction. The valley of death opened and the entire world was cast into the void. Then a great division bell sounded and the end of time rang down its last moments. All the souls in limbo were judged and placed into the heavens and hells. The Gods spoke and time began again and the Wellspring began to draw forth. Life sprang from its shores and death had beget new life.]<br>
