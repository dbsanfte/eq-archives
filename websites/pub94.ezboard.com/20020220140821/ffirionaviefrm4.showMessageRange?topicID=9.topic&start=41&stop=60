Alas, at the time, I just saw someone confused and a little hurt. I thought that I was seeing past the anger in the post to the hopeful person within.  It's my fault for not seeing that beyond the surface anger in your post, there was more ... anger.  I responded as I would to anyone else coming to this server as I feel that good people adding to the server is a good thing.  I had no idea that the moment you were in the door, you would begin not as a champion of good, which you stylize your character as, but rather a champion of intolerance. <br>

I had questions and asked and sought the advice of fellow role players. I recieved the advice I needed and made by decision. Yes I am a champion of light, and where I differ is that I don't pretend to be a champion of light...I am. I am all for tolerance, not for those that are willing to allow their own self needs and interest to place themselves above the ruleset. <br>
<br>
Do I have any sympathy when they hit the hornets nest and get stung and they cry out knowing full well what would happen when they held the stick in their in the first place? No. Like I also said in another post, you support a murderer...your no worse then the murderer yourself, and that includes you if so be it Bludge.<br>
<br>
I don't hate anyone on this earth of gods, I don't have anger in my heart towards anyone. However I am also not one to make excuses and sit back and say &quot;yeah its ok if these people come break up my home, I really don't mind...they are just visiting&quot;. If you break the rules, expect to pay the repercussions of it. It's really pretty cut and dry. It would be one thing if it was, &quot;ok well I made a mistake and I was wrong and I will fix it&quot;. However that has been made more then clear on a number of occassions that is not the case.<br>
<br>
Tolerance without wisdom to guide it leads to foolheartedness. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usearemhard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SearemHard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/01 9:29:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmmm</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm this thread raises a new issue I think.

Honestly some of the PnP rules are far to easy to exploit. When somebody makes me share a camp that I'm holding legitimately, especially when I have been for the past &lt;insert number here&gt; hours I get rather peeved. On Bertoxx the rules are hardly ever invoked and I've seen them used once in the last year or so. Basically be considerate. If somebody is at a camp, its theirs. This is especially true on this server because NOBODY CAN FARM ANYTHING. When I learn HTML I'll be putting a calendar up on my guilds site so theres no confusion on the big raids. <br>
Is it fair to wait for a guild to clear fear, then another guild port up and tell the guild that cleared it to share or else, whens there's only Cazic and the Dracolich left up?

Wasting a GM's time by invoking the PNP and then lying to them about wanting to share a camp when your only desire is to grief another player is pretty low. <br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
Since you have attacked me with this in another forum, please let me clarify.<br>
<br>
Once in CC we fought our way down to a camp and found a mage farming. I still to this day don't remember what the guy was farming, I wasn't looking to camp something, just along for a good time adventuring. <br>
<br>
Guy was, I dunno, 55 or something? No experience. Pure farming. I mean, NO experience, no experience five or ten levels ago. No challenge. No danger. Clear case of pure farming.<br>
<br>
I did not petition him. I did not even ask for the camp. I would not presume to do that. People farm. I personally think its wrong to hold a camp if you can't get experience and someone else needs it. If it were me, I'd have offered to turn it over when someone walked in. He didn't. That, to me, is his right. I respect the social arrangements of camp ownership no matter how sleazy I might think the farmer is.<br>
<br>
If you move that to the RP server and I'm there and I want a camp to get xp and maybe something I really want or need and I see someone (well more likely two people--one a buffer exactly 20 levels above the other) that is from a guild that I know is disruptive or it's a person who's an anti-roleplaying disruptive person--perhaps someone who's so bored with farming that they're /shout'ing the lyrics to &quot;And then I got High&quot;. Well, I don't respect that this type of player has a right at all. I'm not going to respect that camp. I want the camp, I can get experience from it, they can't and they're screwing up the economy to boot. On this server, I'm going to ask for the camp and if they don't feel like sharing, I'll force a share. Is that partially to send a message that I think they're scumbags when 97% of the servers cater to their needs and they feel the need to crash the RP one? Yeah, it is. Am I petitioning solely to grief them? No.<br>
<br>
Why would I respect that farm camp on one server and not the other? Because this is the roleplaying server and anti-roleplayers don't belong here at all. I'm perfectly willing to tolerate them if they don't bother me, but farming a no xp camp that I want is bothering me. That's depriving me of a camp. And IMHO on the RP server, RPers are in the drivers seat, not uberfarmers. And a lot of things that are wrong that I would ignore on other servers, I'm just not willing to ignore on a RP one.<br>
<br>
3 Things for 3%:<br>
1) No IDIOT names<br>
2) No OOC on public channels<br>
3) Understanding that non-RPers are welcome guests on the server, but RPers are the homeowners. <p>Numtini Lightheart <br>

<br>
I don't think it was intended to be seen as discrimination against anti-roleplayers or guilds that are not liked.  I think it was meant more as a statement that people that exhibit this kind of behavior are going to be seen as not roleplaying and will be disliked. <p>Vexis Larseker<BR>
