Thank you.  I so much wanted to say this but didn't dare for fear I'd obscure the validity of it in a shouting match over the specific issue, which is one I haven't (obviously) endured.  Nobody has the right to play the &quot;pain card&quot; for guilt on somebody else's behalf.  It's a cry for help when you're living through it, but nothing more than a cheap shot when it comes in as a left-field semi-anonymous afterthought.<br>
<br>
Gentle hugs for the loss, whenever it was.  I can't begin to imagine that road.<br>

You are really good at making assumptions. What makes you think im not living through it with her? As for your 'Cry for help' theory, its null and void. The situation was an example of how things can be said, even within roleplay that might affect the person behind the toon. That has already been stated twice.

Don't know, don't care, not even a little bit.  You never said, &quot;we&quot;, you said, &quot;Kory&quot;.  If it's your pain as well, it's even more disingenuous of you to bring it up like it's a third-person event.  Cheap.  Shot.  Everybody's got pain.  If it's yours, say so.  If it's not, let the people in pain decide what's important.<br>
<br>
For somebody who's whining about how long the thread has gone on without her, you sure are persistent about keeping it going.  Me, I don't care... so long as you continue to bleed mistakes about my posting, I'm happy to sit here and correct you.  Keep it coming...<br>

If you want to refer to real life events in a vague and off handed manner you really don't have much call in attacking people for responding with assumptions.  If you don't want people to read into what you refer to either don't refer to it or give a lot of detail.<br>

<br>
Matrix I think you need to reread what you said.  And I repeat do not presume emotions on another.  If Kory is troubled over this loss I can understand and feel for her.  I can only assume that if she is having as much trouble as you insinuate that the loss is fairly recent.  If not she needs to seek help.  There is such a thing as allowing grief to become excessive and overwelming your life and there is help for this.  <br>
<br>
Grief must be felt and expressed by each of us in our own way.  Mine I dealt with mostly alone.  See I had twins, one lived and one was stillborn.  Those closest to me didnt know how to react.  Whether to be happy about the wonderful new baby I did have or to sit and grieve with me over the loss of the other so most simple avoided the situation.  A common reaction to a situation like this and I did understand.  <br>
<br>
Each of us have an episode in our lives that is painful.  We can not expect others to guard there every word simple because it might bring up painful memories to another.  Otherwise I might have taken a great deal of offense at how you responded to my post (which by the way brought up a painful episode in my life, the same thing you accused others of).<br>
<br>
If you are close to Kory then I hope that you continue to support her.  But all you are doing is showing me that my orginal opionion that this perhaps is someone who should avoid roleplaying, to be correct.  That of course is only my personal thoughts on the matter.<br>

All in all, it sounds like you're not listening to anything anyone is saying, since them disagreeing with you, in your mind, means they're denying your 1st Amendment right.

<br>
From what I have seen of the Soapbox, people tend to argue what they believe in, not what the majority seems to say. The fact is the VAST majority say that her IC/OOC line is very blurred.  Find me one post that says it isn't (I read the first 5pp, and didn't see an outright defense).  Do you really believe that 99% of the community is wrong and only you and Kory see the light?  <br>

First, damn let it die.  It's not an argument either side can &quot;win.&quot;  She came to complain about something and people told her what they thought.  Some people were ignorant and deserve to be smacked around abit, but people are lumping EVERY single response in with the few that called her names.  NOT everyone that replied did, and to say that someone else's insulting post makes all of the good comments irrelivant is foolish.<br>

I'm sorry but that's way to much personal information about someone I dont really know.  I play everquest to get away from the messy details of real life.  I think its tragic for that to happen to anyone, but I gotta say... It's none of our buisness so why is it being shoved in our faces?  No one can know everything thats happened to another person, and its not fair or realistic to expect people to walk on eggshells.<br>
<br>
You talk about the line between accetable and unaccetable roleplay... well how the hell are people suppose to draw that line when you wish it based on VERY personal experiances that, generally, people dont share with strangers?<br>

The person that made the comment had no idea of this persons background or any event like this, and I really think its shitty for someone to bring up such personal information in defense of a thread on a fucking message board.  Stuff like this doesnt belong anywhere NEAR EQ.  I tell you what, if you were my RL friend and brought up something so personal on a message board, we'd have some harsh words.<br>
<br>
Shame on you for using something like that as emotional leverage.  You should be ashamde of yourself.  If she was upset by it she could have spoken up herself, and unless she appointed you her defender, I'd say your out of line.  I dont WANT to be involved in people's personal lives, if something traumatic is brought up the mature thing to do is to say &quot;ooc im sorry that's enough, can't rp this anymore&quot; and leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Any decent person hearing that, (like most of the people who have spoken on this thread) would appologize and offer some comfort.  That's called being mature.  You can't expect to never have tragic events brought to memory accidentally and I think part of coping with them is understanding that.<br>

Again, I repeat, since I had a similar incident.<br>

HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T HANDLE IN ROLEPLAY IF YOU DON'T FUCKING TELL ME?<br>
<br>
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW ANYTHING, ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT YOUR LIFE RL?  YOU ARE A BUNCH OF PIXELS ON MY SCREEN SENT THERE BY A BUNCH OF EXCITED ELECTRONS BUMPING AND GRINDING ALONG A PIECE OF COPPER OR FIBER OPTIC CABLE!  I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT YOU TELL ME YOU FUCKING CRAZY LOONS!<br>
<br>
THIS IS ROLE PLAY.  EVERYONE HAS THEIR OOC HANGUPS, AND I HAVE MINE (no one says my characters were raped but me, period) BUT I'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE THAT'S OFFENSIVE BEFORE YOU GET YOUR FUCKING BLOOMERS IN A TWIST!<br>
<br>
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE YOU WEAR A FUCKING SIGN AROUND YOUR NECK SAYING:<br>
<br>
&quot;I LOST A BABY, PLEASE DON'T REMIND ME OF IT&quot;<br>
<br>
OR &quot;I'M BLACK RL, CALLING ME 'LIGHTY' IS SOMETHING I FIND OFFENSIVE?&quot;<br>
<br>
OR &quot;A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE WAS RAPED, DON'T SAY THAT MY CHARACTER WAS&quot;<br>
<br>
OR EVEN &quot;I SPENT ALL DAY BEING CORPSE CAMPED BY CABILIS GUARDS, CAN YOU PLEASE NOT RUB IT IN THAT A HIGH LEVEL MAGE IS DEAD IN A NEWBIE ZONE?&quot;<br>

I don't think that that really reflects poorly on the people involved.  It's just the way people tend to be.<br>
<br>
    I had a disagreement with a chap a couple of months ago.  He called me a camp and kill stealer, shouted it out to the whole zone (which is sorta funny, since the zone empty but for us).  I believed myself to be in the right.  I was upset by the incident. <br>
<br>
    So, I came and posted about it here.  But... I was asking for other's points of view.  There were two of us, we both believed ourselves to be right... one of us was wrong in this situation.  And when I posted in soapbox, I accepted the possibility that I might have been the one who was in the wrong.  And even though the community sided with me, I did receive some tips on how I might have better handled myself to help defuse that sort of situation in the future.   And I am grateful for that.<br>
<br>
   But the lady who came here?  Ranted about a situation, then became defensive and abusive to others who posted that they did not agree with her position.  AFAIK, she maintained that she was 100% right in her view, and we were assholes for not supporting her.   She came across as being rigid, dogmatic, and combative.  She gave no signs of conceding that there might be another valid point of view.<br>
<br>
   I don't care if she lost a child.  I don't care if she is a thirteen year old who is gaming for the first time.  I don't care if she ever got raped, robbed, or assaulted.  I don't care if she had called in sick the day her office pooled on the lotto, and lost out on her share of 65 million dollars.  And from the way she was posting her, I sincerely doubt if she cared on whit if any of the above happened to the person that tried to RP with her, or any that have responded to her thread.  The only thing I care about is how she conducts herself in the EQ community that she and I are a part of.<br>
<br>
And she has behaved poorly. <p>-- <br>
