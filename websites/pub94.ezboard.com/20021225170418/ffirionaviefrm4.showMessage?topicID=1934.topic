And before i get flamed by all your friends because im posting this, keep in mind that i need to let this off of my chest because i thought what Kethlar's group did was completely uncalled for.  Being the raid leader of this group, he could have been kinder and perhaps a bit more curteous before pulling a dragon right on top of my group.<br>
<br>
Heres what happened.   Right outside the tunnel in the dreadlands, my small group of sisters were pulling yeti's and such and we were doing quite well.  Without warning, a large group comes up and without word, starts to attack and take our kills.  Right after the second or third one that they took from us, one of the raid members deeply appologized for the groups &quot;ruffian&quot; behavior but we'd better move because they were pulling a dragon right on top of us.<br>
<br>
We were forced to move after that ... of course.  After all, i dont think we wanted to do a corpse retrival due to someones lack of respect.<br>
<br>
Now,  here is my point to this.  <br>
<br>
1.  What gives them the right to just take over a spot without asking?  We would have gladly moved if we were asked and I think this attitude was uncalled for.  Yes, Kethlar, I realize i dont &quot;own the whole zone&quot; as you put it.  But i honestly think your mother should have spanked you more as a child.  your attitude to me was quite rude and only caused me to be rude back.  Really, it was your &quot;i dont care&quot; attitude that really set me off.  You didn't even have the decency to say sorry.<br>
<br>
2.  You would think in an organized raid, they would at least clear the area before people are put into danger.  To me, this is not an organized raid and i find it sad that people are not caring enough to allow people to move first.  <br>
<br>
Again, i dont care who spamms this message and i dont care how many of your friends come along to protect you.  After all, you said you did have such a good reputation.  *rolls eyes*  i think an apology is in order though for the rudeness you displayed this day.  not only to me but the sisters in my guild.  <br>

The traditional spot to kill her is on the glacier to the south -- far away from people that are hunting or travelling in DL.  I've dealt with NC a couple times and it's not just normal raid chaos.  There does seem to be a general lack of consideration on their part when raiding; they tend to act without thinking first.  To their credit, though, when you talk to the raid leader about it, the problem gets fixed pronto.  <br>
<br>
Their actions really don't match up with what I've seen of griefer guilds, too; ie. doesn't look deliberately mean to me.  So, I've put it down to just having a ton of raid newbies in the guild.  They'll get better.  I've not seen 'em or heard of 'em making the same mistakes twice.  My guess is you'll get an apology for this and they'll move it to the glacier next time.  If they'd like, I'll even show them where to kill her that's safe and describe some tactics to use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cutierogue>Cutierogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/6/02 2:37:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pulling the Snowflake to ..</span><hr size=1> His actions were deliberate and by what he told me, he didn't care.

But you are right Bjond.  Why were they pulling there anyway since many travel through there?<br>

Uh was I the one who called the other person &quot;Moron&quot; first?  As I understand this situation you were the hostile party.  Gore was or near the entrance to the zone..our discipline tank went LD and couldn't get back so we had to pull it.  I'm sorry but we are not pulling the dragon across the zone to a spot I have no idea where it is.  We decided to pull the dragon there and one other thing YOU Arudin didn't say where you were camping..you just started hollering at me in tells telling me how you are camping a spot and we were intruding on it...trying to take your kills as you say.  <br>
<br>
1.  Those Yetis or whatnot are GREEN to me so I wouldn't be pulling or killing those beasts in teh first place.<br>
<br>
2.  We were only there to kill Gore<br>
<br>
3.  I told you &quot;you didn't own the whole zone&quot; because we were first at the burning woods zone line in Dreadlands and decided to move camp to the tunnel when we found out Gore was there.  Therefore the raid party moved itself there..and I figured you were as you said &quot;annoyed&quot; because we were in your way at a camping spot you did not say where.<br>
<br>
4.  I did also tell you that during our conversation as soon as we make an attempt at Gore and it was over we would be moving on from Dreadlands.  Need I still EMPHASIZE that you IN THAT WHOLE CONVERSATION YOU HAS WITH ME DID NOT ONCE MENTION WHERE YOU WERE CAMPING?!<br>
<br>
Again we had no choice but to pull Gore there because thats where she was and we had no puller that probably could have withstand the summons and AOE or melee attacks if we had to drag it across the zone.  We felt we were justified in pulling to the mouth of the cave because thats where Gore was.  You had more than advanced warning that we were going to pull Gore there.  Thank you very much.  And I don't feel like apologizing to a snotty gal like you who decides to call names first in the game than talk in a respectful manner.<br>

Second noone  cares if your raid was made up of gimp half elf ninja turtles ( on 2400 baud modems even ) , you decided to roll over a lower level xp group that was grouped in an area thats a pretty common camp.<br>

If they were camped at the bw/dl zone everyone would have just nodded. however they weren't. <br>

Sorta rude, *nods* does it happen all of the time when a raid rolls though an area *nods*<br>

As for those of you who don't believe that we &quot;had no choice&quot; but to pull it there...well were you there?   Have you even engaged Gorenaire before?  And no we did not take her down this time but we will make another attempt soon.  We are in the &quot;learning&quot; process so to speak.<br>
<br>
I don't care for people who &quot;guess&quot; at what we should have done.  Again, the Arane person did not AT ALL tell me where she was camping, therefore I had no idea what her complaint was about where we were intruding.  Also I did not even see this Arane and her group near the mouth of the cave?  I also without know where she was gave her sufficient warning that we were going to pull the dragon...and she came back with...&quot;Are you crazy you gonna get us all killed.&quot;  Which to me at the time (when I didn't know where her camp) was sounded pretty moronic itself.  <br>
<br>
And uh as far as outrunning Gore and having her follow you...heh  try to do it yourself if you haven't and see how far you get<br>

So, because you were at a completely different area at the zone, YOU own the zone.  Wow...this is a new precedent, I think.  Apparently whoever is at the Burning Woods zone in the Dreadlands has the option to move his or her dragon raid on top of whoever he or she wishes.

You're unwelcome.  It really doesn't matter if you feel you were justified or not.  You pulled a dragon with (to quote you) &quot;summons and AOE or melee attacks&quot; on top of another group before scouting ahead to see if the desired pull area was clear.  Your bad....not Arania's.<br>
<br>
I don't know what was said in tells, but I can say that even if Arania was irate, she had good reason to be. You say you had no choice.  That is untrue.  You could have chosen not to attack Gorenaire with your tank gone.  and if your tank went LD during the battle, you could have chosen to evac.  No evac?  Too bad, so sad.  Get a wizard or druid in your party next time.<br>

Yes, I know what you mean by this, but it just came off REALLY condescending.  Please provide some background info next time.  I didn't catch the KSing remarks in Arania's first post, so I thought you were just being an asshole there.<br>

???  Are you like twisted in your thinking?  How in the world does the phrase: &quot;I would not have attaced a Yeti because its green to me&quot; translate to what you said up there?  So you think everyone who doesnt attack a green mob thinks that way?  Uh...I think you have an inferiority complex.<br>
<br>

This sounds kinda childish..maybe that cookie is better suited for you.<br>

Quote:<br>

=================================<br>
So, because you were at a completely different area at the zone, YOU own the zone. Wow...this is a new precedent, I think. Apparently whoever is at the Burning Woods zone in the Dreadlands has the option to move his or her dragon raid on top of whoever he or she wishes. I'll be sure to keep this in mind next time I'm in Dreadlands.<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
What in the world do you base your assumptions on?  Do you even know how to debate?  Sounds like your just ranting here and sounding well off your rocker.  How is it that I am inferring that I own the zone when we had to move a raid party from one location to another?  I never said we owned the zone..Arane is the one that got all huffy because we intruded into her camp, which I had no idea where it was.  And we didnt move our dragon raid over another person's camp.  As I said before I did not see Arane at the mouth of the cave area...if she was there I wasn't aware of it and during ALL that time she didnt say she was there either.  Doh?  You get it?<br>
<br>
============================<br>
Irrelevant. You should have scouted ahead to make sure no one was there. It takes what? 30 seconds? And it only takes one person to do it. Learn a little courtesy.<br>
============================<br>
<br>
Uh it took us about 15 mins to assemble back at the mouth of the cave...not once during that 15 mins did I hear Arane say &quot;we are camping this spot, could you please go elsewhere&quot;.  All I heard was some of your raid guys are killing our Yetis and mobs and its getting annoying&quot;.  Uh where in that statement by Arane does it say she was camping the mouth of the cave?  You mean to tell me that in all of 15 mins you couldn't send me 1 tell that said Arane and her group was camping that spot?<br>
<br>
===============================<br>
You're unwelcome. It really doesn't matter if you feel you were justified or not. You pulled a dragon with (to quote you) &quot;summons and AOE or melee attacks&quot; on top of another group before scouting ahead to see if the desired pull area was clear. Your bad....not Arania's.<br>
===============================<br>
<br>
She had 15 mins to let me know where she was and she failed to do so.  At this point its not my problem..she and her group could have let me know they were camping this spot and we WOULD HAVE moved if we knew we were intruding...but we were not informed so we didnt.  Not our bad...your bad and Arania's.<br>
<br>
================================<br>
I don't know what was said in tells, but I can say that even if Arania was irate, she had good reason to be. You say you had no choice. That is untrue. You could have chosen not to attack Gorenaire with your tank gone. and if your tank went LD during the battle, you could have chosen to evac. No evac? Too bad, so sad. Get a wizard or druid in your party next time.<br>
==================================<br>
<br>
*L* uh we are definitely NOT going to stop a dragon raid because our tank of choice went LD.  We had other tanks there and we decided to try it.  Again I can see if this is the situation why she was irate but I have the same reasoning to be irate as well.  Get off yer high horse please.  No raids gonna stop for your benefit.  Especially one that was legitimate.  Again we would have moved if Arania had made it clear that that was her camp site..but again in all that time of about 1 hour of being there...she did not once mention that that was her camp site..nor did I see her ther.<br>

<br>
You didn't have a single person with snare (or any other &quot;will not be summoned&quot; spell) and enough hps to suck up a couple of 750pt AEs. (Provided no resists.)?<br>
<br>
That just seems unreasonable.<br>
<br>
And pulling Gore to the tunnel is a sick idea. If nothing else so when int casters start hunting in Dreadlands they aren't even near 750hp. They round the last corner and instantly dies...<br>
<br>
I like you Kethlar, but this time you were wrong.<br>

Well of course I would think that they could possibly be killing the guards at the KC entrance, and not camping the tunnel.<br>

And the zone is called Dreadlands, not &quot;We're here to kill Goreny so get the hell out of our way, you've been warned.&quot;<br>

JharyCleric...well think of it this way...<br>
<br>
Arania saying &quot;You are gonna get us killed&quot;  without me know where she was camping could have been mistaken for a newbie statement ... like for example ignorance of what Gore is capable of.  And unfortunately that is how I perceived it at the time.  Again I did not see Arania and her group at the mouth of the cave when I arrived there running from the burning woods zone line.  Therefore I assumed we had the camp.<br>
