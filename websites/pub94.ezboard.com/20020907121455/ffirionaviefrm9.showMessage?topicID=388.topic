(fixed formatting)</span><hr size=1> So I'm new to EQ, but I'm trying to get involved and be a contributing roleplaying member of the community.  I have a farily shallow backstory that I'm adding to daily, as I learn more about the world.  I have a whole slew of questions and would appreciate answers to as many as you can.  So here we go:<br>
<br>
1)  I'ld like to find an in-game mentor for my character; I play a High Elf Magician, who calls himself a Pyromancer.  Anything from a master-apprentice relationship to just a wizened village elder would be wonderful.  I'ld like someone to develop my roleplaying skill against.  The experienced players I've seen tend to be running about at full enhanced speed everywhere they go.  If such noble beings are in such a rush, my lowly character feels out of place to approach them.  Likewise, typically when they aren't running around they are surrounded by a whole host of others and are busy casting spells.  My character has no desire to interrupt their preperations.....<br>
<br>
2)  Similarly I'ld like advice on finding low-level roleplayers to adventure with.  I want to advance, but I don't care if its not as fast as &quot;optimal&quot;.  I've found three groups over the past three nights with overlapping members.  All tolerate roleplay, but none join in, so I find myself stopping as well.  Sadly they are very aggressive about joining fights that others are involved in.  I don't know if its out of ignorance about kill steals, a desire to help the besieged or what.  In two cases when I told them that it looked like the other people had it under control, they backed off before it caused problems.  The third time I was still running to the scene when I noticed what was happening and then it was too late.  The victim complained to me, as I was about to tell the group off.  I apoligized to the victim, left the group immediately, and proceeded to have a nice in-game discussion with the victim, which has already given my character more to think about.  I definately won't be grouping with them again, without a discussion about &quot;sharing.&quot;  Any suggestions for finding more suitable companions.<br>
<br>
3)  Similarly, is it ever right to jump in an assist someone?  When I've seen an a fellow newbie surrounded by a swarm of wasps and can see their health dropping fast, I'ld like to help.  I've always sent a tell asking if they want help, non have every responded, all have died in another minute or so.  While my character is good and would want to help another elf, I don't want the bad will of players.  Similarly if someone is running from the orc camp with a pack of 4-5 orcs following, should I try to distract some/all of the orcs?  I'm a magician, I don't have any beneficial spells I can cast on others yet so I can't help without joining the battle directly....<br>
<br>
4)  Roleplay advice---last night there was a powerful dark elf sitting near in in Felewithe before the bridge.  His tag was green, I don't know what that means, was guessing maybe its a GM/Guide?  In either case it looked like a wonderful roleplay situation, but I (the player) was too afraid to do anything.  I tried finding other PCs but the zone was rather empty and I couldn't get back out to the Feydark without passing him, the character was definately too afraid to try to run by... shouting would only draw attention to me.  If I confronted him, likely denouncing him, I would probably get challenged to a duel... I'ld have to accept, but whats the point he could probably kill me with a single blow....  Suggestions for how to handle this in the future?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1) The in game mentor</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Well, sure high-level players are often busy, but they are as often bored. Just try to approach them with nice roleplaying and I am sure you will not have to seek for long.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2) The stopping roleplaying when you join a group</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Just continue your roleplaying, no matter what the others do. You will draw them in, and if not, you can still leave. There are a lot of nice players on FV. Of course you often have to cut down roleplaying slightly when in groups, in order to function effectively, but by no means it has to stop completely. (Maybe in an excellent group you need not cut down at all ?)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3) Helping others</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Players are very conscious about KSing. I only help when I am sure that the other is in trouble. When in doubt, ask them. No reply probably means no help is needed.<br>

Well, I think you handled it perfectly in character. You knew he would be too strong, so you evaded him.. for the moment. Maybe when your powers have grown you will meet again.<br>

<br>
EzCode only matters when it comes to putting in formatting, like bold or italics. If you just type your stuff normally (double-spacing for paragraphs), it will post that way.<br>
<br>
Starting with a shallow backstory is FINE! You don't have to show up with a full history. Many of us start with just a few ideas about our character (&quot;I'm a really naive and helpful guy&quot; or &quot;I am terrified bugs&quot; or whatever), and then develop our story as we learn about the world and interact with others.<br>
<br>
The newbie areas are, in general, worse than the rest of the world for finding good players. Yes, there are ALOT of good players in the newbie areas, but that is also where you find the bored d00dz who are just trying out the server. You made a good start by posting here - I have met alot of people in-game because I got active on the boards that I would never have met otherwise (I am still a pretty new player on FV). Keep trying, it DOES get better.<br>
<br>
I am a magician also, so I can give you some tips on helping others. If someone is obviously overwhelmed and dying, you can usually send in your pet or nuke to pull a monster or two off. Make sure you say &quot;I hope I didn't interfere, you looked like you were getting swarmed&quot; or something like that when the battle is over. People obviously running to the guards usually appreciate it very much if you pull off a monster or two. If they are jerks about you helping, chances are they won't last long here anyhow, so you can just ignore them and move on with your game.<br>
<br>
You, as a magician, have infinite numbers of summonable bandaids! Get that bind wounds skill up! You can bind someone while they fight, as long as they don't run away. Tell them &quot;hold still, I am bandaging&quot; and most will stay. If you see someone drop, but they're not yet dead (it won't say &quot;Soandso's corpse&quot; yet, and the monster will still be attacking their body), you can send it your pet to fight and bind them so they don't die.<br>
<br>
At level 8 (I think) you get your first damage shield. You can toss that on people fighting, and it won't aggro anything on you or take away their experience in the fight. It DOES give you faction changes - so be careful about tossing it on people fighting things that you don't want bad faction with.<br>
<br>
You can also offer people you meet your summoned items - you get bandaids, bags, food, water, and weapons (all mage weapons are magic, too!). You get your first focus item (the necklace) at level 4, and just about everyone loves those. Summoned items are actually valued here. Don't forget you can equip people's pets, too!<br>
<br>
About duelling - it doesn't cost you experience to lose (to address the game mechanic issue). You can always roleplay being afraid to fight, if you don't want to. Or you can /duel someone just on the principle of the thing, knowing you will lose. I /duelled Gore (level god Iksar) when I was level 8? maybe, because he had been killing gnomish clockworks the day before and I saw him picking on those nice elf guards the next day. I /ruded him, he challenged me, I accepted, I died real fast. And then I had a great roleplay session (no common language, even!) with the elven cleric who rez'd me for standing up for the elven guards. I'd /rude that mean lizard if I ever ran into him again, too! Bad lizard!<br>

(fixed formatting)</span><hr size=1> Focus items are these nifty new summons ... there is a series of 5 (you get one every spell circle starting at 4th level, then start upgrading the ones you have). They are a necklace, a mantle, an earring, a ring, and a bracelet. Each of them offers some AC, mana, and HP - and affects spellcasting in some way. The spells are available in the Bazaar in Luclin.<br>
<br>
Necklace - reduces component usage<br>
Mantle - increases the duration of buff spells<br>
Earring - either reduces aggro generated by spells (the official explanation) or reduces mana usage (the results that are showing up in player tests).<br>
Ring - decreases casting time<br>
Bracelet - increases spell damage<br>
<br>
There are also some very nice new summons such as the Elemental Defender (10 AC, fire and cold resistances, shield or back slot - all non-caster classes) and complete sets of summoned armor. They are especially nifty for equipping your pets, as well as making you loved by other characters. They are available at the mage guild in Shadow Haven.<br>
<br>
If you don't have the Luclin expansion, there are those of us who are willing to drop by and grab the spells for our colleagues.<br>

<br>
I've checked out the mage channel the past few nights, no activity.  Is this an IC or OOC channel?  If IC any &quot;normal&quot; RP explanations for it... not a big fan of general telepathy.... now if there were some magicked gem or something...<br>
<br>
I picked up the Luclin upgrade so I can go there when I have a RP reason to and get the focus item/spells mentioned. (That is if I can stop playing long enough to install it when I'm home)<br>
<br>
I've tried to start working on my bind wound as that will give me some way to feel helpful, but of course no sooner did I start trying to work on it and all the other rookies seemed to have left Greater Feydark so no one seems to be injured enough to be bandageable...  Getting the first damage shield soon, which will be nice as well, but experience is coming extremely slow now, haven't been able to find groups lately that aren't powerleveling and I can't solo well against the orc camp, guess its time to explore somewhere else....<br>
<br>
I look forward to meeting y'all in game.<br>

(fixed formatting)</span><hr size=1> The mage chat channel, like every other chat channel except /market, tends to vary in population. There aren't alot of mages to start with, so it is kind of catch-as-catch-can when we happen to meet up in-channel. No, it isn't a severe roleplay thing. Most things are said in-character, but nobody weirds out if you type &quot;OOC - how do I adjust the gamma in this game?&quot; or &quot;OOC - hey, did you see the new news on spells in EQ2?&quot; or whatever.<br>
<br>
OK, now... bind wounds. You don't have to bind others. Running around finding injured folk is the least efficient way to get skill. Target yourself. Nuke yourself under half, bind. Lather, rinse, repeat... until you max your skill each level. You can also jump off a cliff, but be careful that you don't jump off anything high enough to kill you. Falling damage is variable, nukes are a bit more of a known quantity. Either way, doing this will assure you that you always are at optimum skill in binding.<br>
<br>
Mages are pretty awful at any type of hunting that requires decent crowd control... we don't have any. So don't look to everything-jumps-you-at-once-camps for your primary experience, unless you are grouped or everything is low blue. If you are talking about orc camps in Faydark and a new damage shield, I am guessing you are around level 7-8ish? Get out of Faydark!<br>

Butcherblock - open area hunting between the Greater Faydark zone and the crossroads guard hut. Spiders, snakes, giant bats, goblins. You can work up to the low teens here by moving on to basilisks, giant scarabs, and skeletons. The druid ring in Butcherblock also has some level 8-10 skeletons that can be pulled solo.<br>

(fixed formatting)</span><hr size=1> I hadn't realized I could target myself; was afraid of falling; tried letting the weak monsters pound on me, knowing I know kill them when needed, (got my defense up nicely, too), but after 30 minutes with 3 wasps surrounding me I still wasn't down to 50% so I stopped.... they just weren't hitting or only for 1 point.....<br>

I had tried having my pet target me, it wouldn't.  Self-nuking is even IC for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I try to self-enforce a &quot;only meditate in the presence of fire&quot; so you'll often see me sitting in firepots, etc.<br>
