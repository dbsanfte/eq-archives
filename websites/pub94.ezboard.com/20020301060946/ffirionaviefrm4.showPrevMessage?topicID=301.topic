(Told like a Drill Instructor) Pii</span><hr size=1> Well my first posting generated some friction, but that is to be expected when you generalize peoples Classes.. so let me reiterate that my posts on 'Class Roles' and 'Dos and Donts' are 'Generalizations' and should not be read too deeply in to...<br><br>Rangers - If you are a Ranger then read the following...<br><br>#1: You are NOT a tank. You will NOT be a tank, ever. So dont tank unless you are the only one who can tank in your group. If your group consists of a Rogue, Monk and Ranger then (believe it or not..) let the MONK tank... his defensive, dodge, parry and reposte (and more the likely ac) is better then yours... if you got a Warrior, Paladin or Shadow Knight in your group then let then tank... if you gain aggro STOP attacking. Its simple... just stop, stand there like a bump on a log and wait for the tank to taunt if off.... if you find yourself 'constantly' gaining aggro then I suggest the above AND breaking attack randomly for 5 seconds during a fight... you will live longer, make your cleric happy and you will appear to be a God Among Rangers to others...<br><br>Another good piece of advice... when casting Snare/Ensnare... break attack... cast snare... wait 5 seconds... re-attack... this will help you out tremendously... (and of course if you got Jolt or Cinder Jolt... use it...)<br><br>REMEMBER: Snare/Ensnare is ALMOST a sure bet you will gain aggro...<br><br>AND BY GOD USE SNARE! You get it at level 9. Its in your first line spells and it is also your most FRIENDLY and USEFUL SPELL you will EVER get (until you get the upgrade hehe). Your group will LOVE you when that mob just stands there with its back to you when normally it would be running away screaming like a little girl bringing all of its big brothers to pound your ass....<br><br>Clerics - read the following....<br><br>You are not a Wizard... you are not a Wizard.....<br>You are not a Warrior... you are not a Warrior....<br><br>Now then I will proudly say that at level 20 my cleric has a defense of (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and a 1HB skill of (6) hehehe A clerics job is to Meditate and Heal/Cure your group... learn that.<br><br>Yes yes... I know we have kick ass Undead Nuke... thats different. You need to learn 'when' to cast that Undead... Do you have enough mana to heal your group? Will you have enough after dropping 1 nuke? 2? 3? There are many things to consider before doing anything outside of 'Healing and Meditating'... so before you 'waste' mana make sure you are doing it for the right reason.<br><br>Heres something else... *IF* your mana bar is FULL and your group is doing nicely against monster_0002336 then feel free to stand, engage melee and raise that attack skill.... but if you aint full mana and your group is getting beat on then dont even THINK about it... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Enchanters... read....<br><br>You are a core member of any group. Your uses are many, but let me point out a few..<br><br>Breeze, Clarity, Clarity II etc... your casters (including Hybrids) *need* this spell. Give it to them all and keep them in it. At the VERY minimum keep your pure casters in it. Shaman, Druid, Cleric, Magician, Necromancer (unless he wants to lich...), Wizard etc....<br><br>Cast Breeze, Clarity whatever on yourself FIRST... then cast on the others... when yours wears out or begins blinking you know there is too... refresh everyone (mana permitting...)<br><br>Haste - My God... CAST YOUR HASTE BUFFS ON ALL MELEE... your over-all damage output will raise anywhere from 20% - 50% more damage output just from YOU hasting others... keep them in it....<br><br>Charm - Use this sparingly... its a great saver at times, but can alsoi backfire with hidious results... use it wisely...<br><br>Seive - this is a good thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Strip that mana from that mob... no more heals from healing_mob_299373 (Seive is a must against dragons like Vox...)<br><br>Mez - Your mainstay... that which makes you more useful then anyone... NO ONE can match your crowd control prowess. We love you for it...<br><br>Haste Debuff... second only to Shamans... Mez.... Haste Debuff.... next mob.... Haste Debuff.... have memwipe handy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>CLERICS - if you have an Enchanter in your group KEEP HIM PRIMARILY TARGETTED! Enchanters tend to drop like ROCKS... (this goes for Druids and Shaman too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and Paladins shoudl have Hotkeys for targetting Clerics/Enchanters/Main Tank for Lay on Hands....<br><br>/target NAME - thx <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>No, I am not an Enchanter nor do I profess to know all the 'ins and outs' of being one... but what I do know is what you are good at and what you are piss poor at...<br><br>Enchanters.. if you are NUKING... you are doing it wrong hehe<br><br>Magicians - read...<br>Your roles are primarily as a Utility Caster.. you are second to a Wizard when talking about 'Nuking'... you have nice nukes, but they are HORRIDLY mana ineffiecient... your mainstay is you pet, your damage shield (best in the game), Mod Rods, Call of Hero... beyond that you have some nice utility spells.. but what I listed is about it.... no I dont profess to be a magician I just know what they are good at <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Dont go nuts on casting.. watch your pet, keep him under control and buff your group with Damage Shield. If you got mana to spare drop a nuke here and there.<br><br>Necromancers... well, what can I say... I like Necromancers. Necromancers are 'The Soloist Class' in EQ. NO ONE can even come CLOSE to there natural ability to just plain old kick ass. DoTs, Buffs, Pets, Pet Buffs, Feign Death, Lifetaps, Nukes.... You guys, when played well in a group by someone who knows what they are doing can make a shitty situation turn in to a successful situation.<br><br>Also pump your casters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Its what you are really good at hehe<br><br>When someone in group says &quot;Mana check&quot; and your cleric, wizard, enchanter.. whatever says &quot;20%&quot; or something like that... pump them if you got the mana... Twitching ownz <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Shadow Knights - You will hate me...<br><br>I will only state the GOOD things about Shadow Knights...<br><br>When it comes to sheer ability to just TAUNT a mob about the only class that can come close is a Ranger chain casting Snare/Ensnare. This is a good thing if you need to get the mob off your cleric.... your Attack/AC Debuffs are HUGE taunts, added with your Darkness Line of spells along with a quick tap of your Harm Touch key means you WILL gain aggro from 'almost' anything. This is a good thing.<br><br>Pulling... yes, you can pull, but leave it to a monk if you want a real man pulling... until you are level 60... then you can match a monk... until then... leave it to the masters of pulling. Thx bye <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Lastly... If you got a Ranger/Druid in your group DONT cast your darkness line. Make sure your Ranger/Druid is snaring. Sure your snare has an added DoT factor to it, but its so weak its not worth the effort involvoed and your snare is not as powerful. Snare lasts for 2.5 minutes while Ensnare lasts for 11 minutes. Darkness line only lasts about 1.5 minutes. Your Darkness line also over writes Snare line... so just dont caat it unless the Druid/Ranger si screaming RESISTED!!! RESISTED!!!.... then feel free to back them up with your Darkness line....<br><br>Monks.... oh boy here we go....<br><br>Monks are 2 things and only 2 things...<br><br>Damage Dealer - you output some serious whoop ass... second only to Rogues on the melee side (if you are properly equip'd)...<br><br>PULLER - You are a puller. Born, bred and instinctually made to pull mobs.... Your JOB is to LEARN every single mob, every single path, every single DETAIL about EVERY SINGLE mob in this game. You are the MASTER of KNOWING &quot;How to pull that mob...&quot;<br><br>I refuse to advise you in this area. Just know that YOU make so MANY encounters possible its not even funny. Play your class well. Learn zones, learn spawn times, learn pathing, learn mob abilities... read web sites... experiement... etc...<br><br>Lastly on Monkeys... Did you know if you gain aggro in a fight Feign Death works wonders.... USE IT! You will live longer....<br><br>Well, thats enough for now...

(Told like a Drill Instructor) Pi</span><hr size=1> As a warrior, who most likely is very mediocore himself, I would like to add my own 2cp:<br><br> Druids - From a tanks perspective your snare and damage shields are my favorite item. When you are in a group, please remember that you are not soloing and use you skills to the groups advantage. I was recently in a mid 30's group with another tank, a cleric, a monk and a druid. We were in an outdoor zone. We should have mopped up chain pulling exp. The druid would never cast snare, never once DS me as the main tank and never skinned me. He only dotted and DDed. Even after I asked him to use his skills in a group manner. This type of thing has happened many times. Perhaps classes that solo so much have trouble adapting to group situations. <br><br> Caster in General - If there are two tanks in a group one will most likely be assigned to get any aggro off of you. Please advise us as soon as something is on you. Do not wait for us to notice that your lifeline is draining. Sometimes it can take a few ticks to gain aggro back. That can be too late for you. Better still is to set up a hotkey tell to the assiged backup so that he/she is the only one who sees the message and can respond right away with no confusion.<br><br> Also, warrirors in a group tend to get bored. They may pull too soon for you, expecially the ones that are..ummm...sucky. Let your puller know what mana level you feel comfortable with for a pull. That was if you say &quot;50m&quot; and you have established that you need &quot;75m&quot; to pull the warrior will not think it is time to pull. <br><br> I am sure that you casters have a long list for us warriors too. I look forward to seeing some responses and hope everyone is taking all these posts as constructive criticism and not flames.<br><br>Borm <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usteeltoefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SteeltoeFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 11:48:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=402.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advise for Grouping...

Now I am not saying that 'every' Druid out there dont know how to group properly, but let me place a generalization on it....<br><br>'Most' Druids I have ever grouped with had 'poor' grouping skills. Not because they do not play there class well or because they are 'newbs or any other reason really.... they group poorly out of sheer group inexperience....<br><br>Druids in a group SHOULD be doing the following BEFORE they think about dropping Nukes and DoTs...<br><br>#1: Do you have enough mana for a Group Evac? Your mana level should NEVER fall below Evac Levels....<br><br>#2: Snare/Ensanre - if a Ranger has not taken up this duty then it falls to you. This is your PRIMARY responsibility.<br><br>#3: Outdoor Zones - SoW ... keep everyone sow'd.... never know when a train is coming and a quick hop to the zone line will help...<br><br>#4: Damage Shield - Oh yes... you need to keep your tanks shielded or at a MINUMUM your Primary Tank and Seconday Tank... <br><br>#5: Regen/Chloro/Group Chlor... regeneration is a huge mana saver for Clerics.... mobs are constantly reposting or doing a quick turn about and popping someone for some damage.. having Regen on them helps them heal between respostes...  etc.. etc...<br><br>#6: outdoor zones - if a Ranger has not taken this up then you could do it also... HARMONY pulling... in an outdoor zone NO ONE (not even a monk) can match the ability to pull like a Ranger or Druid in an outdoor zone.<br><br>If you have them bases covered and you got the mana (remember: Never fall below evac levels) then feel free to drop a TIMELY nuke or DoT..

Especially priest classes (including clerics) this is free armor.  When you get agroed for healing, nuking, debuffing etc you need to stay alive long enough for the secondary to keep you alive or the tank to taunt off of you, or the enchanter to mes.  Priest classes get a max defense of 200 compared to 150 or 170 for robe classes, and more of course for melees.  With maxed defense a cleric will have about 400 more ac over one with zero defense.  Druids, enchanters, agroed wizards all die in milliseconds because of low ac. <br><br>True, clerics are a plate class, but that plate armor only goes so far.  A full suit of class armor will add about 200 raw ac.  Half of that which you will get from defense alone...<br><br>If you will be agroed you need the following approximate total armor class to not simply fold to stuff you would be fighting in a group at these levels if the monster(s)  decides you are lunch.<br><br>lvl 30  650ac<br>lvl 35  700ac<br>lvl 40  750ac<br>lvl 45  800ac<br>lvl 50  850ac<br>lvl 55  900ac<br>lvl 60  1000ac<br><br>These are low levels, more is better.

When your enchanter tells you to back off, back off.  No last few hits, just back off.  When your enchanter tells you to stop attacking something, stop attacking right now.  When your enchanter tells you to assist 'Soandso'... assist them.  I do not care if you think it would be a better idea to attack the caster goblin who is standing several feet away and just got finished 'blinking a few times'.  It's not.  The main assist picks what to attack next... unless the enchanter says otherwise.  The enchanter is to be your general, deploying you where he/she sees fit.  If the enchanter is any good, it WILL be the difference between life and death.  If the enchanter is not any good... well... you're in big trouble, so just make sure everyone has SoW.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and when I say big trouble... I mean BIG TROUBLE.<br><br>I only say this because, if you do not do what the enchanter says, you are turning a situation from 'Ok, we pulled too much but chanter has got it under control' into 'OMG, we're all going to die horrible deaths'.  You could accually be doing more to HURT the group that help.<br><br>Of course, my opinion on this topic may be biased... my sister is an enchanter.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I should note that, like the rest, this is generalized newbieish advice and to be used to give you a better understanding of an often misunderstood class.  I have never played +50.  While I don't come across the inexperienced player too often on FV, it is a MAJOR concern on blue servers, where too many lvl 50's and below think the enchanter is just a buff-whore.  They haste, they breeze, they med... no.<br><br>Don't be that blue-server newbie.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A> at: 2/22/02 1:34:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usteeltoefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SteeltoeFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 1:45:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=402.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advise for Grouping...

While it may USUALLY be the best idea to attack Random_mob_04 next, the enchanter may tell you to attack Random_mob_03 instead, because 03 for whatever reasons, just happens to be resisting EVERYTHING the enchanter throws at it.<br><br>Normally, the main assist goes to 04, but in this case, it's a bad idea.  It will mean two mobs instead of one.<br><br>[Edit] - Had a half-finished paragraph in here I forgot to delete after I decided to not use it.  It made no sense just sitting here.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I did not mean that the enchanter is the above-all leader in a group, to shout out orders in every fight and dominate all other classes.  No, the enchanter being in charge is not a normal fight.  They should not be.  Crowd control skills are not needed when taking on a single mob.  But when the enchanter does give an order, it would be a good idea to follow it.  I do not mean to sound conceded, but in a massive fight, the enchanter's crowd controling skills are WAAAAAAY more important than melee damage.  Keeping the situation under control is the number ONE priority, and no one in the group can keep it under control better than the enchanter.  Not all fights follow the same basic patterns.  There are always variables, many of which the main assist will not be aware of right away.  Decisions need to be made yesterday, and unfortunatly, the main-assist might not know all the details until tomorrow.<br><br>An enchanter can give information such as 'Random_mob_03 resisting mez' and the group can decide what to do with the information, but that is a half-a-second of decision making that doesn't need to be made.  As in a real battle, excess thinking can get people killed.  There is no use to relay information to the group and then let the group decide if the enchanter can make the decision in the first place and shout a simple order.  It is pointless to say &quot;mob_04 mezzed&quot; then have the main-assist say decide to attack 03.  It wastes time, and that time could have been used to save the group.<br><br>An enchanter in charge is not normal and should not be normal, because an enchanter only needs take charge in an abnormal situation.  But even if in a basic, boring fight, your enchanter tells you for some reason to attack Mob 03 when common sense tells you to attack 04... the enchanter probably has a GOOD reason for telling you to do so, and does not have the time to type out what that reason is.  Perhaps they are going to charm something to take 2 mobs out of the immediate fight, perhaps they are going to mem-wipe a superior mob that would otherwise be attacked next, perhaps they simply made a mistake and mezzed the wrong mob.  But the enchanter knows the situation because they have the ability to control the situation.<br><br>Enchanter - &quot;Hey guys, I know you would normally attack Random_mob_06 next, but just so you know what I'm doing, I am going to mem-wipe it so it goes away and leaves us alone for good so we can focus on the 4 mobs that are going to break mez in about... oh, 7 seconds... so when you kill the mob you are on, I want you to all attack Random_mob_05 because it has been resisting my slow spells, and while you are doing that, I will re-mez the other 3 mobs.  When you are done with mob_05, I would like it if you all attacked Random_mob_03, because I will have JUST cast slow on that mob and it will be all ready for a beating.  I know you would have normally attacked 03, but I just want to be clear with you all so we all fully understand the situation and are able to effectivly deal with it.  Thank you for listening.&quot;<br><br>Enchanter, 5 seconds later - &quot;Hey, just so you guys know, the situation has changed.  In the time it took me to explain what I had been doing while you were all giving your full attention to killing the first mob, the 4 mezzed mobs broke mez and killed Fred the cleric rather quickly due to the fact that I could not re-mez them because I was busy explaining all my actions.  They are all now beating on my skull, and I am about 3 seconds from death. When I die, you guys will be on your own against 4 blue mobs and one red one.  GOOD LUCK!&quot;<br><br>How about this instead:<br><br>Enchanter - &quot;Attack 05 next&quot;<br><br>Not to sound like a moron elitest, but the enchanter owns the bad guys, and therefore owns the situation.  If you do not do what your enchanter says, you are creating a MAJOR problem.  You are working toward undoing all the enchanter's work.  You are helping the bad guys.  Not everyone plays the game the same.  What one may consider the primary threat, another may consider secondary.  But your enchanter is doing things to the other mobs while you are still fighting the first.  Because of this, it is the enchanter who must decide what is the primary threat, because he/she does not have time to wait for the main assist and pals to finish off the first mob and then decide what to attack next.  The enchanter does not have time to think &quot;who do I think the main-assist will attack next?&quot;  They have to make split-second decisions, and the rest of the group MUST to abide by those decisions or all will die.<br><br>Tanks are great.  I love tanks because they keep mobs off my sister.  But don't you DARE attack something she just told you to back off from.  &gt;=)<br><br>Again, I do not mean to come off as a freak saying that Enchanters are the best and all must bow before them and their orders.  Nor am I saying that all enchanters need to be Drill Instructors that scream at everyone and tell them what to do.  It's just that if you do not listen to the enchanter, you're hurting the group.<br><br>An enchanter need not give orders often, but when they do, those orders supersede ALL others.  Even your own common sense.<br><br>...unless your playing with that enchanter who is just no good.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Then you should just lie down and die. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A> at: 2/22/02 3:47:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usteeltoefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SteeltoeFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 3:33:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=402.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advise for Grouping...

With a cleric of appropriate level I have close to 2600 HP when needed and with aegolism and shaman buffs I reach 3400 (or close) with an ac over 970.<br><br>Rangers CAN tank.... but if you have a Warrior/Paladin or Shadowknight of similiar level and appropriate gear... they will do better at taking hits (but the warrior will have trouble holding agro). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/23/02 11:48:26 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=402.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=402.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=402.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=402.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=402.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=402.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=402.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
