I like that, sums it up nicely. I mean if you look at relationships in EQ as just a story its allot easier  to get comfortable in one without expecting too much in return.<br>
<br>
And in relation to the whole &quot;what girls want&quot; issue, all I have to say is... Buh, women!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Best way I think to find out how you stand is to just give them plenty of breathing space, if they start chasing you, you win. Though my biggest problem with this strategy is that I'm impatient as hell and won't stop thinkin' about them till I talk to them, which means, I lose.<br>

<br>
So there's this girl at work. She's been here for a couple of years. And there's a guy here whose ex-girlfriend used to work here as well. Basically they were an on again, off again relationship. In a nutshell what happened was, the guy lied to both girls and was sleeping with them both at the same time.<br>
<br>
They found out about it and they were upset.... AT EACH OTHER! They both still get along fine with the guy, but will no longer speak to each other. WTF?<br>
<br>
All 3 of these people are friends of mine and I get along fine with them all, but why in the hell do these women act like it's the fault of the other woman when they both know and have admitted that it's the guy that was lying?<br>
<br>
It's one thing if women don't mind being with a lying womanizer (while ignoring other guys of course), but it's a little much when they blame other women for it. <br>
<br>
I tell you, I just don't understand women sometimes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coragoblinfriend>Cora Goblinfriend</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/03 4:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2136.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/wi3/corajones/thembi.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Can't win.

When I meet a guy who has such wonderful qualities, I have a nasty little habit of pushing him away once we start to know each other well.  I figure I may as well end these things before they start, and save myself the trouble of a break-up later. <br>
I also wonder what dark, terrible things someone so nice could be hiding from me.<br>

Gotta look out for that one, too.<br>
<br>
But on a more serious note, there does seem to be a push to try and get men to be more like women, whatever that's supposed to mean. Be more &quot;in touch with your feelings&quot;, don't be &quot;afraid to cry&quot;, etc. Don't get me wrong, being sensitive <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>to your girlfriend or wife's feelings</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is good, but being sensitive <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in general</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> just makes you neurotic. I know it's a stereotype and all that, but I honestly think that most women want their men to have more solidarity and substance than that. You shouldn't be a cold, unemotional brick wall, but in my experience most women want to have an emotional anchor -- someone who can empathize with them but not get caught up in the turbulence himself. This really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but men and women a different *gasp*! And it just wouldn't be any fun if they weren't. No, you can't rely on stereotypes, but we all exhibit them to some degree whether we'll admit it or not.<br>
<br>
Long story short, be yourself. As cheesy and hackneyed as it is, it's still solid advice. There's someone out there for everyone. Even the most socially inept and the most despicable low-life have been known to find love. When you meet him/her do you want be acting like yourself or like someone else? Lots of people wind up in long-term relationships, forced to be something they're not just to maintain it because they fear losing what they've got, even if it's not what they want. That's no way to live life. If you're perennially shy or self-concious, you'll have to try to change your <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>behavior</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> because you've got to play the game to win, but don't try to hide it or fake it. Just work around it.<br>
<br>
And, it's worth pointing out that there's nothing wrong with being single in the first place. Value what you've got now, because tomorrow... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=perifv>PeriFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/03 1:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2136.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Can't win.
