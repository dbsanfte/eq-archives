Second. Recently it has goten a bit better, but for awhile, reading the Battlefield was like reading a frigging bus schedule. We have 4 different groups who want to go do this mob, and three for that one, two over here, four back on this guy, and then 7 single targets, all in the same week. Someone once suggested a calender be made, but nobody ever got around to it. Personally I don't have time to try and remember what days which people want to hit certain mobs. Several times my guild (bunch of big time bad ass raiders that we are) refrained from hitting a certain target because one of us remembered such and such guild wanting to hit it. And then we waited...and waited...and waited...all the time doing a different target. Sometimes people post times they are going to go after a mob, but often it's just &quot;Chardok Royals, Aug 32nd&quot; Yeah great. When on the 32nd? If you say noon pacific, and at 12:15 I check and see 5 of your guiildies on, none in Chardock, what then?<br>
<br>
Then you get the guild who posts 6 things over the course of the next month. Taldaydar and I and someone from Reso already posted about the joke that this is. Why not just go in and post &quot;Chardock Royals, Everyday in September&quot;? (And I'm picking the Royals cause it seems to be a consistantly popular one..no other reason) Yes all examples can be taken to the extreme, but everybody has their own definition of extreme. <br>
<br>
Also, anybody who tells you that they can't switch targets in 15 minutes is either 1-lame 2-runs with lame people 3-has no clue what they are talking about. I will go back to my guild again. At the height of it's powers we had three porters. We never actually had all three on at once I don't ever think, so we ran everywhere and PoK'd it. Once we had our team together I could herd them to any place we wanted to hunt in 15 minutes, tops. Once we were together we could hit multiple targets no problem. If you can't switch targets, then it's because of apathy or inertia. Yes I understand you wanted the chanter epic piece from Fear. It is unlikely that there is not one more piece of gear that someone in your raid can't use from some other place. We went to Kael, it was busy, we opted out to Chardok, it was fine. We went to Chardok a different time, and they were having a convention, so we went to PoS. We went to kill Doomshade, but he was having dinner with Fennin Ro or something, so off to Ssra for some Rhag hunting. If you get locked in all that you get is frustrated and cranky. <br>

<br>
No, it's great we don't have a reservation system here.  They are worthless.  Have you ever waited two months to kill a mob that's up for five days?  It's frusterating and it overcomplicates things.  <br>
<br>
If you want to kill Vox, get off your ass and do it when she's up.  It really is that simple.<br>
<br>
Don't bother whining to me about &quot;Well, I'm a casual or open raider... blah blah blah&quot;.  If you want INSERT_ITEM_HERE or to experience killing XXXYYXYX_MOB, then you'd best join a guild capable of it or make your own and get them capable.  The fact of EQ life is that not everyone gets to experience all the content.  Period.  I'll never see the Plane of Time.  I don't particularly care.  I'll never solo Vox.  Again, big deal.  If it's a big deal to you, use the means necessary to take care of that need.<br>

<br>
Firstly, you likely aren't competing with raiding guilds. They are in a totally different place to your guild. You will always be competing with guilds of approximately your strength. This is not uber guilds vs casual guilds. This is uber guilds vs uber guilds and casual guilds vs casual guilds etc. You think FnF is going to steal your Naggy kill??<br>
<br>
Secondly, all you have to do is say we will raid at x time on x day and our target will be what is up. You then send out a scout if you can't find anything to do then you're not looking hard enough.<br>
<br>
There are very few raid targets that are perma-killed. And there are a lot of raid targets.<br>

Casual raiders <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in competion for targets with the &quot;lower&quot; raid guilds.

<br>
I do not advocate a reservation system.  I think it is nice if consideration is given to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>intent to raid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as expressed in Battlefield, but don't think it should be a writ in stone thing.  I do advocate casual raiders having more than one backup target in case the main is down or in process of being taken down.

Its not really anything to do with equal rights, I mean if it was equal rights the handicapped person could stand up for the trip just as well as you can.... but it is more to do with the fact that they are disabled in some way and therefore it is &quot;polite&quot; for us to stand back and then them have a raid target that we are prepped and ready to kill.<br>

<br>
The idea behind it is that people can co ordinate their raids, show some courtesy and plan ahead, making the game more fun, and less people fighting. In other worlds, work together in a civilized manner. <br>
<br>
Yes it says this at the end: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Just a reminder... respect of posted raid events is subject to the whims of others. If you post a raid event here, and that raid is usurped by others, then so be it.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Well, I read that to mean, there is nothing the FV mods can do to those that usurped your raid. Why? Because there isn't anything they can do. They aren't GM's, they don't control the game, and they don't control other people. The best they can do is ban people from this board. And if some one doesn't come to this board, well, there is nothing they can do. <br>
<br>
So just get rid of the Battlefield section. While I've used it, it's quite clear that most of the people on this MB have no intention of respecting it. I don't think I will be using it anymore myself. I may look at to see what is going on where, because I respect other guilds.<br>

Which is too bad, since I don't have time to try and go to every other guilds web site and see what they are planning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeldagisravensoul>Zeldagis Ravensoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nearly invisible,<br> Totally Moronic</span><br>  Posts: 625<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/03 8:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3842.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FCFS vrs Respect</span><hr size=1> I think it's fine if you want to say &quot;Gaylords of the White Sparkling Wine Abyss having open raid on Vox on Tuesday night&quot;, but I think it's ridiculous to expect everyone not to touch Vox because someone posted on a message board.  You use it as a tool to round up people, and if your mob is up, you kill it.  Pretty simple.  If it isn't, have a back up plan or three.  <br>
<br>
The difference between a casual raider and a handicapped person is that very rarely does a handicapped person choose to be that way.  People choose to be casual raiders.  If you make that choice, like I have, you live with the mobs you targetted being down... a lot.  I don't blame the more hardcore people, I just move on and deal with it.<br>
<br>
It's not disrespectful to kill a mob that's up because someone posted that they will be killing it three days, an hour, or a minute from now.  If they're there in force, then it's damn disrespectful to kill it.  If they aren't there, that's the price they pay for choosing not to be a hardcore raider.<br>

<br>
Ok I know im not in CT anymore, but anyone remember the outroar it caused when CT announced they were going FCFS (before i joined them) that they werent gonna use battlefield anymore.<br>
<br>
CT got tagged as greddy ass gankers when they decided that, now i only see people defending FCFS, guess what i was told once is true.<br>
<br>
When it benefits another, its bad, when it benefits you, its good.<br>
<br>
Kind of sad when you think of it, reminds me of a Phinny attempt in kedge *shivers* we had a good core of folks to take him down. It was a while back, when i was still in my first guild. Well someone took a wrong turn and well, pretty much of a wipe.<br>
<br>
The person that had put the raid together was a bit pissed, one for the wipe, and secondly that because some folks that were suppose to come help declined at the last second.<br>
<br>
Well while we rezed and stuff, who zones in with his very own Phinny raid, one of the very friends that said to raidleader he couldnt come, went in and killed Phinny, can say raid leader was pissed more then ever, logged off for the day, hes a mage, was after that mage epic drop or whatever phinny drops for them mages.<br>

Everything else on the server is First in Force.  But that one rotation causes more whining and arguments than everything else.  <br>
<br>
Clear evidence in my eyes that FCFS works far better than any reservation system, since there is virtually no scope for whining and drama.  Whoever mobilises first wins...  Same rule for everyone.<br>
<br>
Anyway Vox and Naggy are virtually never done 'in guild'  and are generally the subject of open raids.<br>
<br>
I have organised open raids before on the battlefield with no problems.  Provided you focus on epic mobs or level restricted mobs (Naggy/Vox), neither of which are exactly under massive competition, you should be fine.<br>
