Please.<br>
<br>
I'm sick of seeing regular players being kicked around and intimidated by some guy who thinks Firiona Vie was created for roleplayers only. It wasn't. That's why it's called preferred. Not required. Not enforced. It's not just for you and your little friends who like to pretend they're evil Shadow Knights who will wipe out all the goodies. It's for everyone who pays ten dollars a month. <br>
<br>
I'm sick of seeing everyone who isn't a roleplayer be intimidated, and I won't stand for it anymore.<br>
<br>
Why am I saying this, despite the fact that I'm also a roleplayer? Because the d00ds, twinks, and so on don't stand up for themselves. The only time they throw hissy fits and get annoyed is when roleplayers get in the way, and I agree with them. Who wants some warrior saying, &quot;Foul beast incoming, my zesty friends! It is time we smiteth himth unto the earth!&quot;? By the time he finishes, the monster's already smacking the group around. Yeah, those d00ds are real bastards for getting angry at you just roleplaying, aren't they? And then they kick you out of the group? How dare they! <br>
<br>
Here's a hint: Not everyone pays ten dollars a month to roleplay. In fact, a minority of the people do, and a minority of the minority seems to think that everyone that isn't like them should be banished to another server because they don't roleplay with them and instead get annoyed. Let's take a look at a little skit.<br>
<br>
Player A:&quot;Leave these lands, you light-skinned beast!&quot;<br>
Player A challenges you to a duel to the death!<br>
Player B:&quot;Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to hold this camp.&quot;<br>
Player A:&quot;Don't you try and trick me with your words! Fight me!&quot;<br>
Player B:&quot;What the hell? You're like fifteen levels above me. All I want to do is hold this camp.&quot;<br>
Player A:&quot;SPEAK NOT YOUR WORDS! FIGHT ME NOW, FOUL MONSTER.&quot;<br>
You have added Player A to your ignore list.<br>
<br>
I certainly can't see why anyone could get annoyed with Player A. I mean, he was just roleplaying, and Player B just sits there, trying to play the game. What a jerk.<br>
<br>
My point is this: You can't expect everybody to roleplay with you, and just because they try and play the game their own way doesn't mean their wrong.<br>
<br>
So take your character's 2492 page history that you expect us to know and read, grab your prejudice attitude against people that don't play like you, and go away. Some people play the game for the strategy involved. Some people play the game for the roleplaying. The ironic part is, the smaller group is trying to get the larger group to change by bullying them around because maybe ten people didn't want to roleplay with them, another four told them to go away, and every other server just ignored the zealot Shadow Knight who kept trying to /duel them. Grow up already and stop trying to kick people around, because I won't stand for it. That's all I have to say.<br>

(it was the shut up. I was content being quiet about this, but the shut up made me not want to*grin*)<br>
<br>
Here is all I have to say on this, myself.<br>
<br>
Sure it's roleplay preferred, not mandatory and I have my own theory as to why that's so. There's one aspect I agree completely with Shintou's player about.  There are 30something other servers where there isn't any kind of roleplay. Can we not have one?<br>
<br>
I personally don't care whether you RP or not, I will be when I talk to you, and if you're obnoxious I'll /ignore you, I don't have any problems with that. But none of that is the point. In case you missed said point, let me say it one more time.<br>

Certainly there are roleplayers who will shun and/or be greatly annoyed by the d00ds, but the most they can do is scream at the person in RP and then walk away, brooding.  However, these days roleplaying on a &quot;normal&quot; server gets &quot;STFU u fucking dumbass, theirs a server for ur ghey playstyle now get the fuck off mine&quot;.  And, as you said, Roleplayers are indeed the minority.  So what are we going to do?  Hang up our hats and storm about miffed at these clueless morons while being able to do nothing about it?<br>
<br>
The &quot;roleplay preferred&quot; title of the server is there for a blatantly obvious reason, and it's not because Verant wants fairness. It's because Verant wanted to save their ass.  For months it was talked about in &quot;Ask Brad&quot; as the &quot;roleplay&quot; server.  Then one person wrote in saying that powergamers might feel excluded.  Verant could lose money over that!  And THAT is why the &quot;preferred&quot; is added.  Not because Verant really gives a rat's ass about being fair to anyone.<br>
<br>
The thought also occurs to me often that the only, ONLY reason these gamers have a reason to play on Firiona Vie is to out-do the roleplayers and continue to one-up them.  They kill everything first!  They get all the best loot!  <br>
&quot;Look at those faggot dumazz RPers, they get crap! That proves our 133+ness dood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, thanks.  We know that your main server has woken the sleeper three times and that your main character and all your alts have full kael armor and epics.  Congratulations to you, that's very good.

Why don't you RPers go to any of the other 30 servers where you can RP to your heart's content while I play on my special server that Veriant designed for those of us sick of twinks and easy communication? <br>

If you are not here because of single character and languages then go somewhere else. This is our server.<br>

<br>
I, myself, have never had any problem with non Rpers, at all. I RPed just fine on my home server with my little RP community. I was around ubers and other types all the time and they just rarely botherd me at all. And they really don't bother me at all here, either. Unless their actively trying to ruin someone elses day, I've just never encounterd any problem with them whatsoever. So, I'd just suggest going on roleplaying and having fun and just completely ignoring that which bothers you. *shrugs* To each their own, have fun everyone.<br>

or &quot;Roleplaying Server&quot;<br>
<br>
But wait.. they can't call it Roleplay only, because then they would have to enforce that, something they are not WILLING to put the time and resources too.<br>
<br>
So instead the server is named Roleplay preferred, thus all the arguing we see. <br>
<br>
Great huh.<br>
<br>
And Borm, you'd have a point if the server was Named &quot;Not twinking Prefered&quot;,  but I'm afraid that wasn't the main intent for the server, more of a Side feature that caters to the main intent of this server, roleplaying, right along with the Languages. Again no ones allowed to say THE intent of the server is roleplaying because Verant screwed up when they named it.<br>
<br>
This problem is no ones fault but verants, fact is this server should have been roleplay only, but its NOT, it is Roleplay preferred and those who don't wish to RP have just as much right to play here as those who wish to RP. Sure verant would &quot;prefer&quot; people to Roleplay here, but so what? <br>
<br>
That said, theres nothing left to do but deal with it, thankfully all the anger and bickering seems to be limited to the boards, and Roleplayers and casual d00ds seem to be coexisting in game rather nicely, when and if that stops, we will see a very small server get even smaller... and it won't be the d00ds/ooc gamers who leave heh.<br>
<br>
I think a good idea would have been to make a Roleplay Server ( I've obviously made that part of my opinion clear <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and a &quot;High Difficulty&quot; server. HD Server would have a Single character rule, Lang barrier, exp penalty for all races, All NPCs would undercon etc. But then again, who cares what I think? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So in the end there is no point at aiming our venom at each other, aim it the only people who caused this problem, Verant. Sure its not likly to be very productive, bashing verant and all, but its certainly less harmful than bashing each other and creating bad ingame relationships.<br>

I think the biggest thing that's alarmed me is the hostility that was vented here.  Of course, Shintou's original hostility COULD be blamed for most of it, but I highly doubt it.  I think we've seen alot of what people try to hide.  I've seen some pretty unsettling things said by both sides.<br>
<br>
I applauded Kelisk for saying to a tee what I believe this server is about, and I applauded Raycoom for saying even better than to a tee how I think Verant implemented it.<br>
<br>
I have been burned for Roleplaying, even on Firiona Vie, and I wish I could end it.  I'm rather disappointed at Verant for the way this server has come out -- in that there are so few events here, or at least big ones.  You'd think more quests would happen here, especially ones dealing with the storyline.<br>
<br>
I really wouldn't be surprised if Verant takes down Sullon Zek and Firiona Vie given time.  They may not, but it may come that other MMORPG's steal their thunder enough that they don't feel they should support such underpopulated servers.<br>
<br>
Oh well, it was great while it lasted, eh?  I'd suggest people start letting this topic rest.

Vall, I could pull at least half of your post out and find a direct comparison on my Bristlebane logs. That's why I'm here. I didn't want to abandon my &quot;uber&quot; 36 monk, Lord knows I put some work into him, but my enjoyment is in the RP.<br>
<br>
I haven't any horror stories of encounters with d00ds here, but I have countless times had to deal with folks who have no intention of RPing their character. Direct interaction, via say, with others around. Why must I suspend my gaming because you don't want to play the 'preferred' way? If I deal with you as my character would, why can't you make the attempt to do the same? Or go find someone who plays like you do?<br>
<br>
Yes, I find it a bit distressing that the non-RPers here are getting hassled the same way that we did on other servers. I don't agree with that. But I also don't see many of you accepting the fact that there are RPers here (gasp!), and that they would like to play that way without catering to you. For a change.<br>
<br>
One last note, for clarity. None of this was directed at anyone in particular. None of this applies to my dealings with folks like FaF, because I've HAD no dealings with them. In fact, they have acted like I had thought the non-RPers would here: they leveled fast and got out of our lowbie areas, stuck together for their playstyle, and don't insist we cater to them. Bravo, for all that I don't know you.<br>
<br>
In short, please don't run up to me asking to group with your soft self in LoIO, and be offended when I /snarl at you. That's what I was told I'd be ALLOWED to do here.<br>

From Aradune's post at the bottom of the forums, referring to FV:<br>
<br>
***<br>
First, just what are we going to call it? As I’d mentioned in an earlier post, we do hesitate to call it an ‘RP’ server for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1. We feel all of our servers are Role Playing Servers and that EverQuest is indeed a Role Playing Game.<br>
<br>
2. We feel it’s pretty much impossible to define what Role Playing is verbally, much less via a rule set.<br>
<br>
The idea then came up to call it the ‘Alignment’ server, since a character’s alignment is pretty key to many of the features we’re implementing. But, to me, that still doesn’t speak to what the server is really all about. From my perspective it’s an RP server, an Alignment server, a hard-core ‘Seige Perilous’ style server, and, quite simply, an experiment server, where we’re implementing some potential ideas for the long-term future, as well as some features we’d probably have put in the game originally, given 20/20 hindsight.<br>
***<br>
<br>
So, FV was named &quot;roleplaying preferred&quot; because (1) VI wanted to maintain the idea that, actually, ALL of their servers were really RP, and (2) they did not want to impose their own idea of RP on people and thereby limit RP innovation. But, in the end, Brad calls it an &quot;RP server&quot;, not an &quot;RP preferred server&quot;. <br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with what the server is now, or in what direction the server is evolving. But hopefully this might lay to rest the incorrect notion that FV was created and originally intended as a server just &quot;with a different ruleset, and if people RP on it, that's cool&quot;. It was intended by VI for RP (if you care what VI thinks, I don't necessarily. And yes, I am an avid RPer.)<br>
<br>

I interpret this to mean that VI belives the very act of playing EQ is to be in RP. Hence, we are all RPers. Some are just better than others.<br>

<br>
I mean, really. It's just a game.<br>
<br>
I roleplay. Only ocassionally on Bristlebane, when I'm hanging out with some friends who also like to RP, but pretty much all the time on FV (the ocassional ooc /t,/g,/gu notwithstanding). I also run into a lot of people who don't RP. (People who talk like d00ds.) Or don't RP within the &quot;vision&quot; I have for my character. (Softskins who want to group with me.) <br>
<br>
Now, I really wish the d00ds would at least make an effort to speak normally and PRETEND to RP on this server for my sake, but is it really worth getting pissed off about if they don't? Just ignore them (you don't have to /ignore if they're not harrassing you; just pretend they aren't there, is it so hard?) and move on.<br>
<br>
The other folks, who RP but don't mesh well with my character, well, I tend to get in IC arguments with them. A lot. It usually ends with each of us calling the other a blithering fool and moving on, but hey, that's RP. You don't have to get along with everyone.<br>
<br>
And sure, it may be IC for my character to go around being incredibly rude and condescending to softskins, and trying to drive them out of &quot;his&quot; territory via /duel, but if they choose not to accept, that's their prerogative. Consensual combat is a VERY IMPORTANT facet of RP in a game like this. Once you add open PvP, there's no RP anymore. People just gank you and call it RP. RP is not being ganked. RP is being threatened, exchanging a few &quot;poses&quot; (emotes) and then, maybe fighting, maybe not, maybe one guy runs away, maybe one guy just decides he doesn't want to fight and wants to stay right where he is. Maybe he has the flu IRL and doesn't want to fight. We should respect that.<br>
<br>
It's NOT that hard to just pretend someone isn't there and move on. A game of this scope practically requires it. Of course not everyone's gonna meet your personal vision of RP. Find the ones who do, and play with them. FV has the highest concentration of RPers of any available server, and that's why I play on it. My glass is half full. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 3:01:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A stand for all the d00ds, phat l3wt3rs, twinks, ubers, </span><hr size=1> /agree smallcutepuppy<br>

Borm, I'm not equipped to argue the wording of the post.

<br>
This post was supposed to be a stand for everyone who wasn't a roleplayer, to show their side of the story. That d00d probably called you an asshole for a reason, which my examples and skits were to present.<br>
<br>
It was also meant that it's ironic how some of these roleplayers think they know what's best for the game, and that everybody else who doesn't play like them (I.e. power levels, twinks, doesn't roleplay) should be banned from the server. <br>
<br>
THAT was my point. I'd like to add that you people should stop trying to say what Verant meant. They've got a Customer Service team that works as their mouth, not some player they no nothing about. They said it was a server with an alternate ruleset. The end. Go express your conspiracy theories about what they meant about roleplay preferred elsewhere.<br>
