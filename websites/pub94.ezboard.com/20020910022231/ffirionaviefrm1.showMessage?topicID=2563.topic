<br>
It seems like a lot of us want some kind of alignment system restored.  Maybe not the old one (although I'm perfectly fine with the old one), but some kind of system.  Actually, if possible, a dynamic alignment system that also allowed for religious conversion (once and only once) would be ideal to me, but probably programmatically untenable.<br>
<br>
Maybe an alignment system that allowed for neutrality among some of the &quot;evil&quot; race/class/religion combinations?  (I'd have to say, though, that followers of Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, and Bertoxxulous should be invariably evil.)<br>

<br>
it seems as though they've had nothing but trouble with the coding(example, almost every patch the no-drop and sometimes trivial loot stuff is broken), and anything they have difficulties with is sure to somehow become &quot;unviable&quot; over an extended period of time.  just look at the bard class for an example of this kind of thing in progress.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
there are lots of new faces around(i was actually one of them, kinda)so i would say that, to Verant, the may 8th changes have made FV a viable server and were worth doing.<br>
<br>
remember, we don't have population count on the login board anymore, so there is no telling whether the &quot;population rank&quot; is an accurate way to assess where we are in relation to other servers.<br>
<br>
but by all means, go right ahead and good luck.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There may be new faces, I don't dispute that, but we're still positioned exactly in the same spot we were before May 8th.<br>
<br>
I logged on last night 7 p.m. Pacific, prime time, and we were above Stormhammer, Antonius Bayle, Kane Bayle (which was locked), and Sullon Zek (Deity Alliance), but below Tullon Zek (PVP--Teams).<br>
<br>
If we've gotten any new players, then it's been at the same rate other servers have been getting new players. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

I've been thinking about an alignment system that gives big exp penalties for grouping with opposing alignments and perhaps it should also reduce the efficiency of beneficial spells cast on 'enemies' a bit.<br>
That way you would be discouraged from grouping with the 'wrong' people without making it impossible to do so.<br>

I've sent feedback many times.  Verant never announced they were removing /alignment.  They only said they would remove its affect on grouping and buffing.  So, once again, an unnanounced change is a bug.  Send a /bug report until they at least admit they deliberatley removed it.<br>

Putting the 'old' alignment back in would be severely limiting people in their fun. Not sure if that is good or not.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, i too miss the alignment definition. I would like to see a system back where the alignment is there, and where grouping with 'fitting' alignments (and deities) has an affect. Stronger / weaker buffs.. more / less experience.. something.. *anything*. It would still allow people to group across alignment. But it would give them incentives not to.  I think it would add to the atmosphere.<br>

She will heal just about everyone, it's personal grudges and dislikes against the person that would stop her, not their alignment. My RP was put off by the past restrictions, and I don't want to see them return.<br>
If some people need these restrictions for their characters, then they should be playing them out, not asking for Verant to screw a bunch of people over so that some other people can have their ideal plot. Simply put, you don't like the other character's deity, you don't group or interact with them on YOUR OWN ACCORD. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thank you.<br>

That is how people should do it if they don't want to group with certain deity-aligned folk. (On a side note, it's the spineless people who will slur my character for being a High Elf and a follower of Tunare and demand not to be healed, but never leave the group because they want a key or they want EXP that bothers me.) <p><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><center><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/littlerobot/mai.jpg" alt="Doll Base: Angy-Chan Doll Art: Maicare"></td><td><div align="left"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=193658">Maicare Svasti</a><br>High Elven Cleric<br></td></tr></table></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=illudin>Illudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/17/02 1:59:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2563.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Restore Alignment on Firiona Vie</span><hr size=1> I'd be fine with an alignment system -- even if it restricted grouping and buffing, preferably via a massive experience penalty -- if...<br>
<br>
1. It was structured on a more logical (read: less D&amp;D) system of alignment. Rifts, with its spectrum of alignments from good to evil without devotion to order even being a factor, would be a good example. Or...<br>
<br>
2. Alignment is a personal decision (no stereotypical limits) that primarily affects faction. So, if you're a High Elf, and you choose Chaotic Evil for your alignment, your faction in Felwithe and Kelethin is immediately ruined (threatening or worse), severely damaged in good cities, and only slightly improved in evil cities. In this way, characters who want to choose a variant path get the full experience of being an outcast. An LG Dark Elf necromancer, for instance, is immediately thrown out of Neriak and still can't easily get into Freeport. The faction penalties could be made even worse if you were to worship a god and then pick an alignment antithetical to him. In such cases, you might find yourself unable to train for some time until you repair your faction. In order for this to work, however, there'd need to be more neutral merchants and bankers. Perhaps a certain city (High Pass?) could be designated as neutral ground, or perhaps other cities could be modified to do this. Or...<br>
<br>
3. Alignment exists but has no effect on the game, other than as a personal reminder of your beliefs. By default, if you have /roleplay on, you get a warning before doing anything that would stereotypically violate your alignment -- such as grouping with evils if you're a Paladin, for instance.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Ah, I almost forgot the most important part of this. If alignment is put back in in any fashion, /consider should work appropriately. Good characters conning evil characters should get &quot;dubious,&quot; conning neutrals should get &quot;indifferent,&quot; and conning other goods should get &quot;amiable.&quot; That way alignment, if not stereotyped, will be detectable by the player. It actually works well with the IC element of /consider.<br>
<br>
My major complaint with the alignment system, which was my primary reason for not coming back to EQ when this server was first launched, was that, as it was written, it was a needlessly vicious restriction on RP with little IC justification. However, I have no problem with a new alignment system -- even one similar to the old -- if it works in a manner that permits atypical RP, so long as such RP comes with appropriate consequences. Mostly, I just want there not to *be* stereotyped limits on what a person can do; if someone wants to play an evil High Elf mastermind, a bloodthirsty Human Druid, or a reforming Dark Elf rogue, he should be able to do so without the game system getting in the way. <p>Illudin Arbitrator &lt;Society of Adventurers&gt;<br>

However, I hate it when dark elves refuse to listen to me because I'm not a dark elf because I roleplay a different alignement system to usual (plus it's amazing how many people forget that there is such an alignement as neutral and just assume that if you're not a darkie you must be good grrr /rant off).<br>
<br>
Anyway, my ideal system is this:<br>
<br>
You are able to alter how you con to people, and how they con to you. So, if you don't like gnomes, you can set it so that everytime a gnome cons you he gets the &quot;looks at you dubiously&quot; message and vica versa. And if you set it at &quot;scowls at you, ready to attack&quot; then you coudn't group with them. This fulfills three roles:<br>
<br>
1) It allows you to enforce alignement restrictions<br>
2) It allows you not to enforce alignement restrictions, or to enforce them differently than usual.<br>
3) It allows you to actually tell whether the human over there is going to /rude you or group with you.<br>
<br>
The roleplaying purist might regard option 3) as cheating, but in my opinion it would greatly facilitate roleplaying rather than hinder it.<br>

Human nature to actually make exceptions there.<br>

So, while i definately like the idea of changed con messages, i dont like the idea of the system telling me with whom to group and with whom not to group.<br>

To Maicare - yes, it would be very nice if that would work. Just, too many will simply<br>
a) reply in a fashion that they fit what they think to be my desired answer<br>
or <br>
b) not answer at all<br>
if asked what alignement / deity / xxx is. Unfortunately, the game gives no indication how to find that out. No spell exists, no ability is there, and it is next to impossible to judge how other people react to a certain player.<br>
<br>
So, i would love to have a crutch for that. Something which allows to test if someone fits into a certain pattern or not. Alignment is such a crutch. Deities are too.<br>
<br>
I truly like the idea of changed con messages. Perhaps use alignment and deity for that. Or make spells allowing you to *try* to find out about a deity / alignment / whatever.<br>
<br>
Something to help decide if that gal is just saying what she thinks i want to hear.<br>

I'd like to see the alignment put back in, possibly as an optional tag, much like /roleplay and /anon are now.  I think it would be great if the experience bonuses/penalties where reinstated also.  Of course, this would just lead people to turn it on when it's convenient and off when it's inconvenient.<br>
<br>
How about something like this though:  Check the current guild make-up of a player for potential conflicts of alignment (such as Iksar and paladins within the same guild or something) and prevent guilds who blatantly disregard the old good/evil/neutral rules from enabling the alignment switch.  This way, those that don't care which class/race/deity the group or guild with won't incur the penalties that a roleplayer would.  At the same time, the roleplayers would have a &quot;reason&quot; for refusing to group or guild with that vile evil/good character.<br>
<br>
This way, maybe you'd see purple guilds and blue guilds.  The RP'ers could do their thing and those not inclined to RP could do their thing and we could quickly and clearly tell the two apart.  I guess that would have to be an all or nothing for a guild to adopt something like this, but I'm sure there are some groups of people out there that would like it.  I also have no idea how complex the coding would be.<br>
<br>
The conning system may be workable though, after all they have something like this for the deity teams on Sullon Zek right?  Of course, some others consider the alignment system as a hindrance to roleplaying.  /shrug.   Just my thoughts on the matter. <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=289462"> Izzuum Rahij</a></b><br>

I really wish they would reinstate alignments (and grouping restrictions) and have them fluid based on various faction changes. Raising faction with certain groups should have an effect on your alignment.<br>
<br>
Also have various caps on faction for varous classes, and gods (not races). For example, a paladin should never get any better then dubious toward The Dead, no matter what faction work he does. A Necro should never be more than dubious to Keepers of the Art. And you should be able to quest to change your god too. (the Dark Elf warrior who turns from Innorruuk and builds the trust of the wood elfs could learn to worship Tunare)<br>
<br>
That would work more toward RP alignments. At least better than the way it was and how it is now. And maybe we would loose a few d00dz.<br>
<br>
~Bobmato<br>
<br>
Another note:  I would also suggest that the grouping restrictions be in the form of expereince penalty, not our right prohibition of grouping.  Perhaps there should be a time for people grouped with opposing alignments, so that the more they group with them the more it affects their alignment.  If a High Elf Paladin group with an Iksar Shadowknight for a significant amount  of time it should change their faction and alignment.  I would think the paladin who grouped with a shadowknight say from 10 to 35, routinely, would not be looked upon well by his guild masters.<br>

<br>
Simply put, you need the old restrictions, but open it up just a bit, and place Experence Penalities. That Darkelven ShadowKnight that wants to group with the High Elven Paladin can do as he wants, but he should expect to pay a high price to Innoruuk for doing such. 50% of your experence would do nicely.<br>
<br>
Or, you could let everyone follow whatever god they choose. If a Darkelf wants to follow Tunare, thats their choice.. good luck getting out of Neriak alive tho.<br>
<br>
Oh well. I'll check it out.<br>
<br>
And you know what? Most people are here crying that they dont want to be straightjacketed by Verant and be forced to Roleplay.<br>
<br>
They gave you the freedom to Roleplay as you felt when they lifted the restructions.<br>

<br>
This would discourage alot of convenience groups like those that form in Oasis and Paludal.  If you came across a group like that, you would think there'd at least be an RP reason strong enough to discredit all that XP that would be getting earned otherwise.<br>
<br>
It'd also let the raiding guilds group together, because they've all told us that most people don't get experience from raids (I'm not discounting it; I've never been 'high end' so I don't know from personal experience).<br>
<br>
So at least the non-rp d00ds will still group with those of their same tendecies because they don't want to lose all that XP, and those of use who do RP won't have our immersion jarred by that paladin / shadowknight group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxvlladx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xVlladx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/17/02 2:58:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2563.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Perfect Alignment Restrictions that Promote Roleplaying</span><hr size=1> The alignment restrictions was Gay.. thank god they got rid of it.. having to invite everyone first than have everyone click ok to get evils grouped with good races was painfully annoying especially if said &quot;Good race person&quot; went Link dead every 15 minutes.. etc...

<br>
The main reason why I joined this server was because it forced you to play one Race/Class to the fullest potential within the game.. without the annoying twinks runnin about without owning a second account at your own expense... Than we just know your obsessed with the game because who in their right mind would go out and buy a second / third account just to have twinks on the server LOL I feel sorry for you birdies...did the Asylum let you out early?  Anyways with that said.. I like the TLC on the server too.. Minus the epic's being TLC too... thats a hassle.. but it adds a nice challenge and depletes the farming of items / helps economy... <br>
