The blood?  The lab was caught contaminating evidence by accident, they sprayed blood all over the room with evidence in the room, the police had a vial of OJ's blood for a day in an officers pocket while he visited OJ's house and all the evidence AND some of the blood was testified to be missing from the vial. ALL make for reasonable doubt. No one saw him at the scene, the only evidence was a glove that was found by an racist officer with a grudge against OJ AFTER the officer had been to the crime scene. The property was illegally entered for a search by said officer before a search warrent was obtained. The socks had such a small amount of blood it was easy to paint it as part of the accident at the lab or from the tampering by a biased police force.<br>
<br>
Again all reasonable doubt. The prosecution was incompetent, the defense made short work of nearly every piece of evidence they presented. It is the responsibility of the Prosecution to PROVE guilt. In this country you are assumed innocent by the system until a JURY convicts you or you plead guilty.<br>
<br>
When enough evidence wasnt present the prosecution magically found OJ's blood on the back gate again after the officer with the vial had been there and a long time after the property was thourghally searched.  All reasonable doubt. <br>
<br>
To bad we cant get a copy of the archive on the trial. If you watched it you would see the Defense make the prosecution look stupid, they managed to refute or taint every piece of evidence the prosection had as either accidently tainted or purposefully tainted.<br>
<br>
The civil trial only required 50 percent  on whether you thought him guilty or not, and the judge refused ANY evidence that could paint the cops as setting up OJ.<br>
<br>
The presuction failed miserably in the case, there was so much reasonable doubt that it took what  3 hours for the jury to unanamousily find him not guilty. Again the onous of proof is on the prosecution. The defense doesnt have to prove anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/24/03 7:23:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/DavidStrange/vamp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scott Peterson - did he do it?</span><hr size=1> jesus Blood have you ever missed an attempt to attack Fox?

Personally I think OJ is innocent.  I think the person who had Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman killed was one of the many drug dealers that she owned cocaine money too.  There was no true &quot;evidence&quot; besides the fact that O.J. ran and plenty of people could understand why he did. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Are you saying that you think OJ is innocent of the crime or that he did it but got away with it?  If you think he did it, then we are not so far in disagreement.  Yes, the police at the scene, at the crime lab, and the prosecution screwed up enough to help in the acquittal.  I disagree that there was enough for reasonable doubt, but that is just my opinion.  <br>
<br>
Now if you think he is innocent, how does that explain the result of the civil suit against him?  And if you are taking this debate completely outside the court of law (since some of this stuff was not even presented in the criminal trial), how do you explain his little jaunt in the Bronco, or the multiple cuts on his hand, or how he claimed to never have owned either the gloves or the shoes that the perp was wearing during the crime, when there were pictures and receipts of him having them?  And exactly how many people would need to be involved to conspire to frame this man?  Each of those people would have been risking thier own lives by framing an innocent man in a potential death penalty case.  What is the motive for that?  Naked Gun 2 &amp; 1/2??<br>
<br>
How about the limo driver that waited patiently for OJ to answer his door that night and saw a finally saw a figure enter the side of the house from the driveway (around the time frame the crimes were committed), right before Simpson finally came to the door?  OJ said he was sleeping and the witness must have been mistaken...go figure.<br>
<br>
And how does his battery of his wife not get admitted into record?<br>
<br>
That is just a small amount of evidence!  Hey, he did it...no doubt about it.  And there was still enough evidence to convict him after they threw out a bunch of it.  Too bad the prosecution was almost as boneheaded as the jury they were trying the case in front of...<br>
<br>
Oh, my favorite part was when you said that nobody saw him at the scene...maybe if he hadn't killed everyone at the scene, that would not have been the case.  Now having said that, you might want to search your records for the name Jill Shively, who positively ID'd OJ in his car in the area of the crime scene around the time the murders occured (when he said he was sleeping).<br>

<br>
Hey, tell me this - not really talking about evidence, but talking about attitude.  OJ was known to be a pretty confident guy right?  Hall of Fame football player, actor, friend of the police (many of whom spent time at OJ's parties, etc).  So if you didn't commit a murder but were being charged for it, and you had plenty of money for good attorneys etc, would you jump in the Bronco (with a disguise and cash) and threaten to kill yourself when the police caught up to you, and possibly leave your children without their mother and father? <br>
<br>
Or would you get severly pissed off, fight the charges to your last breath, get acquitted and make sure the real killers were found? <br>
<br>
Oh that's right, he is doing that last part...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bloodandsin>bloodandsin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.nathanwebb.com/images/blood.jpg width=70 height=185" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 589<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/24/03 8:37:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=342.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nathanwebb.com/images/blood.jpg width=66 height=144></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Scott Peterson - did he do it?</span><hr size=1> Vampiric says,<br>
