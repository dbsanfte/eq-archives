His answer to my concerns about the tone and accuracy of his piece, as well as its questionable social stance, was &quot;My obligation as a news reporter is to find stories that people want to read and to sell newspapers, not to represent things in a way that is beneficial, helpful, or positive.&quot;  He can kiss my ass also.

But, then again, its just a game. And when someone dies who is close to you, you tend to remember that; It's just a game. And a silly game means nothing to those you love who are now lost.<br>

Korzak your whats wrong with the game.  Your the type of person who obviously thinks EQ is so important that someone would fake the death of the only family he has to get hand outs.  Yeah jerkoff, he didn't give anyone his account info because he was too busy having them buried you lowlife.  Don't you think?   Maybe the same thing will happen to you, but oh wait obviously you don't know the diffrence between EQ and RL since you'd prolly log on the day it happened.  Makes me wonder if we'll be watching a story on 60minutes about you, the next person who couldn't seperate RL from EQ.  Your a loser Korzak, both in game and In RL. <br>

Nothing, ANYWHERE in his posts deserved the kind of disgusting, despicable response you gave.  You may have lost all faith and hope in humanity.  You may believe that everyone is lying to you and you can trust no-one. That is your perogative and makes for a very sad, lonely life.  Again, your perogative (and no less than you deserve).

I offer my condolences for your loss and I hope that time will heal your wounds. I am sure that many changes are soon to be upon you both emotionally and physically. I offer these words to you in hopes that your pain does not overwhealm you:<br>
<br>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>
<br>
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
<br>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.<br>
The Road Not Taken <br>

<br>
     In these two posts you have made a derogatory statement towards the original poster as well as implied that the friend robbed him of his belongings. At no point did the poster ask for anything more than advise about how to deal with a situation. You make an assumption about what happened in the situation attacking two people. This assumption is based upon no fact what so ever and is therefore ignorant. <br>
<br>
You later justify your reactions based up upon this post<br>

<br>
     If you go back upon the posts you will see that the only thing that Aailin had stated was that gm’s were useless in the situation. You had insulted both Azindar and Aailin. I think it would be more accurate to ask why are you surprised they acted this way after you insulted them? <br>
<br>

   The details at this point are unknown. You do not know the situation at all and here you look to insult him further. Ignorance again. <br>

   PoSylvinea I would have to disagree with this statement. I think that he wanted to give off this image but I don’t believe it is true. He is proud of the accusation you have given him. The posts against Azindar and Aailin are not ones of pride.<br>
<br>
I think more accurately would be that Korzax is ignorant, paranoia, and needy. <br>
<br>
-Ignorance based upon decisions without any information. <br>
-Paranoia based upon the justification in your attacks. <br>
-Needy based upon the fact that you use a message board soapbox to bring attention to a shallow identity. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
    If the individual here came to the board and began begging for items and then used the excuse that his parents died so we had to equip him I could understand your response and skepticism. He in no way did these things. Frustration was vented due to the situation at hand. Nothing more. You make decisions and accusations based upon nothing but your own insecurities and paranoia in the situation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When someone claims to have lost everything because they couldn't log on, that could mean many different thing..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

   I agree with this. You recognize the fact that without the knowledge of the situation many situations could occur. It surprises me that with this knowledge you still pursue your paranoia.  <br>

   I agree with you here again. You don’t give people the benefit of the doubt. You do the opposite in the situation. You condemn them without knowing the situation and persecute unjustly. So by your definition giving the benifit of the doubt is for chumps, what is the opposite of that?,<br>
Hmm..<br>

<br>
What makes me distrustful of people? In real life, nothing, in game, the endless sob stories of people getting ripped off, and SOE's inability to do anything about it, that's what makes me disbelieve EVERYTHING people say in game and on these boards. I don't trust you, or anyone else for that matter in the game, because I don't know you, all I know is what you type, I can't read your body language, or listen to your voice, so i have no way of discerning whether what you say is the truth, or a lie. And the way I come across may make me seem like an ass, or a jerk, but it's the exact same stance that the people at SOE take, so when someone comes to these boards trying to drum up a little ingame sympathy for their cause because the big bad GM's won't do anything for their toon, I try my best to shed a little reality on the situation. SOE and the GM's are going to treat you like a BIG FAT LIAR when it comes to stories of lost parents being the reason for failure to rez a corpse in time because they have seen the same excuse a number of times. So, we have to go on the facts that present themselves. A person lost all thier stuff on thier toon because it didn't get a rez in time..We have another person blurt some reason out for the failure, and then we have the first person saying that he had asked the second person to not say anything about why he was unable to get to the rez in time..Sorry, but i'll stick to my disbelief. For all I know, person A tells person B to not use his toon, but person B ignores person A's request, uses said toon, and gets it killed. Then fails to notify person A about the death until it's too late, and now person A must ask someone at SOE for a roll back of the toon. SOE will do it, but only for a really good reason..So person A and B come up with a plan..and here we are.<br>

Untill now I can't believe what is going on in this thread, you are not only a lowlife korzax or whatever name you hold in RL, you are sick and need help. I don't know what happened to make you like this, broken home, back stapping partner or just that you were dropped on the head once too many. <br>
<br>
Unlike you I treasure my parents and their memories. You have no respect and deserve non, I wish I can see you in RL so i can show you exactly how I feel about what you have accused me with! Because you will have no idea how much you have made me angry and furious. I never asked for sympathy not from you or from anyone! What the hell are you saying here? my parent death in the same level as EQ ???? far out, how can anyone respond to that!!!!!!, Korzax you son of bitch, how dare you?! God damn you, God damn you, you bastard, whatever i say I just can't say enough. Korzax just stop shitting from your mouth and STFU. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/azindar/sign.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I truly understand your pain in all of this.  I have nothing relevant to add to this, other than I think that the best thing that coul become of this thread is to be locked or kicked to the dead horse file.  I trully hope that you get your gear back in a timely fashion.  All that the butthead wants is to see how high the flames are going to rise.  To see how many of yours and everyone else's buttons he can push.  All we are doing is adding fuel to his fire by rebutting him..... I know that I wish that I could place the meat head on /ignore here, but one can't.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you, and I hope that your pain eases soon!<br>

I am someone that lost both my parents, I had to raise my brother after they died, and I was only 21 living with my future wife and my brother was a teen..  I played video games back then and here is my take on it..<br>
<br>
There are a few very close friends that know my password.  If something was to happen and they knew I couldn't get in game that would take care of shit for me.  I have had stuff go wrong and here is what I have to say..<br>
<br>
I know Korzax in real life and ya he is a heartless bastard, or cetainly comes off like it..  heh  but I must say that when we have needed something, help, or logging in my guys because I wasn't going to be able to make it etc..  He took care of it.  This is the guy that camped the freaking Foci Robe with me for 200+ hrs..  Ya I know it sucks ass today, but back then it was a sweet looking robe.<br>
<br>
I would have to say we don't know what people are like and I too am a little on the reserved side is someone says &quot;Oh I lost my stuff because my parents died&quot;  Shit happens...  I have had it happen to me..  I survived, and so shall they..<br>
<br>
I mean I got rid of my eq accounts and started over on FV, should I bitch to SoE about how I quit to spend sometime in RL doing whatever, and now I feel I should have my Epic CLR/ENC on FV because of &quot;X&quot; happening...  Hell no..  You grow up and make choices..<br>
<br>
If he chose to take care of family stuff and couldn't make a 2 min phone call, he made choices..  Guess I am heartless too, but I have been there..  And I'll tell you this..  If my parents were alive today and they died tomorrow do you think I would give a shit about my stupid EQ accounts?!?  Hell no..  Who gives a shit..  If all my characters were deleted with their epics..  It's a freaking game, full of 1's and 0's..  You play it for entertainment..  It's not a life style.<br>
<br>
He should take care of his parents, get his &quot;house&quot; in order and if he comes back, and he is indeed missing all his 1's and 0's get his friends that know him to farm him some junk, and he can start over.  .  Why can he do this..  because it's a game..  RL is more important 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
If I was SoE I wouldn't give him anything..  Do I believe him sure..  Would K or I help him get some pretty 1's and 0's sure.  <br>
<br>
Life is more important than any game..  no matter how epic your ingame 1's and 0's are..  Guess I am cold and heartless as well..<br>
<br>
