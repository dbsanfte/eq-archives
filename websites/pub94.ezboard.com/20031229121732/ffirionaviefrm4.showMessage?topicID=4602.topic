With a mezzer, he should have been assisting MA and not chain stunning or taunting so as to let MA keep the agro, and not have mob even notice there was anyone in it's sights save the MA.<br>
Then the cleric can heal and chanter can nuke, slow, etc. to their hearts content without fear of drooling- gnashing- swinging mob turning around and trying to slice, dice, and dismember them.<br>
MA's don't like it when people other than themselves (thereby refusing to let them do their jobs) go about taunting and chain stunning. <br>
Especially bad when said taunter/stunner is smirking because *they got the agro off you*.<br>
<br>
I believe this is what I read. <br>
<br>
(Periods, capitals and enter would help,  but I am constantly amazed at how many non-English/American speaking players do such a fine job getting their points across here and in-game. <br>
Even better than those who have it as their first language quite often. So I try not to rag on semantics too much as they might not be *from here or..there, but from over there or there. And isn't that really cooool when you stop to think about it?)<br>

<br>
Let me explain something you little juvenile ass clown, (at best). Five seconds after I join your so called group I am exposed to the all so wonderful in game pleasantries of you saying stfu you pig fucker. Uh huh, pretty much right there I know exactly how this group is going to be. <br>
<br>
As if that weren't enough to get my attention I am then treated to a wonderful ten minute conversation between you and Bryslin that makes me think Im sitting beside two drunk obnoxious Yankee fans whose team is getting whooped by the Expos.<br>
<br>
So after listening to how great you all are and so forth, the fun really starts, we enter the Dungeon and what happens, during the first fight I cast bloody Yaulp on myself and thats enough for the mighty morphine power retard of a warrior to loose aggro. I decide to let him finish off the fight and in the process laugh as everyones health takes a nose dive.<br>
<br>
Then comes the beautiful indecision of half the group yelling stun and the other half yelling do not stun. Next fight comes a caster mob, I wait 20 seconds,......ya.....oh look I casted yaulp again and he lost aggro.....this mob is going to heal himself so out come the stuns.<br>
<br>
Several moments later mob is dead, thanks to being chain stunned and then I get the wonderful input of dumb and dumber telling me not to stun anymore and telling me how I should play my class and so forth.<br>
<br>
Well at that point, I figure...oh hell this is not worth it in the least, so I do the right thing and leave your sorry asses to go join another group, which by the way finished very quickly.<br>
<br>
However, in the meantime I am subjected to more wonderful behavior by my two new best friends vis tells with great colorful language, much like you posted above. The one that really made me laugh though was, and I quote, &quot;I will follow you around from zone to zone every time you are lfg warning people not to team with you.&quot; Wow, if you all have that much time on your hands I feel sorry for you.<br>
<br>
Also, I am on your ignore list!!! Happy day happy day, this coming from the man who was getting laughed at to no end last week for announcing a mgb in pok, single targeting someone then having to say oom and kept everyone waiting...lol and your telling me I need to learn how to play my class (laughs) ok......funny.<br>
<br>
1. I am not an off tank I am a tank, especially if and when the so called main tank can't even keep aggro of Yaulp.<br>
<br>
2. Usually don't have to stun mobs on casters because there are no mobs on casters when I tank and maybe if you demeanor was any better then I would be inclined to maybe assist instead of laugh.<br>
<br>
3. Learn my class? Ya I know it pretty well thanks, most would probably attest to that fact.<br>
<br>
4. Im on a list... I'm on a list...woot.. at least someone cares enough to write my name down!!! Hey, I've avoided you for 65 plus seasons, I think I can survive.<br>
<br>
5. Actually yes I did.<br>
<br>
6. Cry me a river.<br>
<br>
7. My only mistake was not leaving the group like I wanted to the second I saw your name on my screen...(well..ya live and learn)<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.hostmysig.com/data/deathwatch1/dw.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kundow>Kundow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hugs a Tree</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/03 8:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4602.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Deathwatch!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> ....<br>
<br>
/cheers Deathwatch.<br>
<br>
Darrdun is one of the absolute obnoxious people I have ever met in EQ.  He's up there in the &quot;Worst Clerics I have ever met&quot; category.  These include Bendora, who likes to melee and nuke instead of heal, and Azoziss, who was damn right determined that casting Annul on a mob would keep it from summoning....and didn't heal, because he was too busy casting Annul to keep from getting summoned when he sat down.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
Darrdun, in my experience, never learned that if you sit down right after a heal, the mob is going to come after you.  So, when this would occur, he would beat the holy living fucking shit out of hit dumbassed &quot;CLERIC UNDER ATTACK&quot; hotkey.<br>
<br>
Yes, this dumb fuck actually does have one of those.  And he uses it a lot. Because he sucks gnat nuts.<br>
<br>
So, for certain a moronic Dwarven Cleric...Stuns cause a shitload of aggro.  Now, if Deathwatch was pulling aggro off your half-bit tank by casting Yalp on himself, he most likely saved all your asses from a pesky CR with the stuns. I can understand him Stunning to save your hide, the Enchanters hide, the Warriors hide, and most importantly, his own.  You see, Mez is a stun as well.  Mez causes a rather absurd amount of aggro.  Ya gotta counteract that, or else your Enchanter is gonna get smeared all over the place.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and it's spelled &quot;fucking&quot; not &quot;facking&quot;,  you fucker.  I suggest you politely ask Mr. Yantis for a refund on your 65 Cleric, and go do something more productive with your time.  Like get a castration. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kundow>Kundow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hugs a Tree</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/03 8:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4602.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Deathwatch!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> Sonova...this was supposed to read <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Darrdun is one of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> absolute obnoxious people <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  I forget words when I should be asleep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As stated, when I saw his name in the group I wanted to leave right then and there but figured I would give him the benefit of the doubt and therein I should flame myself.<br>
<br>
I will be the first to admit, in the past I had somewhat of an attitude in the game and never really thought about my words or actions until one day I swore freely in chat and someone explained tome that their young son was watching what he was doing and thus he was forced to ask his son to leave the room. Since that day I have tried to keep myself in check and drop the whole attitude thing because it is not worth it nor is it fair to others.<br>
<br>
It was not in so much as his actual behavior once the timer started that got on my nerves it was the language and attitude while waiting to get underway that really got to me. With that being said, there is no way that little turd is going to come in here and try to flame me and not hear about it.....no way!!!<br>
<br>
For the record, when a Pally has 7.2k hp and 1553 ac opposed to a warrior with 8.1k ac and 1401 ac, I think most people would instantly let the Pally tank.<br>

Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word ‘Fack’. <br>
Out of all the English words that begin with the letter F, ‘Fack’ is the only word referred to as ‘The F word.’<br>
It’s the one magical word that just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. <br>
‘Fack,’ as most words in the English language, is derived from German. <br>
The word ‘Flacken’ which means ‘To strike’. <br>
In English, ‘Fack’ falls into many grammatical categories. <br>
As a transitive verb for instance, “John Facked Shirley,” as an intransitive verb, “Shirley Facks.” <br>
It’s meaning is not always sexual. <br>
It can be used as an adjective such as, “John’s doing all the Facking work.” <br>
As part of an adverb, “Shirley talks too Facking much.” <br>
As an adverb enhancing an adjective, “Shirley is Facking beautiful.” <br>
As the object of an adverb, “Shirley is Facking beautifully.” <br>
As a noun, “I don’t give a Fack.” <br>
As part of a word, “Abso-Facking-lutly” or “In-Facking-credible.” <br>
And as almost every work in a sentence, “Fack the Facking Fackers.” <br>
As you may realise, there are very few words with the versatility of ‘Fack.’<br>
As in these examples describing situations such as, Fraud: “I got Facked at the used car lot.” <br>
Dismay: “Aww, Fack it,” trouble: “I guess I’m really Facked now.” <br>
Aggression: “Don’t Fack with me buddy.” <br>
Difficulty: “I don’t understand this Facking question.” <br>
Inquiry: “Who the Fack was that.” <br>
Dissatisfaction: “I don’t like what the Fack is going on here.”<br>
Incompetence: “He’s a Fack off.” <br>
Dismissal: “Why don’t you go outside and play hide and go Fack yourself.?” <br>
I’m sure you can think of many more examples. <br>
With all of these multipurpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use this word? <br>
We say use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech. <br>
It will identify the quality of your character immediately, so say it loudly and proudly, Fack You<br>

You are not defenseless in the slightest.  Here is a list, study it well :<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What a cleric can do when they have aggro (especially 65s) :</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. Stand your ground.  You are a plate class, if you were dilligent in making your character your defense skill should be maxxed.  That being said you should be able to take a few hits while the tank re-aggros the mob.<br>
<br>
2. You have a Greater Immobilize takes 1.8 seconds to cast, use it. (thats Root for you e-Bayers)  Lower level clerics have a bit longer cast time on root.  Regardless, root is your friend.<br>
<br>
3. You have stuns too!  Yeah!  Go figure!  You yourself can stun a mob, back off and refer to #2 above.  Woot!<br>
<br>
4. Spell : Atone.  Lowers your position on the mobs aggro list, occasionally making it forget about you completely.<br>
<br>
5. Get a Drogmor/Horse if you're doing PoP zones for xp.  No aggro from sitting is your friend too.  This will save you alot of aggrivation and the cheap one is really not that expensive.  Whore yourself for buffs in POK for a week and you'll have enough easy.<br>
<br>
6. When all else fails, Divine Aura/Barrier.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Some other helpful hints :</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
-  Lose the fucking hotkey.  Nothing annoys a group more than some douchebag slamming on a &quot;HELP ME!&quot; hotkey.  If you have THAT many problems with your groups, maybe its time to look in the mirror cause it's probably YOU that's causing them.  I've been a PoP level cleric for a LONG time and I very very very rarely get aggro in an XP group regardless of what zone I'm in and how crappy the group is.  <br>
<br>
-  Know your spells.  Know which ones cause alot of aggro and which ones don't.  Heal-over-time spells generate almost no aggro whatsoever.  Therefore if you throw one on your MT when the mob is incoming, not only will it buy you time before you have to CH, but it'll negate alot of the pre-slow damage.<br>
<br>
-  Don't run around like an idiot when you do get aggro.  This is the oldest rule in the book for casters.  Follow it to the letter.<br>
<br>
<br>
This'll probably all fall on deaf ears but I was in the mood to type LOL<br>
<br>
Oh yeah one more thing, follow Kundow's advice too : <br>

<br>
&quot;4 you have been put on a large amount of people /ignore/never group with list&quot;<br>
<br>
If any person on this server has made it to MORE people's /ignore/never group with list than anyone else it is you.  Even more so than some of the greatest asshats this server has ever seen.  They may have been asshats but they at least had an inkling of how to play their character properly.<br>
<br>
You are the WORST CLERIC I have ever known.  Your constant WHINING is pathetic.  You were the FIRST and ONLY person to ever make it on my IGNORE LIST with not 1 but 2 of my characters for completely different reasons!!!  Add this in with your complete INABILITY to play your class and you can see why a lot of people DO NOT LIKE YOU.  I remember being in a guild with you and even your own guildmembers would take ANY OTHER HEALER (including a Ranger one time) before they took you for groups.  Raids were called off because you were the 3rd Healer and everyone knew that you couldn't handle even that position.  The only reason you ever made it to the high end game is because newer raid guilds needed clerics and they PL'd you.  I know - I was there...<br>
<br>
It's time you rerolled as a Paladin - as your sig has suggested many times in the past or buy a clue and really learn how to play your class.<br>
<br>
I generally do not flame people but You are definately today's <br>
exception.<br>
