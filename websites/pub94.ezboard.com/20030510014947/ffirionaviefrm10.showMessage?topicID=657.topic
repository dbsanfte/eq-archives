Kelisk watched from the old balcony of Kurn's tower as a lumbering Burynai threw itself onto a young wolf in the field below, tearing its claws into flesh and bone and scale.  Survival of the fittest was the law in the wilds of Kunark, and offenders-like the wolf-paid a dear price.  So it had been for thousands of years, ever since the first primitive beasts had drunk in the air of its shores, before the God-chosen races were seeded across the lands, and so it was now.  The cycle went ever on and on, a constant reminder of the fleetingness of life, especially in these barren wastes.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
  <br>
Kelisk pulled his grappling hook and rope up next to him and aimed to throw at the next highest balcony.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Burynai had barely sunk its teeth into its kill before the ripping pain of a Scourgetail scorpion's sting tore into its back.  It shrieked once, sensing the last grains of its time slip away, and let out a final gurgling growl as the Scorpion withdrew its sting, spilling blood across the parched ground.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kelisk threw the hook twice, missing by inches both times, then re-steadied his grip and threw again, catching the hook on a stone railing.  He tugged at the line to test its hold and, once satisfied, swung out onto the wall and begun to climb.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>From the field came the charging cry of two young warriors of Cabilis as they ran at the Scourgetail, their blades glinting in the hot sunlight for just seconds before tearing into the chitin of the monstrous arachnid.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He'd passed two more balconies, and Kelisk was one climb from the roof of the ancient tower.  He set down his packs and took a long draw of Bloodwater from a flask at his belt, then stopped to gaze around the small platform.  Like the others, there was a door to the inner tower, and like the others, it was long since sealed with magics too powerful for him to break.  He'd often wondered what lay in the upper floors of the tower: none had passed the barriers at the fifth floor since many years before his hatching.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Looking down, he could just make out the tiny forms of the two young warriors cheering over the massive Scorpion's husk.  But as they sat to rest, a savage Stalker of one of the scaled wolf packs creeped behind them, preparing to pounce. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kelisk twirled his arms in the air in intricate motions, whispering incantations in a tongue lost to all but the Mystics and Patriarchs of Cabilis.  As if from nowhere, jagged spears of ice began to form over his head, condensing from what little moisture the air held. With a swift motion, he sent the spears careening down at the Stalker.  It let out a pitiful yelp as the huge shards pinned it, still living, to the dirt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sometimes, the cycle had to be interrupted.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He spun the hook in the air a final time and threw it, snagging it on the battlements of the tower.  After ensuring that a small leather pouch on his back was secure he made the final ascent and pulled himself onto the roof, where a fire and a tent waited for him.  He'd camped here for six days now, having found the place to somehow ward away the dreams.  A bizarre irony, he recognized, that a tower pf death should bring him peace!<br>
&quot;But if it works...&quot; he muttered to himself.  He peered into a small pot boiling over the fire and ladled out a mouthful of rabbit stew, tasting it delicately.  It wasn't quite done, but Kelisk would have eaten it cold, so was his appetite.  <br>
<br>
When he had slurped the last drops of the stew, he walked to the edge and squinted down to the base of the tower, straining to see movement in the fading light.  He fixed his eyes on a form on the ramp to the tower's main entrance, which by its colors was unmistakably a Bandit of the Forsaken.  After gauging its position as best he could with his eyes, he flung the pot down, and grinned as it rang off of the bandit's head with a hollow crack.  It felt strange to Kelisk to smile, lately.  He shrugged and walked back to the center of the roof.<br>
<br>
Next, he fixed the tent so that it was pitched over the fire, and the smoke filled it quickly, billowing out of the small chimneyhole in a stream that rose high into the evening sky.  Kelisk stripped off all of his armor and ducked inside in only his basic wraps.  The smoke flooded his eyes and lungs, burning him inside, and Kelisk did all he could to crouch next to the fire in the tent-turned oven and take the small pouch from his back, setting it next to him.  From inside, he pulled a handful of white powder and crushed leaves of some sort.  The Prime Hierophant of Cabilis would be annoyed to find some of this mixture gone, but Kelisk found it an acceptable risk.  He sifted it through his hands for a moment, then tossed it into the flames.  For a moment they glowed white, then they faded to a shimmering black and slowed, so that they moved visibly, slowly, like a dream.  The last of their smoke flowed out of the tent, and Kelisk took a deep breath of the cold fresh air.<br>
<br>
Then he reached back into the pouch and closed his hand on something larger than his hand, and hard as stone.  He pulled it out and gazed at it, turning it in his claws. It was the half-rotted skull of the Hierophant Zildrax Shathrais. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelisk>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil<br>Look out! ...Rar!<br>New lizard Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 864<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/03 6:46:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/CyrusVI/fullsize/keliskpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning</span><hr size=1> The fire churned before Kelisk angrily, as if awaiting some vital need that he had clumsily delayed. It was only too correct, though. The skull was here... the fire sensed it, felt it, tasted the traces of the spirit that had departed it not too long ago. It was no longer a simple flame, but something alive, and it was hungry. <br>
<br>
Kelisk looked closer at the hollow head and squinted his eyes, imagining the pale grey of the scales over the orange eyes that had held wisdom and pride, sadness and anger. He put the tip of a claw to his tongue and then placed it on the cold forehead of the skull, slowly dragging it over the exposed bone, scratching an intricate rune in its surface. He'd have never imagined before that his skill in carving bone would be useful--he'd scratched many things into the slaves of Ifrinn's skeletal slaves before for amusement, but this was hardly amusing. If he made the slightest error, it could not be done again. So, he would not. He carefully snapped a dry scale from the rotting flesh still hanging from the bone, and ran its edge over the lines of the rune, crumbling it into the grooves. There... perfect. Or so he hoped. There was nothing he could do about it now, though. He continued the strange ritual.<br>
<br>
Thrusting the skull into the air to catch the last cold rays of the sun as it sunk below the horizon, Kelisk shouted into the air loudly, his voice reaching out across the field. It had to be strong. Confident. And so, Kelisk put more breath into it as he stared into the sockets of Zildrax's eyes. On the ground below, several creatures and broodlings looked about for the source of the strange, faint voice, but could not determine its whereabouts. Not that Kelisk would have cared if they had. It was too late to worry about being found out. He moved his lips and tongue as he belted his voice out, chanting in a tongue known to few but the Iksar spiritists, and then threw his hands down, sending the skull flying into the flames, which caught it softly and began to ooze around it as if to caress its form. <br>
<br>
Kelisk leaped back onto the battlement and contorted his body in the ancient dance that he had prepared himself for, swooping his arms and tail in wide circles and jerking his head in all directions as he spun dangerously on the edge of the tower roof. Finally, he tossed his head back loosely and pulled his arms back to his chest, gathering spiritual mana from all around him, surrounding himself with it, burning in the pain of its energy until it completely enveloped him. Then, he pushed his arms forward quickly and it flowed from him into the fire. <br>
<br>
The skull was released from the black ooze of the flames and spun into the air, sparks flying in all directions from its surface. The mana mingled with the flames for a moment, then took them in, the two energies becoming one as they began to take shape. Legs grew from the mass of energy, and arms, and the rest, until a blurry humanoid mass stood several feet in the air, the skull suspended in the lump that might be a head. As it stopped spinning to fae toward Kelisk, the body rapidly defined itself: the pudgy lumps grew smoother and thinner, giving the appearance of smooth muscles and flesh, which became crossed with bumps like scales. The toes and fingers seperated and the tips sharpened to become claws. The tail became long and pointed, and the head grew a snout and rows of spines. As Kelisk watched, the shape became an Iksar. Lastly, transparent threads and materials seemed to weave themselves around the body: a thick belt and long flowing cloth spun themselves over the waist and leather and bone clung to its chest and shoulders. Then, the ghostly figure, roughly one and one half times Kelisk's size, was complete, its eyes unfocused and its head rolling slowly on its shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Zildrax?&quot; Kelisk whispered, stepping cautiously onto the flat roof.<br>
<br>
The head slowly stopped and looked up, tilted curiously to one side. Its eyes glowed a dull orange.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zildrax>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 676<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/03 9:35:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning</span><hr size=1> He had never felt so serene, so empty, so untouched and unaffected by any and everything. There were no sounds, no images, no sensations…just endless emptiness and nothingness, he might have been bored, but emotions, too, were no longer there. Just a faint sensation of peace. Was this death? He almost wondered, but the desire to know the answer was lacking, and the question faded away. It seemed to last an eternity, this empty quietness, almost like a dream, but far more enveloping. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, in the distance, he heard the faintest of noises. A whisper, perhaps the wind, passing from one place to the next, but it was enough to disturb his spirit. To break the endless serenity, to remind him of the other world. He was restless now, he did not want to be here. He wasn’t conscious, his thoughts wouldn’t take shape or come together in any sensible manner, but now he longed to be alongside his people. Not here. He did not want to spend eternity asleep in this place, no, it was selfish and wasteful of his spirit to be here. He longed to suffer alongside his people, to aid them in whatever way he could, or even to watch futilely as they fought to their doom. Anything besides, this. <br>
<br>
He heard the whisper again now, this time louder. He attempted to look around for where it was coming from but found he had no body, no eyes, and nowhere to look. But he felt something calling him, and he longed to follow it’s faint voice. But how can he follow a voice coming from no direction, when he has no form? A unusual dilemma, indeed, he thought. Again, he heard the unintelligible whisper , this time much louder, and this time it awoke his memories. He remembered what he looked like, what it was like to feel, it came flowing back into his mind, and he felt himself being pulled away from the serene, empty place. Colors and shapes swirled around him, blurry and distorted, his memories and emotions coming back all at once. He felt as if he was awakening from a thousand dreams and being torn through all of them. Then, the dream broke. In a horrifying shriek of anguish and pain, the empty, serene world shattered with a brilliant flash of light. <br>
<br>
He was conscious now, he thought, but he felt strange. It was not as he remembered, and yet, it seemed very familiar. Everything he saw was distorted, and yet it was slowly taking shape. Around him, he heard endless whispers and voices, the voices of spirits. The wind, the earth, the dead, and countless others. Perhaps if he was alive, the voices would have driven him insane, but now, they didn’t bother him at all. His own form took shape, and he gazed at himself, right through himself. He seemed to be transparent now, but he still held the shape of an Iksar, thankfully. Perhaps it was just from memory or desire he held this shape currently, but nonetheless, he was proud of it. <br>
<br>
He turned his eyes upwards, into the bright, blurry world. It looked very familiar, it was at the top of Kurn’s Tower. And yet things…looked different. He saw things that he knew he hadn’t seen before, he could see the spirits and the effects they had on this place. He could feel their emotions and their thoughts, and while they were confusing, each second they seemed to become more clear. Looking past them, he saw another, one who’s spirit was still bound to a form of the living. He looked at it curiously, trying to focus his gaze and discern who it was. He had not quite adjusted to this new form. <br>
<br>
“…Zildrax?” The live bound one said, and he recognized the voice, as well as his own name. It was Kelisk. The world became much clearer and sharper now, and for the moment he blocked the other spirits from sight, focusing entirely on his old friend.<br>

But, while Kelisk had success on that front, on another, he was being tracked, and would soon answer for his illegal actions.  Time was short, and yet no words came to him.  Zildrax's spirit opened its mouth slowly, becoming familiar again to the action, and at first its voice was a barely audible whisper on the winds.  Kelisk strained himself to hear it, and it seemed to grow stronger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kelisk...? What...exactly, is going on?&quot;  The words weren't quite what Kelisk would have expected from a just-resurrected spirit.  Still disbelieving in the reality of the moment, he took a cautious step forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Zildrax Shathrais?&quot;<br>
<br>
The spirit nodded slowly. &quot;Yes, it's me, or was me. I am not sure what I am now...&quot; It turned its head in confusion to take in its surroundings and assess its situation for a moment, then returned focus to Kelisk, who was beginning to regain some sense of composure.<br>
<br>
&quot;You... are truly here?&quot;  The spirit looked itself over in response to Kelisk's question, nodding in confirmation.<br>
<br>
&quot;In some way or form, it would appear so.  What is going on here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are dead...&quot;  As Kelisk muttered the words, he realized the futility of his crime.  Zildrax was indeed dead, no more, immaterial.  An idea, a thought, even a mind, but nothing more.  The possibility that he could help was slim.  Still, Kelisk reasoned, he must make his minutes left here count.<br>
<br>
&quot;I seem to have... brought you back... you are on Norrath again.&quot;  Zildrax's spirit raised an eye curiously.<br>
<br>
&quot;You brought me back? I had no idea you were taught such rituals. Although, I, ah...do not know how long I have been deceased.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It has been only months. And, Zildrax... I am not taught anything near this power.&quot;  The mystics were in the field now.  Kelisk peered over the edge of the roof, counting two nervous looking petitioners and a regular mystic, female by her colors, headed in the direction of the tower.  He would need to make haste, more so than he'd thought-the mystic would sense the power still remaining.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, for once, I am glad you bent the rules. I owe you now, Kelisk, and I thank you for bringing me back. I felt, so...&quot; Zildrax seemed to hesitate, searching himself for the right words.  &quot;It was quiet, and peaceful, and I'd never felt so serene in my life. Yet, I utterly hated it. It was as if-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Prime Hierophant will have noticed the tear in the spiritual plane by now.  I'll be found soon,&quot; Kelisk interrupted, his voice taking on a sense of urgency.  The spirit nodded compliantly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then I am a spirit, I assume,&quot; it said ponderously.  With a brief bow, it added, &quot;You have my utmost thanks, Kelisk, and I will do what I can to make sure you are not punished.  Until the time comes for that, I will gladly speak of any subject you like.&quot;  Kelisk opened his mouth to speak, but found that he had no idea what he wanted to say.  He had not summoned Zildrax for help, or for power.  He racked his brain for a reason, but found none, and so decided to present the problem and seek an answer later.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am being punished for... something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Punished? What do you speak of?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Zildrax, you recall, in your last days, that I showed you the Globe of Fear?  The one I thought to hold some of our Lord's powers?&quot;  He waited for a moment as Zildrax thought, then continued hesitantly.  &quot;Ifrinn, Krost and I... Shattered the globe, Zildrax.&quot;  If Zildrax could have drawn a breath in his spiritual form, he would have now.  His eyes closed for a moment, and the slightest sound of a hiss escaped his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hrn...and what happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelisk crossed his arms and stared at the cracked stone beneath him, remembering.  &quot;A great pain... I was blinded with it. And since that evening, terrible visions... No, nightmares, have plagued me each moment I sleep.  I have gone for days-even a week at a time without resting because of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zildrax frowned, nodding, and ventured, &quot;Kelisk, what did you think when you broke the orb?&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Kelisk could answer, a scaled hand appeared at the edge of the roof, wearing the signature beaded gloves of the Temple of Terror, and its owner began to pull itself up to face the scene. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/03 2:46:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning</span><hr size=1> OOC: I'm really enjoying this story.

<br>
The candles set at regular intervals around the small room cast odd shadows on the walls, flickering erratically. Its spartan furnishings were plain and functional, a small desk, a few bookshelves, a row of jars occupying other shelves in which floated various flesh pieces, a large sink... and a large metal table in its center.<br>
<br>
A small female stood before the table, a metal instrument vaguely resembling a hook in hand. She remained still a few moments, lost in thought, the instrument forgotten, as thick drying blood slowly followed the curb of the tool, down its length. She consulted a book on the adjoining desk, ever so careful of its precious pages, then turned back to the table. She discarded the tool in the neat pile of them by her, chose another as an apprentice dutifully cleaned and sorted them at the sink. From the long years of room's use, the heavy scent of blood and decay was thick, seeped into every corner, blanketed every creature.<br>
<br>
Ifrinn lowered her gaze to the table's diminutive occupant. A gnome had had the unfortunate distinction of being chosen tonight. He had hours ago stopped struggling against the restraints, and stared numbly at the ceiling. A faint whimpering still occasionally escaped his pale lips, his chest cavity partially exposed as the Iksar performed research on the hapless creature. Her art and the Brood that studied it demanded a deep knowledge of anatomy to better serve the Empire. How else to inspire their lord's Fear, to crush his enemies, to plague the lesser races with diseases and poisons, to make their weak hearts explode? All of her life had been spent in this tower, studying the brood's gift to the Empire, and now researching in the tower's dungeons to advance their knowledge.<br>
<br>
The flames suddenly flickered wildly again, went out. Sighing irritably, Ifrinn turned to the profile of the apprentice assisting her, barely visible in the dark. &quot;I TOLD you to keep the upper hallway door closed, else the breeze gutters the candles! go remedy that! Or find some oil lamps!&quot; The young male bowed quickly and scurried off.<br>
<br>
Sighing again, she turned back to the desk and stared at where she guessed the book was, its shape completely lost in the darkness. To notice a very faint greenish glow emanating from her own robes. Frowning slightly, she wiped her bloody claws on a rag, then retrieved a small pouch she kept hidden in an inner pocket of her robes. Opening it with care, the eerie green light suddenly filled the small room. The Nihilist poured the five small gems from the pouch into her hand, and stared at them for some time, her subject forgotten. &quot;what could this mean...&quot; she asked the blank walls, her eyeridges knotted in consternation.<br>
<br>
Her memories went back to that difficult day, the last time Hierophant Zildrax had been seen in the city. She had answered his private beckons, crossing the city to meet him in his office, in the Temple's depths. Smiling faintly, he had given her those five green gems... the magics imbuing them was famliar enough, though still beyond her own powers at the time... they contained a bit of his essence, his soul some said, trapped within, to be used by her caste in their magics. Soft skins were often captured and sacrificed in droves to the great Cazic-Thule, to fuel these gems, their essence trapped in them until needed. She had never heard of an Iksar submitting himself to this exacting ritual.<br>
<br>
Ifrinn had stared blankly at the wise and respected male, his features still not showing the ravages of disease. Understanding came to her eyes. He had simply nodded, closed her hand around the gems, whispering &quot;a gift to you and the Empire. I know you'll put them to good use some day.&quot; A dozen protests had immediately surged to mind, but none seemed fitting, so she had just nodded in muted silence, words failing her. The proud Hierophant had muttered some vague excuse about other preparations and left the room. She had stood there stunned for long minutes, before leaving the Temple.<br>
<br>
The door to the room opened suddenly, bringing Ifrinn out of the reverie. The broodling dashed about the room, replacing and lighting the candles. She replaced the gems to their pocket, then turned to him. &quot;I must go investigate something. Keep the soft skin fresh until I return.&quot; He nodded and bowed, as she left the room and travelled the dank halls of the tower dungeon. Reaching her own small chambers up in the tower proper, she grabbed her well used travel gear, tucked her personal tattered book in her robes, and closed the room before her. She bowed respectfully as always to Master Kyvix by the tower entrance, mumbled something about an investigation. The old Master, used to her eccentricities, merely nodded. She started walking with conviction to the Temple at the other end of the great city, questions for the Hierophants.<br>

Probably a Forsaken Mystic messing with the spirits to annoy the Empire, he thought to himself, as he looked up prepared to slay whatever pest was before him.<br>
<br>
“Ke…Kelisk!?” Dexl said in surprise as he looked at the Chancellor of the Skathris Ven’Sho and the spiritual form behind him. This certainly wasn’t what Dexl was expecting, but quickly remembering some of the things he’d heard about Kelisk Mae’Lohk, it wasn’t all that surprising either. <br>
<br>
“What have you done!? By Thule if you don’t have a good explanation for this I’ll personally throw you in the pit!! The entire Temple is out searching for what caused that rift, I should have guessed it was YOU!” Dexl screamed angrily, he was not known for being one of the more quiet or understanding mystics. <br>
<br>
“It’s nice to see you again, Dexl.” The spiritual form behind Kelisk said calmly, his voice sounding distant and eerie, as if the wind itself was speaking. It slowly stepped forward, while it’s feet touched the ground, it didn’t really seem as if it was walking on the surface. <br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Dexl said, shifting his weight back nervously as the spirit mentioned his name, his hand moving toward his cudgel. The transparent spirit was blurry and strange, but it was clearly an Iksar. As it approached him, the features become more apparent. The pattern of the scales, the arrangement of the spines on the back of his head, the size and shape of his snout, Dexl recognized him now, but he couldn’t quite believe it. <br>
<br>
“Zildrax…?” He took a step back, surprised to see the late Hierophant he had once shared a room with in the Temple, however, he was already standing on the edge of the tower, and as he attempted to place his foot on the non-existent ground, Dexl slipped off the edge and fell. He quickly scrambled and managed to grab hold of the ledge, although he was barely able to hold on. Looking down and seeing a familiar female Mystic a short ways down the rope he had used to climb up, he screamed down at her.<br>
<br>
“Mystic Skaska, quit playing with that piece of string and help me up this instant!!!”<br>
<br>
Zildrax rubbed his head nervously, looking back at Kelisk with a slightly worried expression on his ethereal face. “I see things haven’t changed too much…” He said, with a slight smile.<br>

<br>
Skaska was nearly to the top of the tower and could hear Dexl's ranting...and another much fainter voice. She paused to try and hear what the other voice was saying, then startled and looked up as Dexl slipped off the edge of the tower roof.<br>
<br>
Frozen for a startled moment, Dexl's harsh words finally broke her shock. She took a second to wrap the rope around one leg to keep from sinking away, then pulled a batwing from the pouch at her waist and began casting levitation for the Hierophant.<br>
<br>
When the spell finished and the Hierophant's form lightened considerably, Skaska breathed a faint sigh of relief then yelped in surprise as her own levitation spell faded out. The rope supporting her snapped taut from the sudden weight and she lost the insufficient hold on the rope. She smacked into the tower wall and scrabbled to find a handhold, the rope waving out of her reach.<br>
<br>
Now she was the one just barely clinging to the Tower. However, unlike the Hierophant, she didn't promptly yell out for someone to assist her, instead she poured all of her concentration into not losing her grip on the thin seam between the stones of the wall. She thought a silent prayer to Cazic-Thule, offering him her fear of falling even as the fear kept her from opening her eyes and looking up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elyta@firionavie>Elyta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ask about my bunny<br>

Behind him was Zildrax Shathrais, hierophant of the mystics, reborn into a spirit's wraith by Kelisk's own doing. But something had gone rather unexpectedly wrong. In Zildrax's return, a tear opened in the fabric that separated the spiritual realm from that of the Mortals. Such a tear could be fatal for the one who opened it. Worse, such a tear could be disastrous for the fate of The Empire. Not even one in such high standing as Kelisk Mae'Lokh could escape punishment from that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
He stood paralyzed with indecision a moment more, then time seemed to slow ad his mind set itself. Each step he took seemed to require such effort that he thought the next might not be within his power. He passed Dexl without so much as a look at his face. It seemed that Dexl didn't see him either, trapped in time as he was, frozen in anger and frustration. For a reason he didn't know, he stopped at the edge for a moment and waved his arms instinctively, sending a levitation enhancement blindly down the side of the tower wall.<br>
<br>
Then, for the second time that day and the second time he could remember, Kelisk defied the Empire of his own will. For the very first time in his life, fear had won over Kelisk's senses. Time resumed its harsh speed, and he leapt to one low parapet of the tower's edge, tensed his muscles, and sprang out into the open air. Though his feet gripped nothing, he ran as feverishly as his body would allow, levitation taking its own gentle hold on him. Muscles burning, he sprinted toward the open sea. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112815"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zildrax>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 698<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/19/03 10:04:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning</span><hr size=1> Dexl pulled himself up with the help of Skaska’s levitation spell, cursing and mumbling under his breath the whole time. He pulled himself and stood facing Kelisk and what he now assumed was Zildrax’s spirit. With a angry heave, he took a step forward, only to see Kelisk suddenly dash past him and cast a levitation spell. Before Dexl could respond to Kelisk’s actions, he lept from the tower, and started running. Confused, Dexl turned to Zildrax.<br>
<br>
Zildrax watched as Kelisk ran, he understood why he was running, he could feel it. <br>
<br>
“Where does he think he’s going!?” Dexl shouted at the spirit. Zildrax turned and faced Dexl coldly, Dexl’s face of anger turning to one of unease, having never been face to face with an Iksar spirit this close, especially not one he knew personally in life. <br>
<br>
“I do not think he knows, Dexl.” Zildrax spoke softly, as if he felt guilty about something. <br>
<br>
“Does he think he can evade punishment for this? Hah! We’ll hunt him down if we have too!” Dexl said with both anger and determination. <br>
<br>
Zildrax looked down at the ground, and slid his eyes toward the figure of Kelisk running away, getting ever more distant. <br>
<br>
“Dexl, please, go easy on him. He did not mean to do any harm, and…now I owe him. Who knows how long I would have slept if not for him.” <br>
<br>
Dexl shook his head. “You of all Iksar should understand that he must be punished for this! If the ritual itself doesn’t end up killing him in short order. Awakening a spirit prematurely is dangerous, they are still attached to this world.”<br>
<br>
Dexl was right of course. Zildrax was still very attached to this world, and he likely always would be. He pondered if this made him more like the wandering undead and less like the spirits the Iksar typically revered. But he wasn’t unhappy about this, he was glad to see a world he knew, the same world he’d lived in. It might have been hundreds of years before he awoke normally, and then, indeed, he would feel very separate from the world, it being one he did not recognize. Kelisk had torn him from the spirit realm, right through the very fabric that separate the two realms. He was grateful to the chancellor of the Skathris, but he too feared what damage it may have done, or may yet do.<br>
<br>
“I will go after him, Dexl. I am asking you both as a spirit and an Iksar to be lenient to Kelisk…I will do everything I can to rectify any damage he’s done. And, Dexl, Skaska is about to fall, you had better help her.” <br>
<br>
Zildrax faded out of existence before Dexl could reply, leaving him standing there dumbfounded. He turned around to see Skaska hanging on for dear life, and quickly chanted a levitation spell and cast it on her, looking a tad embarrassed. He then turned his gaze toward the fleeing Kelisk. Be lenient? Such words were horribly uncharacteristic of the Hierophant Zildrax he had known, but as he thought about it, it wasn’t so far fetched. When Zildrax had left the Empire to die he had felt it was the last he would ever see of it, or it’s inhabitants. But because of Kelisk he was able to see it again, and can continue to serve it, in a way. <br>
<br>
“Alright, Zildrax, I’ll try and get his punishment to be a bit more lenient, but no promises…”<br>
<br>
Zildrax wasn’t particularly used to traveling like this. He wanted to just run after Kelisk, and he tried, but it felt so weird. His body was weightless and empty, and he wasn’t bound by mortal restrictions anymore. Although exactly how he moved around was a bit of a mystery to him. He willed himself to go towards Kelisk, and in short order found himself floating alongside the fleeing beastlord. While Kelisk was running, Zildrax was casually walking now, if only out of old habit, and keeping up with him completely. <br>
<br>
“Kelisk, stop running…you have nowhere to go, and your fleeing from the very thing that you summoned me to help you with, aren’t you?”  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=657.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=657.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=657.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=657.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=657.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
