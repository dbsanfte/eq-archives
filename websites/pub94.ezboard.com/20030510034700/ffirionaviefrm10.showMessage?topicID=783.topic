Dressed in dark red robes with a hood completely covering his features, he walked with his hands together in front of him, taking a long, slow stride with each step. His body language showing he was deep in thought. Another apprentice of the Dismal Rage was killed by a Steel Warrior loyal to Marr. To Daon, normally this would mean nothing beyond the need to avenge out of loyalty, not compassion. Daon only cared for himself. Usually.<br>
<br>
This was a special situation. The apprentice of the Dismal Rage that was killed, was an unusually skilled young Magician. Also an exceptionally independent, young woman. A young woman who was, from time to time, Daon's lover. Not &quot;Lover&quot; in the emotional sense. No &quot;Love&quot; sang by Bards in taverns, to keep happy couples warm at night. &quot;Lovers&quot; in a more physical sense. Despite his relentless studies in dark secrets. Despite his constant exercise to keep up his health and strength, Daon was still a man like many men. He had his own needs, as did the young woman who studied the art of Magicians. He had been attracted to her inner strength. Her intelligence. That made Daon look away from his studies to notice her exceptional beauty. <br>
Now she was dead. Daon felt a strange sense of loss. An emptiness that grew with the pain he felt from another lifetime. A &quot;memory&quot; of a woman he could &quot;feel&quot; but not remember. He knew he never shared his past life with this...mystery woman. Yet a pain haunted Daon at odd times when he was alone. Now the pain mingled with the loss of the apprentice he respected and shared his bed with.<br>
Daon slowly walked out of the tunnels and into the sunlight. Looking.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere, in the Western Commonlands. A young Shadowknight, recently achieving his Ninth Season, practiced his new skills in Necromantic Arts with a hunger. He was determined to be the best he could be in the Dismal Rage. He was a &quot;Chosen One&quot;. Nearly immortal. Death only made him shed his old form like a snake skin, to be reborn again. The &quot;unkillable&quot; enemy. Death could only hold &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; if their will to live stopped. Other wise they would live forever. And forever, was what the Shadowknight looked forward to. Dark dreams and dark glory. Women to want and treasure to take.<br>
As the Shadowknight finished his practice, becoming as skilled as he could be for his Season, he walked along the deep green of the Western Commonlands. He enjoyed the feel of the cool wind that picked up. Slightly shivering when the wind hit the sweat on his body. His armor was a tombstone grey, with engravings of torture and masochism. An inheritance he enjoyed wearing for it's shocking imagery. He kept his head and his face clean shaven. A black eye patch covered his right eye. A memento of earlier battles. Life of cruelty, sadism, rape and ruin suited the young Shadowknight of the Dismal Rage.<br>
<br>
 He noticed the two Druids that guarded the ruins in the middle of the Western Commonlands, were not there. Perhaps they had been murdered again. They were always making enemies in a world where they had enough enemies. He wandered by the merchant, looking her up and down in predatory fashion. She was a young but experienced merchant. Capable of defending her self. Too well, for the Shadowknight. He didn't like the ones with enough inner strength to fight back. Perhaps in time though.<br>
Acting &quot;innocent&quot; and walking by the young merchant at the ruins, the Shadowknight almost tripped over a piece of old bone sticking out of the ground. Recently unearthed by an apparent battle where the Shadowknight stood. &quot;No doubt, those stupid Druids were killed by some Wizard.&quot; the Shadowknight muttered to himself, looking at the damage covering the surrounding area, as he bent down to inspect the exposed bones.<br>
<br>
Daon stood still. Only slightly turning his head side to side as he watched adventurers run around the Eastern Commonlands. Behind him to his right, stood an unholy abomination of black magic and bones. A skeleton possessed by a spirit of death. Some Necromancers and Shadowknights summoned the ghost of the once living. Daon had learned a secret form one of his favorite teachers in the Dismal Rage. <br>
<br>
There were spirits of death that could answer the call. Ghost were the once living. Ghost were what many people called &quot;spirits&quot;. These ghost, were what many who practiced the Death Arts summoned to animate their skeleton servants. Spirits, true spirits, had never lived at all. Entities that could be friendly...or monsters. Spirits from a realm of death. A place the &quot;once living&quot; passed by, on the way to their god's domain. Spirits who dwelled in a place some called the &quot;land of the dead&quot;. Not demons, creatures of darker power, but spirits who hated the living. Jealous of the living, but incredibly loyal to whoever summoned them into the physical world. Daon's servants were always quite single minded, in their hatred of the living. No one could hear them chant and whisper, but Daon could, in his mind. Soon, he would have to gain the magic to allow his skeleton servant to speak in the material world. It would be amusing to listen to physically.<br>
<br>
Daon blinked. He had been lost in thought. Thinking of the spirits who served him from the land of the dead. He almost didn't see the warrior passing by in the distance. The Warrior, Daon knew was the one who killed his &quot;lover&quot;.<br>
As Daon looked at the Steel Warrior, the undead servant hissed and clawed at the air. Sensing his master's thoughts. Looking around briefly to make certain no wandering guards of Freeport would interfere, Daon said in a low and cultured voice, &quot;Servant...kill the Steel Warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old bones should not have been there. The Shadowknight was confused. The land claimed all things in time. Bodies would disappear, belongings dropped would &quot;fade away&quot;. The magic that flowed through all things made it so. In a sense, all things came from the earth and all things would be &quot;reclaimed&quot;. The Shadowknight unearthed the remaining bones. He found enough to use for summoning a skeleton pet of his own. He could tell the bones came from one source. A large, powerful, humanoid creature. Holding the large bones in his hands, the Shadowknight could sense power in them. Magic he did not recognize, but strong enough to keep the bones intact despite the passing of time. Smiling to himself, the Shadowknight quickly placed the bones in his traveling bag and ran towards home in Freeport.<br>
<br>
Daon took his time walking back towards Freeport, but kept to the edge of the East Commonlands. Away from guard's eyes. Behind him, the skeletal servant dragged a barely alive body of the Steel Warrior by the hair. Daon ordered the undead servant to stop attacking before the Warrior died. Daon wanted him alive.<br>
<br>

(OOC No big point to this story. Just had a few ideas left over from the last story and an urge to write about the current adventures of Daon Wolf's reincarnation. Not anything to do with my interaction with other characters in the game. Just a story floating around in my head. Might be short, might be long, don't know yet.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A> at: 2/17/03 11:08:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/17/03 11:02:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old...&quot;Friends&quot;</span><hr size=1> Somewhere secret underneath Freeport, Daon entered a large room devoid of all natural light. Yet a blue luminescence filled the room. This was the personal chamber of the Prophet of Rage. An oracle for the Human servants of Innoruuk. The Necromancer did not remember all the details, but he knew the previous Prophet of Rage, generations ago in his earlier life as a Shadowknight. The current Prophet was a unique woman with ash grey skin and a haunting, beauty. She would appear like a ghost floating in the air. Strips of white silk flowed around her in slow motion, almost blending with her long black hair. The strips of silk and her hair floated, as if she were underwater. She wore nothing else. Daon bowed his head in respect as the Prophet of Rage appeared before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have brought the one you saw, Prophet of Rage.&quot; he began. His voice low and respectful. Echoing in the secret chamber. &quot;He is now tied to an examination table in a private chamber. Awaiting his punishment.&quot; The beautiful prophet, floating in the air above Daon, nodded her head. As she spoke, her voice seemed to come from the four corners of the room, rather from her mouth. &quot;I sensed it when you found him &quot;Daon, Once Daon Wolf&quot;. Soon to be Daon Wolf again.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Prophet of Rage knew of the Necromancer's past existence. It was their &quot;secret&quot; together. There was no true &quot;trust&quot; in the world of those who served dark gods. Yet Daon felt no alarm when she first addressed him as &quot;Daon, Once Daon Wolf&quot;. He did not know why he felt safe with her knowledge of him. Anyone could use knowledge to gain power over another somehow, someway. The Necromancer, strangely, was not alarmed when she revealed her knowledge of him. &quot;I trust you will punish him appropriately.&quot; she said. Her eyes looking at the hood that covered Daon's head. Daon felt she could see him through the hood. He never felt the need to remove it in her presence out of courtesy. She could see into his soul. There was nothing to hide from her. <br>
<br>
 Elsewhere, in the underground base of the Dismal Rage, the Shadowknight emptied the bones out of his bag with a loud rattle. He could feel the magic. Almost see it. Glowing. If he was successful, he would have a powerful skeletal pet to serve him. He believed the pet would last forever. Not dissipating when nearing towns or new lands. The magic the Conclave Empire established in various areas to &quot;guard&quot; from some unknown attack. Areas, the Shadowknight assumed, where the old empire had planned to set up kingdoms. The magic near cities and even unsettled lands, repelled most pets and sometimes monsters. No one knew how this magic worked or the exact reason &quot;why&quot; it was there. It was believed, therefore, that the now dead empire made it so. But the magic could have been even older for all anyone knew.<br>
If these bones were as strong as the Shadowknight thought, his pet would resist the magic and possibly grow ever stronger. The Shadowknight smiled at this idea. He did not truly know if this would work. But the dreams of true arrogance did not allow for the possibility of being wrong. The Shadow knight never believed he could be wrong. He began casting his spell when he suddenly stopped. He put his thumb to his chin as he thought. Still wearing his armor and gauntlets, his metal covered thumb caressed the cleft in his chin as he pondered. &quot;If I make it here...some of the elders may see it and try to claim it's power for their own.&quot; he said softly to himself. Without thinking twice, the Shadowknight quickly slid the bones off the table and into the travelling bag. Tieing the bag closed, he hefted the bag over his shoulder and quickly ran out of the underground base of the Dismal Rage.<br>
<br>
Daon entered the private chamber where he held the Steel Warrior. Daon, slowly walked around the table where the Warrior was tied on his back. Daon watched him. The warrior had awaken. Struggling with the leather bonds that kept his arms and legs still. A leather strap holding his head in place. Daon had tended to his wounds. No need to let him die yet. The Warrior's armor had been removed and set aside within view of the Warrior. The weapons nearby, also in view. Just out of reach. This was intended for a psychological effect. The armor was the Warrior's protection. Having it arranged and placed within view reminded the Warrior of his vulnerability. The weapons were part of his strength. The weapons reminded the Warrior of his helplessness.<br>
 Daon slowly continued to walk around the table, keeping his head turned towards the Warrior. Even though none of Daon's features could be seen in the shadows of Daon's hood, it told the Warrior that Daon was always watching him. Watching his struggle without saying a word. <br>
<br>
Calmly walking in front of the Warrior, then around behind the Warrior's head, where the Warrior could not see him. Then down along the side, close to the struggling hands that tried to reach and grab Daon. Just out of reach. Only when the Warrior tired himself out, did Daon stop at the left side of the table. He stood still. Red, gloved hands clasped together in front of him, looking down at the Warrior. The only light was two candles near the Warrior's equipment. The armor at the foot of the table with one candle. The weapons at the right of the Warrior with the other candle. Everything else was faint darkness and total blackness. The blood red robes of the Necromancer stood out like a reminder that the Warrior was not alone. Daon had not spoken a single word.<br>
<br>
The Shadowknight found an abandoned hut in the East Commonlands. Sitting down for a moment to regain his strength. The Shadowknight felt excitement at the prospect of a large undead servant, fighting at his command. Getting back to his feet. The Shadowknight began to cast his spell of forming the bones into a complete skeleton. Summoning one of the dead to animate the bones and serve his will. The green magic spread outward form his armored body. He could feel the power within the large, old bones reacting to his spell. It was working. The sound of bone clicking on bone filled the abandoned hut. Green light filled the hut as a large, almost giant skeleton began to form.<br>
<br>
&quot;You... are the Warrior, who killed a rather...unique Magician a few days ago.&quot; Daon said. His voice calm. He took his time speaking. The Warrior himself had not said a word. Determined not to give in to the weakness of fear. Many people, even if not begging, would have said something by now. At least demanding what the Necromancer wanted from them. The Steel Warrior was stronger than that. No one became a Warrior by being soft.<br>
&quot;You mean the slut.&quot; the Warrior taunted. His eyes cold and unafraid. &quot;Slut...&quot; Daon echoed. No emotional reaction, like the Warrior wanted. Rather, the Necromancer seemed to examine the word by speaking it. &quot;When a man calls a woman a &quot;slut&quot;...he is actually, on some level, whether aware of it or not, jealous that HE is not the one the woman is &quot;playing&quot; with. All men believe, somewhere deep inside, that all &quot;attractive&quot; women should be HIS.&quot; The Necromancer began to slowly walk around the captured Warrior again. Still speaking slowly. He paced when he was in deep thought. &quot;I know this, because despite the pursuit of power that occupies my time, I am also a MAN. Unlike most men, I am not insecure, and can admit these &quot;things&quot; freely.&quot;<br>
The Warrior began to laugh. &quot;You are an idiot! You have no idea what you are talking about! Let me off this table and I'll teach you how a man fights! No words! No pets! No coward tactics! You are pathetic!&quot; <br>
The Necromancer, did not stop his slow walk around the table. He did not react to the Warrior's words, merely letting the Warrior speak his mind. It would give the Warrior confidence, hearing himself. Daon wanted him to feel that. All the more painful then, when the Necromancer would begin the Warrior's &quot;education.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Odd isn't it?&quot; said Daon. &quot;You are the hero. You oppose all the gods of darkness, fighting all evil you come across. I...am a monster. A Necromancer in service to Innoruuk and the Dismal Rage. Yet, &quot;I&quot; the monster, am more honest than the hero.&quot; The Warrior laughed. &quot;Your an idiot!&quot; the Warrior said. Daon took his time walking away into the darkest corner of the room. The corner was within view of the Warrior. The Necromancer made sure of this. The Warrior could no longer see Daon. Only hear the sounds of glass clicking against something. The Necromancer, just as slowly, reappeared walking towards the Warrior with a glass vial in his right hand.<br>
&quot;Time for your first lesson.&quot; Daon said. He felt the time was right. &quot;You only thing you can teach me is how to be a coward and talk too much!&quot; The Warrior retorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your first lesson...&quot; Daon calmly spoke, &quot;is that acid should be weakened by adding equal parts water to it. If acid burns through the victim, then the torture will end too quickly by the threat of death.&quot; Daon stood at the top of the table, over the warrior's head. &quot;Second lesson..&quot; The Necromancer slowly said, &quot;Courage, for many people, can be situational. We will see, if yours holds up over pain.&quot; Daon carefully poured the acid onto the Warrior's eyes. The struggling Warrior grunted as he resisted the pain. Then began to howl and scream as the acid ate through the eyelids and into the eyes.<br>
<br>
The large skeleton formed in a kneeling position. Unusual for the formation of a pet. Most undead servants formed standing, ready for action. The Shadowknight noticed this but did not care. His servant had formed. The spell successful. Now he only needed to test the power of his new pet. &quot;Stand up!&quot; the Shadowknight ordered, breathing heavily, excited by his success. The large skeleton arched it's back with the front of the skull looking up at the ceiling and roared in a powerful, looming voice. It seemed to roar forever. The sound hurting the ears of the Shadowknight, causing him to cover them with his armored hands. Suddenly, the large skeleton stopped with a surprising quickness. It's lower jaw bone snapping shut with a loud click of teeth over teeth. At the same time, the skull quickly turned it's head towards the Shadowknight. It's left arm shoot out like a flash of light. It's bony digits smashing through the Shadowknight's teeth and into his mouth, clamping down on the tongue. Bending at the wrist bones, the &quot;palm&quot; of the skeleton's hand supported the Shadowknight's head, as it lifted him up. Standing up to it's full height. Towering over anyone of human size, the large skeleton held the struggling Shadowknight up at arm's length. Blood poured out of the captured Shadowknight's mouth, over the skeleton's fingers and dripped to the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no.&quot; The large skeleton's voice boomed, even though it spoke calmly in a course whisper. &quot;Oh no, I don't think you will be giving orders to me.&quot; The large skeleton said, tilting it's head to the side, looking at the Shadowknight. It's tone mocking. The fingers of the skeleton's right hand, unbuckled and dropped the Shadowknight's weapons. The loud clang of the weapons hitting the floor, mingled with the muffled growls of pain by the Shadowknight. &quot;You won't be needing those.&quot; the large skeleton stated casually. &quot;Will you?&quot; The undead creature quickly brought the Shadowknight close to his &quot;face&quot;. The Shadowknight's enraged eyes close to the empty sockets of the large skeleton. The undead abomination seemed to be &quot;sniffing&quot; the blood pouring from the mouth. If a skeleton with no lips could smile, the Shadowknight could have sworn the undead creature began to grin. &quot;Will you, &quot;Chosen One&quot;!<br>

His body struggling with insane strength from the pain. The Warrior's right arm burst out of the leather strap and reached towards his left arm. Fingers trembling with agony as the acid ate through his eyes, the Warrior blindly fought with the leather strap holding his left arm in place. He felt his body weaken, as his strength was leeched out of him and into Daon. Green energy flowed between the two men as the Necromancer completed his spell. With his stolen strength, Daon grabbed the Warrior's right wrist and slammed his arm back down to the side. The impact of the Warrior's arm against the table, echoed in the torture room. The Warrior could hear the sharp sound of a blade being pulled from it's sheath and then felt cold steel quickly penetrate his skin, muscle and then the bone of his upper arm. He could feel the skin on his outer arm stretch, then give way as the dagger pierced completely through his limb, pinning him to the table. The dagger was buried in his arm to the hilt. The Warrior's scream seemed to go on forever.<br>
<br>
The Shadowknight grabed at the large skeleton's skull with both hands. Red, firey magic flashed out of the Shadowknight as his Harmtouch made the skeleton roar with pain. Small parts of the skull exploded outward from the unholy magic. The Shadowknight fell painfully to the floor as the skeleton released him and staggered back, clutching at it's damaged skull. The Shadowknight scampered towards his weapons, ignoring the throbbing pain of his mouth. He grabbed the handle of his longsword and pulled. The sound of steel, sliding along the inside of the scabbard as he pulled the weapon out, filled the hut. The Shadowknight quickly turned to face the undead creature but no one was there. The Shadowknight charged towards the doorway to hunt the creature down, then felt the impact of a large skeletal fist colliding with his face. The Shadowknight was thrown off his feet and onto his back. His body made a loud 'thud' as it hit the floor. His weapon was thrown out of his hand by the impact, making a loud racket as the sword fell to the side. <br>
In the doorway of the hut, the large skeleton peeked into the room. Upside down. It was easy for the creature, even with it's size, to slip out the door and leap onto the roof. Ready to attack from above. There was no bulk of muscle on it's bones to trap it in the doorway. The creature was more silent and nimble than any undead should be.<br>
&quot;We're not finished playing yet.&quot; the large skeleton said as it looked, upside down, at the barely conscience Shadowknight.<br>
<br>
When, and only when, the Steel Warrior stopped screaming from pain, did Daon cast another spell. An unusual comfort overcame the Warrior, as small amounts of the torture done to him healed. Just enough to for his eyes to reform. Just enough for him to see and to pay attention to something besides the pain. The Necromancer made sure the Warrior could see him well enough, as he slowly walked past the warrior's feet. The red robed and hooded magic user, stopped besides the Warrior's armor. Making certain the armor his captive used, was in his line of sight. All the more to remind the fighter of his vulnerability. Daon felt weak from using some of his own lifeforce to heal the Warrior, but made certain he did not show it.<br>
&quot;Lesson three. If too much pain is a constant sensation, the victim's body has a chance to adapt, one way or another. I have no intention of letting you get used to pain. Besides...I DO want you to see what I am doing to you.&quot; Daon took his time, walking back into the shadows of the corner, where he kept the equipment. The Warrior could not see the Necromancer in the darkest part of the room, only hear the sounds of metal tools being gathered. The Steel Warrior tried to pull his arm off the table that was pinned by the dagger, but could not find the strength. If only he could see the damn Necromancer and what he was doing.<br>
<br>
Daon pushed a cart with various blades arranged on it, up to the side of the Warrior. Daon had no intention of using the blades on his captive. He had no taste for physical torture beyond what he had already done. Daon felt &quot;above&quot; pure physical torture. But the sharp blades would have a good psychological effect, being within sight. When Daon thought of what he had planned for the Warrior, he paused for a moment and wondered if it would be more merciful to &quot;just&quot; torture him in the &quot;usual&quot; way. The idea Daon came up with while talking to the Warrior, might seem to some people, to be worse.<br>
&quot;We are not finished yet...&quot; The Necromancer said, as he brought out a large box filled with various spiders.<br>

The Shadowknight was the predator. HE, was the villain, the monster. The one other people ran away from. The one who held women down or beat them into submission as he raped them. The one who villagers screamed at for mercy as he killed their families, their children, their lives. HE was in control..not the victim.<br>
The Shadowknight's eyes were wide open with terror. He was held down. His body unmoving. His mind unraveling. His sanity fleeing. A large skeleton was on top of him. Sitting on him. Holding down both his strong arms by the wrist, with one skeletal hand. The other hand quickly ripped off the Shadowknight's armor, throwing the pieces to the side. Each piece of metal that fell, seemed to ring in the Shadowknight's ears and would not stop. The huge skull of the undead creature, loomed over his face. Sniffing at the blood leaking out of the man's mouth.<br>
&quot;Get rid of the outer shell, hmm?&quot; The large skeleton said in a cruel booming voice. &quot;Get RID of it! Get to the tasty parts.&quot; The skeleton ran the sharp tip of it's finger down the Shadowknight's chest, cutting to the bone. The skeleton brought it's bloody fingertip up to it's &quot;face&quot;, looking at it with a tilt of it's head. &quot;The blood of the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot;. How I looked for it for soooo long.&quot; The skeleton put it's finger in between it's teeth, as a person would, if they were licking their finger. There were no lips or tongue on the skeleton, yet the fingertip came away clean. &quot;It is time to eat. Feel free to scream.&quot; the skeleton said in a most casual manner. The Shadowknight tried to hold his concentration enough to send a mental message to another &quot;Chosen One&quot;, whom he knew. Then all the Shadowknight could do was scream, as the large skeleton opened it's jaw bones wide, then clamped down on the man's chest. Then slowly brought it's teeth together, ripping flesh and muscle and began to chew.<br>
<br>
A young, confident woman who served Innoruuk as a Shadowknight, was herself a &quot;Chosen One&quot;. She and the Shadowknight currently being tortured, were &quot;lovers&quot; from time to time. She heard his &quot;call&quot; in her mind, then heard his scream. Her ears started to bleed.<br>
 She ran down the long tunnels of the underworld of Freeport and found one of her superiors. She explained what little she was aware of, then ran off to find her &quot;lover&quot;. All she knew, was that he was in an abandoned hut somewhere in the Eastern Commonlands.<br>
<br>
Daon placed the large box on top of the Steel Warrior's crotch. It was a crate, well made, with very little room for anything to fall out of between the boards. Small, hairy, black and brown legs seemed to dart in and out of the spaces between boards. Occasionally a thin, hairless leg would &quot;peek&quot; out as well. Almost as if testing the air. The sound of small things scratching and scuttling about came from inside. Daon then took his time, walking to the other side of the table. Stood near the group of weapons the Warrior had used. Daon wanted him to look his way eventually, and see the weapons so easily in view and too far to reach. Daon stood there patiently. The hood covering his features completely. Not his eyes, his nose, nor even his chin could be seen. Daon stood with his hands together, the sleeves of the red robe covering his gloves.<br>
&quot;I am not afraid of you!&quot; The warrior growled, breathing heavily in defiance. Daon undid the leather strap holding the Warrior's head in place. &quot;I do not NEED for you to fear me.&quot; the Necromancer calmly said. &quot;I only wish for you to suffer.&quot; Then Daon held up the vial of acid over the Warrior's head.<br>
<br>
The woman Shadowknight of the Dismal Rage, ran hard throughout the Commonlands. She never paid attention to what other buildings existed, besides the ones she sold to when hunting. Now she wracked her mind to try and remember which one was abandoned. She stopped for a moment, exhausted. Her hands on her knees, gasping for breath. &quot;That bastard better not be with another woman!&quot; she gasped out loud. &quot;If it's just one of his sluts who decided to rob him while his pants were down..I'll kill him!&quot; She looked around and saw, off in the distance, a building she could not remember being occupied or not. Drawing her bastard sword, she half walked, half stumbled from exhaustion, towards the hut. She did not even think of knocking. She was a Shadowknight. She would kick down the door. If she was wrong... well, she did not know what to do then. She was all out of ideas. Stopping at the doorway, long enough to inhale deeply, she brought her foot up and crashed it into the door. The door did not move. She swore an unholy oath to Innoruuk, then screamed as the door swung open and a large skeletal hand shot out. The two middle fingers piercing through her eyes and hooking down, to hold her by the skull and drag her in.  Her nails clawed at the door frame for brief seconds, before disappearing into the hut. The door slammed shut.<br>

The screaming within, was muffled by the walls. Something was wrong.<br>
There is no final death for &quot;Chosen Ones&quot;. Die, only to be reborn again, like a snake shedding a skin. Only their will to live, determined if they could truly die.<br>
Something was wrong.<br>
The eyes of the first Shadowknight were wide open. Barely alive, head shaking side to side in denial and panic. Seeing the inside of the hut flash by, as his head turned one way. Seeing the gore covered, large skull in front of him, screaming in mockery of the Shadowknight's screams, as he turned his head the other way. Hands trembling in vain to grab and fight the undead creature, as it slowly ate him alive. Every time the creature bit him, the Shadowknight lost the will to live. The large skeleton was &quot;eating&quot; his will to live. The woman who came to rescue the male Shadowknight, was already dead. Truly dead. The man knew it. Somewhere in the chaos of his pain, fear and thoughts, he knew she was truly dead. Not reborn. Not coming back with reinforcements. The undead monster ate her quickly, almost mercifully. The undead creature, took it's time with the male Shadowknight.<br>
<br>
The Steel Warrior turned his head to the side in reflex, as he saw the vial of acid over his head. No pain came. No searing, burning agony. The Warrior looked back towards the Necromancer and saw him reaching with his other hand towards the large box sitting on the Warrior's crotch.<br>
&quot;Try not to do... what is expected of you.&quot; Daon said as he removed the lid of the box and overturned it onto the Warrior's stomach. A dozen large and small spiders quickly tumbled and scampered out. A few looked as if they were trying to eat each other. Most started to crawl.<br>
 Over the Warrior's stomach. Over his his arms. Even down to his legs. One spider, seemed interested in the dagger still imbedded in the Warrior's arm, pinning him to the table. A dozen spiders crawling, searching the Warrior's body. One large, black spider rushed up the Warrior's chest and towards his face. The Warrior could almost see his face reflected in the multiple eyes of the black spider, as it stopped at his chin.<br>
<br>
Daon slowly walked towards the center of the room. A chain hung from the ceiling, attached to a round trap door. The door covered a hole that led to the surface. An air vent that led to a spot just outside the city. Magic kept the smaller vermin of the area from messing with the air shaft. Magic also kept the air shaft clean. Daon pulled on the chain, opening the trap door in the ceiling. Light came down as if a bright torch illuminated the tunnel. A cool breeze came through, followed by light rain. Daon stood underneath the air shaft. Tilting his head back, letting his hood fall. His long, light blond hair reached down past his shoulders. His face, young and clean shaven, was lightly pelted by the rain drops. Daon just stood there, feeling the rain on his face.<br>
&quot;There are different kinds of evil, Steel Warrior...&quot; Daon said. His voice lower and more thoughtful, than a young man of his age should have been. &quot;There is what I like to call &quot;Noble Evil&quot; or &quot;Divine Evil&quot;. ...Those of use who draw a line and call it honor.&quot; Daon's eyes were closed. His face and hair now wet with the rain. He continued talking, not knowing if the Warrior was paying attention. Not caring.<br>
 &quot;It is what makes us different, from &quot;other&quot; evil that has no honor, no code. Little more than beasts on two legs.&quot; The Warrior did not move as he looked at the large, black spider. The spider, looking at him.<br>
Spiders had already bitten him. He could feel his skin swelling with irritation at the small fangs. At the spider venom. He controlled his pain. The Steel Warrior would not die screaming at spiders. He would not allow himself to die that way.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Some people think, that because &quot;Noble Evil&quot; shows self-control, even respect, in certain situations, that we could never be as vicious as the &quot;other&quot; evils. ...They have no idea.&quot; The Warrior's body twitched in pain involuntarily. Some spiders reacted in fear and moved away. Some became more violent and bit again. The black spider at the Warrior's chin, tapped his lower lip with one of it's long, hairy legs. The Warrior tried to control his breathing. To calm down his body. &quot;The cold truth is... that ALL beings, Good and Evil have a...horrible...&quot;monster&quot; inside. This &quot;monster&quot;, is the cruelty, anger, and potential for madness, we all have within.&quot; Daon still stood under the air vent, in the rain. Talking, thinking more to himself, than to his prisoner. &quot;With no control, the &quot;monster&quot; can go beyond all preconceptions of evil and past insanity. I tap into my &quot;monster&quot; in order to BE a monster. I use &quot;it&quot; to gain power. To do what is necessary to survive.&quot; Daon opened his eyes. Watching for a moment, the rain fall towards him like a hundred falling stars. &quot;You would not want to believe the things I have seen. Most of it memories from a past...time. Death, quiet oblivion, with no gods to pull our destines, would be a sweet release. Sometimes I think that.&quot; Daon, slightly covering his eyes with his right hand to keep water out, watched the rain fall from above. &quot;...Wash away the memories.&quot;<br>
<br>
The door to the abandoned hut opened. Flies gathered around the building, looking for the source of the grotesque smell from within. A large skeleton, bent over to allow itself room to exit, stepped out of the hut. Standing up to it's full height, it stretched as if it felt cramped from being in so small a space for it's large form. Tattered sheets of human skin, sewn together with strips of sinew and bone, covered it's skull like an executioner's hood. There were two holes for the eyes on the hood of flesh. One large hole for the mouth. Blue magic flowed from the large skeleton's hands. Surrounding the creature with power. With the Spirit of the Wolf. &quot;I feel...like a new Ogre!&quot; The large skeleton laughed and ran with magic speed. Disappearing into the forest of the East Commonlands.<br>
<br>
Daon stood over the captive Steel Warrior. &quot;You are lucky I am your torturer. Some people, thinking they are more terrifying or impressive by being more debased, would have defiled you. While using magic to force you to defile someone you cared for. Then possibly eating you alive. Or even during.&quot;  Daon put his hood back on, covering his wet features. The Warrior, feeling physically and even emotionally weaker, still refused to give in. &quot;Oh, I am so &quot;honored&quot; you are my local madman!&quot; <br>
Daon picked up the large, black spider on the Warrior's chin and held it over the Warrior's face. Close to his face. Two orcs with green skin, appeared out of the dark of the other side of the room. One holding the Warrior's head still. The other forcing open the Warrior's mouth. Had they been there the whole time? The Warrior could not think clearly enough to answer his own inner question. Daon, the Necromancer in red, held the large spider close to the Warrior's mouth. &quot;Think before you speak.&quot; was all Daon said. Then placed the spider in the Steel Warrior's mouth.<br>

Which I will write in a little bit. It deals with some Mature subject matter.<br>
 Someone once said &quot; When you write, don't hold back. Let it all flow out even if it disturbs you while writing it. Sometimes in our stories, the monsters, villains, or horrible scenes, is actually our subconscious trying to remind us and our readers of the real issues or real life monsters that are out there. it's easy to forget and turn the other cheek, when we are safe in our homes or with our friends and loved ones. Disturbing material, is sometimes &quot;just&quot; necessary to help the reader understand a character or monster. Sometimes it's to make us wake up and remember we are not in The Magic Kingdom. Writing has many levels to it. You won't always know until AFTER.&quot; <br>
Now when I say &quot;Mature&quot;, I do not mean porno. Although sexual matter is definitely &quot;Mature&quot; and is sometimes in my stories. It is acceptable in a story if it helps in some way. When I say &quot;Mature&quot; I usually mean anything from serious philosophy to dark subjects like violence or crime. I decided to go half-way and edit out a LOT of material I was originally going to leave in. For one thing, too much disturbing material can ruin a story for many readers. Even when they know what they are getting into. I want to get across to the readers, the horrors Daon has seen and known, among other things, but without pushing away anyone who has been reading.<br>
Although edited, some material may be a little too dark or disturbing for some. For that I apologize. I do not want anyone to read any of my work and think&quot; holy crap, this guy is sick!&quot; and never chat with me or talk to my character in the game again. I am hoping to avoid that problem while keeping true to the character. So, this is my official Warning: some material may be too intense for younger readers. Parental discretion is advised.<br>
Sincerely, Player of Daon  <br>
<br>
I am going to go walk the dog, clean up and then write out more of the story. Just wanted to throw in a little warning. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A> at: 2/23/03 1:40:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/03 12:22:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=783.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old...&quot;Friends&quot;</span><hr size=1> OOC: OKAY, the spell check just deleted the whole thing.

The two orc guards forcing his jaws together, keeping the angry spider inside. The Warrior let out grunts of pain as the spider began to panic and bite. &quot;...Despite your predicament...you do have options.&quot; Daon took his time speaking. The Warrior's eyes bulged as fought to open his mouth. His left hand grasped at the empty air with his struggles. His right hand flinched from time to time, useless since Daon had stabbed through the Warrior's arm with a dagger. The spiders crawling on the Warrior's body either crawled away, frightened by the shaking or became agitated and bit more. The Necromancer felt more sympathy for the frightened spider, than he ever could for the Steel Warrior. &quot;You could continue to struggle...hoping you will find the strength to force open your mouth and spit out the spider...or you could...swallow.&quot; <br>
<br>
Daon stood there calmly, quietly. His hands once more together as if he were in meditation. Looking straight ahead, his features still covered by the hood of his red robe. Making him look like some distant, untouchable, red ghost. Part of this was Daon's nature. To seem &quot;aloof&quot;. Part of this was to make the Steel Warrior feel as if he could not &quot;touch&quot; Daon. Untouchable, unbeatable. As if nothing the Warrior could do would make a difference. Everything the Necromancer did, was a subtle psychological attack.<br>
Daon waited a few more patient moments, then gestured to the orc guards to release the Warrior's head and jaw. The Steel Warrior spit out the crumpled looking and angry arachnid. It scuttled away into the shadows. The Warrior was too busy coughing and gagging to say anything. Daon gestured to the orc guards and then to the door. &quot;Leave him for now. Let us give him a moment alone to think. ...The spiders will keep him company.&quot; The orcs opened the door and walked out. Daon snuffed out the two candles in the room, then slowly walked out the doorway, surrounded by the light from the hall. The Necromancer turned around to look at the Warrior covered in spiders, then closed the door leaving him alone in the dark.<br>
<br>
Daon paused at the door of the Prophet's room, awaiting permission to enter. The door opened by itself and Daon walked inside. The Prophet of Rage floated in the middle of the room. Daon stopped a few feet away and looked up at her. &quot;Have they been found?&quot; the Necromancer asked.<br>
 The Prophet nodded as she talked. &quot;They are being held in another room.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Daon replied. Satisfaction in his voice. &quot;Now all I need to do, is prepare the dead apprentice's body for the funeral and one of our &quot;guests&quot; as a sacrifice.&quot;<br>
&quot;There has been a change in your plans.&quot; came a snide voice from the side. A priest of Hate, a new arrival in the Dismal Rage, with more status than usual due to &quot;political connections&quot; within the Rage. He enjoyed &quot;pushing&quot; whoever he could with his political status. There were a dozen Clerics of Innoruuk who were more qualified for his position. But sometimes, politics ruled. &quot;The dead apprentice was not important enough for the unholy funeral. Her body was left to rot.&quot; The Priest sneered. &quot;The earth has reclaimed her.&quot; The Priest enjoyed this opportunity to &quot;push&quot; Daon.<br>
Daon did not flinch. Grateful he left his hood on, for the Priest may have seen the anger in Daon's eyes. The Necromancer was more emotional than he was in his previous life as a Shadowknight. He was learning that emotions, although leaving him vulnerable in some ways, was a good source of strength in other ways.  He closed his eyes and sighed. He had wanted to give his former lover a farewell worthy of her inner strength and beauty. Now, with her truly gone, Daon must find another way. &quot;Prophet of Rage...&quot; Daon said very slowly, his voice low and thoughtful. &quot;...what would be the price of your silence?&quot; The Prophet looked at Daon, her eyes meeting his under the hood. &quot;You will have to be creative.&quot; she said, &quot;I need no money.&quot; <br>
&quot;Entertainment?&quot; the Necromancer asked. The Prophet narrowed her eyes at Daon, wondering what he meant. Daon turned his head slightly enough to look at the sneering Priest.<br>
&quot;Whisper..&quot; was all Daon said. A sleek, black cat with golden eyes appeared on Daon's shoulders. Mewing like a kitten, as it peeked around Daon's hood and looked at his face. The Necromacer pointed his finger at the Priest. &quot;...eat his bowels.&quot; Daon said angrily. The cat leaped out at the shocked priest with supernatural quickness, slamming into his face with more force than the cat's body should have had. The Priest hit the floor, stunned. The cat easily landed on it's feet, then quickly darted at the barely conscious man. Ripping and tearing into the Priest's unarmored body with unusual ease. The Priest tried to struggle, but Daon placed his boot on the man's neck, holding him down and choking him. Daon tilted his head towards the face of the shaking and dying priest. &quot;You &quot;pushed&quot; me, Priest. You &quot;pushed&quot; me...and this is my way...of &quot;pushing&quot; back. <br>
<br>
Daon did not look back to see if the Prophet would interfere or attack him. Even though his back was exposed to her, Daon did not care. A mistake, perhaps but Daon's quiet hatred for the man who ruined his plans and sneered at him, would not let go.  The cat's growling seemed to echo from inside the Priest's body as it ate his bowels. The Priest stopped struggling as his eyes grew wide, then lifeless.<br>
&quot;What is that cat and how did you find it?&quot; the Prophet asked calmly, despite the gory spectacle in front of her. Daon's head tilted up, facing a wall. The floating Prophet was still behind him. Daon's blue eyes were cold and focused even though looking at nothing. &quot;There are some things..even you cannot see, Prophet.&quot; the Necromacer said. He slowly turned to look at the Prophet. &quot;Secrets Best, are Secrets Kept.&quot; he said slowly. The Prophet floated close to Daon and &quot;looked&quot; into his soul. She would find her answers by searching his memories.<br>
