His mother, ashamed of having a half breed child, wanted nothing to do with the hardships of raising a half breed. 

Luckily, a young mans keen hearing picked up the muffled cries of baby Tarin. An adventuror, this young man was nothing short of unique, and although he did not lead the life of a parent, he commited to raising baby Tarin. 

A wandering minstrel, Tarin's adopted father did his best. Tarin new many mothers growing up but always respected and loved the same kind man that saved him from death.

So it was that Tarin grew up in this mixed up world in a mixed up...kinda twisted way. As he grew older he eventually went out on his own to see the many corners of Norrath and the continents beyond. At a young age he met the love of his life, Mickee. They soon made many friends and developed a uniquely strange family, filled with characters of all types. It was then that Tarin and his friends all adopted the same last name...the last name of Twisted, and with that formed a clan that would never seperate and vowed to conquer all the lands that spread out before them. 

Every night, when evening fell, the young bard Tarin remembered his early days with his father, and remembers when he first started to learn how to play an instrument. One day this young bard dreams of adventuring alongside his father, his mentor, his friend...Flutio.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 				<span class="privatevalue">disabled</span>						</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
