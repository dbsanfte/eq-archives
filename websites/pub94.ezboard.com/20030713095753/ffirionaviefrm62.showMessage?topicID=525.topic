&gt;It's that time again! The awards this year are classic. These awards are <br>
&gt;given each year to bestow upon (the remains of) that individual, who <br>
&gt;through single-minded self-sacrifice, has done the most to remove <br>
&gt;undesirable elements from the human gene pool. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;5th RUNNER-UP <br>
&gt;Goes to a San Angelo, California man who died when he hit a lift tower at <br>
&gt;the Mammoth Mountain ski area while riding down the slope on a foam pad. <br>
&gt;The 22-year old David Hubbell was pronounced dead at Central Mammoth <br>
&gt;Hospital. The accident occurred about 3 a.m., the Mono County Sheriff's <br>
&gt;department said. Hubal and his friends apparently had hiked up a ski run <br>
&gt;called Stump Alley and undid some yellow foam protectors from lift towers, <br>
&gt;said Lt. Mike Donnelly of the Mammoth Lakes Police Department. The pads are <br>
&gt;used to protect skiers who might hit towers. The group apparently used the <br>
&gt;pads to slide down the ski slope and Hubal crashed into a tower. It has <br>
&gt;since been investigated and determined the tower he hit was the one with <br>
&gt;its pad removed. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;4th RUNNER-UP <br>
&gt;Goes to Robert Puelo, 32, who was apparently being disorderly in a St. <br>
&gt;Louis market. When the clerk threatened to call the police, Puelo grabbed a <br>
&gt;hot dog, shoved it into his mouth and walked out without paying. Police <br>
&gt;found him unconscious in front of the store. Paramedics removed the <br>
&gt;six-inch wiener from his throat where it had choked him to death. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;3rd RUNNER-UP <br>
&gt;Goes to poacher Marino Malerba of Spain, who shot a stag standing above him <br>
&gt;on an overhanging rock and was killed instantly when it fell on him. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;2nd RUNNER-UP <br>
&gt;&quot;Man loses face at party&quot; is what the headline read: A man at a West <br>
&gt;Virginia party (probably related to the winner last year, a man in Arkansas <br>
&gt;who used the .22 bullet to replace the fuse in his pickup truck) popped a <br>
&gt;blasting cap into his mouth and bit down, triggering an explosion that blew <br>
&gt;off his lips, teeth, and tongue. Jerry Stromyer, 24, of Kincaid, bit the <br>
&gt;blasting cap as a prank during the party late Tuesday night, said Cpl. M.D. <br>
&gt;Payne. &quot;Another man had it in an aquarium hooked to a battery and was <br>
&gt;trying to explode it. It wouldn't go off and Stromyer said: 'I'll show you <br>
&gt;how to set it off.'  He put it into his mouth, bit down and it blew all his <br>
&gt;teeth out and his lips and tongue off&quot;, Payne added. Stromyer was listed in <br>
&gt;guarded condition Wednesday with extensive facial injuries, according to a <br>
&gt;spokesperson at Charleston Area Medical Division. &quot;I just can't imagine <br>
&gt;anyone doing something like that,&quot; Payne said. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;1st RUNNER-UP <br>
&gt;Doctors at Portland University Hospital said an Oregon man shot through the <br>
&gt;skull by a hunting arrow is lucky to be alive and will be released soon <br>
&gt;from the hospital. Tony Roberts, 25, lost his right eye last weekend during <br>
&gt;an initiation into a men's rafting club, Mountain Men Anonymous in Grant's <br>
&gt;Pass, Oregon. A friend tried to shoot a beer can off his head, but the <br>
&gt;arrow entered Robert's right eye. Doctors said that had the arrow gone 1 <br>
&gt;millimetre to the left, a major blood vessel would have been cut and <br>
&gt;Roberts would have died instantly. Neurosurgeon Doctor Johnny Delashaw at <br>
&gt;the University Hospital in Portland said the arrow went through 8 to 10 <br>
&gt;inches of brain with the tip protruding at the rear of his skull, yet <br>
&gt;somehow managed to miss all major blood vessels. Delashaw also said that <br>
&gt;had Roberts tried to pull the arrow out on his own he surely would have <br>
&gt;killed himself. Roberts admitted afterwards that he and his friends had <br>
&gt;been drinking that afternoon. Said Roberts, &quot;I feel so dumb about this.&quot; No <br>
&gt;charges have been filed, but the Josephine County district attorney's <br>
&gt;office said the initiation stunt is under investigation. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt;THIS YEAR'S WINNER. <br>
&gt;The late John Pernicky and his friend, the late Sal Hawkins, of the great <br>
&gt;state of Washington, decided to attend a local Metallica concert at the <br>
&gt;George Washington amphitheatre. Having no tickets (but having had 18 beers <br>
&gt;between them), they thought it would be easy to &quot;hop&quot; over the nine foot <br>
&gt;fence and sneak into the show. They pulled their pickup truck over to the <br>
&gt;fence and the plan was for Mr. Pernicky, who was 100-pounds heavier than <br>
&gt;Mr. Hawkins to hop the fence and then assist his friend over. Unfortunately <br>
&gt;for Mr. Pernicky, there was a 30-foot drop on the other side of the fence. <br>
&gt;Having heaved himself over, he found himself crashing through a tree.  His <br>
&gt;fall was abruptly halted (and broken, along with his arm) by a large branch <br>
&gt;that snagged him by his shorts. Dangling from the tree with a broken arm, <br>
&gt;he looked down and saw some bushes below him. Possibly figuring the bushes <br>
&gt;would break his fall, he removed his pocket knife and proceeded to cut away <br>
&gt;his shorts to free himself from the tree. Finally free, Mr. Pernicky <br>
&gt;crashed into holly bushes. The sharp leaves scratched his ENTIRE body and <br>
&gt;worse, without the protection of his shorts, a holly branch penetrated his <br>
&gt;rectum. To make matters worse still, on landing, his pocket knife <br>
&gt;penetrated his thigh. Mr. Hawkins, seeing his friend in considerable pain <br>
&gt;and agony, threw him a rope and tried to pull him to safety by tying the <br>
&gt;rope to the pickup truck and slowly driving away. However, in his drunken <br>
&gt;haste/state, he put the truck into reverse and crashed through the fence <br>
&gt;landing 30' below atop his friend, killing him. Police arrived to find the <br>
&gt;crashed pickup with its driver thrown 100' from the truck and dead from <br>
&gt;massive internal injuries. Upon moving the truck, they found John under it <br>
&gt;half-naked, scratches on his body, a holly stick in his rectum, a knife in <br>
&gt;his thigh, and his shorts dangling from a tree branch 25-feet in the air. <br>

<br>
2 of them break the rules of getting a darwin award... that being that the recipient must be no longer able to contribute to the human gene pool (aka where the darwinism bit comes in).<br>
<br>
This can be achieved by either:<br>
a) dying<br>
b) losing your reproductive functions.<br>
<br>
Two of those runners up are still alive with reproductive organs intact, so they are either fake.. or the people who put together the darwin awards are really stuck for stories this year.<br>
