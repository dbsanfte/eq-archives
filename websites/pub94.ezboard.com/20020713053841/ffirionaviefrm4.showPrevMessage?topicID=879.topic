Makes you think you got a second job (or third, or even first!) playing some times. <br>
The day comes, you get bored with it enough to want to quit, which beggars the question- what do you do with your toon/money/gear?<br>
<br>
Seems like as of late, people have expressed being on the fence about this issue. Fine. We all have opinions, but there's one thing you *do* have to keep in mind-<br>
<br>
With the exception of a *few* people who would actually take a rl-purchased toon and use it the way it was meant to be used, you are a minority. The rest of those who would buy things in a game with real life money are just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lazy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people who want to look important and get attention.<br>
<br>
You take away everyone's fun, because you clearly have no idea what you are doing. You take away the fun, because you get into groups, and everone presumes that you at least have some idea of what's going on. We all make mistakes, yes, but this is different.<br>
<br>
Case in point- the Cleric (33th lev.) I was grouped with today who was running around in a set of Planar armor, not healing anyone, sending me tells that the rest of the group &quot;sucked and had no idea what they were doing&quot; and then comes the kicker- &quot;Why is everything everyone is saying coming out as gibberish?&quot; I asked him if he spoke any language beyond ((race deleted)) - said no, and was completely puzzled by this concept. This leads me to believe that this person clearly hasn't played much (if at all) before. I don't think I'm off-base in at *least* assuming this. <br>
<br>
I didn't get a response at all when I asked him *twice* where he got his armor. Lots of chatter about how everyone else in the group sucked, and the girl that was trying to get some RP going was a &quot;Roleplay loser&quot; though. Before and after I asked him this.<br>
<br>
Maybe he was twinked to the gills and PL'ed by someone. <br>
Maybe someone just *gave* him the planar armor.<br>
I don't know. I did promptly and politely leave the group when I had heard enough of it however, and I'll avoid this person like the black plague in the future.<br>
<br>
Anyhow. More to the point. Think before you sell for rl-money. <br>
Me saying &quot;don't do it&quot; or calling you &quot;scum&quot; isn't going to change this.<br>
But you are screwing other people's fun to a degree if your toon goes into the wrong hands. READ: the whole &quot;Ogah&quot; sitch that some that have had to deal with as of late. <br>
You're at your level because people assume that you've gotten there, and they depend on you to do what your class does if you're grouped. I'm an enchanter. You won't see me trying to melee, because it's pretty much a well established fact that the warrior in the group will take care of that, much like a Cleric who heals people less than the Paladin does.<br>
<br>
This is akin to putting someone in a wheelchair into a professional football league. (in comparison- you get what I'm saying). <br>

Most e-bay'ers don't buy characters to play, though.  They buy them the way junk-store and flea-market rats buy cartons of unknow &quot;stuff&quot;.  What they do is strip the character of all the items that are not no-drop and then sell off the parts seperately.  The lack of no-drops on FV make this server an e-bay paradise.<br>
<br>
I suspect that once people get to 60+, you'll begin to see a plethora of e-bay activity.  How to spot an e-bay on FV?  He'll be naked or undergeared to the point that you'll wonder how he managed to get to 60.  If you chat with him, you'll realize that he probably has no idea how he got to 60, too.  A bit rarer than this, but still common, are the 60's with the best non-no-drop gear around, but have never been to any of the zones where it drops and might not even know where it drops.<br>
<br>
There's not much need to worry, though.  Even the most loot-hungry d00d guild on a blue server would completely ostracize any random ebay-er.  About the only exception to this is when people know the buyer is a good player that has leveled to 60 himself.  I've seen good players buy characters for all kinds of reasons, most typically for class change or sex change (ie. tired of cross-dressing -- seen both men and women do this to play gender-aligned characters). <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

But it does feed the culture and support the people who do this. There are people who are more than willing to ruin your entertainment (read &quot;the game&quot;) in pursuit of a few more dollars. And people who give them money to do so encourage that.<br>

<br>
   I'll come out and speak from experience.<br>
<br>
   I never bought anything for EQ on E-bay, but I did buy a lightsabre (a unique crystal sword) for Diablo 2.  I had some money sitting in a paypal account and I was too lazy to go through the whole rigamarol to finish activating the account such that I could get the money mailed to me as a check (vs just spending the paypal money).<br>
<br>
   Why buy it?  It was rare enough in the game that I couldn't guarantee that if I stuck it out and just fought in the right areas I'd find it.  I might find it in one day, but it could be weeks and weeks, and I really wanted one.  The cost was roughly 3 hours of pay (after taxes), so I figured:<br>
Chance of finding sword after 2 hours Gameplay: 0.01%<br>
Chance of finding sword after working 2 RL hours overtime: 100%<br>
<br>
   It wasn't so much that I found the gameplay unpleasant (I quite enjoyed it actually), as much as I wanted that particular sword and there was no guarantee I could obtain one just by playing the game.  I had a lot more fun w/ the sword than I was having without it, so to me it was worth the price.<br>
<br>
   In a game like Diablo 2, where there's effectively 0 competition for spawns (because you can keep starting new games), the selling of items for RL money doesn't impact gameplay that much.  In EQ however, where there's a fixed pool of monsters to fight, if items are being sold on E-bay it can drive up the number of people hunting that item, which can cause crowding and other problems.  It's no fun if you're camping stormfeather to use the map yourself, and you're faced with twice as much player competition because half the people camping it want to sell it for RL cash.<br>
<br>
   Selling whole accounts (vs just items) is fairly related, but also fairly different, and I'll leave that for another reply so as to keep this one from gettin too wordy.<br>

<br>
By your 50s, you need to be instinctual in how you react to things, or you and those around you will soon find things getting pretty messy... Those instincts can only be honed by spending considerable time with the class. It is a rare individual who can purchase an account and slip right into the stream of things.<br>
<br>
All this is from a purely functional perspective. It doesnt take into account the immense disruption trading/buying accounts will create on a server designated for RP... Because on Nameless, there is a ton of &quot;Ogah&quot; malarchy already going on. I heard stuff like this almost daily: <br>
<br>
&quot;I heard from so-and-so that cleric is ebay.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nono, they didnt sell. They have their sister play sometimes.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, they did sell, but they bought account back.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nono, hes not ebay, he just suXors.&quot;<br>
<br>
/ignore<br>
<br>
I really hope for everyone's sake that the time people invest into their ~characters~ here means this wont happen very much on FV. I completely agree with the author of the original post; obviously, people own their characters and can do whatever they want with them, but I hope most people, when they decide to leave the game, will keep in mind those who are remaining, and retire their characters to a fishing village somewhere, or library, and not into the arms (and accounts) of somebody else.<br>

PS: I think Verrant really dropped the ball by allowing people to change their names for cash. I believe in personal responsibility for ones opinions and actions, AND in making ebaying as difficult as possible, and feel the &quot;new name for cash&quot; policy makes it easier for people to ebay successfully and to slink around bad reputations.<br>

<br>
   I think e-baying will always be a part of the MMOG scenario.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Not necessarily because there's people who want shortcuts, but because the game itself reacts impersonally to your character's wants and desires.  If I were playing a pen &amp; paper version of EQ, and I made it clear to my DM that I really wanted a Vorpal Doodad +3, he'd probably be willing to work out a quest of some kind somewhere along the line that would lead to the Vorpal Doodad +3 if it was within my range to obtain.<br>
<br>
   With MMOGs, you can tell the game as often or as much as you like that you want a Vorpal Doodad +3 and there's really no guarantee you're gonna even get the opportunity to obtain one.  If you're playing Ultima Online on one of the more populated servers, no amount of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> wanting</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a house will get you one, because the land is all occupied.  I knew people with millions of gold who only had a straw shack because that's all they could find room to build.  The more demand exceeds supply, the more you'll see items sold for real world cash than in-game cash.<br>
<br>
   Some people make the argument that supplies need to be kept limited in order to keep the balance.  Items wouldn't be special if everyone had one.  But at the same time no one wants to be odd-man-out when it comes to items they want.  No one wants to come into Ultima Online and basically say &quot;Alright, every world needs homeless people, so I guess I'll take on that role.  Sure, my friend Joe Bob has his own castle with freaking dragons in the stables and a pool hall and a swimming pool, but I'll be damned if I haven't met some great folks in this dark alley I've staked out for myself&quot;.<br>
<br>
   Any time a game designer says &quot;We're going to add &quot;x&quot;, and to keep it special we're going to make it difficult and/or impossible to guarantee that one can obtain it&quot;, they're basically creating an E-bay market for that item.  If &quot;x&quot; is something that can't be traded (no-drop items, high levels, etc) then people will just sell the whole account.<br>
<br>
   Game companies can only go two routes really.  They can ban it all (ala EQ), or they can try to join in on the profit (ala UO, where you can pay a &quot;secure transfer fee&quot; to have ownership of an account permanently transferred to someone else).  Third route I guess would be creating some kind of system where through a reasonable amount of work, players could be guaranteed a reward equivalent to the effort they put into obtaining it.<br>

<br>
If you swim in circles where power is the major determining factor (Oh!  You are level 57?  Okay, come on our raid.  What's your name again?) you aer going to encounter this problem a lot more than others.  If you priortize friendships, mutual support, and activities with your established friends, you are *far* less likely to ever come into direct contact with a problem like this.  I'm not directly condeming one play mindset over another, just pointing out that you get what you are looking for.  That goes for RL also, btw, but I'll refrain from drawing the moral examples.<br>
<br>
I have the blessing to be in a guild that's held together into the early 50s now (maybe a dozen of us there now, with another dozen on the way) and I'm confident that we will hold together far longer.  I don't think I'll ever need to worry about seeing an E-Baby with my guildtag on.  We have allies, and the same goes for them.  Not trying to boast, just showing that the best way to avoid this problem is to not set your priorities in line with those who will go looking for the quick fix.<br>

Anyway, there's my 2 coppers again.<br>

He has asked me a few times to get stuff for him over here and send it to him. If you ever want anything thats been released in the US but hasnt made its way to Germany yet, let me know. As long as you reimburse me, it takes about 15 minutes for me to buy a copy and ship it.  <br>

    (ooc) Ebay, I've always noticed, comes with it's own.. reward. <br>
<br>
   First off, as soon as you buy stuff off of ebay, you're basically wasting your 12 bucks a month. The whole point of the game, I thought was to play it? Ya know, kill the giant rat, followed by the Kobold, followed by Lady Vox, grow in power my son, yadda yadda? If you just buy your way to success, why the heck play? Seems like your rippin yourself off of having a worthwhile time with your charry.<br>
<br>
    2nd: Nobody likes an Ebayer, specifically, because it's freakishly obvious due to apalling lack of skills, or totally level inappropriate armor, that they are one. Once a charry is tagged ebay, good luck with your purchase my friend, as mentioned waaay back at the beginning of this thread.<br>
<br>
    3rd: D00d, you just spent $250.00 on some boots. Eq boots. Digital boots. Real money. Digital boots. Real money... follow yet?

<br>
Just to throw a little kindling onto the fire, what about a manastone?  You can't, regardless of patience, get them for free as they're no longer dropped.  If someone was selling one on e-bay, would you still find the purchase similarly unjustifiable? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uburanmcmuffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BuranMcMuffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 4:56:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=895.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ebay</span><hr size=1> *quietly points out that, in most cases, if you want something bad enough, you can trade for it in-game with items you earn in game*<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, money in the real world should be kept out of the game as much as possible.<br>
<br>
I was playing EQ back when Ebaying was an easy option, back before the dupe bug was fixed. I had friends who were making over $2,000 a month duping and/or harvesting items for Ebay. It mauled the economy of the server I was on at the time and really messed up the game dynamics of the server to this day.<br>
<br>
Any game is designed with a balance of power in mind. In Risk, you need to do certain things before you amass the power to take over the world. In Monopoly, you need a certain amount of property and cash.<br>
<br>
EQ was designed with a power balance between players and mobs in mind. Ebaying, harvesting, duping, and any of the other activities that artificially affect the economy and power balance of a server can have a significant affect on the game as a whole for everyone... <br>
<br>
I could go into the details of this, but it would make for a long, long post, so I wont. It suffices to say that I was, and still am, glad that Verrant has worked to keep the game and the economies of the servers as free from the influence of money in the real world as possible. <br>
<br>
I hope it continues, although it wouldnt surprise me if Verrant tried to work out a way of allowing it at some point, with a fee being paid to them. Its all about $$$, after all.<br>
