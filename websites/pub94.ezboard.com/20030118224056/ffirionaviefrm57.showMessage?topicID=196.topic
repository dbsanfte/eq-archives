<br>
Lately, I have been having anxiety problems in large groups of people, and it really sucks at work.  I deliver pizza, and the dispatching area is quite tiny, maybe 10 feet long by 4 feet wide.  Entirely too small of a place for a few people to gather around.  This used to not bother me though, all the drivers could be standing around there all crammed up each others asses, and I wouldn't give a shit.  I've just been getting more paranoid of people, and more claustrophobic, more anti-social, more disgusted with some of these people the longer i work there.   One of the drivers, Lee, is a dirty old man, who makes sick perverted jokes, because he will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>never</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in his life feel the touch of a woman.  The man doesn't bathe, or brush his teeth, and he makes the sickest comments.  All the teens in the town I work in are spoiled ass brats, and 16 year old girls will be driving brand new Mustangs, Camaro's or whatever around.  I saw some 16 year old girl driving around a GEORGEOUS 1968 or so Corvette the other day.  So, I make an occasional joke about these girls flirting with their dads to get what they want...but...this louse takes it wrongly and says.. &quot;Well, if my daughter looked like that, I'd wanna fuck her too!&quot;  What the hell?!?!  That isn't funny in the slightest, this filthy ass shit.  I am completely ashamed to work around these people.  All in all, I find myself more disgusted with humanity every day, I work with the trashiest people you will find, stupid stoners, high school dropouts, my boss lost one of her eyes when she wrecked her car because she was coked up and drunk.  These people swarm around me every day, I get sick to my stomach because of it. These people have worked this job for years.  Anyone else here ever delivered pizza?? Well, you'd understand that it's a lousy job.  These people have it as a damn career.  Are your social skills that lousy that you can't find decent work?!  Are you such social misfits that you cant get up off your ass, and do something with your life?!  I'm only 22, and I'm sickened with myself over having this job for more than a year,I should be doing something decent.<br>
<br>
This anxiety thing just isn't at work, it's at parties, with groups of friends.  Almost anywhere other than a concert or rave.  I go the mall, and I am completely disgusted by people.  People that think that their life is so perfect because they're the star quarterback or head cheerleader at their school.<br>
<br>
I know some reasons why I have been having crazy ass mood swings, and this anxiety.  Poor diet, stressed out like hell, i need a change of job/apartment, I need a vacation.  But I don't know the definate root of it.  Am I sick of everyone else, or sick of myself?  Why did I think nice happy thoughts of blowing a rather large chunk out of my skull, while drving at the same time on the way home from work today?  What the hell is wrong with me?!  I don't know if I may have a chemical imbalance.  Possibly I do, I do all sorts of other weird shit, maybe it's just nervous ticks.<br>
<br>
I dunno...maybe I just have one hell of an ego and think I'm perfect.  Maybe I'm just hopeful that I will catch one small break, so I can get both feet on the ground, and I get pissed at others that are perfectly happy with wasting away.<br>
<br>
Ugh.<br>
<br>
Maybe I just need to go take a shower, listen to some Pink Floyd, and attempt to relax.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for reading this.  I know not a single one of you knows me in real life.  And only a handful have spoken to me in game.  So feel free to call me a social fuckup if you wish, tell me I need to jump off a bridge, whatever.<br>
<br>
Later<br>

I'm far from a medical expert but I did go through a period in my life where the stress was getting to me like that - I mean I was contemplating suicide on a semi-regular basis. I saw a doctor, she put me on Prozac and it made a world of difference. It could be a chemical imbalance.

You have EVERY right to be sickened by that.  I'm just an avatar behind the screen and I want to clutch my stomach at the description of that guy.<br>
<br>
As for Prozac and whatever else....  maybe it's just me, but I have a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>deep</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> distrust of drugs of any sort.  Headache?  Whatever, I'll deal with it, keep your Asprin.  Cramps?  Yeah, they suck, but I've never taken any pills for them.<br>
<br>
So along those lines....  unless you have SERIOUS moodswings, as in one moment you love everyone and everything and the next moment you want to track down your neighbor's dog for a purposeless animal sacrifice....  then you might want to look into medication.  But just being pissed at people who drag you down into a world that you would be ever-so-happy to stay away from all together?  Knowing that you'll have a profession a bit more respectable than delivering pizza?  I don't call that rage or ego - I call that being human and being confident.<br>
<br>
Moodswings suck, but they're a part of life.  If my word's worth anything, it would say stay away from the pills unless you REALLY need them.<br>
<br>
/massage<br>
<br>
Take that shower - or better yet, a bath, maybe even with bubbles.  Listen to Pink Floyd and relax and kick back in your favorite chair or bed.<br>
<br>
We all have those days, those weeks, those months.  *hug*  Good luck with yours.<br>
<br>
If you ever need to blow off steam or chat or relax or what have you....  I'm frequently on MSN - Amaeliya@hotmail.com   Send an IM, if you would like.  *smiles* <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Amaeliya/forestsig.JPG "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brynvin>Brynvin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/23/02 5:47:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blowing off some steam</span><hr size=1> I know this isn't helpful but...yeah, what Amaeliya said.  Exactly.<br>
<br>
Words cannot express exactly how much I can identify with everything you just said.  I could never figure out why I felt so uncomfortable in crowds, or around people.  I always thought it was shyness or something wrong with me.  Figured out that I hate people.  The world if full of all manner of shitty people and nice people who just don't seem quite &quot;right.&quot;  Not sure which makes me more uncomfortable... hehe.<br>
<br>
And I've had those months where the number one thought in my head is &quot;well, damn, what am I going to do with myself?  I'm so far behind in the race.&quot;  I had some horrible horrible dark times, hating myself for feeling as though I somehow did not measure up to someone else's standards of life, looks, and love.  Just get so bogged down in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
After a while, though, I learned to take a step back from it all.  It always feels worse when you're flailing in the middle of hell and suddenly don't know which way is up.<br>
<br>
So maybe try what Amaeliya said.  Take a step back and into a nice bath (I don't care how unmasculine it sounds, it feels damn good!), with some good music (keeping the electrical equipment AWAY from the tub, of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   because you could be as clumbsy as me and accidentally ruin an otherwise lovely night, hehe) or go on a vacation.  Work on your diet, work on relaxing, get some sleep.  And if you still can't find the comfort you desire, go for the help you think you may need.  <br>
<br>
But really... disgusting people are not a good enough reason to drive yourself crazy over <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The only actions you can control are your own, not Lee's, no matter how much he may need a good bleaching.  Thinking about the magnitude of scumball he may be will probably get exhausting.<br>
<br>
Anyway... sleep well Kundow, Ok?  I hope you feel a little better in the morning. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>+ B R Y N V I N + S I N E S T R E +</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

At 22 you should mostly be past the teenage phase of suicidalism but anyway, having a scumbag for an office mate would make me want to puke too.<br>
<br>
a) get a new job... doesn't matter what, just anything =P<br>
b) eat right, sleep right<br>
<br>
I consider myself to have a pretty good constitution.  But a lot of that I think has to do with the fact I try to eat right and I sleep the 8 hrs a day rather than be tired all the friggin time. Yes, it means I have less time to do personal things (wave EQ) but I FEEL BETTER.  If I get 'just' 6 hrs a day for a couple of days in a row, I start feeling fuzzy and woosy and it's not a pretty thing. I know friends that did a 3 or 4hr stunt for a while, night after night after night. I'ts NOT healthy for you.<br>
<br>
That said, if you still feel fucked up after getting some sleep, see a doctor.  Yeah, medication sucks, but there are some things that will mess you up, and you will be happier on medication.  I'd prefer the non-medication route when possible (cheaper and less stressful too, those medical companies dont make it easy to get reimbursed!) but hey, sometimes you gotta. Like having diabeties, take your medication =P<br>
<br>
Ps: we got a guy at work here that i swear showers once a month.  And he works on the trash/cleaning crew.  Most of them are fine, but he... well, I try to stay upwind. It's bad!

<br>
Start looking for a new job.  Seriously.<br>
<br>
Your words draw clear pictures in my mind.  Those feelings of disgust for humanity.  They are actually feelings of frustration, mixed with anger/hate for being an outcast, for not having a click, for thinking the grass may be greener in some other pasture, because some people really do suck, and others make us feel like crap because we think they have it so much better.  Both sides of the spectrum.<br>
<br>
I hate that feeling.  I never fit in.  Even when I was on a sports team in highschool and college.  I do miss the commraderie and the adventure of it, and even when I was in various extra curricular clubs.  The jocks were always the other guys, and the nerds were always the other guys.  <br>
<br>
Later I found out some thought I was a nerd, and some referred to me as one of the jocks.  /boggle <br>
<br>
At least when I moved here during high school in '91 the kids ignored me instead of when I was harassed as the new kid when I moved to a new town during middle school.<br>
<br>
Yes I remember the hate, the burning rage.  You need to get away from the people who suck.  You are too old to beat the shit out of them, unless you want to see jail time.  I am happy I got to lay some smack down when I was 12 &amp; 13. <br>
<br>
Hah 12-13 sounds so young, omg, 2 years before highschool, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>but I was only half way to my blackbelt.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
I wasted my tormentor, an older bully, a real psycho ...in the end he left me alone, but only after I gave him a broken nose and arm, and a shit load of bruises.  That f*cker tormented me no longer (later he was expelled from highschool his freshman year when he blew-up someone's locker, I was still in middle school then).  (his name is Eric Barros, I wonder if he plays EQ.  /grin)<br>
<br>
The bastard could not even press charges after I beat the shit out of him since he instigated the fight.<br>
<br>
Though he came back later and destroyed my parent's garden and bashed in our front door with one a 15 pound stepping stones from the garden and then threw the stone through the kitchen window....Well, =) I will never forget the scene when the police pulled into his driveway and took him away. (he lived 2 houses down from me in the coul'de'sac where I lived at the time.<br>
<br>
And then to learn he already had a police record, and he was just 15...<br>

I know these feelings are testosterone based.  I feel it still some days.<br>
<br>
I remember at one time wanting to hate everyone, having disgust for humanity.  It was easy at one time to think there is no good person out there.  Such is a dark place to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fack I keep deleting my suggestions, rewriting ...<br>
<br>
<br>
It is so depressing.  I can only guess we are all like this, life is still a solitary experience.<br>
<br>
But don't give up on it yet.  And do not let anyone attach themselves to you just so they can lean on you, you won't be happy unless 'the leaning' is a mutual thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do not ever own a gun.  I have many times realized how grateful I was for not having an easily accessable firearm.<br>
<br>
I have a compound bow (and love it), but that is different.  I can't kill myself with a compound bow.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
The darkest feelings always subside and I realize life is not so bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
To those reading this, these feelings are the darkest feelings which one can have, and if you can not relate, then good for you, but do not consider us f*cked up.<br>
<br>

<br>
This last Tuesday I was at a restaurant/pub with an old school friend who I befriended in 1992, and after his wife and son left we talked about the past, and to me it really did seem like a different life, it has always been a good life, I just accentuated the darkest feelings in this post.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fack I know I will regret posting this.  I hate reading what I have written. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Decided today to stop giving a shit about a few things.  I'm letting my hair grow out, and my goatee, just because I don't give a shit.  Going to keep up with my Taoism studies, and going to start eating right.  I have to, I am pretty screwed up physically, bum knee, bad back, and something wrong with my ahoulder I have no idea about...anyway...I dunno, things overall have been better recently, although I still hate people.<br>
<br>
Going to get my ass in gear, get back in school when I start the new job, get back into making music, get my audio production degree, and get a real job.<br>
<br>
Just hope I can keep the dedication to straightening out.  I need a nice girlfriend...hmm...I should get on that too.  That would help a lot. (I'm loooooonely)<br>

Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Bleh ok nevermind you'll probably mistake the humor for me just being another sickening pervert of the world.<br>
<br>
Seriously, find someone you're happy with. You need it to offset the time you spend with people you're unhappy with, you need it to make yourself feel more secure about who you are.<br>
You find yourself in a hell of a catch 22 in trying to do this though. Nobody fits the bill and seems to match you. Well, make a compromise, you can't have god for a girlfriend. Find the things you do like about people, and look for people that have those qualities. You aren't perfect, and you can't expect anyone else to be either. Just keep that in mind, and you'll eventually find you're happier with broader horizons, and you won't miss the past at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roawen>Roawen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bow down!<br>

<br>
I, PoRoawen, would not be alive on this earth without them. Twice over.<br>
They saved me from myself, and from someone else who was not being very nice to me until they started meds.<br>
<br>
I really dont understand that whole &quot;no medicine of any kind for me please&quot; attitude (and im not trying to be rude, really... its just how it comes out when i type it)... I mean you injest all kinds of other chemicals when you eat, or drink, or breathe. So whats the difference if you're taking a pill that makes you feel better?<br>
Im not really a huge fan of taking medicine either, which sounds hypocritical i know... I know my limits of what i can and cant handle. And if I have a kick me in the ass headache, you can be damn sure I'll be looking for the Advil bottle.<br>
<br>
I guess the crux of it is, I dont know where the stigma about anti-depressants comes from. Why is it a bad thing? It helps people. It makes them feel better. It makes them function more normally. It helps a person get themselves under control...<br>
Its not a little magic happy pill. You dont eat one and suddenly everything in the world is happy, and you are floating on cloud nine...<br>
It just evens the world out a little bit... so you dont feel so so horrid. And the tiny miniscule things dont make you so angry or frusterated. Yeah, they still annoy you, but you have the capacity to step back and say, ya know thats not important enough for me to get worked up over.<br>
And for people like my &quot;someone else&quot; it makes them not so horridly irrational and violent. It gives you the ability to chill out, take a deep breath, and calm down.<br>
<br>
I reccomend Paxil. For me, it was my savior. Not to metion it helps with anxiety around people... going to class was a lot easier after Paxil.<br>

<br>
Depression is a serious medical condition that is biological in nature.<br>
There are many and varied triggers, however, one thing is certain, it IS a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that it is NOT something someone can just &quot;snap out of&quot;.<br>
NOR is it anything to be ashamed off.<br>
Depression is one of the top 5 diseases suffered in the world.<br>
<br>
Anti-depressants are not the &quot;be all and end all&quot;, obviously counselling and other &quot;non-pharmaceutical&quot; treatments should be used in conjunction with drug therapy.<br>
However, if a person is diagnosed with a clinical depression, I believe it is very important to start some form of antidepressant.<br>
The newer class of antidepressants, being those of the SSRI and SNRI groups are safer, cleaner, and have less side effects.<br>
Your Dr would of course choose the most appropriate for you.<br>
<br>
Anti depressants wont work overnight, nor will they &quot;change your life&quot;. What they do is get you back to a level where you are in control once more, and are more able to deal with the problems that may have contributed to the depression in the first place.<br>

The one that worked for me was a movie store. Most of the people who work in that sort of place have an interest in a good story, appreciate whats appropriately funny, and are not complete stoner/idiot/asshole sickos.<br>
<br>
 Also a couple of other possibilities are coffeshop, bookstore, places where they sell stuff your interested in. NOT FOOD! Snacks are ok, but the foodservice industry is a nightmare in general.<br>
<br>
 If you're having trouble with other people being all crowded next to ya, you might try a telephone related industry like telemarketing or tech support. The little cubicle would make the difference<br>
<br>
On the medication front, Prozac and the like are pretty effective, but it's a lot better just to fix the problem if it's a situational depression. Also from how you described it you might also talk to your doctor or possibly a psychiatrist about the unsettling feeling in crowds.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showPrevMessage?topicID=196.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showNextMessage?topicID=196.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=196.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.threadControl?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57>Apep's Coffee Talk</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
