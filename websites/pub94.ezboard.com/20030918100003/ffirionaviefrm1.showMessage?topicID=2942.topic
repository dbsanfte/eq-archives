Check this FAQ!</span><hr size=1> Hi there everyone,<br>
<br>
seeing as how we have had quite a few new people asking questions lately, and the appropriate thread in the coffe shop has not been updated since before the May 8th patch I thought I would get started on a new New to Firiona Vie FAQ thread. If you mods already have something in the works feel free to delete this. I would also like for others in the community to view and correct/add things as needed. then maybe move it to coffee shop with a sticky pointing to it in the general forum. as thats where most new people seem to post first for some reason.<br>
<br>
Q: What is the best/most needed class/race to play on this <br>
     Server?<br>
<br>
A. Play what you have the most fun playing. You are<br>
    allowed  only one character per account. So make your<br>
    choice  wisely. People for the most part on this server are <br>
    not going to judge you by your class or race (Exception <br>
    being RP reasons). Your ability to play your class and <br>
    interact with the community are far more important here <br>
    than other servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I heard there are alignment restrictions on this server I.E. <br>
     goods not allowed to group with/buff evils. is this true?<br>
<br>
<br>
A:  No this is not true anyone may group with or buff anyone<br>
     else without penalty. Again RP and possible guild rules<br>
     may be exceptions. This was changed with the May 8th<br>
     patch<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What is TLC(Trivial Loot Code)?<br>
<br>
<br>
A. TLC or Trivial Loot Code is the server wide rule which works<br>
     as follows. If you or any member of your group does not <br>
     Gain experience form a Mob any Magic or Lore items that<br>
     the mob would normally drop will not drop. You will see <br>
     instead &quot;the mob_01 was trivial to you/your party&quot;<br>
     message. (I think I got this right please double check )<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: I heard that most things here are not no drop is this true?<br>
<br>
<br>
A: Yes the vast majority of things on this server are not no <br>
     drop and can be traded. Exceptions being most  epic <br>
     quest pieces, epics and certain items which would be<br>
     considered game unbalancing by Verant if the were not no <br>
     drop.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: This is the role play preffered server. Do I have to roleplay?<br>
<br>
<br>
A: No you do not have to roleplay here, However I would<br>
    suggest that you do try roleplaying as I think you will find<br>
    your gaming experience more enjoyable if you do. If you<br>
    decide Roleplaying is not for you please be respectful to<br>
     those who do roleplay<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: What classes are needed for the high level/end game here?<br>
<br>
A: If your only reason for comming here is to get in a high end<br>
    raiding guild for uber gear and loot. You are probably<br>
    coming here for the wrong reasons. I would suggest you go<br>
    to the guilds section and find out wich guilds are currently <br>
    doing the high/end game content and see what they are <br>
    looking for first. (almost want to add  and then go play<br>
     somewhere else)<br>
    <br>
<br>
Q: I heard this was a low population server will this affect my <br>
    ability to get groups?<br>
<br>
<br>
A: For tyring to get pickup groups in non popular zones or<br>
    during non peak hours getting a pick up group may prove  <br>
    dificult. However if you take the time to make friends during<br>
    your regular playing hours you can usually find enough <br>
    People to put a group together to go do something. Make<br>
    lots and lots of friends. And joining a good guild would also <br>
    be recommended. There a lots of good ones out there to<br>
    to choose from.<br>
<br>
<br>
Important info:<br>
<br>
The excessive use of shout/ auction in non appropriate zones <br>
is highly frowned on by many people on this server and abusing these commands is a good way to get yourself put on many peoples ignore lists.<br>
<br>
Do not beg. The community at large is very friendly and helpful but does not take well to those who do not at least make some kind of effort on their own. You will get more help by going out and doing stuff than by begging for plat or items.<br>
Begging is probably the only thing that will get you put on ignore faster than abusing shout.<br>
<br>
<br>
whew lots of typing there. Please be tolerant of spelling errors and grammer. I threw this together as a rough draft at work without a spellcheck.<br>

<br>
Q. I heard there were no twinks on Firiona Vie, but I saw a level 10 with X gear. What gives?<br>
<br>
A. In the most common usage of the word, a twink is an alt character onto which someone has loaded improbably high-level gear gathered with another character on the same account. On Firiona Vie, you can only have one character per account, so this is much less common (although it does occur occasionally with people who have multiple *accounts*). However, it is very possible that you are seeing someone who has chosen to re-roll their character, and has passed their equipment down from the previous incarnation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q. No, seriously, what class should I play? What's needed at the high end game? What's needed on the server?<br>
<br>
A. We already told you. Besides, in the time it takes you to get to the &quot;high end game&quot;, the situation could have changed completely. The game and the server are constantly changing. Play what you will enjoy. <br>
<br>
<br>
Q. What if I come up with a new way to word the question?<br>
<br>
A. We'll still tell you to play what you enjoy. <br>

Just recently: A light skinned elven rogue of 43 comes across 3 dark elves of 30 seasons and below and asks them for a Spirit of the wolf. Then puts on a mask of deception and changes to a DE right in front of them, thinking he'll get more friendly answers from them.<br>

#1 The dark elves saw the lightly when he was light and change right in front of them<br>
#2 NO dark elf can cast a spirit on the wolf on anyone<br>

What is FAQ?  Is this server too difficult to start on (seems unique)?  I read up on the game and various classes and races.  After finally loading it up, I knew I wanted to be a healer.  I played 3 classes to 10 to get the hang of them.  <br>
<br>
All 3 classes were healers.  Cleric was not that exciting.  Druid seemed interesting and they port people around the worlds (I think).  I read they can solo but not as demanded in a group.  However to my surprise, I really dug the Shaman.  From what I read they are a nice compromise (group and solo).  So, here go my questions:<br>
<br>
1)  Is my idea that Shamans are a nice compromise between the 2 for groups and solo?  It appears they are offensive which I like.<br>
<br>
2) Regarding this server, should I start here or some other server?<br>
<br>
3) If I pick a race for a Shaman, I am torn between Barbarian (tried him but I hate their zones and I can't see), Troll (I like the looks but big) or an Iksar (smallest which I like but I looked in their zone and got lost and died ALOT).  Any pros and cons are appreciated.<br>
<br>
4)  I will play later and need to be versatile.<br>
<br>
5)  Any recommendations on what to put points.  I thought I would put all my points into wisdom.<br>
<br>
Hopefully these are not the same stupid questions.  I figured out what FAQ meant as I was about to ask that question!<br>
<br>

No one owes you ANYTHING unless you've done something important to them. So you cannot beg anything out of anyone just because they have cool equipment or are high in season than you.<br>
<br>
No's in general:<br>
Begging in general<br>
Player harassment<br>
Shouting useless crap<br>
Using roleplay as a defense for ooc stuff Ex: DE steals an item when he says he'll return it ooc but doesn't and claims that because he's evil he can do that.<br>
Hacking in general<br>
Cheating in general<br>
Saying &quot;It's just a game&quot; in defense of whatever you did above. People take the time to get their equipment and you also need to remember that there is real people behind those PC avatars you're talking to. You can harrass an NPC all you want but DO NOT harrass the real people<br>

Whether that member is too low (mob super red) or too high (mob green) makes no difference.  If the TLC kicks in on the mob you've killed, you will see, in red:<br>
<br>
A_Insert_mob_here_01 was a Trivial Challenge to your party!<br>
<br>
This is how you know the TLC got ya.  And whatever magic or lore item that normally would have dropped, did not.<br>
<br>
Simple really.  The way the TLC changes the game dynamics is that you must conduct certain quests before they are too easy for you, and the harder quests and some raids now have what's called a &quot;TLC Team&quot; of lower-level PC's whose job it is to specifically kill the mob from which the drop is needed.<br>
<br>
My first experience with this was in Castle Mistmoore, where I was on the TLC team.  We had 3 teams of higher season (a level on Firona Vie is usually called a &quot;season&quot; for warriors and wisdom casters, a &quot;circle&quot; for intelligence casters, and a &quot;symphony&quot; or &quot;song&quot; for Bards...but it's really up to your imagination what you want to call your levels, just as long as you can be understood and you don't use the word &quot;level&quot; which is just SO d00d. ugh.) players running &quot;air cover&quot; for the TLC team, which had its own healer, nuker, and tank team.  It worked.  We integrated well and got what we needed.<br>
<br>
It also makes the young ones more valuable to the old ones.  On other servers, once you hit the high end game, you don't have much use for &quot;newbies&quot; anymore.  On Firiona Vie, it's common practice to hire lower level people to do quests, or to assist in quests that you have become too high for.  On a positive side, the TLC promotes cooperation and the use of real people skills to get what you want.<br>
<br>
You want Jboots?  You can't just level up to 60 and camp the AC anymore...he'll TLC out and you'll never get them.  So you have to make a deal with someone younger who can still get EXP from that AC...or you must do it yourself when there is still quite an element of risk.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the TLC brought back into line a lot of the original intents for the quests and the drops that the &quot;no drop&quot; code was intended to fix but didn't.<br>
<br>
Yes, it can be a hassle.<br>
<br>
Yes, it takes some getting used to.<br>
<br>
But it makes sure that those who are SUPPOSED to kill the proper mobs at the proper levels...do.  And pharming becomes just another dangerous way to make money...but you can still do it.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1) Is my idea that Shamans are a nice compromise between the 2 for groups and solo? It appears they are offensive which I like.<br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Shamans can be seriously offensive, especially when they overpull.  Just kidding.  Shamans have a place in the game just like every other.  If you like it, go for it.  Keep in mind, though: <br>
1) Druids get port and snare and track, Shamans don't.  <br>
2) Shamans get a kickass pet at 34  <br>
3) Clerics are the only pure caster class that can rez and they will always have the best and most mana-efficient heals, AND they are a &quot;plate&quot; class, meaning they can wear PLATE ARMOR, which has the highest AC.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2) Regarding this server, should I start here or some other server?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Honestly, I always recommend that a true newbie (not meant to be derogatory...I just mean someone new to the game and its mechanics) try out a regular blue server first, to learn the mechanics, where /ooc exists, you can ask game mechanics questions without getting dirty looks, and you can find groups and learn things from other players.  I've found that two kinds of people flocked to Firiona Vie:  The experienced veterans who have 50+ characters on one or more servers, and true newbies, who run around saying &quot;How do I do this?  What's this thing mean?  I pay my money to play this game how come you all are being mean to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
We're not being mean, we're playing In Character, because that's what we came here to do.  Learn the game on a server where it is easier to learn the game, THEN come to Firiona Vie and experience a real role-playing experience.  It still exists, though many of us are disillusioned with it because of many of the &quot;Lewt D00ds&quot; who have come here to take advantage of the server rules.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3) If I pick a race for a Shaman, I am torn between Barbarian (tried him but I hate their zones and I can't see), Troll (I like the looks but big) or an Iksar (smallest which I like but I looked in their zone and got lost and died ALOT). Any pros and cons are appreciated.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You will find that playing the &quot;evil&quot; races are more difficult here, because in character, the &quot;lighty&quot; race PC's may shun you merely because you are of an evil race, and you can't raise faction with THEM.  You may find yourself refused groups for In Character reasons (Like a Paladin refusing to fight alongside a Shadowknight of ANY race, for instance)<br>
<br>
Playing an &quot;evil&quot; character is harder on almost every server, but this one has a few more handicaps than others, and you should seriously consider this when you roll up your one and only character to play here.  Keep in mind also that this will be the only character you have, so you cannot escape to an Alt if you screw up.  All you can do is rename (which is expensive) or re-roll (which is frustrating).  So it is important to know these things before you take the plunge.  Another reason to try out all the races on a blue server before coming here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4) I will play later and need to be versatile.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Versatility is good.  When you say &quot;Later&quot; what do you mean?  There are EQ players worldwide, across almost every time zone on Earth.  Of course the most populous times will be US Prime Time, but you could conceivably find a group just about anytime...I know I have.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5) Any recommendations on what to put points. I thought I would put all my points into wisdom.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If you're a Wisdom caster, such as a Shaman, a Druid, a Cleric, a Ranger, a Paladin, or a Beastlord (did I miss anyone?) Then Wisdom is your most important trait, as not only does it determine how much mana you have, it also determines how quickly your skills advance. (Technically it will be either Intelligence or Wisdom, whichever is higher, but not both).<br>
<br>
If you're an intelligence caster, such as an Enchanter, a Necromancer, a Magician, or a Wizard, then putting your points into Wisdom is a complete waste.<br>
<br>
If you're not a caster at all...then you should put those points somewhere where they will do some good.  Stamina is an all around good place to put points, because that determines the number of hit points you will have.<br>
<br>
But really, there are guides for basic character creation on sony's website, as well as many other places on the Net...which have much better data than I can provide here on the nuances of what points put where, do.  Better off to go there and read up on whatever class you are choosing.<br>
<br>
I wish you good luck, and welcome to EverQuest.  If you decide that Firiona Vie is where you wish to be, then by all means roll up your character and start your reputation.<br>
<br>
Remember that your reputation is much more critical here because you only have ONE character.  You will see people on blue servers acting in a rude, belligerent, or downright nasty manner;  This is known as &quot;blue trash&quot; and that, in part, is what we have come here to get away from.  So guard your reputation, for that is how ye shall be known in this Realm.<br>
<br>
Good hunting!<br>

That's a good website for class information for newbies and veterans alike.  Scroll down to where it says Class Areas, click on the class you want to read about.

<br>
For roleplaying you distinguish between the characters and the players. Characters are the &quot;persons&quot; in the everquest world (for example the woodelf druid or the troll shaman) and players are people who sit on their pc and play the characters Roleplaying is acting like you are the character you play and like the otheres are the characters that they play. Just think what your druid or your evil cleric will do and do it. There are no rules about it just common sense, but be prepared to get rough answers when you speak in a rough manner to another character. Just keep in mind, not you are getting attacked but maybe your character is.<br>

Another way to look at it would be like this. Your Avatar, or Character, or whatver you want to call him is a part of a big play =) No matter what you do, or do not do, you will affect how others around you play. By interacting, you might change their mind about what they were going to do, albiet subtly, or perhaps help them confirm they want to go there.. or in-action, they continue as they were before, and perhaps if it was a person under attack and low on health, die.. but it's just a game =) I'm assuming you know that at 10+ you need to get yer body back hehe =) Here's another last thought for you.. think of EQ as a huge stage, and you are your character ina  an impossibly huge Impromptu Play.... That is alot like what an rp is anyway... I came here from UO, and before that several table top rpg's... Wether in those games or this, it's a good way to act. Also, as an evil race don't be afraid to play you're character the way you feel fit for him/her to be played! For instance, if a dark elf encountered a wood elf they might say IC something like &quot;Thou art a pathetic disgrace! Truly a waste of space! I have absolutely NO reason to help preserve thine continued existance!&quot; You know? as long as you let em knoew OOC that you were adressing their char and not them, most people won't be offended =P<br>

<br>
Think back to when you were a kid playing cops and robbers, cowboys and indians, or superheroes and super villains.  That was roleplaying, simple and basic. This is the best way I have thought of to explain roleplay to anyone that does not have any idea what to do, and it usually works well. <br>
<br>
While the actors in a play scenario is a good way to explain it, some folks may not get the gist from that, as they have never &quot;acted in a play&quot; before.  I can't think of anyone who hasn't played cops and robbers, doctor, or house when they were kids, so this is something almost everyone can relate to.<br>

<br>
I'm new to this board, and I'll skip the formalities for a sec. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  First, my quick 2 coppers about this whole TLC bit. Personally for me, it is going to be difficult to get used to it, and to tolerate in some sense. I know the most predominate consequence of farming by 133t players d3wdz is the inflation of the game market (I can't stand it myself), but I believe exceptions should be made, or should have been made. Best example would be a no drop utility item like JBoots. It's a one of a kind item, restricted to one section of the world of Norrath. What would an Iksar, who spent most of his life in Kunark and have never heard of Antonnica, do once he's discovered these boots do in fact exist, but has already progressed too far into his levels? It would've been fair if there were exceptions to the TLC rule, especially for items people can't even trade anyway. After all there is only one character per RP server account, so the account can't exactly &quot;farm&quot; for his alternate toons.<br>

This is all nitpicking heh, but in anycase, I'm planning to begin anew again on FV soon. I am a 3 year player (beta-ed EQ from the start and played up to the Velious expansion) but eventually, RL took priority and a lot of guild politics (on Povar) and crap convinced me it was time to go. 2 years later, I have that EQ itch back to start all over again, at level 1. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I look forward to maybe meeting some of you in the game soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2942.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2942.topic&start=41&stop=52>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2942.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2942.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2942.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=2942.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2942.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2942.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
