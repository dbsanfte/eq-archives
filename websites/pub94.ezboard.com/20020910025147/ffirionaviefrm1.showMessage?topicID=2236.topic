<br>
I was very impressed about the story 'Flight from Felwithe' so far, and will continue to read it with interest. I feel tempted to step in it as well, but RP-wise I don't feel fit, at least right now. Maybe later, maybe never.<br>
But, that's not the matter I want to discuss here. The point is the poem above. As I see many adventurers tend to choose the road less traveled by. Many are outcasts, renegades, people who fled from home, orphans, people who don't know their past, offspring from forbidden love affairs, and so on. Ok, that's great, and makes an interesting story as well!<br>
But now I look at myself. I also think I am walking a road less traveled by: I promote the lovely and joyful side of Innoruuk and necromancy. But I don't RP as outcast, nor renegade, nor something else mentioned above.<br>
And I feel the need to ask myself: What am I actually? Hm, and I don't have an answer, and least not now. I'm not looking for a tautologic answer, like 'I am Teiraa', that's a bit too simple...<br>
Maybe rather: I'm someone who wants the abnormal be the normal.<br>
But still I'm not quite satisfied with that answer....<br>
<br>
Anybody can understand what I want to say? Maybe it's a bit cryptic...<br>

Isharra had quite a lovely, wonderful upbringing, and she would probably also have a content, happy marriage whether she loves Gareth or not, but she didn't give herself a chance to have that. So, in a sense, she is causing her own troubles by having left, and she knows that. <br>
<br>
Who knows what will happen in her story, but one of the things she beats herself up over is not just marrying Gareth and settling down, like a proper Lady. She's not self-righteous in her rebellion... rather, she's self-castigating.<br>

I don't mind playing a Koada'Dal cleric who learns that there is something different in Cronadan, but what I liked about Cronadan is that he didn't demand to be accepted and he did not criticize other &quot;lighties&quot; for not accepting him. He knows all too well how cruel his people can be, and he doesn't try and convince anyone that his people are good folks. He just does what he does, and if lighties recognize it as a sign of his &quot;goodness&quot; then he accepts their friendship. If they don't, he doesn't demand acceptance. At least in all my experiences with Cronadan that's been the case. <br>

And Teiraa, though I'm not positive what you're looking for, I'd say you're also a Unique.  And not &quot;the same kinda unique as tons of others&quot;, just your own kind.  From what I've seen among the characters with any degree of over-the-top roleplay, Unique is the norm, not the exception.<br>

Maybe you also had that experience that you feel 'sort of question' in your mind, but don't even know what the question is. And that makes it a bit hard to express ones mind and to talk about it. But thank you all for your nice input!<br>
Actually it is not a burning question I need a quick answer. I'm quite happy with myself so far.<br>
A rebel? Maybe that's better. But maybe I'm rather a rebel defining myself as not being a rebel at all... sort of...<br>
<br>
And speaking of Cronadan, yes he's a great exception. And a wonderful roleplayer. But though we are from the same race and in the same guild we are quite different in our basic beliefs, though some are similar. Teiraa also knows all too well how cruel her people can be, and she is ashamed of it, but she is rather patriotic (you could also say racist<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), and still tries to convince anybody that her people are good folks, or at least can be. That's the difference (well, and she has to do it, otherwise she would have to give up her profession, actually). IC I explain the difference by the fact that Cronadan has Feir'dal blood in his veins.<br>
<br>
&quot;not the same kinda unique as tons of others&quot;, *blush*, well, actually all of you are! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>

Now I realise that things did not work out exactly as I planned.

Cadien, nothing goes as planned. And that's the interesting thing here on Norrath. And I have the same experience: When I was young I joined an 'evil' guild, as almost everybody young Teir'dal does, and if it had been a guild with strong beliefs and principles it would have absorbed me, and most probably I would have become somebody different than I am now, probably!<br>
It is very hard for a Teir'dal to look beyond the fence, we are tied by our guilds, our fellow dark elfies, our old friends (or even loved ones) from early adventuring, the quests we have to do, and the fact that we are hated almost everywhere, by guards as well as other adventurers. And most importantly: Tied by the common belief 'how we should be' (ooc aka booklet).<br>
But if you feel that slaughter of other innocent elves is wrong, then there is no reason that you should quit that belief. You should rather fight for justice and peace then. A fight that can not only be done by the sword, but also by words and patience. And there are so many different ways to do this fight. I do it with words, I'm proud of my dark heritage but teach everybody that it is possible to follow Innoruuk and not to do all those cruel things which are done by others in His name. Another possible way (what Cronadan does) is that you turn away from Neriak and become a renegade. If you work hard, you'll be accepted in Kelethin, Felwithe and other places. That's extremely hard and time-consuming, but most people of the light races will accept you. And the third possible way is, that you stay together with these people doing evil things, that you maybe even join an 'evil' guild, and try to moderate their bloodlust in small steps, a word here, a deed there, or simply a good example for the other young Teir'dal, and I'm sure you won't be alone there and will succeed to some degree.<br>
If you want to prevent violence against innocent, you have a hard task. There are different ways to help here, different fronts to fight at. But we all share at least the same basic principles.<br>
Speak with the people, Cadien, speak with the other Teir'dal, speak with the high elves, the wood elves. Show them who you really are, protector of elves. Not all will believe you, but some will, and they are worth it! <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>
