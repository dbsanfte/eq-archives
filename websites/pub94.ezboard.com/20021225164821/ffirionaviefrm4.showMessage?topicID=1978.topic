<br>
Something I hate:<br>
Sad, weak people writing lame posts attempting to ruin the reputation of another player on a message board they may or may not even read.<br>
<br>
I for one am instantly suspicious of anyone posting about another player giving their names.  Especially if the other party is not there to defend themselves.<br>
<br>
So, I know most of you dont care, but flame without cause and you'll find me adding you to my 'sad gimp' list of people to ignore in game.<br>

<br>
I personally dont see the point of posting a flame against someone if they dont read the board. Kind of a waste of time and effort.<br>
<br>
There are times I want a name attached to an act. In case I choose to venture forth much in FV, it is nice to know who to avoid. I am not one of the people that instantly assumes someone is lieing when they post a name. We have a few of those, they will champion ANYONE that gets named for any offensive no matter how damning the evidence or number of people that tell you it happened. Just curious when you think naming is acceptable? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeldagisravensoul>Zeldagis Ravensoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nearly invisible,<br> Totally Moronic</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/02 1:15:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1978.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Flaming without cause</span><hr size=1> I think whining on the boards about someone's actions in and of itself is lame.  I'll join in the flamefest of a person who did something stupid (Yar :P ), but I do it for fun and enjoyment, not some sort of &quot;boy, I can now avoid that person&quot;.  Call me shallow, but coming to this board to whine about someone else's actions only shows me that you aren't mature enough to handle the matter yourself (of course there are exceptions, like trade scams, ect).  I also don't think you should petition unless it's bug related.  There really are few times you actually need to petition anything, most of the time the situation can be resolved, but a lot of people are too lazy to take the time to do it.  It's easier to /report and /petition.  To me, thats the same as running home to mommy and daddy.<br>
<br>
In short, there are too many hall monitors on this board, but that's the nature of it.  I accept it as it is and have fun mocking and ridiculing others.  I guess I'm easily amused.<br>
<br>
As to naming names, it adds to the stupidity on the board, so therefore it should stay.  In a perfect world, people would suck it up and figure it out themselves, this board is proof that the world ain't close to perfect.<br>

Like it or not, sometimes there is a RL jerk behind the keyboard. I ran into someone in HK that refused to respect our camp. I did a search and contacted a higher member of his guild who then contacted him. He would not even answer the tells from his guild member, but he did suddenly decide to move elsewhere. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have met other members of this guild that were very nice.

But if this situation had persisted and the other guild member had ben nonchalant or rude then I would post both his name and guild here. <br>
It's not an unreasonable flame if Ansur (that's me) is running around pulling from your camp and being rude, to come here and say it (assuming you have already tried to resolve it ingame). Good or bad, a reputation is usually earned. Anyone who has met me ingame and dealt or grouped with me is welcome to mention my name on this board.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ettenok>EtteNoK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/02 10:02:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1978.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Flaming without cause</span><hr size=1> I like losing battles =) but this one's too far for me, I have to /agree with these people there are times posting a name could definately come in handy =D<br>

That's the nice thing about this server, we stick up for each other and try and help each other out.  That's the main reason people post what some people call whining.  Not to whine, but to inform.<br>

Contrary to public opinion, most of us do not make a snap judgement based on one negative post here.  It is when we see a pattern of behavior that opinions are truly formed.<br>

<br>
This is the kind of story we like to see here:<br>
<br>
A person, whom we will call, for rhetorical purposes, by the d00d name Poptart Megafart, does something bad (like, say, intentionally training).  Poptart responds to your polite requests to stop with a big steaming FU!  Newb001 (the one trained) contact's Poptart's guild, and seeks a resolution.  Poptart's guild responds with a big steaming FU!  Newb001 then petitions, spends 3 hours waiting for a GM, who finally responds with &quot;sorry, didn't see it can't help you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Newb001 then comes to this board and states their beef, whereupon the FV community fans the flames and eat's popcorn.  <br>
<br>
Poptart Megafart then comes here and points out that Newb001 is a total lamer and a newb loser so no one should believe him and since Poptart is level 57 and a 9/16ths, and since he needs a fungi and a foot rub he was totally justified in training Newb001 on 8 seperate occasions and the entire FV community is just flaming him because they are jealous of his short sword of the ykesha.<br>
<br>
Whereupon Poptart's guild comes to the Soapbox to point out that Newb001 is a total lamer who consorts with Al Queda and that no one should believe him and he's just trying to sully their image and that the other people who posted about the 6 other incidents of intential training are just jealous because Poptart's up and coming uberguild just took out Fippy Darkpaw and didn't share the phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, while the above story is silly, all too often actual events posted here often mirror it.  Do disgruntled people come here to extract their pound of flesh, and in the process sully the good name of honorable guilds?  Of course.<br>
<br>
But something tells me that, at least on occasion, some people who are in fact at fault come here and whine about the fact that someone had the cajones to stick their name, or the name of their guild, out here in public where the community can judge their actions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maladominus>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ak'Anon Sex Symbol</span><br>  Posts: 1038<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/02 7:48:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1978.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  bapsmear, a new word</span><hr size=1> I decided that today I would invent a new word. <br>
