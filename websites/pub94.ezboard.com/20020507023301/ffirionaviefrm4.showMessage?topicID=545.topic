If you don't know me, I'm a level 58 enchanter. I had been working on my epic for months. Wednesday night we got the FINAL drop I needed, but it was very late and I had work in the morning so I had to camp.<br><br>So last night (thursday night) I was going to do the turn-in after helping my guild take down a couple dragons. During the second one I died. I got a click res as usual, looted everything, sat down, medded to full mana. I somehow became &quot;group bugged&quot; (very common), so I sat down and camped out real fast (like usual to clear the bug).  When I get to the character select screen, i'm displayed in the &quot;no robe&quot; newbie look, odd I think but I've seen bugs like that so not yet concerned, and I re-enter world (maybe 3 seconds after camping).<br><br>After I load, the first odd thing i notice is that my mana is gone and i have the res effects icon on again. Hmm. I press &quot;i&quot; and...it's all GONE, everything, every equipped item, and every pack. The only thing left is my sebilis key and 20 peridots I had picked up in the bazaar when I died before the res. 3 of the 4 completed parts of staves for my epic were in those packs, as well as 4 more drops to complete the 4th and final part of stave....gone, everything.<br><br>So I'm thinking uhm, I looted my corpse but there has to be one right, because I have nothing. /corpse. &quot;you have no corpses in zone&quot;. bard says, you have no corpses in zone. ok so i'm really screwed. <br><br>/petition OMFG<br>&quot;Hello Guide xyz here, how can I help you?&quot; I tell him the story you just read above. No reply for quite some time....&quot;I'm sorry Lead GM Zel is on vacation until Tuesday, please visit everquestlive.com and submit a form.&quot;...TUESDAY??? It's Thursday, that's 5 days, and I'm thinking 5 days from now they'll never fix this, if they can now even. So I re-explain how bad this situation really is. &quot;Ok I've esacalate this and hopefully another GM from another server will see it.&quot;    I kid you not he used the word &quot;hope&quot;. That was basically the end of the guide. I used my son's pc and account to log onto the chat rooms so I wouldn't miss any tells. There was only one &quot;gm&quot; there (red name), and totally ignored me despite the severity of my claim. I tried calling the tech support # and it was &quot;past business hours&quot;. After 30 minutes or so I get summoned and a GM from another server has me re-tell what's happened. After another wait he tells me I can probably be restored but he lacks the power and will escalate my case, but that I should go submit a form anyway. I say &quot;does this mean I'm not getting this resolved tonite?&quot;.  He says, hopefully but no promises. Using my son's pc i submit thier damn form. So, after a couple hours it's now midnight and no further response. I go linkdead and give up for the night as I had early work this morning. So now I'm at work, unable to sit online praying for someone to magically show up and help me. I don't even know where to start when I get home, guess I'll /petition again, get a guide again, and go through this all over again.... Here's the autoreply I got from my form submittal,  about what you'd expect. I can't wait for someone to finally show up and tell me it's a) too late to restore me or b) they simply can't.<br><br>Greetings Traveler,<br>    Thank you for taking the time to contact me.

Then you quickly looted, and noted that you were bugged.  This bug probably prevented you from properly 'saving' when you camped out.  So when you came back in, it reverted to the last save of your character, which was BEFORE looting.  Unfortunately, the zone was not bugged and properly saved that the corpse had been looted and poofed.<br><br>I have lost items like that before, but never a whole corpse.<br><br>I would imagine the GM, who is very nice, will do a restore.  Your best bet is to use the Contact your Server GM email link from the EQWebsite, I have had excellent response that way.<br><br>The downside is, your problems are caused by the fact that the server did not have a good save of your character at the point when you had your last epic drop, and the last save was with you naked.  So they will have to go to the most recent backup.  This likely means you will lose a bit of XP, and possibly a few items if you got anything very recently.  It most assuredly means you won't have your LP on Epic, and I would be HIGHLY surprised if they conjured one up and handed it to you...  Bu you never know.<br><br>Good luck! :-/<br><br>EDIT: I re-read your post and see the corpse loss occurred some time AFTER getting LP...  So I'd say there is then at least a decent shot you'll get it back.  Good luck! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A> at: 4/19/02 10:39:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukironkeensong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiron Keensong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/19/02 10:45:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=545.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: still in shock - still no help</span><hr size=1> something similar happened to me on another server some month ago. <br>lost my stuff due to &quot;a corrupted save&quot;. that means, the game is unable to save your current situation properly. i went LD and when i came back in, almost everything was lost. petitioned and our server GM on lanys contacted me. he checked the logs and could *much to my pleasure* verify the corrupted save. got everything back immediately.<br><br>only GMs can check for corrupted saves though. <br><br>good luck to you!<br> <p><HTML><BODY><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb.html" ><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/2002/04/17/flamingtext_com_1019035381_13581.gif"<br><br><br>Emissary of the League of Antonican Bards<br>Hero for Hire<br><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=enheduanna>Enheduanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/19/02 11:05:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=545.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: still in shock - still no help</span><hr size=1> That's terrible.

I know the idea of later sucks a lot, but it will be fixed.  Even if the GMs aren't equiped to handle something like this on the spot the records don't clear or anything and it's as fixable a week from now as it was the day is happened.
