The tiny girl runs halfway to the bar before she suddenly stops, her bright blue eyes widening from behind the long silvery hair tousled into her face.  She raises one finger, sprints back to the door, closes it, then runs to slam a thin stack of papers onto the bar.<br>
<br>
With a determined set to her delicate jaw, she turns her widened eyes up to Drixa and says in a childlike voice, &quot;Please, you HAVE to put this up where people can read it!  It's very Important!&quot;  She nods a little to give emphasis to how very important the matter is, then she shyly lowers her eyes back down to the papers, biting her lip.  &quot;See, cause, I sent it to the Ranger Lady, but she didn't listen, and I've got to, I mean we have to...&quot;<br>
<br>
She quickly raises her face again, her crystal blue eyes glistening with tears.  &quot;We have to Save the Pixies!!&quot;  She then buries her face in her hands and sniffles, leaving the papers to be picked up and read.<br>

Deer Ranger Lady,<br>
<br>
Please stop asking people to kill pixies.  I know they're flighty and giggly and can sometimes be really reeeeeally annoying, but they're not trying to burn down the forest.  I promise!  See, cause... I mean...  I mean, that is...<br>
<br>
IT'S ALL MY FAULT!  I didn't mean it and I din't know and I am so SOOOO sorry and I tried to make it better but it just kept getting worse and<br>
<br>
[the remainder of the page is smeared and tear-stained, though the following page is legible]<br>
<br>
Okay, maybe I'd better start at the beginning so you'll see why it's all okay about the pixies.  See, where I was borned, we didn't have fire.  I mean, we HAD it, but we didn't HAVE it.  I mean, we didn't just bring it out willy-nilly cause all of the trees and a lot of my friends were burnable.  And Tunare gets sad when people get burned and you do NOT want to make her sad, cause it makes me cry.  So no fire.  <br>
<br>
But then one time at the nymph camp there was this really BIG fire that just blew up all around me, only it didn't burn so it was really cool and when it faded I wanted to see it AGAIN!  But the fire didn't come back even when I jumped up and down clapping and singing, so I figured I'd go find my friends and brag a little.  Okay, a lot.  A whole lot.<br>
<br>
But see, the thing is, I couldn't find them!  But instead I saw lots of new trees before I got really really lost, and that's when the faeries found me.  They let me stay with them for a while but after they lost their sense of humor (which didn't take long let me tell you, snotty little meanies), well then they decided I should probably go play with the pixies instead.  <br>
<br>
But anyway, this is the important part, that's how I got to be friends with the pixies.  Because it's the pixies that got me to go over into the big forest where the snooty elves live.  We were going to play the FUNNIEST game with Highmoon when I saw my bestest friend in the whole wide world and this hugemongous wasp that was trying to kill him.  So that's when I healed him up and turned his skin to wood (TREE MAN!!) and he saw that I was his bestest friend too and we killed the wasp and that's when we started hanging out together.  I like Kenyon a lot!<br>
<br>
So anyway, it was Kenyon that told me about the coolest toys in the whole world -- MATCHES!  See, they're these little sticks that when you... oh, you probably know.  Well anyway, he said that matches are a very big responsibility, especially in a forest, so I promised I'd be very careful and vigilant for matches.  (In fact, that's such a fun word I'll write it again.  Matches!)  Well you know that pixies like toys, and they were really jealous about my fire story, so I went out looking for all the pixies I could find to make sure THEY didn't have any matches.  They can be irresponsible, you know.<br>
<br>
So while I was out telling all the pixies to be careful about matches, I found the cuuuutest little baby fae drake.  So I said, &quot;Hewwo witto fae drake!  You just a cutest witto hatchling aren't you?  Yes you are!&quot;  And it blinked and said, &quot;Hi Kimaya.&quot;  So to be really careful I asked, &quot;You don't have any matches do you?&quot;  And it shook its little head and I said &quot;Good!&quot;  But before I could run off again, it asked, &quot;What are matches?&quot;  So I said they're little sticks that summon fire, like wizard wands except everyone could use them.  But before I could tell it how they may sound like fun but they're a very big responsibility, it perked and said, &quot;I want matches!&quot;  So I told it all about responsibility, and that if it ever did find matches, it was supposed to take them to Grynn right away.  It promised, so I went off to see what Kenyon was up to.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was quite a time later when I was running back through the forest and I saw the hatchling again.  So I said, &quot;Hewwo witto pretty fae drake!&quot;  And it said, &quot;Hi Kimaya.&quot;  And so I asked, &quot;Did you find any matches?&quot;  And it said, &quot;Yeah.  Matches are fun!  They let me play with them in the ranger place putting fire on candles!&quot;  Then it looked kinda disappointed, but sheepish too.  I asked what was wrong, and it said, &quot;Well, I can't play with matches there anymore cause they said they didn't need me to put fire on the candles.  They said they were out of things they called wicks.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I could tell that there was more, so I put my hands on my hips and leaned forward and tapped my foot until it stopped fidgeting long enough and told me.  &quot;So well, I thought that with the matches I found later, I could light wicks on my own!&quot;  It flittered a little bit, looking around.  &quot;And you know, people say that PIXIES are wick-ed, and...&quot;<br>
<br>
And that's when a little pixie came zoooooooooming by with her hair all on fire putting sparks on trees as she ran into them, screeching, &quot;Extinguish meeeeeeeeeee!&quot;<br>
<br>
I tried to catch her and put her out, I swear I really did.  But as soon as I got her taken care of, there was another one on the other side of the woods!  And they weren't happy.  So now the pixies are playing jokes on the fae drake kids, and those babies are pranking them back, and there's all sorts of games and sparks and all Hate's broke loose, and even the wolves are getting into it!  (It turns out they don't like acorns tied into their tails, who knew?)  It's so you can't even turn into a tree anymore without some big puppy romping around and scrambling at your roots, barking all wild at a bunch of poor little pixies or hatchlings with their wings all tangled up in your twigs.<br>
<br>
So anyway, pixies aren't really bad, they're just victims of circumstance.  Oh, and curiosity.  And baby drakes who don't know any better.  But it's obviously not their fault!  So now that you see how it's all just a big misunderstanding, please stop asking people to kill the pixies.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and please ask Grynn to get babysitters.  I'd offer to help, but I gotta go cut these knots out of my hair again.<br>
<br>
Pixieeeeeees!<br>
<br>
<br>
Yours truely,<br>
