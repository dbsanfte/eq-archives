Well Kimaya, for people like you with high innate wisdom this might work. But unfortunately there are some mage-like people around like me who have to rely on their intellect.<br>
Obviously this poem isn't about finding the right questions, rather it says (as you have hinted before also): Better don't ask at all!<br>
Well, that's a fascinating idea. But this path dulls the intellect, senses and ambitions. You can solve all the questions by saying 'Do you really want an answer?' and secretly hinting that questions shouldn't be asked at all, you can solve all problems with our feelings we have by saying 'Do you really need those feelings?' and secretly hinting that we shouldn't have any desires at all.<br>
Is this neutral? Yes, maybe. But is this actually anything at all?<br>
It maybe works for you, and you do well. But I have a different philosophy.<br>
For example:<br>
I assume you would say: Not-knowing is true knowledge. (OOC: 71)<br>
I would rather say: What you know, you know, what you don't know, you don't know. This is knowledge. <br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.human.toyogakuen-u.ac.jp/~acmuller/contao/analects.htm">(OOC: see here, 2:17)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Struggle on these questions is useless, and not necessary.<br>
Let's be friends and be happy!<br>
*hugs Kimaya*<br>
<br>
OOC:<br>
It is a fascinating idea to identify the Nameless with the Dao, the 'name that cannot be named'. Just thinking that the Nameless is the 'Asian server' (quite a lot of Asians around there). Maybe this is just a coincidence? <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>

But I don't expect this to be understood. You creatures will continue to believe that Norrath is really some peaceful place, and there are a few creatures disrupting that peace, rather then seeing it for what it is. A chaotic swirling maelstorm of hatred and anarchy which the soft skins and many other races continue to drag further into the abyss, and which we Iksar offer the only semblance of order and only chance at this ever changing.<br>

Wow, Zildrax. I did not think i would ever say this, but.. i agree. In part, that is. Of course, i dont care wether you claim it is Cazic Thule, who is not denied, or wether it is the big bad lizzard in the sky. But you have a *very* valid point. Multiple nations truly cannot exist. So, all Norrath should succumb to hate, and let itself be ruled by hatred.<br>
<br>
The part i dont agree to is that all of us see Norrath as a peaceful place. It is a chaotic swirling maelstrom of hatred. Or, most of it is. Many you call 'softskins' see this, and enjoy it. I do. Hopefully, all will be, in time. Even the Iksar will succumb to it - or become extinct.<br>

Can you sense it ? It would be the worst of fates, if the world actually came to *that*. No, Ellywig, that is no utopia. It is the opposite. I would never want to live in a world like that. Perhaps that is why i rarely go there.<br>
<br>
And to Kimaya, well, i could write many words. But Teiraa did it so well, once more. So i will merely point out the one part of the little poem, which i can actually understand.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
If you keep your mind from judging<br>
and aren't led by the senses,<br>
your heart will find peace.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
To me, that reads.. if you do not judge, do not act, do not decide, you will find peace. So, peace is found in inaction - in watching - in doing nothing. So, if all follow that, everything will be in peace. And noone will do, noone will act, noone will move, beause all found peace. And the morning after, Norrath would be quiet, because all would have found eternal peace - the peace of death.<br>
<br>
No, Kimaya, i think that poem is far more cruel than i could ever be. It offers a sollution, but only for a few. If all heed it, and all follow it, the result will be stagnation and death. The quiet of nothing ever changing.<br>
<br>
So, call me lovelyscritch.. or sillyscritch.. or whatever you like - but i still see what you offer as a fate worse than what Zildrax offered.<br>
<br>
Oh, and a side note, Zildrax: Of course they will sooner or later invade the Iksar ruins.  If they wont, others will. And all those which will not succumb to hatred will be sacrificed. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

<br>
Intellect and wisdom are both only tools, and we need both to help us make choices. The poem isn't about slipping blandly away into a sea nothingness, it's about not making up your mind about things and dividing them and sticking-them-put in such a way that you can't ever let them move from the spots you've decided they will always occupy. Once you've determined that you already know all the ways you'll ever need to learn, you've pretty much cut yourself off.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, fanatacism is all about having already decided how you're going to judge the world, and there are far too many fanatics already trying to shape the world in a way that would prove that they are right. That's why I don't believe in running around trying to give answers. Not only do I think it doesn't do any good when other ears just won't hear them, I also personally learn a lot more from focussing on the questions themselves rather than trying too hard to be &quot;right&quot; with my answers. And when I make a choice, I take personal responsibility for it rather than blaming it on a god.<br>
<br>
But I'm used to being called silly and not making any sense, so I'll go have that nap! Just please, don't put any more words in my mouth while I'm sleeping! It'll make me snore...<br>

In order for your precious little way of life to work, you NEED multiple nations, because if you don't have them, then you have nothing to hate, nothing to focus your rage on, so there is only one thing left to do. Turn your hatred on your own people. After all, how can the world be ruled by hate if there is NOTHING to hate? And in turning your hate on eachother, which you have to do in order to keep &quot;hateing&quot;, you destroy eachother, dragging the world down into flames, creating multiple nations once again for no other reason then you need an enemy in order for  your sick twisted mind to work. And in the end, Norrath will become ash, and you'll effectively wipe all living things off of it. Hatred is a pathetic, self destructive emotion, and those who indulge it are nothing more then slaves to their rage.<br>

But, you creatures shall never conquer Norrath, that fate is reserved for us Iksar alone. We're above hatred, and we won't succumb to it.

Yes, I find your religion comical as well. Your people are destined to destroy eachother, if they aren't conquerd by us Iksar. They already kill, betray, and hate eachother more then any other species I've ever seen. And the only thing that holds them together is their common hatred of the enemy. Amusing to think what would happen without that, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Of course, from what I've seen of alot of hatelings, they actually want the world to become the endless inferno of aimless hatred that it's destined to become if they conquer it.

Those I think I can answer I will try to answer, and still confess openly that maybe my answer is wrong. Those I think I cannot answer, I'll say I cannot answer. Those I think they are useless I'll say they are useless questions. Sometimes I may be wrong, sometimes I may be right, it is up to the listener to determine that and find his own way. It is as simple.<br>
And, I don't know anything, actually! Life is permanent learning. But we have to act to be able to learn. And to ask questions, and to try to find answers. That's my humble opinion.<br>

And you fall for a misconseption, if you think that hatred is only nutured by a multitude of empire. Under the right government, hate would be the all deciding quality. You do not need an outside enemy to hate. It is just a lot easier then.<br>

<br>
I agree that right or wrong do not apply. The world is not about being right, or wrong. It is about being. And about being honorable. But neither reflection do i see in the poem, or in your words. What i see in the poem is.. do not worry about questions, or answers. Look into yourself and you find it all.<br>
<br>
That at least is what i interpret into the words. And that i will not follow. I will continue to seek answers. Not 'right' or 'wrong' answers.. answers. Each answer given shapes my world. Each view presents adds to my view of the world, and to my view of myself.  Right or wrong do not matter. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

And your people are already nothing more then a bunch of constantly infighting, bickering, self serving weaklings who already stand to destroy eachother at a moments notice.

<br>
Why the need for these labels? Why the need to call yourself good or neutral, or call others such? Is it because you don't know who else to fight? Or is it because by labeling yourselves and each other is this odd way, you're able to hide from what you truly feel or desire?<br>

<br>
I will not claim to understand soft skins or their labels, but for us Iksar, it is simple.<br>
<br>
You are our enemy, your ideals oppose ours, you defy Cazic-Thule, and you continue to drag the world into anarchy. For that, all soft skins are evil. <br>
<br>
That is why we Iksar label you such, there is no hidden motives or desires. You are simply our enemy, and we find the actions and ways of life of you creatures atrocious. Beyond that, I do not claim to have any understanding of the labels you soft skins throw around, they confuse and befuddle me as well. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/2/02 1:27:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uteiraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teiraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Innoruuk also needs love</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/2/02 2:14:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/38/38498/pages/89050/teiraa3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neutrality</span><hr size=1> Sorean, since Zildrax' answer was IC, I'll try to give you an OOC one:<br>
The discussion about good/neutral/evil will never have an end. This thread wasn't the first one, and won't be the last one. It is a difficult question, but I try to make some things clear.<br>
The answer will depend on the character's basic beliefs. And there are in my opinion 2 basic approaches:<br>
1) Those who use evil/neutral/good to establish a division, for example a high elf paladin who thinks all dark elves and iksar as evil, while paladins are good, druids are neutral, and so on. Or like Zildrax who thinks he is good, and all 'softskins' are evil, or at least should be conquered and killed/enslaved.<br>
2) Those who don't care about the division, and play evil paladins, good necromancers, or iksar who like to help high elves or whatsoever. Or those who don't play them, but at least interact with them (for example a paladin who groups with a 'good' necromancer, or a shadowknight grouping with a 'evil paladin').<br>
Well, and those above are the roleplayers. Unfortunately there are also some non-roleplayers who don't care at all about anything. But that's a different question.<br>
<br>
So some people use evil/good as general label put on a race/class to define borders and enemies. Others see every single person separately, as evil or good, according to his/her actions.<br>
Nobody is right, nobody is wrong, all are great roleplayers, and we all try our best to have great fun together.<br>
