Love does not power hate. Light does not power darkness.  Love is weakness, and weakness is in love.<br>
<br>
One that has never known love is powerful. Without that worthless Emotion slowing him down, splitting his heart and soul which he should be devoting in his faith, he wastes it on some pathetic other Male or Woman, whichever the case. Its a waste of effort and time.<br>
<br>
Their is one thing now that gets me up and puts me to sleep, daily. That is my hate. My Constant reminder that I will destroy the Lightbringers, I will stand above and kill them all.<br>
<br>
The 'Mighty' Gore has been destroyed. Why? Because pathetically, he fell in love. No longer was his heart devoted to Bloodshed and Battles, now devoted to Misha, some little blue elf stringing the poor fool along. His Doll as it were was split and became dependent on Misha to keep him standing.<br>
And you know what happened? Such stong trust left him reeling. Ogarth killed him. And soon enought, his own love destroyed him. <br>
<br>
Love destroyed others as well, Gore is not the only one to fall, but he's the strongest pure fighter to fall to its whims.<br>
<br>
An perfect example, Mr Demiath. Here, a Tier'dal Priest.. filled with the Perfect Hate of the Father! His hate was astounding..<br>
Before he met those Harlots of love, Do I really need to say their names? You know who I am talking about, and no, they are not the only ones, but they are a sparkling example.<br>
<br>
Roose twisted and destroyed that Hatred sprit that Demiath was. Demiath was a Great man untill he ran into her. I daily tried to ressurect him as Roose destroyed one of the Fathers Creations, I could hear his true sprit yearning to be free of this pathetic love. But it was not to be, she had him.<br>
<br>
In the end, he became a Tier'dal Priest of love. How Pathetic. After he had made his final Transgression, I had no choice but fight and make an example of him. We broke even in battles.<br>
<br>
But in the end, it was her that would deal the final blow. She shattered his worthless love, and kicked him to the side when she was finished with him. How foolish of you Demiath, falling in love with that trash.<br>
<br>
Where did becomming a Priest of Love get Demiath? Nothing but wasted time he could of put to good use destroying the creations of Tunare. He was not strong enought to put those people to good use as I did in the past, and they almost destroyed him.<br>
<br>
If you must know, I believe he has recovered and is doing fine, I think he is with the Lightbringers, but I am not sure, a flaw that will never becorrected thanks to love.<br>
<br>
Juonar and Celiesta.. Ahh, a star crossed pair. One Tier'dal Knight, and one Tier'dal Priestess, both in the way of the Father, and both in Love. Their love was boundless, first started by lust, but Celiesta fell weak to it, as did Juonar. They became closer, their love forcing the two to lean on one other just to stand.<br>
Then, Celiesta was ripped away. A Family arrangement. Celiesta was to marry another.<br>
<br>
Now, Both Celiesta and Juonar are dead. So much potental for these two to do the Fathers work, wasted. Why?<br>
Because of love.<br>
<br>
But I stand here as your example. I have had a woman's love, almost my Entire life untill lately. From Genashai to Sarhea to Kallee to Vivienne and Vienna to Citrellis, and what has that love done to make me stronger?! Not a thing!<br>
Only two of these women I did not love. But it is not their fault, nono. They have no control over it, its the fault of Love itself~! I am lucky however. I faught back against love. I am not proud of how I had to do it, Love tried to box me in and I had to bring out everything I had just to break even and have a chance at survival.<br>
<br>
Love is caring deeply. Love is pretty, roses and blue skies.. the Bird flies over the skies singing a song of Peace and Harmony.<br>
<br>
I hate peace and harmony. These Unions of Love called &quot;Marriages&quot; shall end. The Father deems it so, for with his Hate, I have all I need. I need not this thing called a Woman's love, I am stronger without it.<br>
<br>
I'm in my 52nd level of power. The Neutralic powers I seek to fight are still way above me, and they shall continue to grow as the Planes of Power are revieled and our bodies are able to raise to new levels of power. Why am I so weakened, only now being able to crawl out of the Hole I was put in and stand above?<br>
<br>
Because of Love! Their worthless love chipped away at what I was, what I should of been by now. Some tired to use me, some tried to whore me. Some tried to love me. Does it matter? No. Its all love, and it all should be destroyed. Its the blessings of a worthless lesser Priestess, and it shall be crushed just like the Many Paladins under my Heel of Hatred(R).<br>
<br>
I point to you, Young Necromancer. Young ShadowKnight, Young Follower of The Father, follower of Hate. Bewear these worthless blessings, the Blessings of love. Be weary of it, do not falter like the Pathetic Paladin, droping himself and everything for the love of a another who will just shatter him in the end. Stand tall and above it, your hate.. Hate the very essence of it. Hate all that Love stands for. This will strenghten your hate even further, and you will become stronger with it.<br>
<br>
Take your pleasures if you need be. But that is all. Fall in love and lose all that you stand for.<br>
<br>
For I stand before you now, My sprit torn and beaten, battered throught a life of the Torments of Love. It cuts deeper then any blade, it tears harder then any claw, and destroys faster then any Harm Touch could ever do.<br>
<br>
And I raise my Lance to you all, and say that &quot;I HAVE CONQURED AND DEFEATED LOVE!&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again. Just as I was as a Child. <br>
Before Genashai.<br>
<br>
Perfect in my True Hatred.<br>
<br>
Just as the Father intended.<br>
<br>
I am a Perfect Child of the Father. He created me, as he did all Tier'dal in a manner that is Perfect. I shall not allow love to stain and make me Imperfect, as it has made others..<br>
<br>
Very ..<br>
<br>
Woodelven like.<br>
<br>
That is all. Take away from this as you wish. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif" WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="110">

You have stood against it, and you are strong.  Others have not been so wise nor fortunate.  Because, what is love?<br>
<br>
Love is a vicious parasite, carried and spread by bards, mostly, and those of the &quot;light&quot; speaking of a happiness unparalleled, a divinity unfathomable, sighs never ending, purity, salvation, and so on.  That is their way, to sing and preach of how things should be instead of how they truly are.  For instance, how does love work?<br>
<br>
This parasite attacks both hosts, destroying their sense, their reasoning... there it thrives until something impairs it from flowing between the two.  This can happen for many reasons: one host is killed, taken away, moves on, is strong enough to expell it, or rumors create their own silent barrier between the two.  Left on it's own, it turns against it's host.<br>
<br>
This love that once made the body seem more alive attacks its host twice over to make up for what it would be taking from the other body, enfeebling it's lone host, making the host more vulnerable than ever before.  Here the cylce ends, or begins again.<br>
<br>
Either that host is destroyed as he should be, throwing himself into a pit of lava, or tries to find someone to share it with (infect with it) to ease the pain left by the gaping whole the parasite has eaten through him.<br>
<br>
As with all in life, only the strong will survive.  Only the strong can keep it from taking them to begin with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upentapod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pentapod</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~pentapod/graphics/a_pod.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>WTB phat newt</span><br>  Posts: 1210<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 11:52:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~pentapod/miscpics/couple.jpg height=200 width=100.gif></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Love is for the Weak.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm in my 52nd level of power.

<br>
Because of Love!  Without light, there is no shadow.  Without heat, we do not know coldness.  Once I wandered, aimless, trying to serve Innoruuk.  Some tried to tell me of hatred, some lusted for me.  But then Innoruuk brought Tallonar to me, to conceive a child that would serve Him truly.  Do not tell me Love has weakened me.  In the light of Love, I have come to understand true Hate.  In defense of my child and husband, my Hate towards our enemies knows no bounds.  Loyalty to each other ... hatred and no mercy to our foes.<br>
<br>
Those broken souls you speak of did not know love ... they were seduced by lust, by the false promises of Erollisi Marr.  True Love is as unswerving and intense as true Hate, for it is the reverse side of the same coin.  Love is not pretty. It is not peace and harmony.  It is a burning flame that strengthens, a shield that protects the faithful, a sword that can be turned on the enemy.<br>
<br>
Your service to Hate is admirable.  But it's clear you do not yet understand its flip side, its shadow, its complement.<br>

Love does destroy the weak, but it is also a battle that is a pure waste of effort and energy. Love Makes you weak, then it pushes you over the edge into destruction. So yes, love destroys the weak, but its also the water that corrodes and weakens the rock. Juonar and Celiesta both were not weak, yet it destroyed them.<br>
<br>
    Lady Didi - Without light, their is nothing but darkness. Those perceptive things are only used by Druids that try to convince us of an need for balance.<br>
<br>
The Balance between Heat and Cold.<br>
The Balance between Light and Dark.<br>
The Balance between Love and Hate.<br>
<br>
I tire of playing within Tunares worthless circle. I'll shatter these balances and take them off the deep end of Darkness. Without Love, their is only the Burning fuel of Hate.<br>
Love is a thing that lowers swords and brings forth acceptance. If Love had its way.. well look out there now. Woodelves and Darkelves Parade around with eachother in Happyness within places like Dreadstorm. Come now, I'm going to fight love because love is the source of all that is wrong with this world! Love has no bite, no fangs. It beguiles like an Enchanters spell, or the wave of some Various Females Hips or something of that nature. It lowers you down into half of what you are and then finishes you off with the final blow.<br>
<br>
But from this blow their can be a rise. Throught the Torment my hate has begun to toss away the final strings of sainity and in the way of Saryn, I'll rise to power and destroy what I seek to finish off.<br>
<br>
I personally believe that what you and Tallonar have is different from Love. A stronger bond where you KNOW that the each of you can rely on one another. This is all in theroy, I really have not figured out the details of this, but Its like an Ally, Undying trust in one another, or something like that. I refuse to call it love, for Love is for the Weak, and Neither you or High Knight Tallonar are weak. I'll figure it out, or try to.<br>
<br>
May the Father have .. No, The Father has no mercy for any lightbringer. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif" WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="110">

What is love, but a bond of trust and strength?  Juonar and Celiesta - friends though they were - were not strong, they were both weak.  Juonar *needed* to find a companion - his need led him to mistake lust for love, and undermined him.  Celiesta never sought an equal partner; from the start she flaunted Juonar as a possession, seeking to control his actions, even as she met in secret with another man.  Neither of them knew love, and were tragically brought down by their flaws.  <br>
<br>
As for Tallonar and me - I call it Love, you may call it what you will, but you can't deny it.  Each new month we remain together, I enjoy watching you grow more puzzled.  *chuckles again*<br>

Didi, without that foolish bond you call love.. would it matter if Celiesta met another man while she was so called in love with Juonar? Would they even have to meet in private. Would it even matter to Juonar if it were not for it?<br>
<br>
Falling in love is a waste of effort and time. It makes you waste your time fighting. Remember how livid Dalion was when he found out about me and Citrellis? A Waste of Dalion energy.. and when he discarded these feelings finally, he well..<br>
er..<br>
<br>
Just don't look at the Bunny Slippers and he will appear to be a strong Knight of Darkness. Didi, The Father created us this way, to be Sinful creatures of Lust, yes. Satisfy yourself if you need be, but Love for the most part will end in you being weaker then you really are. No longer is their any need to care about who's bedding who and who's got who's fiancee tied to some bed wielding a wooden Paddle. Without love, none of that matters.. and thus gives us the ability to focus on things much more Important.<br>
<br>
For me, Thats the battlefield. Fighting, killing the Children of Tunare. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif" WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="110">

One truth that links all of us together is that peoples from everywhere can make each other happy by loving, and being loved.

And don't go all foolish on yourself about what love is.  Love isn't the antithesis of hate -- that's apathy.  And love isn't what you need in order to hate -- that's passion, and not a small bit of a narrow mind.  Love isn't even getting angry and hurt when your lover loves someone else too -- that's envy, Lanys' playground.<br>
<br>
Love is when someone else's happiness is your happiness, when their joy is your joy, when caring for their well-being is a part of everything you have, everything you are, everything you ever hope to be.  As for whether it's strength or weakness...<br>
<br>

It's neither.  It simply Is.  Now what people DO about it can be strong or weak, depending on who they are and what choices they make.  But you can't blame or congratulate love, you just gotta blame or congratulate yourself.<br>

Pure Lust isn't a ritual to Erollisi.<br>
<br>
No, I didn't love Kallee. So that makes three in that list above that I didn't love, as opposed to two I said before. My mistake, these things slip my mind.<br>
<br>
You know what worthless druid, other then that..<br>
<br>
You just made a whole lot of sence. Damn you for being right.<br>
<br>
Ironic that someone like you would understand.<br>
<br>
But you are right. I accept, Love is not for the weak.<br>
<br>
It just is. Its not a Rival of hate, not at all. So those that believe in Hate can also love. <br>
By that same token, it strenghtens you not.<br>
<br>
So, It is not needed in the very least for survival.<br>
<br>
Right now, I'd find some reason to hurt you seeing how this acually somewhat helped my understanding of this subject, I hate Woodelves that seem to know too much, but I think I'll have to keep you alive for a while. The end is comming, and I promiced you that you'd get to see Torment on the faces of all the people. I'll save you for last, Kimaya. For last.<br>
<br>
I want to see that giggle gone from yourself, and that smile turned to sorrow, and the tears of mourning and helplessness fall down your face before you die.<br>

When one is far too tall and stretched out, after all, one tends to overlook those of the proper height.  &quot;I was once told,&quot; she begins softly, nodding in acknowledgement to Solaneb. &quot;rather a long time ago, that the opposite of love is not hate but apathy.  There is a deciding factor for Love, however, and that is trust.&quot;  She looks up to the being of Hate before her with fathomless oak-green eyes, shining orbs wide with optimism despite having seen the spoils and the ill of the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, Shintou, how you feel about your god.  Do you hate him?  If so, for all of Norrath, why do you serve him?  If I have gathered true information, you kill for your god, you die for your god, you live for your god, you breathe, you walk, hunt, eat, survive, move, you EXIST for the Hate, for its spread, for its depth, for its purity.  These are similar qualities in the existance of love.&quot;  She shifts her weight to the other foot, angling her body in a gesture unconciously confident and self-knowing.  &quot;I would not, of course, say that you love your god either, for therein lies the almost-paradox of loving Hatred itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;If faced by Innoruuk, however, you would not turn your back to him.  You would not face him weaponless.  You would not trust him.  After all, the Darkness despises the weak, most especially of those who say they follow it.  Like a pack of wolves who hunt the rabbits and the drakes alike, the Darkness weeds out all frailty.  It would not be any different if you were to face Innoruuk.  To trust him - that key factor, TRUST - would be folly, and in it, a flawed death.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that love is not the weakness that destroys those who cannot survive it.  Trusting those whom are untrustworthy, those who would knife you in the back as soon as your usefulness were through, is what is weak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Those who confuse love and trust can and do fall.  To see the beauty and love of another being can bring trust.  This trust can shape one's mind so that they believe that, like their lover, all is worthy of trust.  It is here where they fall, where they sink into a rose-tinted world of decadence.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are those who flit across Norrath, preaching that they 'love everybody and everything'.  This is not love, but a glut of trust.  Trust taken so far that it blinds, and it kills.  There are precious few who truly love all.  Precious few who would die to save a complete stranger's life.  How many Elves do you know of, followers of Erollsi Marr, who would die to save an alien Troll or Iksar?  I know of none, though I know of many who moralize to say they, like Erollsi, love all.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turns to address Solaneb.  &quot;While I agree with most of what you say, I must differ with you in your belief that those who abhor love 'simply need to find the right troll or ogre'.  To love one's god is enough.  To love existance, or to love oneself, or to love a figment such as money or power, that is enough.  To love aught else is to sully and dilute the single entity that is loved.<br>
<br>
&quot;To use myself as an example, I love and follow the Balance.  Bodiless and without tangible entity though it may be, I kill for the Balance, I die for the Balance, I live for the Balance, I breathe, I walk, hunt, eat, survive, move, I EXIST for the Balance and for my god.  I now walk the Dark path to serve my faith, and insodoing I follow those of the Darkness.  I aid them, I serve them, I am a companion to them, but I do not love them.  I once walked the path of the Light.  I aided those that follow the Light, I served them, was a companion to them, and trusted them because they could be trusted.  I did not love them.&quot;<br>
<br>
She hesitates a moment, and looks away.  &quot;I....  loved once, and it was a fool thing for me to do.  It lured me from my god and my faith.&quot;  She looks up again, determination a glowing radiation of green embers in her eyes.  &quot;I learned my lesson, of course.<br>
<br>
&quot;For me, there is nothing but the Balance and Karana.  For Shintou, there is nothing but the Hate and Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
That said, she pulls herself up onto one of the chairs and then onto a table built for too-talls, and perches there, a meditative look in her eyes.<br>

Why do I follow him however?<br>
Its simple. <br>
<br>
Hatred is true power. Its the only force that matters. I ally myself with those that can at least respect the trueness of those words. To Hate ones own Diety, can you understand what loathing that brings? What power? I hate even his Alter plane, there they have this Giant Version of Me running around, killing everyone. I really hate him, he's a pain. Right when we were able to fight there with relative ease, the Father brought down an entire new legion of stronger Minions, forcing us to ..replan.<br>
<br>
Anyhow. Innoruuk is power. That power is not easy to attain, if you go off and join the Lightbringers, you'll slowly lose that hate. You'll become like Cadien, like those in the Baston, like Demiath was. He became a Priest of Love, you know?<br>
<br>
They learned Tolerance from their lightbringer friends. Tolerance took from their hate. Soon enought, they loved, and no longer could handle hating the father. They became weak, and yes..<br>
<br>
Their is nothing worse to me.. then one of his own Children forsaking the Father.<br>
<br>
I was once there when I was young. I used to believe in the power of Malice.. or what was just an mistake on my part, for it just came out to be Weak Envy of Power. Thats where I learned to appricate death in its various forms.. But the Father came calling for me once again.<br>
<br>
I don't have the luxury to turn my back on him. I am his. I am special. Thats why he won't let me go, not even to another evil force. So the father came to me throught Rhael.<br>
<br>
And he taught me to hate everything he is.<br>
<br>
Trust? Putting so much faith in another is foolish. Its how you get used. Hate is all, and its what I use to find out truth.<br>
<br>
Lightbringer or Child of Darkness, I'll treat you like a lightbringer until you produce what proof you have that you are Dark. Most of the time this gets me makes me look foolish, but its worth it to find out who is friend or foe.<br>
<br>
So thats why I hate Innoruuk, and continue to follow his path. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kimayasilverbark>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 502<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/29/02 11:40:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Musings</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kimaya slowly blinks her eyes back into focus, having drifted off into a reverie about someone special.

Oh, Sillyshins, powermongering is for the weak!  Seeking power over others is a poor balm for lacking power over oneself.  No matter how you run around yelling and screaming, how many blades you bloody or hearts you break, it won't bring you knowing.  It won't bring you understanding.  It won't bring you the power you lack.<br>
<br>
Your race are who they are because they were stolen away, and were not strong enough to hold out against Captain Hateyhead's torments and suffering forever, were not strong enough to keep their sense of Self.  You are who you are because you were stolen away, and were not strong enough to hold out against your own personal hateyhead's torments and suffering, were not strong enough to keep your sense of Self.  So you lash out blindly, spinning madly, furiously storming your dance of blindness as you try to blind all others so you don't have to open your eyes, trying desperately to justify all you've suffered rather than face that it may have all just been bad mistakes and sad misdeeds.  For all you've suffered, that pain would hurt too much.<br>
<br>
So go on, be a slave to hate struggling to expand his master's grasp, cry out to the world how your beloved bonds make you strong.  See how strong your hate is when it bangs against the bastion of grounded Self Knowing.  See how effective your storms are when they wail against the bastion of Inner Peace.  See how well you can wound with your sticks and stones when someone simply refuses to stand within your tiny circle.<br>
<br>
You know I'd love to help you see so many things, but only you can open your eyes.<br>

Both are fueled by the deficiencies of Man, by the yearning of living creatures to complete the emptiness within themselves through contact with others, either for good or evil. Apathy is indeed the true counterpoint to passion.<br>
<br>
I am that apathy.<br>
<br>
Your craving emotional needs are laid bare before the cleansing touch of Pain. The bright ardor of your passions are like a blazing candle which must eventually burn itself out. The path of Torment is a frozen flame, unchanging and eternal. Only when all desires have been renounced can the clarity of the Dark Truth be revealed.<br>

We could argue FOREVER, and never find a &quot;true&quot; answer. Is love when you are willing to die for another...or is that weakness, lack of self preservation? Is love &quot;letting go&quot; of the one you love? Hoping beyond hope that your love returns to you? Or is that lack of self esteem or pride and letting someone &quot;play&quot; with you and walk away? *grins* Who knows? Maybe in death we will find out *grins and says in a dark whisper*...maybe not.<br>
 All this &quot;humble&quot; apprentice knows...is that with out Love and Hate, the drama of life AND death would be very &quot;dead&quot;.<br>
*grins very evilly* Farewell.<br>
