<br>
I have been trying to buy the game for a friend &amp; have even offered to pay his monthly subscription... problem is this particular friend doens't even like to get birthday gifts because he thinks it somehow makes him &quot;beholden&quot; *sigh*.  <br>
<br>
But... I know not eveyone has the finances for an additional account (or even an account at all in some cases), heck 5 years ago I wouldn't have been able to contenance $13 a month let alone $60 for software for even 1 account if now had been then.  <br>
<br>
I do think there is some unfairness to having only those who can afford a second account &quot;allowed&quot; a second character, but isn't that somewhat in the same line as only someone who wants to pay can change their name or server or even play on Legends with its supposedly spiffier stuffs?<br>
<br>
The real irony, in a way, is that one who is wealthy in the game can be dirt poor on the other side &amp; one doing well financially (I'm not rich... not even close... but working for high tech in North Cal does have its advantages... even after the bust) can be dirt poor in the game... anyone know how I can earn some more plat to make some more arrows so I can shoot them to kill things to make some more plat to make some more arro.....  Hmmmmm.  (Yes, I know I could just use the cheapest arrows I can make to shoot &amp; sell back the best ones I can make to fun more arrows.. but.. but... I take pride in shooting good arrows I make).<br>

They are too bloody daft to realize the server ain't going anywhere... the patch that was supposed to 'revitalize' the server did nothing except push out a majority of long time players to add a new crop of people in which a lot could not care any less if FV is a RP server.<br>
<br>
They need to go back, remove everyone from the May8th patch and give us an alt or 2 instead.  It's not a matter of twinking all around, it's a matter of having something to do!  I walk around bored bored bored bored log... and look at the people, a LOT are quitting simply for the reason that when your high level, you can't pick a zone and decide, I want a group, you either have to bring your own group or go to Velketor which is the only high level zone with any kind of crowd.  My friends list, which used to have 10 or so names online at a time now has a maximum of 3, it is frustrating and boring as hell.<br>
<br>
As for twinking, there is ALREADY twinking!  I see people with equipment at 20 that I just got when I was 40-45, as we find items, they are bound to stream down and younger people will be better and better equipped, I mean what else will we do with the stuff in our banks, go around and destroy it?  The price for anything you can obtain below 40 has also gone down about 400-500% , I remember when a BABS was being sold for 500 and now you can get one for 100 or so, same with armor, as crustecean started trickling in, it was about 3 times the price it is now.  Basically, if you ask someone like me who has been here since about 1 minute after the server opened, EVERYONE is twinked compared to what I had and it's the same with most everyone else.<br>
<br>
People say, 'buy another account, it's what I did' , well unless you have 2 pc's capable of supporting Everquest, what the hell is the point of buying 2 accounts and saying 'I don't want alts on the server'.<br>
<br>
Oh well, as for me, even with an alt, I'm not staying, I gave them plenty of chances to keep me around since December and they never gave what people wanted.  I have set my permanent departure date with the release of Unreal Tournament 2003, so end of July, but at least my guildmates will be happy with what I leave them since everything is droppable and hopefully I'll be able to get more stuff to give them before I go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=traxxus>Traxxus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/26/02 3:18:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How bad could it really get if VI allowed two characters</span><hr size=1> Not trying to throw more fuel on the fire, I'm just curious as to how most FV players feel about this subject.

Dont think for one minute it will affect the market drastically.  Why would I buy my melee alt mid level stuff when I am camping KC or ME and can pick them up the better items.  Also I have tried to negotiate with higher levels before (when I was mid 30's) and have been told they would just hold it on there alt in the bank until they got the &quot;price&quot; they were looking for so they would not negotiate.  Add alts and you increase this (guess that is an impact on the market). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umosushi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mosushi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/26/02 4:16:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  You increase e-bay activity, too</span><hr size=1> More characters means more banks to warehouse lore items.

<br>
now that i'm here, i think they should've made the entire game this way.  i agree with the person above.  they should've made it so that you can only have one character on a server.  naturally, it would be a much less popular game than it is now, and wishes don't change reality. <br>
<br>
there's no way to justify my attitude.  i all do know is that every time i return to zeb and run around the newbie area everyone i see is fully dressed, with a guild tag over their heads.  basically, it means that they are mostly alts of people with higher-level players.  they don't go out of their way to socialize with others.  they don't need anything from anyone besides themselves, their guild, and the few people in those small circles that they run in.<br>
<br>
i think it would've added ALOT to the gaming environment to have it be like FV is now.  here people actually might talk to strangers.  here their actions are scrutinized by other players, and if their behaviour is lacking, judgement is passed.  <br>
<br>
it also cuts out alot of the scheming &amp; social sniping when people can't just go play an alt and reap the same benefits.  if we want to play an alt, we have to fork out the extra money (which is somewhat prohibitive for some), or go to another server where we cannot rely upon the same circle of friends or bank accounts.<br>
<br>
multiple characters gives everyone too much anonymity.  as the post on okane/nabiki/whoever they are proves, next time the same person could be ripping/flipping you off with simply a new character fronting for them.  of course, the name change policy now makes this point not count for as much.<br>
<br>
to sum up my pointless rambling, let's just say that i like it when the social structure tries to match something partially realistic.  yes, it's a fantasy game i play to escape the real world from.  unfortunately it's a game that also tends to exacerbate the negative real life behaviour that people engage in because they can constantly reinvent themselves and avoid their just rewards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarios.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 845<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 11:12:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: just random thoughts</span><hr size=1> I would say extra characters are fine BUT make it hard to get another.<br>
<br>
If you do not you will have random low lvl characters running around in the best armor there &quot;dady&quot; can twink them in being dicks. Been there seen that sooo many times.<br>
<br>
Having to buy an acount stops people (most anyway) from randomly creating another character and putting no thought or care in it.<br>
<br>
I say make it a quest, make it a long quest (60 hours) at the end of which you can have a second character.<br>

You asserted the game wouldn't have been as popular if they had followed my suggestion from the beginning.  I beg to differ.  If every server had a one-character rule from the get-go, no one would have noticed--no one would have known any different.  But since Verant didn't do that, everyone would notice the change.  And they'd all bitch about it incessantly and scream they're going to quit their accounts and play Dark Age of Camelot, NeverWinter Nights (which I bought yesterday, primarily because my partner, who DMs his own campaign, plans on using it), or Star Wars Galaxies (this &quot;threat&quot; puzzles me--why threaten to quit EQ to buy and subscribe to a different Verant/Sony product?) until VI decided that it isn't worth the bother. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

<br>
i still contest that it wouldn't have been as popular.  i think that in many people, the instinct to race to the finish line would've lessened their enjoyment because they wouldn't have soaked in all that there is to see along the way.  afterwards, they'd have to start over from scratch somewhere else without all of the people that they've relied upon.  <br>
<br>
even if they didn't know any different from day 1 of release, boredom would've set in at merely the thought of going to another server and starting all over again.  personally, i think many folks would go &quot;ok, i finished that game, next!&quot;  although a few die-hards (perhaps half of the eq population?) would try out all of the different races/classes and get their full money's worth out of it.<br>
<br>
to my thinking, at least a part of the success of EQ is due to the fact that when a player gets bored with their character, they can just fire another one up, gear them up like a holographic Pretty Woman, and go out to slaughter bats with one blow of their Sword of Uberness.  twinkage (and knowledge of the game somewhat) make levelling go twice as fast the second, third, and forth times around, at least until the character's level &amp; gear even out.<br>
<br>
now, the question of &quot;how much less popular?&quot; i can't determine with the feeble powers at my disposal.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uowump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Owump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 6:54:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: just random thoughts</span><hr size=1>  why do people come to a server,where they know that you can have only one char,and then adamantly bitch and moan because they can only have one char per server?this is like the idiots that build houses on the lake and bitch to the city that there basements flood or idiots that buy a house in town and bitch about the noise...<br>

The new people aren't what made the server, those of us who have been here since the start made the server, the economy, the guilds, everything that this place is.  New people like you come and say 'no alt, please , waa waa waa'.  Well guess what, everyone started like that, but after you've been here 9 month, it gets boring.  Once you'll have been here as long as the posters, then you can complain, but as it stands, there are perhaps 25% of us who are actually left that made the server what it is, we got to 50+ and once there, there is only so much you can do.  If people want to twink the living s*** out of a toon, they will have deserved it since they worked for everything they have.<br>
<br>
And guess what, no one as actually said 'I want an alt to twink' , people are saying, 'I want an alt to mule, to bank or to get a chance to have fun'.  You new people are going around equipped at 20 with what we had at 40, you shout, auction, act like doods and do whatever you want... we formed the economy, most of the guilds, the tight knit community as it stands for the raids and the battles which you can't do alone.  We dealt with no auction, limited shout, forced roleplay, lanquage restrictions, alignement restrictions, so if we want alts to further enjoy the server, why the hell should we not be allowed to have some.  <br>

<br>
Please recognize that there's room for reasonable people to disagree on this issue.<br>
<br>
While earlier I was stating the reality of the situation, I also prefer things to be one character, and I've been on the server, causing one ruckus or another, since the first week (started on day one, but went back to SZ for a week when I couldn't get a kill in edgewise due to the rampant KSing of orc pawns, bees, spiders, etc).  I'm not some &quot;newb&quot; who showed up 4-6 months later.<br>
<br>
However, I understand why people want alternates.  There are times I'd really like to reprise my AD&amp;D paladin Sarah, and FV would be the perfect place for her.<br>
<br>
I think Verant screwed up from the get-go by a) having so many servers and then b) also allowing 8 characters per server except on FV and SZ.  But what's done is done, and there's no use complaining about it now.<br>
<br>
I had 40 characters in my partner's AD&amp;D campaign, at last count, but he had a meta-rule in his campaign that forbade characters of the same player to meet one another--and a harsh rule, at that.  If they did, he (the DM) absorbed one of them as an NPC under his control--permanently.  Coupled with the fact that each magic item that wasn't a limited-charge item (wands, potions, etc) was unique (meaning only one Short Sword +1, one Holy Avenger, etc.), and what we know as &quot;twinking&quot; was just impossible.  Finding a magic item, any magic item, was an Event, capital &quot;E&quot;, no matter how piddly the item actually was.  Anyway, I guess I'm trying to say I understand the urge to create multiple characters and explore what they can do.  I've done it myself in other RPG settings, and there were times I just did not want to play my evil necromancer, and other times I didn't want to play her twin. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

I did more for FV than you ever will boyo, I was among the founders of a 7 guild roleplay alliance, I was an active member in the open raid community in the plans and leading 36-42 people to Nagafen on a few occasions and giving people a chance to do things they might not otherwise do.  <br>
<br>
No offense, but I deserved an alt for my work on FV, my alt was to have fun and be able to do more.  No matter what you do on the server, you will never surpass me, I was here at the beginning, saw the world form and change, was among those of us here who made it what it is.  I was the first to go to North Karana and East Karana, I was probably the first to get to Freeport on the server from Qeynos at level 5.  <br>
<br>
We are better than you, we don't need people like you coming now and assuming it's your right to tell us what to do.  We MADE Firiona Vie, if it was not for us, there would be no Firiona Vie, it would have died long ago.  But now we have a bunch like you who came after the May 8th patch which ruined the server and you dare tell us what we can and can't do? You have not lived till you've gone from 1-40 speaking only 1 tongue and using Emotes without knowing who is what, not understanding anyone, not being able to shout.<br>
<br>
As for not having an alt, just this week, a 52 friend quit the game like me as he was bored and a 55 in our guild decided to reroll himself as a rogue.  Tons and tons of friends have quit and more will follow.<br>
<br>
I can leave you all with this advice, have fun while you're under 50, but never reach over 50 because then you will find out why you need an alternate.<br>

Sheez, take a breath and count to ten Feneant. Is the injustice of it all just too much for you to handle anymore? Mom ground you for the weekend? Whatever your trip man, embrace the pain, get over it and yourself and mellow. Realize that for everything you did, for everything you accomplished there are those of us out there who are grateful and would like to say thank you...except right now you sound like an arrogant, self-aggrandizing prick and who want's to talk to one of those?<br>

I'm still fairly new to this game.  could someone tell me what a blue server is?  =\<br>
<br>
about the character limit<br>
i'd love to be able to play other characters on this server.  i currently have a paladin at 45 (my first character) but i'd really like to try out some of thee other races and classes.  I started playin on this server but i didn't know there was a character limit until i was about 11 and decided to create another character.  course i learned i couldn't so i just stuck with my pally.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uegilbe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>egilbe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/30/02 3:44:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: just random thoughts</span><hr size=1> I just had a thought...doesn't happen very often. When you get a character up to a certain level (say 55) you are granted the option to start a new character. But, hard code it so no equipment can go from the high level toon to a low level toon. Must be a neutral third party involved. That would make it more difficult to pass gear off, but not impossible. <br>
 I have a lot of time invested in Wiestrum-she's my first EQ character-I screwed up that starting stats for a rogue, wish I had put the bonus points into Dex, rather than charisma, but she is still my highest level character on ANY server. Sometimes I wish I could play a troll shaman on this server, but not really looking forward to rerolling. I would miss my Sisters too much. <br>
<br>
blue servers are the hell that *most* people ran from, to come here. They are filled with rude, arrogant, irritating, immature people, who speak a language called d00d.  Good for trying out new characters and classes, but not good for fun. (or my Idea of fun). They are overcrowded, noisy, and generally nasty. They are the standard production servers as apposed to the -Zeks, which are player vs. player, or red (correct me if I'm wrong) servers.<br>

<br>
on Torv, there is huge amounts of same person twinking, p/ling, the markets are rediculous.  I've seen Fine Plate BP's sometimes being sold for 10 PP in the Market.  There are people on Torv who would move to a brand new server in a heart beat, one where the market hasn't been saturated by people playing 2 characters at a time, p/ling themselves to 50 in 2 weeks, then farming crap without the use of other players.<br>

yeah, its going to be a bigger challenge on FV, but its going to be a nice break <p>http://members.cox.net/mtorgler/misc/psyanos.jpg

<br>
Adding one more character per account means one more character that needs equipment.  The total number of tunes that now are going to be in the market for equipment just doubled.<br>
<br>
Demand for lower level items increases as high level players bid of them for their twinks.  Equipment that would ordinarily be sold or given away is retained just in case the player wanted to start a new toon based around those items.  Etc.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, twinking can extend your enjoyment of the game for a time.  On the other hand, it negativly impacts the market as items are taken out of the market only to sit idle on a toon that isn't being played because the owner is on his/her &quot;alt&quot;.<br>
