I love Christians who tell me something sweet and Christian, like, &quot;You're<br>

An engineering professor is treating her husband, a loan officer, to<br>
dinner for finally giving in to her pleas to shave off that scraggly beard<br>
he grew on vacation. His favorite restaurant is a casual place where they<br>
both feel comfortable in slacks and cotton/polyester-blend golf shirts.<br>
But, as always, she wears the gold and pearl pendant he gave her the day<br>
her divorce decree was final. They're laughing over their menus because<br>
they know he always ends up diving into a giant plate of ribs but she<br>
won't be talked into anything more fattening then shrimp.<br>
<br>
Quiz: How many biblical prohibitions are they violating? Well, wives are<br>
supposed to be &quot;submissive&quot; to their husbands (1 Peter 3:1). And all women<br>
are forbidden to teach men (1 Tim. 2:12), wear gold or pearls (1 Tim. 2:9)<br>
or dress in clothing that &quot;pertains to a man&quot; (Deut. 22:5). Shellfish and<br>
pork are definitely out (Lev. 11:7) and clothes of more than one fabric<br>
(Lev. 19:19). And since the Bible rarely recognizes divorce, they're<br>
committing adultery, which carries the rather harsh penalty of death by<br>
stoning (Deut. 22:22). So why are they having such a good time? Probably<br>
because they wouldn't think of worrying about rules that seem absurd,<br>
anachronistic or - at best - unrealistic. Yet this same modern-day couple<br>
could easily be among the millions of Americans who never hesitate to lean<br>
on the Bible to justify their own anti-gay attitudes.<br>

DEAR (FILL IN NAME OF LOCAL CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN MINISTER),<br>
Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's law. I have<br>
learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as<br>
many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual<br>
lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly<br>
states it to be an abomination. End of debate.<br>
<br>
I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific<br>
laws and how to best follow them.<br>
<br>
When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a<br>
pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They<br>
claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?<br>
<br>
I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus<br>
21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br>
<br>
I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her<br>
period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do<br>
I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br>
<br>
Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around<br>
us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not<br>
Canadians. Can you clarify?<br>
<br>
I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2<br>
clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill<br>
him myself?<br>
<br>
A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination<br>
(Lev. 10:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't<br>
agree. Can you settle this?<br>
<br>
Lev. 20:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a<br>
defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my<br>
vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br>
<br>
Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around<br>
their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How<br>
should they die?<br>
<br>
I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me<br>
unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br>
<br>
My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different<br>
crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two<br>
different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse<br>
and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble<br>
of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't<br>
we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with<br>
people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev.20:14)<br>
<br>
I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you<br>
can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and<br>
unchanging.<br>

Without a doubt the most peaceful species of chimpanzee is the &quot;bonobo.&quot;<br>
Among bonobos the females - not the physically larger males - dominate the<br>
hierarchy, and casual sex soothes all conflicts. Bonobos even engage in<br>
such human-like practices as French kissing, face-to-face sex in the<br>
&quot;missionary&quot; position, promiscuity, and homosexuality. <br>
<br>
The discovery of such a species of ape with such behaviors disturbed the<br>
creationist Christian reviewer of the book, Bonobo: The Forgotten Ape, who<br>
wrote, &quot;In an evolutionary framework the integration of such sexual<br>
features [as promiscuity and homosexuality, both of them favorite pastimes<br>
among bonobos] into human society is out of the question, but the<br>
Judeo-Christian tradition indicates that promiscuity and homosexuality are<br>
secondary events, coming into the world after man's 'fall' and dragging<br>
the whole of creation into a new pattern of life.&quot; <br>
<br>
Aside from the fact that this &quot;Christian&quot; explanation for the &quot;sexual<br>
features&quot; of bonobo behavior doesn't explain why the other well known<br>
chimp species (pan), does not engage in such behavior [Is the other<br>
species less 'fallen?' By how many degrees of 'fallenness?'], it also<br>
seems to me most unfair that these attractive, harmless chimps should have<br>
been affected in any way by Adam eating a piece of fruit. But I will admit<br>
that they seem to enjoy the results.<br>

Concerning the claim that homosexuality is &quot;unnatural&quot;. Perhaps the Pope<br>
is suggesting that it lies beyond the scope of &quot;normal&quot; human behavior. If<br>
so, this has uncomfortable implications for an association of old men who<br>
wear dresses, hear voices and practice ritual cannibalism. Self-enforced<br>
celibacy is all but unknown among other animal species. If any sexual<br>
behavior is out of tune with the natural world, it is surely that of the<br>
priesthood.<br>

don't practice Catholicism.<br>

WHAT ABOUT SEMI-SAME SEX MARRIAGES?<br>
Paul the apostle wrote in the first chapter of his letter to the<br>
congregation in Rome that it was wrong for a woman to &quot;burn&quot; for another<br>
woman. But what if the other &quot;woman&quot; has both a vagina and a penis (where<br>
her clitoris is usually located)? Such people exist. What kind of<br>
condemnation should apply to them? Are such people allowed to &quot;burn&quot; for<br>
people of either sex?<br>
<br>
Cases of inter-sexed human babies include different degrees and types of<br>
inter-sexuality. &quot;When all causes of inter-sexuality are considered, as<br>
many as one in 2,000 babies are affected.&quot; (Altheaea Yronwode, &quot;Intersex<br>
Individuals Dispute Wisdom of Surgery on Infants,&quot; Transgender Tapestry,<br>
Issue #88, Fall 1999) The American Medical Association has decreed that<br>
doctors ought to operate on the genitalia of such infants to ensure that<br>
every inter-sexed baby is &quot;made to fit&quot; into either the &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot;<br>
categories that society prides itself on being able to easily distinguish.<br>
<br>
In the case of a baby who has not been operated on (because their parents<br>
did not allow it), and who has grown into an adult having breasts, a<br>
vagina, and a penis instead of a clitoris, what decision should churches<br>
make? To allow such a person to wed a partner of either gender means that<br>
that church approves of &quot;semi-same sex&quot; marriages. (How far is that from<br>
approving of &quot;same sex&quot; marriages?) Another option would be for churches<br>
to insist on operations for all babies born with inter-sexed genitalia, in<br>
other words such children must be mutilated for having messed up the neat<br>
and tidy categories of human sexuality with which the Bible deals. The AMA<br>
is beginning to shy away from continuing such operations, so maybe<br>
churches will need to mount a counter campaign to maintain them! Or maybe<br>
churches can continue to do what they have done all along, simply ignore<br>
the theological questions that &quot;inter-sexed&quot; people raise. Certainly the<br>
Bible gives little assurance as to how to proceed and &quot;what to condemn&quot; in<br>
such cases.<br>

FIVE HUNDRED BRAVE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN THANKED BY CHRISTIANS<br>
A long time ago before the Roman Empire arose, an enormous Persian army<br>
attempted to conquer the Greeks. The city-states of the Greeks had been<br>
quarreling with one another, but when news of the advancing Persian army<br>
reached the Greeks they put aside their differences and banded together.<br>
Five hundred soldiers from the Greek city of Sparta volunteered to<br>
distract the entire Persian army of tens of thousands, while the Greek<br>
city-states prepared for battle at Thermopylae, a battle that the Greeks<br>
won. If the Persians had won, perhaps their resolve would have<br>
strengthened and the Persians and their religion might have moved further<br>
into Europe, or at the very least maintained their hold on the Middle East<br>
longer. In which case, Christianity might never have arisen. Leaving such<br>
questions aside, there is one thing that historians are fairly sure about,<br>
that many of the five hundred Spartans whose ultimate sacrifice bought the<br>
Greeks time to consolidate their forces and defeat the Persians at<br>
Thermopylae. were &quot;gay.&quot;<br>

If AIDS represents &quot;God's condemnation&quot; of homosexual behavior, what do<br>
measles, mumps, small pox, tuberculosis, and polio represent? &quot;God's<br>
condemnation&quot; of &quot;childish&quot; behavior? Half the children who were born two<br>
hundred years ago never reached the age of eight, due mainly to diseases<br>
like those. What did the &quot;flu&quot; epidemic (from 1918 to 1920) that made half<br>
the world sick and killed nearly 40 million people represent? Maybe &quot;God&quot;<br>
was &quot;condemning&quot; people for touching the same things and breathing the<br>
same air? What damnable behavior worthy of death!<br>

If I read them correctly some Religious Right figures seem to be saying<br>
that AIDS is &quot;god's punishment&quot; for homosexuals, as well as for babies<br>
perverse enough to be born of women raped by hemophiliacs, drug abusers,<br>
or Haitian men.<br>
<br>
Why didn't god give AIDS to Socrates or Plato or Aristotle or Alexander<br>
the Great? Or to Shakespeare or Leonardo da Vinci? Or to King James (who<br>
decreed the production of the King James Bible), or to Erasmus (who<br>
collected the Greek and Latin manuscripts for that Bible)? Did god think<br>
that the homosexual acts they committed were less wicked than those<br>
practiced in California and New York today?<br>
<br>
On the brighter side, this tragic disease has prompted more research into<br>
immune processes in twenty months than we have gained in the last twenty<br>
years. If and when AIDS is cured homosexuals will be safer than ever<br>
before. And where will god's efforts have succeeded then?<br>

AIDS is a dream come true for a few Christians who rejoice to see what<br>
they call, &quot;God's will being done.&quot; Such Christians cite Psalm 58:10, &quot;The<br>
righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance, he will bathe his feet<br>
in the blood of the wicked.&quot; The author of Deuteronomy 28:63 even depicted<br>
such rejoicing as one of God's traits, &quot;.the Lord will rejoice over you to<br>
destroy you.&quot;<br>
<br>
But if you are tossing out Bible verses it would appear that the author of<br>
Proverbs felt differently than the authors of Deuteronomy and the Psalms.<br>
Because the author of Proverbs wrote, &quot;Do not rejoice when your enemy<br>
falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles.If your enemy is<br>
hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to<br>
drink.He who rejoices at calamity shall not go unpunished.&quot; (Prov. 17:5;<br>
24:17 &amp; 25:21) <br>

I recently visited Colorado Springs, Colorado, the home of several<br>
Christian media empires, and saw an effeminate man in a pink ruffled shirt<br>
standing on a street corner holding a sign that read, &quot;Help Us Find A Cure<br>
For AIDS.&quot; The empty bucket at his feet was labeled, &quot;National AIDS<br>
Foundation.&quot; On the opposite corner was a loudly dressed woman with high<br>
hair and bright makeup, holding a sign that read, &quot;Help Save Homosexuals<br>
from Their Sin! Give to Christian Broadcasting!&quot; and she had a bucket at<br>
her feet overflowing with money. In fact, people were skirting the side of<br>
the street the guy was on, just to cross over and fill the lady's bucket<br>
with more cash. So I gave the guy some advice, &quot;If you're gonna solicit<br>
for AIDS research you should pick another part of town, or try another<br>
city, because people are filling up that lady's bucket simply because they<br>

THE GAY-JV BIBLE<br>
<br>
<br>
How many folks know that King James (who commissioned the King James<br>
Bible) loved men and had sex with them? At the age of thirteen James fell<br>
madly in love with his male cousin Esme Stuart whom he made Duke of<br>
Lennox. James deferred to Esme to the consternation of his ministers. In<br>
1582 James was kidnapped and forced to issue a proclamation against his<br>
lover and send him back to France.<br>
<br>
Later, James fell in love with a poor young Scotsman named Robert Carr.<br>
&quot;The king leans on his [Carr's] arm, pinches his cheeks, smooths his<br>
ruffled garment, and when he looks upon Carr, directs his speech to<br>
others.&quot; (Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, in a letter, 1611)<br>
<br>
Carr eventually ended the relationship after which the king expressed his<br>
dissatisfaction in a letter to Carr, &quot;I leave out of this reckoning your<br>
long creeping back and withdrawing yourself from lying in my chamber,<br>
notwithstanding my many hundred times earnest soliciting you to the<br>
contrary...Remember that (since I am king) all your being, except your<br>
breathing and soul, is from me.&quot; (See The Letters of King James I &amp; VI,<br>
ed., G. P. V. Akrigg, Univ. of Calif. Press, 1984. Also see Royal Family,<br>
Royal Lovers: King James of England and Scotland, David M. Bergeron, Univ.<br>

Although the title page of The King James Bible boasted that it was &quot;newly<br>
translated out of the original tongues,&quot; the work was actually a revision<br>
of The Bishop's Bible of 1568, which was a revision of The Great Bible of<br>
1539, which was itself based on three previous English translations from<br>
the early 1500s. So, the men who produced the King James Bible not only<br>
inherited some of the errors made by previous English translators, but<br>
invented some of their own. It was also sponsored by a king whose vanity<br>
demanded a Bible with his name on it.<br>
<br>
Desiderius Erasmus was a &quot;Christian humanist&quot; who collected Greek and<br>
Latin New Testament manuscripts, compared and edited them, verse by verse,<br>
selecting what he thought were the earliest and most well attested variant<br>
passages, until he produced what came to be known as the &quot;textus<br>
receptus.&quot; Early English translations of the Bible, like those mentioned<br>
above, were based on his &quot;textus receptus.&quot; Erasmus was also a monk whom<br>
some historians believe engaged in homosexual activities.<br>
<br>
But without King James and Erasmus, the most widely touted Bible in<br>
Christian history would never have been produced, the KJV (or shall we<br>
say, Gay-JV?) Bible.<br>

(THE BIBLE AS A GUIDE TO FINDING A MARRIAGE PARTNER)<br>

is a religious marriage ceremony set forth; it was a business contract<br>
between the father and bridegroom, a simple exchange of property.<br>

trim her nails, and give her new clothes. Then she's yours. (Deut.<br>
21:11-13)<br>
<br>
2) &quot;Lay hold on&quot; a virgin who is not betrothed to another man, and have<br>
sex with her, but afterwards pay her father a sum of money. Then she's<br>
yours. (Deut. 22:28-29) <br>
<br>
3) Find a prostitute and marry her. (Hosea 1:1-3)<br>

4) Find a man with seven daughters, and impress him by watering his flock.<br>

<br>
5) Purchase a piece of property, and get a woman as part of the deal. -<br>
Boaz (Ruth 4:5-10)<br>
<br>
6) Go to a party and hide. When the women come out to dance, grab one and<br>
carry her off to be your wife. - Benjaminites (Judges 21:19-25)<br>
<br>
7) Have God create a wife for you while you sleep. Note: this will cost<br>
you a rib. - Adam (Gen. 2:19-24)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Agree to work seven years in exchange for a woman's hand in marriage.<br>
Get tricked into marrying the wrong woman. Then work another seven years<br>
for the woman you wanted to marry in the first place. That's right.<br>
Fourteen years of toil for a wife. - Jacob (Gen. 29:15-30)<br>
<br>
9) Cut 200 foreskins off of your future father-in-law's enemies and get<br>
his daughter for a wife. - David (1 Sam. 18:27)<br>
<br>
10) Even if no one is out there, just wander around a bit and you'll<br>
definitely find someone. - Cain (Gen. 4:16-17)<br>
<br>
11) Become the emperor of a huge nation and hold a beauty contest. -<br>
Xerxes or Ahasuerus (Esther 2:3-4)<br>
<br>
12) When you see someone you like, go home and tell your parents, &quot;I have<br>
seen a woman; now get her for me.&quot; If your parents question your decision,<br>
simply say, &quot;Get her for me. She's the one for me.&quot; - Samson (Judges<br>

<br>
13) Kill any husband and take HIS wife. (Prepare to lose four sons<br>
though.) - David (2 Sam. 11)<br>
<br>
14) Wait for your brother to die. Take his widow. (It's not just a good<br>
idea, it's the law!) - Onan and Boaz (Deut. or Lev., example in Ruth)<br>
<br>
15) Don't be so picky. Make up for quality with quantity. - Solomon (1<br>
Kings 11:1-3)<br>
<br>
16) A wife?.NOT! - Paul (1 Cor. 7, see quotations below)<br>
It is good for a man not to touch a woman [sexually]. For I would that all<br>
men were even as I myself. I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it<br>
is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let<br>
them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. I suppose therefore<br>
that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a<br>
man so to be. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife. The time is<br>
short: it remains that they that have wives be as though they had none. He<br>
that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may<br>
please the Lord: But he that is married cares for the things that are of<br>
the world, how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a<br>
wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord,<br>
that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married<br>
cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. And<br>
this I speak for your own profit. that you may attend upon the Lord<br>
without distraction.<br>
- 1 Cor. 7:1,7,8-9,26-27,29,32-35<br>

<br>
SAINT AUGUSTINE ON WHY ALL MEN SHOULD ABSTAIN FROM SEXUAL INTERCOURSE<br>
In the first times, it was the duty to use marriage.chiefly for the<br>
propagation of the human race. But now, in order to enter upon holy and<br>
pure fellowship. they who wish to contract marriage for the sake of<br>
children, are to be admonished, that they use rather the larger good of<br>
continence. But I am aware of some that murmur, &quot;What if all men should<br>
abstain from all sexual intercourse, whence will the human race exist?&quot;<br>
Would that all would. Much more speedily would the City of God be filled,<br>
and the end of the world hastened. <br>
<br>
For what else does the Apostle Paul exhort to, when he says, &quot;I would that<br>
all were as myself;&quot; or in that passage, &quot;But this I say, brethren, the<br>
time is short: it remains that both they who have wives, be as though not<br>
having: and they who weep, as though not weeping: and they who rejoice, as<br>
though not rejoicing: and they who buy, as though not buying: and they who<br>
use this world as though they use it not. For the form of this world is<br>
passing away.&quot; (1 Cor. 7:7-8, 29-31)<br>
- Saint Augustine (c. 354-430), On the Good of Marriage, Sections 9-10<br>
CELIBACY AND CONQUERING ONE'S CARNAL DESIRES<br>
<br>
<br>
SAINT JEROME<br>
I am aware that some have laid it down that virgins of Christ must not<br>
bathe with eunuchs or married women, because the former still have the<br>
minds of men and the latter may present the ugly spectacle of swollen<br>
[pregnant] bellies. For my part I say that mature girls must not bathe at<br>
all, because they ought to blush to see themselves naked.<br>
- Saint Jerome (c. 342-420)<br>
<br>
Saint Jerome conquered his carnal visions of dancing maidens by throwing<br>
himself in tears before a crucifix, beating his breast with a stone, and<br>
fleeing into the desert.<br>

SAINT BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX<br>
Saint Bernard of Clairvaux threw himself into half-frozen ponds to free<br>
himself from sexual temptation. He also wrote lengthy commentaries on the<br>
biblical Song of Songs (also called &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;) &quot;to prove it<br>
was not about sex&quot; - a feat without equal in the history of biblical<br>
interpretation.for its foolhardiness.<br>
<br>
My breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.<br>
- Song of Songs 8:10<br>
<br>
That couldn't possibly be about sex could it?<br>
<br>
Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts like clusters of<br>
grapes.I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also your breasts shall<br>
be as clusters of the vine.<br>
- Song of Songs 7:7-8<br>
<br>
&quot;Really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree&quot; was how the Steve Miller<br>
Band sang it in their hit song, &quot;The Joker.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let us get up early to the vineyard.There will I give thee my loves. The<br>
mandrakes give a smell and at our gates [or doors] are all manner of<br>
pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.<br>
- Song of Songs 7:12-13<br>
<br>
&quot;Gates&quot; or &quot;doors&quot; are euphemisms for the genitalia. And the two-pronged<br>
&quot;mandrake&quot; root is crotch-shaped. Since ancient times &quot;mandrakes&quot; have<br>
been related to sexual potency. Take Genesis chapter 30 in which Jacob's<br>
barren wife tells him she has &quot;hired him [a child] with mandrake.&quot;<br>
Speaking of &quot;pleasant fruits,&quot; notice how &quot;breasts&quot; are described as<br>
&quot;clusters of grapes,&quot; and be sure to keep an eye on further appearances of<br>
&quot;fruit&quot; in the Song of Solomon:<br>
<br>
As the apple tree among the trees of the world, so is my beloved among the<br>
sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was<br>
sweet to my taste.<br>
- Song of Songs 2:3<br>
<br>
Hmmm, that wouldn't be referring to fellatio, would it?<br>
<br>
The smell of your nose, like apples.<br>
- Song of Songs 7:8<br>
<br>
Translated literally it's puzzling. &quot;Noses&quot; do not &quot;smell like apples.&quot;<br>
The Anchor Bible dissects the linguistics, concluding that this refers to<br>
the scent of a woman's &quot;vulva.&quot; The reference to &quot;apples&quot; also mirrors<br>
verse 2:3 where the female &quot;sits in the shadow&quot; of the male's &quot;apple tree&quot;<br>
and finds his &quot;fruit&quot; &quot;sweet&quot; to her &quot;taste.&quot; Should not her &quot;fruit&quot; smell<br>
equally as &quot;sweet&quot; to him?<br>
<br>
Your navel [literal Hebrew, &quot;groove&quot; or &quot;slit&quot;] a rounded crater, may it<br>
never lack punch!<br>
- Song of Songs 7:2<br>
<br>
It is not difficult to spot the euphemism being employed in this case.<br>
Cunnilingus anyone?<br>
<br>
Whew! If the Song of Songs is about &quot;Jesus's love for the church&quot; as Saint<br>
Bernard says, then maybe the marketers of Viagra should use Jesus as their<br>
new spokesperson and quote from the Song of Songs in their ads.<br>
- E.T.B.<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Poetic allusions to the most intimate of female charms are sometimes<br>
overlooked or studiously ignored by translators. In the Song of Songs 2:17<br>
the lady invites her lover to be like a gazelle on &quot;cleft mount(s)&quot; and in<br>
8:14 the invitation is to &quot;spice mound(s).&quot;<br>
<br>
The lady of the Song speaks of her unguarded vineyard (1:6), and there is<br>
frequent reference (2:16; 4:5; 5:1; 6:2) to the garden(s) where the lover<br>
grazes, not among &quot;lilies&quot; (as traditionally understood), but on the<br>
lotus, an ancient and famous sexual symbol. The body part praised as a<br>
rounded crater (mixing bowl) never to lack mix (7:2) is hardly the navel<br>
but a receptacle not far below. The all-spice part(s) of the lady (4:13)<br>
are not &quot;shoots&quot; but a &quot;groove&quot; or &quot;conduit&quot; [the vulva].<br>
<br>
Song of Songs 5:4 states, &quot;My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the<br>
door, and my bowels were moved for him&quot; which is suggestive of<br>
intercourse.&quot;Hand&quot; appears as a euphemism in another part of the Bible<br>
which states, &quot;You have loved their bed, You have looked on their manhood<br>
[literal Hebrew, 'looked on their hand'].&quot; (Isaiah 57:8, NASB) And the<br>
Dead Sea scrolls refer to a member of the Hebrew religious community at<br>
Qumran being fined for exposing his &quot;hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is even sexual suggestiveness in the use of the word &quot;couch&quot; in Song<br>
of Songs 1:12-13 (which states, &quot;While the king was on his couch, my nard<br>
gave forth its fragrance.&quot; - RSV). The double entendre meaning of &quot;couch&quot;<br>
is illuminated by Rabbi Judah's ancient remark that Jerusalem men were<br>
lewd: &quot;One would say to his colleague, 'On what did you dine today? On<br>
well-kneaded bread or on bread not kneaded; on white wine or dark wine; on<br>
a broad couch or a narrow couch; with a good companion or a poor<br>
companion?'&quot; &quot;All these queries,&quot; Hisda explained, refer &quot;to fornication.&quot;<br>
- Marvin H. Pope, &quot;Bible, Euphemism and Dysphemism In The,&quot; Anchor Bible<br>
Dictionary, Vol. I<br>
____________________________<br>
<br>
Just because the author of the Song of Songs praises &quot;well favored&quot; women<br>
with &quot;breasts like towers,&quot; is no reason to think &quot;the Lord&quot; finds &quot;favor&quot;<br>
with them. He's into virginity - into it deeper than any Protestant ever<br>
imagined. Take the following heavenly scene: <br>
<br>
I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they sung as it<br>
were a new song before the throne [of the Lord]...and no man could learn<br>
that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed<br>
from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they<br>
are virgins.<br>
- Revelation 14: 2-4<br>
<br>
Of course I wonder why it is so important to &quot;not be defiled with women.&quot;<br>
And why Moses felt it was important for Israelite men to &quot;come not at<br>
their wives&quot; before &quot;meeting the Lord.&quot; (Exodus 19:15,17)  What is so bad<br>
about having a little nookie before meeting the Lord? And why did Paul<br>
teach that &quot;those who have wives should be as though they had none&quot; and<br>
wish that &quot;all were as myself [celibate]?&quot; And why did Jesus say that<br>
&quot;some have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven?&quot; (Mat.<br>
19:12) <br>
<br>
What's the lesson behind all this? There appears to have been some ancient<br>
taboo about a woman &quot;spiritually defiling&quot; a man by having sex with him. <br>

Three young Irish candidates for the priesthood are told by the Monsignor<br>
they have to pass one more test: The Celibacy Test. The Monsignor leads<br>
them into a room, and tells them to undress, and a small bell is tied to<br>
each man's willy. In comes a beautiful woman, wearing a sexy belly-dancer<br>
costume. She begins to dance sensually around the first candidate.<br>
<br>
*Ting-a-ling*<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Patrick,&quot; says the Monsignor, &quot;I am so disappointed in your lack of<br>
control. Run along now and take a long, cold shower and pray about your<br>
carnal weakness.&quot; <br>
<br>
The candidate leaves. The dancer continues, dancing around the second<br>
candidate, slowly peeling off her layers of veils.  As the last veil drops:<br>
<br>
*Ting-a-ling*<br>
<br>
&quot;Joseph, Joseph,&quot; sighs the Monsignor. &quot;You too are unable to withstand<br>
your carnal desires.  Off you go... take a long, cold shower and pray for<br>
forgiveness.&quot;<br>
<br>
The dancer continues, dancing naked in front of the final candidate.<br>
Nothing.  She writhes up and down against his body. No response. Finally,<br>
exhausted, she quits.<br>
<br>
&quot;Michael, my son, I am truly proud of you,&quot; says the Monsignor. &quot;Only you<br>
have the true strength of character needed to become a priest. Now, go and<br>
join your weaker brethren in the showers.&quot;<br>

By the fact that you mention same sex kissing you show your issue is with homosexuality. You even say hetero. I find this revealing and damning of you.. if your problem was just kissing, you would NEVER have brought up &quot;homosexual&quot; or &quot;hetero&quot;. Sorry, but shame on you.<br>

Let me get this straight:  he says he doesn't like the sig.  That's his choice and his right.  Just as it's Robin's choice and right to display a sig with the qualities that his exhibits.  <br>

Robin knows damn well that it offends the sensibilities some people.  And believe it or not, those people that it may offend are not necessarily bigots, homohaters, homophobic or anthing else that you wish to trounce on so gleefully.<br>

You are a clown.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you're far more prejudiced than &quot;Skipy&quot; whom you're jabbing your finger at.  I'm a clown because my sig has Charlies Angel's in it?  WTF is wrong with you?<br>
<br>
Are you a florist becuase you have a petunia in your sig?  Are you irrationally anxious becuase the dark elf in your sig is looking to the right rather pensively?  Are you a murderous bludgeoner because the dark elf carries a big hammer?<br>
<br>
If you're making direct correlations between the people and their signatures, and typifying them accordingly, turn off your computer and go get some fresh air outside and have an actual conversation with a person, face to face.<br>
<br>
And yes, some people may be offended by Robin because he rubs his homosexuality in their face with his sigs.  He's proud he's gay, that's cool, but he knows it will rub some folks the wrong way.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there are also people who are offended by overt displays of intimacy/sexuality...particulary on a website frequented by minors.  <br>
<br>
If you can't understand that, or would rather ignore that possibility so that you can pursue your witch-hunt because it makes you feel good to call folks bigots (and you don't even know what that means truly), maggots and other things, then you're in the same boat as your accused.<br>

Just because Slack Bladder has increased his backpeddle skill by (3) doesnt mean I suddenly believe he wasnt here.  <br>
<br>
Kurley I appreciate your views in defense here but have to add my own feelings.  If someone is so afraid of 'kissing' or the dangers a picture of 'kissing' will introduce to thier children they should stop reading this board, right now.  This is an adult community by and large, you need only look to the adimistrations example to see this.  While I have no idea why someone would fear examples of love and affection I am certain that the internet is no place for such a person to look for reprisal. <br>
<br>
Anyhow I think this thread has run its course.  And I'll leave the rest of my treatise regarding it to sit within my heart and head.  Its late, and this is no longer in the spirit of our server.<br>

<br>
Lasgalen started with much racier sigs (personally I thought the Think Dirty/Play Nice sig was brilliant) and first added pants (you gotta admit las, that cod piece was a touch... optomistic?), then struck it entierly.  So it's not as though he isn't trying.  But even when he takes it down to the level of his current sig, there's still people whining.  Frankly, if I were him, I'd throw my hands up in the air and make a TRULY disturbing sig... possibly two guys in bondage gear having anal intercourse while wearing monkey masks with a burning American flag in the background.  Hey, if people are gonna whine, give them something to really whine about.<br>

<br>
I won't be a &quot;doctor&quot; after my exams are over, so calling me Dr. Las is a little premature.  Flattering, but premature.  Presuming I pass the qualifying exams, I'll be ABD--&quot;all but dissertation&quot;.  The dissertation will take at least a year to write.<br>
<br>
Even then, I won't be a &quot;doctor&quot; who can prescribe you meds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=35.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=35.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=35.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=35.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=35.topic&start=101&stop=112>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showPrevMessage?topicID=35.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showNextMessage?topicID=35.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.threadControl?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49>The Dead Horse Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.31c<br>Copyright 1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
