     If he is going in for college money, education, or a short tour then air force is the choice.  They have the best housing, facilities, and allow their members a better chance to improve thier education while gaining valued skills for civilian life.<br>
     The army is not an easy enviroment.  It is harsh at times, things can become very unpredictable fast and with constent deployments army schools and college courses arent easy to get except thru correspodence courses and online classes.         <br>
     Now I will always be on the side of the army as I spent 8 years active, most of it in germany, as mechanized infantry dismount and then medic..  I did three long deployments that at the time I silently complained to myself about but would never want to lose the memeries of.  While the air force teaches you how to manage men the army teaches you how to lead from the front.  While the air force usually sleeps in bays or at least tents, in the army you might find yourself curled under a tree with just a poncho to try to keep dry.  (never works)  Most gear the air force uses isnt on thier back like an army soldier who at times may carry well over 100 pounds in gear.  Add an objective 15 miles away and it becomes an interesting mission.<br>
     Now I am sure there are MOSs in the army that allow more time for soldiers to get an education but as infantry their is very little.  But I dont know your brothers choice of job either.    I left with only the education I got by taking any class when it became available and my medical training.  But I learned other valued skills much harder to get in the civilain world.  And as any military person can tell you once you go military you will never be able to look at a civilain in the same way.  It changes you.<br>
<br>
The one thing I would recommend to your brother is to review in detail the occupations he is interested in and then decide where he wants to go.  But no matter what job he chooses he will only perform that job 50 percent of the time.  there is always a nice list of duties the recruiter fails to tell you.  How many here remember hearing about dry sweap from their recruiter.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tudilfv>TudilFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/03 7:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2032.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Military</span><hr size=1> 2 years active Army and 20 years ARNG.

It's the only branch of the sevice that send the officers out to fight while the enlisted stay back where it's safe, and warm, and dry, and you can go to school. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I tried to go to school in the Army, but field training exercises kept interfering with my classes. <br>
<br>
No matter what cushy MOS you think you're getting in the Army, the Army will find a way to screw it up. I went to see an active duty recruiter (father was a Nat'l Guard recruiter). I'm color blind so that limited anything in the electronics, medical, or combat fields. I hated typing in highschool so I knew I didn't want that. The recruiter told me my MOS would be a 31C single channel radio operator. Yeah, right. It's also known as a radio teletype operator...key word there is type.<br>
I spent 10 weeks in the middle of the hottest, muggiest weather I ever endured, in Augusta GA. Nasty place. <br>
<br>
I was stationed at FT Bliss and assigned to a Patriot missile battery that had no equipment at all. None, zero, zilch, which is why I started attending classes at UTEP. 4 weeks later the new stuff started rolling in. All brand new, in crates or boxes. The vehicles had less than 30 miles on them in most cases. So, being a radio teletype operator, I was assigned to be the battery commander's driver. For two years, I drove her, and then him around. Spent every freakin' week in the field testing this stuff. In the mid 80's the Patriot system was still experimental. So after all the time and money the army spent training me to be a radio teletype operator, I never ever once saw the inside or a RATT rig. I became a...truck driver, LOL<br>
And that was scoring a 94 on my AASVAB test. Only needed a 30 to pass.<br>
<br>
so yeah, GO AIR FORCE <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bloops>Bloops</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/03 8:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2032.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Military</span><hr size=1> If he whats to join the service, Why no go all out and be a Marine.

Don't get me wrong, I love em both but even they will tell you that there is so much B.S. about the mythos that it's rediculous.<br>
<br>
Now, with that out of the way.  I'd say it all depends on what your brother wants out of his time in the service.  Is he planning on becoming a career military man?  or is he interested in a tour or two and then taking advantage of the benefits? (college, etc).<br>
<br>
Either way, I (and my brother looking over my shoulder) cant recommend enough, that he pursue a M.O.S. (job) that will benefit him when he gets out.  The military offers alot of trade and technical training that anyone should take advantage of, and much of that can earn him any number of nice job opportunities as a civilian.  There isn't much call in civilian life for paratroopers, but if he looks into some of the nuclear fields the navy offers, he could very well land a pricey job when he's ready to become a civilian once again.<br>
<br>
Whichever branch he chooses, DO NOT let him fall for the bravado the Army/Marine Corps spouts off about.  While there is alot of tradition in both branches, neither of them are today, what they were in world war 1 and 2 (and the days of Chesty Puller and other &quot;famous&quot; soldiers)... in the sense that going to Parris Island, or San Diego for 12 weeks or training or so will instantly allow you to whip 5 men.<br>
<br>
The best bet would be to look into all branches.. find out what they offer, and then set down with the family and discuss the long term goals and effects of a service term.  We are in an age where it seems that we fall into one war after another, so long deployments into unfriendly areas seem very likely.  Even today soldiers are being wounded or killed in Iraq, and who knows where tomorrows war will be fought...<br>
<br>
Talk with your family, friends.. know that there are risks that dont end with yourself, since soldiers in war zones have worried families at home.  I have a brother who was a planned &quot;lifer&quot; in the Marine Corps, who was wounded in Iraq; badly enough to end his military career.  And while this has altered his career plans, and has been a disappointment to him, I can honestly say that I am glad he's out of that life.  I cant imagine the horror or stress of a war zone, but I do know that the horror and stress at home while someone you love is terrible.<br>

Air Force promotes on testable knowledge, job performance and skills, education, and community service. And yes, the Air Force has the best housing, base facilities, equipment, etc etc etc. And yes, we send the officers, not the enlisted, out to fight the war.

When they recieve funds to build a base for example, they build all the recreation and support facilities first, when the money runs out, and there is no airfield to make the base operational, of course they ask for and get more money.<br>
<br>
The Marine Corps isnt for everyone. Mission always comes first. So when they recieve money for a base they buildthe required facilities first and build the recreation stuff with whats left.<br>
<br>
If Your Brother has the scores, go airforce if you arent staying in for a career. More oportunity for schooling and education training while in. If he wants a career investigate all 4 services and pick the one that fits his image of what he wants to be.<br>
<br>
Pride in self and service is rather important, something some of the services have forgotten and dont teach their people.<br>
<br>
Obvously though, if he has a specific job in mind, check which service has that Job and which one will give him written proof he can be enlisted into that training. Dont ever believe anything that isnt in writing. Recruiters have a hard job and will say what they must to get you in.

Airforce will treat you better, but its still the Military and the Military is about 30 years behind the Civilan world in ..well just generally taking fuckin care of people.

The rest of your obligation is with the IRR. or individual ready reserve. If you retire from the military, you are part of the IRR for life. The IRR is a pool of trained, healthy bodies that the military can draw from if needed. To give you a personal perspective, I retired from the Nat'l Guard. The whole time I was reserve, we were never activated, not once. I retired last year and now my unit is put on the DOD scource list to go to either, Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Balkans. Guess what? My unit is understrength, so they are planning to activate the recently retired. <br>

The military does teach you discipline, patience, and promotes self-esteem after they rip it away from in Basic Training. And if you join the Marines, you'll be the butt of every stupid joke the military ever invented. There's a reason the two GI's were making fun of the Marines in Hamburger Hill, when the truck driver was trying to get rid of a trailer. &quot;find a Marine to sign for it&quot; &quot;yeah, those dumb f$%#ers will do anything&quot;<br>
<br>
A sailor and a marine walk out into an alley, behind a bar, to urinate. When they're done, the Marine looks at the Sailor and says &quot;In the Marines, they teach us to wash our hands after pissing&quot; the sailor replies&quot;In the Navy, they teach us not to piss on our hands&quot;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's NONE of those things.  I was in the Marine Corps.. there were MANY times when I did not get fed in order to complete my job and would have to spend my own money for food.<br>
<br>
You spend alot of time in the field.. and only one of those times was there ever a roof over my head (and that a tent roof)<br>
<br>
I learned something.. how to count bullets.  They put me in the job they needed people in, and I did it, but come to find out when I'm a civilian again I don't even qualify for a warehouse job because the civilians use computers and scanners and such and in the Corps we used good old papers and index cards.<br>
<br>
Also.. I was put on anti-depressants and summarily separated from the Marine Corps.  I also saw lots of people get out early for medical reasons.. admin separation.  It isn't exactly job security unless you stay in your tip-top shape, something not as easy to do with the strenuous lifestyle.<br>

Generally speaking, however, it is a job.  For however long you are in, it's security.  And sometimes you just can't get out even if you wanted to (stop loss, anyone?).  It's promised pay twice a month of X amount.  As long as Finance doesn't screw up your pay, that is.  <br>
<br>
Sure, the military sucks, I've said it myself countless times since I've been in.  But I'm not getting out anytime soon; I've seen the job market, it sucks worse than my opinion of the military in general. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=2032.topic&start=21&stop=37>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=2032.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=2032.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2032.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=2032.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2032.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2032.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31b<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
