I'd like any additional input on my top choices.  I haven't played EQ for about 10 months, and won't have a huge amount of time to play.  So, I'm trying to pick characters that can both solo and group well at most levels, and ones that aren't terribly complicated to master.<br>
<br>
My top choices:<br>
<br>
1) Vah Shir Shaman.  Seems like it might not be a particularly complex class to play, and not too hard to solo for when I don't have a lot of time.  The safe fall, sneak and neutrality seem like they might be nice bonuses.  Also, at least in my limited experience, Shamans always seemed to be in demand by groups.  Alchemy seems like the natural hobby, is it worthwhile?<br>
<br>
2) Gnome Enchanter.  If I recall Enchanters were always in high demand by groups, and most chanters said they soloed much better than people think.  Seems like it might be pretty complex to play with the overwhelming number of spells and corresponding research and components, not to mention mastering mezzes and such.  Jewelry and enchanting always seemed fun/useful as a primary hobby unless this has changed recently.<br>
<br>
3) Halfling Druid:  My limited EQ experience was with my L17 Druid on Terris Thule.  Seemed like a relatively easy class to play, though not always in demand for groups.  I already have a Druid, so this one would probably be easiest for me but also a little boring for the same reason.<br>
<br>
4) Dwarf Cleric.  Haven't really researched this one much.  Might also consider other combinations if they seem to fit my criteria.<br>
<br>
Any other input much appreciated, especially on where to put bonus ability and early skill points.  <br>
<br>
I'm leaning toward the Vah Shir Shaman, so I'd really appreciate comments if you also play one.  Comments also appreciated on how these or other choices might fill needs on Firiona Vie.  Thanks again! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utimiachaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Timia Chaos</A> at: 8/7/02 5:41:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unahide.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nahide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 6:14:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2503.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advice on creation please, esp from Shamans and Enchante</span><hr size=1> There seem to be very few Vah Shir Shammies out there, I love my shammy partner Mystikat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53989>Nahide' Altaica , Khala Dun Journeycat Champion of the 54th rank</a><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>

So much that I have not logged in on my other characters but once since I started her.  It is a lot of work as a Vah Shir, but I liked the quests I had to do.  I've only been playing since the beginning of May, but I think out of all the characters I have, my Vah Shir Shaman is my favorite.  My guild has lost many Vah Shir because of the quest intensive beginning, but I think it's so cool that in running the Citizenship quest you can make or just about make your first level.<br>
<br>
I suggest going over all the Vah Shir Shaman quests ahead of time so you know what items you need for each quest so you know what you need ahead of time.  It's so much better that way.  I personally didn't leave Luclin until my character's 29th level.  By then it was mostly safe to get through Paludal into Shadow Haven(at season 30 the fiends won't aggro you anymore).  <br>
<br>
Contact me if you have more questions, either in game (character is Siokitty) or by email (addy siofra_sedai@yahoo.com).  I'm almost always willing to help a young Vah Shir Shaman (being the Shaman officer for my guild and very devoted to the Vah Shir). <p><center><a href="http://www.freeopendiary.com/entrylist.asp?authorcode=A846251"><img src="http://www.gothictiger.net/CSW/siokitty.gif"></i></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utynsiltemppest.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tynsil Temppest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 8:33:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2503.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advice on creation please, esp from Shamans and Enchante</span><hr size=1> GNOMES RULE!!!  *cackle*<br>

I am a gnome enchantress of a mere 27 seasons and I am looooving it!  Soloing is easy ( well not difficult ), although I usually have a cleric that likes to tag along with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Plus, gnomes are just oh so CUTE!<br>
<br>
Oh and did I mention that you can buff not only melee but casters?  Clarity and Haste are very nice buffs to assist any group!  Mezzing comes in handy as well....especially in dungeons!  Jewel craft has been expensive so far, but the benefit of making my own jewelry has paid off!  Not to mention that even the lower end rings and such still do bring a profit. Plus the new armor quests are pretty nice considering you don't have to be level 50 to get them!  Ahhh so many benefits, so little time!<br>
<br>
Must be going now...gotta get my next spell level so I can have an endless supply of mana!  *cackle*<br>

With regard to #1: put the bulk of bonus points into WIS, as you might guess. As a shaman you can buff every stat except WIS (Bear Form does raise WIS slightly but I'm not counting that) and INT, and INT isn't terribly important for you, so the choice of where to put the last five points isn't critical. I put mine into DEX to raise it to 75. I did that because some stats have effectiveness spikes at multiples of 25. Whether 75 vs 70 DEX makes any notable difference, I do not know. As for beginning practice points, I always put at least 4 into the weapon skill which corresponds with my starting weapon. After that it's wide open.<br>
<br>
Vah Shir as a starting race: there are a plethora of fun quests, and easy access to Paludal Caverns, which from about level 8 to 25 is probably the best low level dungeon in the game. The Caverns also serve as a low level travel barrier as they stand between Shar Vahl and the Nexus, which is a problem. There may be a way to sneak all the way through, but I never found it. Always a patog phlarg fiend that I couldn't maneuver around. Sneak as a racial ability is very nice. To be able to turn apprehensive and dubious merchants into indifferent is helpful.<br>
<br>
Shaman soloability and groupability is in the middle of the pack for both, I think. Enchanter and cleric are the stars of grouping. Druid is one of the best at soloing, and also very useful to groups, but suffer some stigma due to their reputation as soloers who don't know how to function in groups (less of an issue on this server).<br>
<br>
All in all, those are all good choices of class/race, and there are really no wrong choices. Just read up on the classes to learn their roles and strengths, weigh the roleplay and faction considerations of race choice, and follow your heart as to which you want to play. That is the only right answer. <br>

You have access to the vast majority of spell effects, in addition to having a huge number of spells per level, so you'll find yourself shifting between spell sets and blowing a large chunk of cash on spells. Combine this with the fact that getting a fair share of the loot may be difficult, depending on the group, and you can expect to be low on cash quite often. You can also expect to be low on mana, as everyone will demand something of you that will make balancing things difficult; once you get Augmentation at 29, the constant expenditure of mana for hastes will be reduced, but the expense of your slows and buffs will more than make up for it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Enchanters are primarily a defensive support class, much like a Cleric. Due to the fact that, if you're good, you can turn a deathtrap into an easily winnable situation, you'll rarely lack the opportunity to group. Soloing is more difficult, especially if you don't have an extremely high Charisma, as your primary mechanism for soloing is Charm. You can, of course, use the classic &quot;root-and-nuke&quot; method, but the fact that your direct damage spell line (the *one* direct damage spell line we get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is all-or-nothing, easily resistable, and inflicts precious little damage while having a stun component for that extra bit of taunting will make this path difficult. The Animations help, but they're easily destroyed if nothing else is there to help them. This is a function of the fact that an Enchanter's job is to improve the efficiency of the group, not to destroy their foes.<br>
<br>
So, as much as I love playing my Enchanter, I have to admit it's an acquired taste. If you like grouping, don't mind dying (Enchanters and Clerics tend to be the first people to die, mostly because of the aggro levels of their spells and the fact that they're chain-casting them), and have a very high situational awareness, you might like the class. If you want to be the character who stands out in the forefront, taking the enemy down with your magics or melee, a Druid or Shaman would be best of the four classes you mentioned. If you want to be constantly asked into groups, Druids and Clerics are quite popular because of SoW and powerful healing/resurrections, respectively.<br>
<br>
I can offer more advice on enchanting if you want; Illudin is now in the 30th circle of mysteries, and I'm more than happy to answer questions about the class both in and out of character. It's a tricky class to play, but depending on what you want to play, it can be very rewarding. <p>Illudin Arbitrator &lt;Society of Adventurers&gt;<br>

Also, my biggest complaint as a Druid was the constant downtime to regen mana, unless I had a breeze or clarity.  I had hoped having constant access to breeze or clarity would solve that with the enchanter, but it sounds like that may not be the case.  Have they done anything else in the last 10 months to reduce mana downtime for casters?<br>
<br>
I'm leaning toward the Shaman, if only because I already have a Druid.  I've been reading that neutrality allows you to group with anyone, which seems like an advantage.  <br>
<br>
The official site mentions an exp bonus or penalty depending on alignment.  How does that affect a neutral class?  Only a bonus for an all neutral party?  If a good/evil party adds me, do I ruin their bonus?<br>
<br>
For either class, are there any deity selections that have serious impacts?<br>
<br>
Especially for the Vah Shir, are you KOS in any major race areas or towns?  I don't quite understand about turning apprehensive merchants to indifferent as a vah shir shaman- does sneak do that?<br>
<br>
Any other subtle considerations to know about? :-)<br>

<br>
Also played a druid to 53.  No hands on experience on enchanter class.<br>
<br>
I first started playing Shaman on a server switch.  Played  a ranger up to 47 before kunark, and really enjoyed the utility magic and ability to melee.  Shaman seemed the caster type that best fit my play style.  Like to mix it up a bit, can be self sufficient, but also can make a big impact on a group, or even a raid's success.<br>
<br>
Well it wasn't exactly what I had in mind.. You can melee fairly well up to late 20's after that you are pet dependant in that respect.  I thought it was a Wisdom class.  In reality it is a HP/AC class, more like a melee in that respect than a caster.  Why?  at 24 level shaman get a spell called cannibilize.  With this spell they convert 50 hp into 25 mana.  Essentially you are never out of mana as long as you have hitpoints.  The size of your mana pool (wisdom score) becomes secondary to things like hp's and hitpoint regen (also get regeneration spell at lvl 24).  Many very successful shaman in there 50's have wisdom in the 130's.  they instead wear gear to increase AC (prevent getting hit, leaves more for mana conversion) and hitpoints (more for mana conversion).  <br>
<br>
In groups you will buff a lot.  In raids you will buff even more.  <br>
<br>
The true power of the shaman is in debuffing though.  We get the the best line of slows in the game.  Enchanters are second to us in slows and we are second to them in haste.  At lvl 60 the shaman's best slow is 75%.  Without this some encounters are just impossible.  By slow, I mean that the monster will be doing only 25% of its normal damage output if slowed by a lvl 60 shaman.  We get the malisement line (mages are second to us in this) which is similar to the enchanter tash line, except its resistable until the level 60 version.  We get the cripple line, along with enchanters.<br>
<br>
So, you say.. Enchanters can slow, they can tash and they can cripple, plus they get mana regen.  In these ways shaman and Enchanters are similar, but in one important respect they are not.  Shaman have priest class hitpoints and they have chain class armor.  Enchanter slows cast slower and have longer refreshes.  A resisted slow by an enchanter means a dead enchanter in alot of cases.  <br>
<br>
Shaman is a fairly easy class to play, a fairly difficult class to really excel in.<br>
<br>
Anyways this is just a perspective on the shaman class that people don't figure out until higher levels, you should try and figure out how you see yourself.  Are you a bigger than life metal clad figure (all shaman races are medium to large) who is always in the front of the battle, ripping the will to fight out of the enemies throat by brute force?  Or are you a Robe wearing cultured caster type, using subtlety and guile to do the same?  Play what feels right to you. <br>
<br>
Both types are for control freaks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Its just how you go about gaining that control....<br>

It gives you access to spells and effects you dont otherwise get, but generally the cost is too expensive to make selling them to other players near impossible except for certain things like SoW potions....<br>
<br>
That said I have spent the 15k or so to keep my skill maxed for level through 53......  Its a labor of love. <p>Lorec <br>

The Barbarians of Halas are amiable. This is helpful because spell prices in Shar Vahl are very high. It is worth the time to travel to Halas for spell purchases once you are able.<br>
<br>
By using Sneak, you can get behind a merchant and have him regard you indifferently regardless of faction. This allows you to get better prices if the merchant is ordinarily apprehensive. Dubious merchants won't trade at all unless you sneak up behind them.<br>

Great RP potential, and fantastic(game mechanic) ability in the right hands. Taking a long view.. you will end up a soloing God, a Rockstar on raids and every melee's best friend. Clerics will love you for making their job so easy, enchanters will love you for taking the burden of slowing creatures off of them(so fragile /grin).<br>
<br>
Plus the mysticism around shamen is very appropriate and lots of fuel for some fun rp.<br>

<br>
Shammy is extremely boring until level 24. Gets TONS more fun after that. Great solo class and very welcome in groups. A very straight forward class that you can have tons of fun with in the higher levels.<br>
<br>
Gnome's as a race, are one of the &quot;most tolerated&quot; in EQ. Am agnostic gnome can walk into just about any city in EQ. I'll let yo u find out which ones you are KoS in =). Keep in mind, as you gain the ability to cast illusions, your race ** almost ** becomes irrelevant. Gnomes also may not have the best stats for an enchanter but are probably the most fun to roleplay =).<br>
<br>
Enchanters are almost always welcome in groups. Perhaps not in the lower levels but certainly as you gain in power and skill you will almost always be able to get a group. Chanters can do more than just charm when soloing. A few tactics you can use to solo are:<br>
<br>
1. Agro kite - Generate tons of agro (tash / nukes) , make sure you have sow / jboots, and run around with your pet smacking the mob behind you. More effective now with the recent pet changes and in old world zones. Not very effective past level 35 as mobs start to get to many HP.<br>
<br>
2. Chain cast your invuln line - Summon your pet and chain cast (as needed) your re-agentless invuln spells on your pet. Can't recall when you get these spells, but they are spread all over. Very effective once you slow your target and just sit and med up inbetween casts. I still do this from time to time.<br>
<br>
3. Charm - Always good to pick your targets (and pet) carefully. Keep targets rooted. Toss in a nuke here and there if need be. A nice trick to do is to let both your target and your pet get beaten up so by the time your pet wins, its really low health. Then break charm and kill your former pet for xp.<br>
<br>
Have fun! <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

Shaman have more use than beastlords but little kittie kat warders are just cute!!!!!<br>

But seriously both are very involved classes and would be fun.<br>

Although from my personal experience on raids unless you are at a place needing a lot of mezzing ... i.e. Plane of Hate then shaman would probably be more fun because I get to have my nukes resisted more often than anything else at some. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utimiachaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Timia Chaos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/9/02 3:31:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2503.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Thanks Again, All</span><hr size=1> I've created my Vah Shir Shaman on Firiona Vie.
