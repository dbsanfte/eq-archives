I'm not trying to steal anyone's idea, just reiterate it.<br><br>OK.  This would be, in my opinion, a more or less fair solution to the TLC quest problems many people have been having. Simply make it so that no mob below 30 is affected by TLC.  That's it.  Why would this work, in my opinion?  Because there really isn't much worth farming below level 30 anyway.  There are some quests that might be worth it for people to farm, but not that many.  Stricter enforcement of PnP, which I believe does say that you shouldn't be hunting well below your level, would help there.  I'm sorry, but it is ridiculous that Bako, a high-level Iksar monk, should have to be willing to trade a Wu's Fighting Stick, one of the better monk 1HBs, for an item that is the result of a quest that is really quite easy to do.  A saw that WTT ad and thought it was part silly, part sad.  Bako deserves to be able to do his epic, people!  OK, I'm sorry, I just think we have to ask VI to give us something here.  Many of us have invested large amounts of time in these characters, and the low server pop and TLC are making them so much less useful it isn't even funny.  If they won't help us out and the server population continues to go do down, do you think that they'll let us all /movelog to another one?  Not bloody likely. Very sorry to beat a dead, mutilated, sack of meat that doesn't even resemble a horse anymore after all the punishment it's taken, I just wanted opinions on this specific proposal.<br><br>Thanks<br> <p>Tenzin Dralha <BR>Human Monk <BR>30 Seasons Serving Quellious <BR>Proud Member of Starspun</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umheddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mheddik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 1:55:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm, good idea</span><hr size=1> I like it.

There are some people who like it, and I'll admit that I used to be one until I was severely bitten by it.  My proposal, and Bjond I'd welcome your help in getting this done, would be to petition VI incessantly.  The people who play on FV play here for a reason.  We don't like all that ooc nonsense that goes on on other servers.  Constant questions over /ooc and /shout about stupid things.  People auctioning in non-city zones.  All of this is kept to a minimum on FV.  And I think that even if TLC was removed, we still wouldn't see enough of an influx of new players to tip the balance back to the d00ds.  <br><br>Why would a petition work when so many others that various boards have tried over the years haven't?  This is more fundamental and less nit-picky.  Classes have balance issues and petition for mob magic resistance to be lowered, or that they be more mana-efficient or whatever.  The concerns may be valid, but they don't effect the game at the base level like TLC does.  It effects an entire server, and VI would have to admit that rampant TLC problems are part of the reason for the low pop of this server.  They've got dozens of computers devoted to supporting just a few hundred of their subscribers.  (In case you didn't know, a server is actually not just one machine, but many.  One computer can actually only support a few zones.  And though I don't know exactly what they use for servers, you can bet it ain't your grandma's Compaq) This hardly seems efficient, and one of the reasons they open new servers is to lighten the load on the other ones.  So not having people play on a server because it has severe problems doesn't even make sense for them financially.  They have an incentive to make people want to play here.  <br><br>Let's help VI make more money!  Let's lessen the bandwith strain on the other servers by getting people to play on Firiona Vie!  <br><br>Most of the rules, like the chat channel and grouping restrictions, work in my opinion.  TLC doesn't.  Let's tell VI this.  It's easy to fix.  Make a change in the code like my above proposal, or just take it out altogether.  Right now I'd say toss TLC and reinstate NO DROP.  Let's get this together, people.  The TLC monster is ruining the server I love. <p>Tenzin Dralha <BR>Human Monk <BR>30 Seasons Serving Quellious <BR>Proud Member of Starspun</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uprothall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Prothall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 4:28:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pursue the level instead of the quest?</span><hr size=1> TLC was in place when the server went live back in October so everyone knew the ruleset of playing on this server. We all make choices and have consequences for our decisions.

An idea is to ask someone who is perhaps lower in power then yourself to help complete a quest. Often times they will with the right incentive.<br><br>Simple solution to this issue really, either focus on the high end mobs and keep leveling your hearts out, or perhaps slow down and do some research on existing quests you want to complete.  Another idea is to go to a standard blue server where you can compete with level 50+ people farming items 20 levels below them. Nothing is perfect, not even Firona Vie, but Im here because of the TLC and other aspects such as /auc /ooc and the alignment based grouping. <br><br>[ANONYMOUS] is making things tough to find groups for most people, this is something that i would like to see changed to improve everyones grouping chances.

Holier than thou attitudes about how leveling up is your own fault just don't belong.  It presuposes that all quests are known in their entirety in advance and that all quests actually are not buggy.  It assumes that everyone researches the web for quests instead of roleplaying quest discovery.  It also supposes that those against the TCL are mad powerlevelers in search of &quot;phat lewt&quot;.  All of these are far from true.  I run into more true newbies on FV than I ever did before and they will all be absolutely floored by TLC sooner or later.  The most common thing I hear when I tell newbies to hit the web is &quot;I want to discover things on my own&quot;.  FV is definitely not a server for first time EQ players.  Besides, if you're so willing to pay people to do your own quests for you, why are you upset with a 50+ farming something you want?  Just pay the farmer.  Same difference, but when the 50+ leaves, you have some chance at getting it yourself.  You have zero chance at doing a TLC-blocked quest yourself.<br><br>Now, if you have a *constructive* pro-TLC argument on why it's good for FV, I'd love to hear it, but posting that kind of drivel about how it's all our own fault for choosing a server that has it just doesn't fly.<br><br>Personally, I don't think it's any one thing that turns people away from FV.  There's something here to turn off everyone: TLC, Anon, Alignments, Single Char, Language barrier.  'Course, these are also the very things that bring them in, too.  If I had to pick one to toss, it would be TLC -- it breaks normal (ie. non-web researched) questing and VI doesn't support it.  After tossing TLC, I'd add an &quot;/lfp on&quot; flag for group leaders so they can advertise group spots available.  That would be a good feature for all servers. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/30/01 5:35:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uruss386.showPublicProfile?language=EN>russ386</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 5:29:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OK, that kind of post ..</span><hr size=1> Yeah, TLC is most definitely anti-RP.  VI doesn't like spoiler sites.  I think they evn say in some press releases that they don't want people to use them.  Isn't being able to go to some source outside of the actual game the most non-RP thing you can think of?  I mean, how would my character just magically know about all the good quests to be done all over the world?  Tenzin has never been to the Twilight Sea, but I, the player of Tenzin, know that there are class-based armor and weapons quests there.  Main point, as was stated before: Server-wide TLC forces us to use spoiler sites.  VI doesn't like that, so we have yet another point we can use to argue for it's removal.<br><br>And /agree Bjond on the first point.  I think I can speak for many people when I say that the anti-TLC people on this server also love this server.  We want to make it even better.  Saying that we knew what we were in for when we first logged on is like saying that an immigrant to the US has no right to protest to demand his or her rights.  They knew what the US was like, but they have just as much right to try to make it better.

You knew it when you joined.  If you did not want to play with the TLC, you should not have chosen FV as a server.  (Servers are not a 'Create Your Own' salad bar -  I will take the 'Removal of NO DROP', but leave the &quot;TLC&quot;).<br><br>2) The TLC is really only a 'BAD' think for those that are basically 'Leveling' and 'Uber Oriented'.  In other words, you are probably more concerned with LEVELING then you are QUESTING or ROLEPLAYING. <br><br>3) The TLC is a challenging obsticle, not an impassible barrier.  The challenge is to work around it.<br><br>There is nothing that the TLC affects that STOPs game play for someone.  Even if there was, it is the persons error in not focusing on it, rather than Leveling.   Worse case senerio, the player can either a) wait and purchase from someone, or b) attempt to level down (oh no! not lose levels!) below the TLC.<br><br>I personally joined FV not to 'role-play' in an Uber guild.  I joined FV to play EQ with some new challenges, the TLC being one of them.  I love the fact that FV forces players to have to change their approach to game playing (instead of Level, level, level, read spoiler site X, obtain Uber item A, Level, level, level...).<br><br>Rather than complaining about and trying to change Rules you where fully aware of, why not learn to play the came with in the rule set?<br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 5:55:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blame the Players, not the TLC.</span><hr size=1> Most people who complain are those who concentrated on level'ing and didnt pay any attention to what they needed in advance.

The fact is that that drivel is the a very strong argument against your stance.  It is the core rebuttle to your argument.  There is not reason to remove the TLC. <br><br>1) *Most* quests are discovered prior to the TLC, if you are looking for them?  <br>2) There are valid and easy methods around the TLC:<br>a) finding someone to get the componet for you (think of it as different form of a quest).  <br>b) level down below the TLC<br>c) merchant Mine.<br>Yes, it may take work, but that is part of the Challenge.<br>3) TLC does not stop the game.

Ok, here:<br>1) Creates NEW challenge.  New approaches to old problems.<br>2) Encourages player cooperation.<br>3) Helps to de-emphasis LEVEL goal orientation, and LEVEL status symbol (Thus, no more  I am Level 60, I can kill what I want, loot what I want, make what I want, etc.....). <br>4) It helps keep the server population LOW. (And thus we have less Uber d00ds, Uber Guilds, etc.).  A Low server population also cuts down the amount of over camping, contested spawns, etc.  It might be a *challenge* to find a group and 'raids' may have to be rethought, but that is the fun of the FV server I LOVE.<br><br>There is no reason to remove the TLC.  It is not 'broken'.  It does not stop game play.  It is just an obsticle.

It gives a big advantage to those with money to pay lowbies to quest for them.  It gives a big advantage to those with two accounts and two computers (can farm low items with blur, atone, FD, etc.).  It gives a bigger advantage to those that read spoiler sites than it does for non-TLC -- it almost makes reading spoiler sites essential.<br><br>2. TLC breaks quests.  You can't do quest discovery.  Many quests involve killing green creatures for no-drop items (which of course trivial-out here).  You can't even see what you might have obtained when trying a new quest with TLC in place.  Basically, you have to wait until someone else solves it and posts the spoiler on the web.<br><br>3. TLC promotes farming.  You *MUST* pay a farmer for blocked items.  There is no way around that other than two computers (see point 1).  TLC encourages lowbies to farm rare TLC blocked items and charge outrageous sums for them.  Without TLC, you have the choice to pay a farmer or camp it yourself.  With TLC, you simply pay -- no choice.  You need to empty your wallet on a newbie raising plat to buy ethereal mist or fire up your 2nd comp/account (y'all do have a two comps and accounts, right?).<br><br>Most people that support TLC are non-roleplaying web d00ds that want to kick back and let someone else solve the quests for them.  After the spoiler is on the web, they have no problems not doing the quest themselves, but rather reading about it and paying someone to do it for them.  Those that aren't web-d00ds are perma-lowbies that want to charge outrageous prices to farm trivial items so they can buy gear they have no intention of leveling up to obtain themselves.  Most generalizations are ridiculous.<br><br>When you see a level 1 player in full planar armor, I think you'll change your mind about how good TLC is.  Or maybe not.  Maybe you're one of those that wants to buy planar on ebay instead of hunt for it yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uchiporama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiporama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 7:45:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC is really not a problem for ..</span><hr size=1> Most of your points are baseless statements lacking any hard evidence (other than opinion) to back them.<br><br>Addressing your Points:<br><br>1) &quot;TLC promotes uber &quot;phat lewt&quot; &amp; level chasing play over roleplay... it gives advantages....&quot;<br>False:<br>- TLC does not promote 'phat Lewt' or level chasing, especially over Roleplaying.   You give no solid example of how the TLC directly causes either of these by itself (IE - a person with 2 computers and 2 accounts still holds that advantage without the TLC.  And people will still read spolier sights to solve quests, and you can still solve quest without reading spoiler sights.).    <br><br>2) &quot;TLC breaks quests. You can't do quest discovery&quot;<br>False:<br>- Most quests tell you what you need, either by quest NPC or book in library.   In most quests, you do not 'discover' a quest when you kill a mob (ie - the mob drop does not suddenly tell you about the quest).<br><br>3) &quot;TLC promotes farming. You *MUST* pay a farmer for blocked items&quot;<br>False:<br>- Paying farmers is not the *ONLY* way to obtain blocked items.  You can merchant mine, plan ahead and farm yourself when with in the TLC, have a guildie get it for you, find a newbee not charging insane prices, etc.  Farming on one level or another is a part of the game (it is part of the player economy).  <br><br>4) &quot;Most people that support TLC are non-roleplaying web d00ds that want to kick back and let someone else solve the quests for them&quot;<br>- False<br>You have no evidence and make a  broad baseless acusation.<br><br>5) &quot;When you see a level 1 player in full planar armor, I think you'll change your mind about how good TLC is.&quot;<br>- False<br>It is near impossible for a level 1 to make enough money farming anything to make the money to purchase a full set of planar armor (at a resonable price, not at 1 plat per piece).<br><br>6) &quot;Maybe you're one of those that wants to buy planar on ebay instead of hunt for it yourself.&quot;<br>- False<br>Do you know me?  Did I indicate this in my posts? Again, another example of baseless statements.<br><br>In general your arguments are baseless acusations to support a rule that you disagree with.  You castigate vaild arguments against your statements, rather than offer strong evidence to support your position.  In fact, most of your statements would are better arguments for the the TLC (in that without it, most of the issues you stated would be rampant, just as they are on other normal servers).<br><br>Your arguments seem to simply elude to you haveing negative experiences with the TLC.  That you probably had negative experiences in attempting to purchase TLC blocked items, and that you feel 'cheated' by the TLC barrier that you are faced with.  Now I do not know you, so I am only making an educated guess based on your posts rather than following your example of making wild acusations, disparaging remarks and baseless statements to support my position.<br><br>It would be nice to hear some 'hard' facts why the TLC should be removed.  What are some quests that are completely unsolvable because of the TLC (and it can only be fixed by removing the TLC).  How does the TLC make the game unplayable?

You didn't even read what I wrote.  Read it again and perhaps you will understand.  Your points here, for instance, quote me out of context.  I never accused anyone of anything: I practically hit you over the head with that sarcastic bit about all generalizations being ridiculous and you still took them all at face value.  Ah, pearls before swine!<br><br>In simple words of little sylable the reason TLC should be removed is that it forces farming instead of permiting people to solve quests themselves.  When faced with a TLC blocked item, you are required to pay outrageous sums for a simple to obtain item, delevel yourself (absolutely NOT an option that should even be considered), or use a 2nd-comp mule.  Most do not have a second comp+account.  That means large sums, which are not available until you are high level.  So, TLC promotes leveling and &quot;phat lewt&quot; gathering so you can afford to pay the farmers.<br><br>TLC doesn't stop farming.  It just makes it more exclusive.  Guess what I found when I went to wisp island to get some xp and cash?  A high level druid and mule on 2nd comp farming every wisp on the island.  Guess what I find when hiring lowbies for quests?  Complete disinterest.  I don't blaim them.  I can't afford to pay much at all, nor do I wish to.<br><br>And, yes, it completely removes all hope of quest discovery from the game.  I did quite a bit of that on my other server.  Some of the most worthwhile quests do not tell you which mob to kill or what to do with the item or even what the item is (eg. monk shackles).  You often have to kill armies of green things and then use an identify spell on everything that drops.  If things don't drop due to TLC, you can't solve the quest.<br><br>The iksar shackle quest was so buggy that I had leveled my monk to 57 before they finally fixed it.  So, I'm supposed to delevel to 15 to finish it?  I'm supposed to find and pay a lowbie to spend 20-50 hours camping green junk when we don't even know if it's really fixed or what we really need? It took 4 rounds of &quot;we fixed it!&quot;, &quot;uh, no you didn't!&quot;  Ask a friend to do that camp?  I wouldn't even dream of it.  I'm not that cruel to my friends.<br><br>Now for myself, I have a 2nd comp and account.  TLC is no hardship for me personally -- other than having to maintain a mule of the right level.  I'm thinking about the folks that are real newbies, don't have two accounts, don't have two computers, haven't played multiple characters to post-50, or don't read the web.  That covers most people.  They're great people.  They make this server so much more fun than a regular blue server.  TLC will squash them flat.  It turns FV from a RP server into an RP/experts server.<br><br>TLC is for elitists.  I like newbies, especially the non-begging variety, which seems to be all FV has.  FV has great newbies!  I seriously dislike pretention and elitist snobbery; eg. &quot;You knew about TLC when coming here.  *I* can get a round it. I don't give a damn if you can or not, so lump it or leave it.&quot;  Hell, I can get around it, too.  Most can't.  I do give a damn about them.  So, I don't like TLC.<br><br>If all I cared about was myself, I'd say keep the TLC and get rid of the alignments.  Then I could make a lizard monk that could group with everyone and still twink my second char with planar armor.  It will just be a while before I can do that.  I'm sure others are already doing it -- they're just not being obvious about it.<br><br>BTW, I'm not going to go into the exploits TLC permits for obvious reasons.  Think about it, though.  Almost nothing is no-drop.  If I was selfish, I'd be embracing TLC like a twin seperated since birth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uartillis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 10:28:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yes, it's a great idea ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> General consensus, at least on the boards, seems to range from moderately to very anti-TLC. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I remember a pole awile back were i thought the majority of votes were FOR TLC, I could be wrong.

Our resident uber guild, FnF, is not filled with d00ds and l33t3s but rather thoughtful and considered tactical players.

That being said, if they're useable by other races, then on another server you would simply need to run the quest and get the result.  No need to interact with anyone other than the required NPC's.<br><br>This is FV, however, so the rules change slightly.  You need to RP through it.  I'm not familiar with the quests, but if TLC is keeping you from completing it, then the answer is to ally yourself with Vah Shir of the appropriate level, and assist them as they assist you.  That way you can complete the quest.<br><br>Let's not forget, Verant puts new quests into the game quite often.  This is not a static environment.  Therefore, on a TLC server, if you want to run a quest that is newly introduced and you're above the level where you can actually run it, you need to ally yourself with others.  This stops quests from being dominated by high level players as soon as they're introduced.  I'm not saying that this would happen on FV, but it does make sense to me.<br><br>For my part, I'd be glad to help you out with these quests.  It gives me something to look forward to, and I kind of look at it the same way as when I help out someone lower than me... I get nothing for it, but you'll remember me as a good guy in the future.  Maybe you'll even buy some of my fish rolls.
