He said he would pay me a lot of money and give me his gear because he would not need it with his new character.  I agreed, so he said we would go to the Bazaar so he could give me his stuff to hold while he created a new character.  I wondered why we had to go all the way to the bazaar, and he said he would help me sell my equipment that his would replace, and that was the best place to do it.  Sounded too good to be true, but I went along with it.  After talking for about half an hour, we finally went to the Bazaar, and he told me to put all my stuff in bags so I could bank it and take his stuff and wear it.  I did that, getting more suspicious by the moment.  He then told me to put my stuff in the trade window and he would hold it for me while I took his stuff because I did not have enough spots open.  That was the moment I knew he was definitly trying to scam me.  I said forget it and walked away.  I didn't even bother acusing him because I new it would be a waste of time.  After I zoned into the Nexxus, someone sent me a tell saying Hopebringer was shouting in the Bazaar that I stole from him.  I sent him a tell saying I was petitioning a GM and we could get this all straightened out.  He logged off.  <br><br>Now, I will probably never see the name Hopebringer again, unless he is a very stupid person, but I am going to follow through with this GM investigation.  By looking at the conversation him and I had it will be obvious he was trying to steal.  My word to everyone is to keep an eye out.  He will probably return under a different name, but once evil, always evil.  And remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it IS!!!<br><br>Kuue Soulslinger<br>Proud member of the Clan of Brothers<br>33rd circle druid of Tunare<br><br>&quot;Bloom where you are planted&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulethecerulre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lethe Cerulre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Siokitty Silvermoon <br> CSW Officer</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 9:15:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1183.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: BEWARE.....SCAM ALERT</span><hr size=1> He's done things like this before.

I am not an idiot dear, I know not to trust people ya don't know.  I never gave him anything.  The point is this guy is trouble, and that was the reason for my post.  I was not taken by his scam, but younger players may be, so I wanted to expose him.  I was intrigued by is offer, so I went along with him until I could see for sure it was bull, then I told him to get lost.  I just think it is a good idea to always expose these thieves.  You are right though.  You do get desensitized to people being scammed.  It happens too much.  Maybe if they are reported though, it will happen less.

Unfortunately, I could not modify that screenshot to blank out the guild name.  Srir was indeed in Dawn Rising (please note the date and time stamp...I am somewhat thorough) at that time and was deliberately operating anonymously because he had been kicked out of Wolves of Antonica three days or so prior (Due to my informing Bars about his antics), so he will run anon because he knows I am watching.<br><br>I met up with &quot;Hopebringer&quot; in Splitpaw last night.  He was grouped with a DE SK whose name I forget.  Hopebringer, a druid (as was previously stated here) is pretty darn incompetent, IMHO, having trained something ugly upon himself and his partner, getting them both killed.<br><br>Hopebringer left soon after, once I told him that I would not group with someone so honorless.  I think that clued him in that I knew who he was, because he said &quot;ok by&quot; and that was the last he said (If anyone knows Srir or has dealt with him...you know that little phrase, he uses it to gaffe you off when he's discovered).<br><br>He did not do anything untoward while I was present this time.  Of course, he knew I was there and he knew I knew who he was.  Other than blatant incompetence, he behaved himself.<br><br>But yes, it is confirmed.  &quot;Hopebringer&quot; is the former Srir, Re-Rolled to be a Druid.<br><br>As a side note, my guild got the poor DE a rez and I grouped with him in Paw...he's a pretty good player.  Got KIA one time when an inopportune spawn happened right on top of his pull and was still too far away for me to Evac...but all in all, he was only grouped with Hopebringer because he did not know who he is.<br><br>So now my hate list for Srir is erased.  HOPEBRINGER, I am watching you.  You have again tried to hurt my Guild.  I am sharpening my stakes for your crucifixion.  Do not think for one moment that just because you are a Druid you can escape me.<br><br>Oh, and whoever posted that Hopebringer is in Wolves of Antonica is absolutely CORRECT.

The mere fact that he is still a member of Wolves of Antonica implies that 1) They approve or condone his behavior or 2) He has them snowed.  Either way, I'm done talking to guilds he is in...The previous thread, &quot;Beware Srir's Promsies&quot; which is 3 pages long, documents the painful process I went through to inform not one, but TWO different guilds who snatched him up without knowing what a scumbag he was when he was Srir.<br><br>So I'm done banging my head against that wall.  Instead, I am simply observing his whereabouts and his guild affiliations and posting them here.  If the guilds in question really value their reputation, it is now THEIR responsibility to research who wears their guild tag.  Otherwise, they deserve the reputation stain that Hopebringer carries with him.<br><br>And that's all I have to say about that.<br><br>Omi, the Crusader-For-Justice Wizard<br><br> <p><img
