<br>
I am posting here to make you aware of a scam out there, I think it's new but I've at least never heard of it. To start I realize it was my fault for being suckered into it. Secondly this is just to make you aware to hopefully avoid anyone falling for this same thing.<br>
<br>
Today I was in the bazaar, someone auctioned Yittrium Wrapped Sleeves..I asked for a price and he told me 200k. I tell him I have only 76k but thank you anyway, he says he will also trade for a Blade of Carnage (very expensive also) or a Truthbringer Stone..the stone I had never heard of before so a quick check of the bazaar...no blade of carnage but a truthbringer stone..price 75k!. As it turns out the vendor selling the stone is the alt of the player auctioning the sleeves...<br>
<br>
So, I link him the stone make sure it's a deal..he says it is. Buy the stone off vendor and go to complete the trade and they are gone. I'm mad but at least i have a 75k pp stone (he told me it was for a new weapon quest) so i look it up on alla..it's worthless. Later I see the trader back on...I confront him in tells and eventually tells me he had already spent the money so could not repay me, but he offers me a split blade of destruction to /delete the petition i had made...I suppose I should have cut my losses and taken it...but i was mad and it was basicly an admision of guilt to me so i refused.<br>
<br>
The players names were Eerrk and Vumpler both green cons and as he told me they are just mules so probably will be rerolled...<br>
<br>
The Moral is<br>
<br>
If someone is offering to trade you for an item you dont have but can afford in the bazaar...but thier selling price is much higher...dont buy the item unless you know the player well and know they will follow through on the trade.  And most importantly, if it sounds to good to be true it probably is.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you,<br>
<br>

Ah I hadnt heard of it before, I did a /report and /petition and emailed the GM on both players.<br>
<br>
Also I want to add in the short time since this happened several nice folks have offered pp etc. to me.  I appreciate it SO much, but I am not hurting for equipment or plat and hopefully the GM's will reimburse me. Also I passed on takeing that blad which would have covered some of it most likely. <br>
<br>
So thanks to everyone, but again this is just a heads up to keep it from happening to others.<br>
<br>
names were Eerrk and Vumpler<br>

A friend of mine was scammed earlier today so as soon as he asked for 2 truthbringer stones i knew what was up. I immediately petitioned this person and guide showed up shortly afterward. Unfortunately the son of a bitch had logged out his two toons before the guide got there. Heads up too &gt; this person was auctioning shananas equip via links, and claiming to be shanana, when i thought at first it was him, obviously it was not. They are trying to mask their identity and I really hope this motherfucker gets banned. This person tried to scam me too, but i checked the web first on the gem they wanted and nope, it was not for a super-uber bard item like they claimed, its for a LOW LOW level pally ring quest. So i told this person to fuck off and i petitioned them.<br>
<br>
So yep, just watch out. This crack head is posing as shanana and linking his wears in auction channel for sale. If someone offers you a trade where they want a truthbringer gem for exchange, immediately petition them.<br>
<br>
GD Avon, shouldnt happen to you. Makes me want to smash this scammers face in in RL, i just cant put up with that BS. Anyway, watch out peeps, and petition. This person is making new characters every time he pulls this scam too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurley>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1144<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/29/03 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4117.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just a heads up...</span><hr size=1> Maeluuin:<br>

What happened to you is officially known by SOE as a &quot;trade-scam&quot; and is an actionable occurence - meaning that SOE administrative GM's can take action to a) retrieve/replace what you lost and b) discipline the scammer.<br>
<br>
Send in a petition and state CLEARLY that you were trade-scammed and how it happened along with the names of the scammers.  Be patient and eventually an admin level GM will help you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maeluuin>Maeluuin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/29/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4117.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just a heads up...</span><hr size=1> Thanks Kurly and everyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But there's good news for everyone I think. Just now my petition was completed, it took two GMs and a couple hours but I did get the pp back. Also I saw *GM admin* Vumplerx logged on durring the process. (Vumpler was one of the char's names) I wasnt told specificly what was done, only that he had been taken care of. So hopefully there's one less scammer in the world.<br>
<br>
19hours from first petition to fully resolved (most of which i was not logged on) is pretty great CS by sony imo. My advice, /report the text as soon as you know something is wrong, /petition (and use /viewpetition to make sure it stays up), and email your GM through the Everquest site. It worked for me at least.  Also, please be aware of it and don't let yourself get fooled. Good luck all!<br>
<br>
Weee I'm happy<br>

I reported all the Alts of this guy. I did get my PP back from Jindrak. I had about 45 Screen Pics of these fools trading there gear to each other and i inspected them all and got the gear they were wearing and all. Got all my conversations and them hiding in corner trying to lose me, lol. They got big time caught. I got so many pics i could make a short movie about it. When Jindrak Finally contacted me, he was already briefed by like 5 guides and another GM that i missed when AFK. So when i showed him all that proff, he was very excited and laughed. And gave me My PP right then. He just told me to be careful. Well I got the PP back yesterday. So, if anyone is selling an Ornate BP mold. lol, please let me know.  <br>
