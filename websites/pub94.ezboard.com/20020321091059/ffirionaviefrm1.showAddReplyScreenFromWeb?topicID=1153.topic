These are simple code changes that can solve a huge problem on this server.<br>

As soon as you go LFG your anon flag comes off and you are listed by class, zone, level just as on a normal server.<br>

Now this is the hard part-gonna take an additional 15 minutes for some programer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
As soon as you gain a group your LFG flag trips off (perhaps triggered by activation of the group window or something). This way you will come off the list and others who went LFG after you will move up the list.<br>
<br>
If you really want to go nuts, it can be sorted according to alignment, but not necessary. <br>
<br>
Am I wrong here? Is this too simple? Should we all get together and petition Verant for something like this? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udreks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreks</A> at: 1/20/02 10:01:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 6:57:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LFG-Has anyone thought of this sollution?</span><hr size=1> I've said this time and again, but what, precisely, is so hard about asking someone who's /LFG what his or her class and level is?

<br>
I know who many of the mover-and-shaker Enchanters, Druids, etc are in my area.  I know who are clerics I deal and group with regularly.<br>
<br>
I've never had trouble with my /LFG flag on finding a workable group.  With a few well-placed /shouts, I typically get one or two /tells within minutes.<br>
<br>
And for places I know are going to be problems pulling a group together once I'm there, like Lesser Faydark, I'll get the group together in a city, like Kelethin, first.  Not only does this encourage social behavior, but it's also somewhat more realistic.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I just don't buy that this is as big a problem as some people want to make it out to be.  That's not been my experience, and there a ton of ways to &quot;work around&quot; it that are easy and well within the capabilities of any character.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the argument doesn't hold water on its own merits.  If there are so few people in these zones that it's hard to find group-mates, then it shouldn't take long to send a /tell to each of the people in the zone asking them if they want to group and what their class/level is.  If, on the other hand, there are a lot of people in the zone, then finding a group really isn't a problem at all, as long as you put yourself out as looking for one.<br>

If he is right next to you then it is fine. If you have an entire group of people of the right class, level, alliance standing right next to you each time you log, then you are right, the problem is non-existing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Problem is how often does that occure? How often are there enough people to work a doable group in 5 local zones?  How do you &quot;just ask&quot; on a limited population server that is further limited by alliance? <br>
<br>
See the problem is that you can't just shout across EC to know that there is a group around. You can't do a /who all cleric 10 15 to see if there is one around. No, you must run the entire zone asking each and every person their class, level and alliance. If you find noone in that zone, you must do the same in each zone.<br>
<br>
The way you ask your question, it sounds simple. I would have to ask what char and level you are that you think the problem is non-existant. My Barb Warrior knows that it is much. MUCH harder then that. It is a process that can take hours for a young warrior-especially with all the solo classes that people are choosing because of the group &quot;problem&quot;. <br>
<br>
  I can only imagine what its like for group dependant classes in the 30s and 40s. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udreks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 7:36:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LFG-Has anyone thought of this sollution?</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;And for places I know are going to be problems pulling a group together once I'm there, like Lesser Faydark, I'll get the group together in a city, like Kelethin, first.

<br>
Well I have to ask what level you are. One to 10, or even 15, I don't see this as a problem as everyone is packed into one zone. You cannot judge the game by Gfay. Gesh, its the highest populated zone on the planet.  You have casters, tanks, clerics, druids, bards coming out your ear. <br>
<br>
When I logged on in the beginning there were maybe 12 people in all of everfrost. Maybe 1 or two in my level. Same with the adjacent zones. Twice was I able to pull a group together to get some exp for my warrior. I had to two box most of it. <br>
<br>
Again, I can only imagine...well, I don't have to, there are enough higher level players confirming it as a problem, the people I am reading about leaving are also confirming that it is a problem.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udreks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreks</A> at: 1/20/02 8:02:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 228<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 7:43:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> There are many problems ..</span><hr size=1> .. with even basic LFG.<br>
<br>
1. Groups never ever scan for LFG players unless they have a specific need for a certain class.<br>
<br>
2. LFG people scan for groups all the time.  They have no way they can identify who needs a group, though.  They can't even check for groups in other zones -- you have to travel there and actually visit the spots.  This is like want to camp the SSOY on old-time blue's.  Run over, find out it's camped (or no players or all full groups).  Now you'll need to run someplace else.<br>
<br>
3. It is an incredible and monumental pain to send a tell to everyone in the zone asking level, class, and if they want to group or have a spot.  If they're fighting, they might miss it and if they get enough tells for groups, one more can be irritating.  That happened to me yesterday when I was grouped in Runnyeye -- made me want to throttle the poor innocent LFG'er.<br>
<br>
4. It breaks RP.  I personally find it breaks immersion to be constantly asked level/class when (if it worked) you could just look it up.  The only time you do a &quot;/&quot; or &quot;/ all&quot; is when you want to know.  So, if you think knowing that is bad for your RP, just don't use the command and find people by running about and /shouting.<br>
<br>
5. There is no zone-spanning messaging.  Both /shout and /auc have the same range as /yell.  Only /tell and /gu have longer reach.<br>
<br>
IMHO, I'd like almost all the extra rules removed.  However, for this one, I think it would work almost as well if the group leader had a &quot;/lfp &lt;message&gt;&quot; command so LFG people could find him and he could spend his time fighting (as he does anyway); eg.<br>
<br>
 /lfp 32-36 iceclad healer<br>
 /lfp 24-28 sol-a crowd (prefer bard)<br>
 /lfp old-seb rogue 201+ LP only<br>
 etc.<br>
<br>
Then LFG people could do &quot;/ all lfp&quot; and see all the groups that both need and want more players.  It doesn't break /roleplay, it lets groups xp, and it let's LFG folks hunt for groups -- all of which is what people do already, just with more effort.  This would work very nicely for all servers, too -- an important consideration when asking for features.  FV is way too small to have any special work peformed just for us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udreks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 7:46:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LFG-Has anyone thought of this sollution?</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;I believe that's what friends are for.

<br>
Well, here is another point to think about. What do you do when the friends list is depleted? There is a post titled &quot;the server is dieing&quot;. It covers exactly that issue. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;, but it's also somewhat more realistic.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Dieing and going to your bind point is not realistic, consuming food without ever eating is not realistic, Zoning to escape a mob is not realistic, elevators in Gfay with no mechanism, no maintenance are not realistic. Realism is often overlooked because of game machanics, requirements. <br>
<br>
A game that requires grouping as its core, yet does not have a practical means by which to accomplish this task as its core design is a game with a major design flaw. No?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
From Bjond:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;1. Groups never ever scan for LFG players unless they have a specific need for a certain class.<br>
<br>
2. LFG people scan for groups all the time. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Yanno, I like this idea even better. Makes sense. <br>

Replace &quot;never ever&quot; with &quot;quite rarely&quot; and you'll be right.<br>

Whenever I am in a group of less than six, I look for more people, with little attention (if any) to their class.

I'm nineteenth level.  And I still haven't had any problems finding a group.  I've had quite the reverse problem, actually--random invites when I'm trying to accomplish a very specific thing.<br>

Oh, and I really enjoy the invocation of the Nixonian &quot;silent majority.&quot;  Some higher level people have left.  Some haven't.  Some will.  Some won't.  So what?  That's the cycle.  That's not &quot;server death&quot;.<br>

...and if all these people can't? Then what? Go to the next zone? then the next where you can get experience? You are right in your argument, in Gfay, in those levels, there is no problem. I'm not arguing that at all-but Gfay is a tiny part of the world.  I have raised 6 or 8 chars in Gfay. Eventually you have to move out, people spread out. The world is huge. <br>
<br>
Someone made a great point. What if you need something in guk and you are in LIOI? Do you run, take the boat, run all the way there to find out that no one is camping the lord? That no one is there at all? Then do the same to the next place? <br>
<br>
Trust me on this though, I have been playing this game up and down the ladder since beta 4. With the current situation, you WILL find it a pain in the ars to find workable groups in your higher levels. Experience comes slow and you can waste hour after hour after hour trying to move, not that yellow bar, but the lil blue one.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Oh, and I really enjoy the invocation of the Nixonian &quot;silent majority.&quot; Some higher level people have left. Some haven't. Some will. Some won't. So what? That's the cycle. That's not &quot;server death&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why the abrasive tone, there is no need. Now really, we can argue this infinitum, but there is no need. An important feature was removed from the game on a single new server. A good portion of the experienced population have tested it, and see this change as having negative impact. <br>
<br>
Lower level experienced playes can clearly see the problem that lies before them based on those explanations. That provides reason for review. Its pretty straight forward. <br>
<br>
Now if you do not like the implementation of a new option, then simply don't use it. It is an option. If you prefer the zone to zone hunt, then that option is still available. No reason that I can think of to argue against something that will not effect your gameplay.<br>

The best way I've found to look for a group is make a friends list, once you have enuff friends you can check it in game and see who is on then send your friends a tell asking if they need help with anything or if they are up to doing anything.  Guilds are also a great way to go with this.  <br>
<br>
Currently when i'm in game if im going to be on a bit and im in the mood to group I see what the guild is doing and i see what my friends who arn't in the guild are doing.  Once I have that nailed down I can usualy find a few people that want to do something.<br>
<br>
The other thing that works is talking to people without sending tells.  If you know a zone fairly well then go to some of the favorite hunting spots and talk to and role play with the people there and see about grouping with them. (don't recomend doing this in some dungeons) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Basicaly what the constant roleplay tag does coupled with a smaller population is it destroys the &quot;standard&quot; pick-up group we're used to seeing on other zones on other servers such as OT, and DL.  The roleplay tag does not destroy grouping possibilities it just limits the go to a zone and shout <br>
<br>
&quot;level such an such something LFG&quot;<br>
<br>
Grouping is still very doable, just have to get out of the pick-up group mentality left behind from past servers.  Does it mean you won't group as easily as your used to on other servers, more then likely, but its still not as bad as some may think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 9:46:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pickup groups ..</span><hr size=1> .. in the upper levels with near-strangers are just awful.  The reason I'd like the /roleplay to go away is not so I could find out (for example) which level 52 clerics are online, but which level 52 clerics I know are online and where they are.  By the time you get up to 40 or 50, your friends list will be way overloaded.  It's only got space for about 20 or 30 people.  I think I ran out of space in my 30s on my last server and by the 50s, I likely knew 20 folks in each class at least well enough to group with.<br>
<br>
If Verant would let the friends list go infintely long, let us tack notes about class and level and such onto each player, not cut the list short on a &quot;/ all friends&quot;, and let us sort-search our own friends list, then I'd say the friends list would cover it.  Random pickups and the current /friends implementation work pretty good when you're still a lowbie and just meeting folk.  My past experience says it's probably not enough at the upper levels, though.<br>
<br>
BTW, I think most of our suggestions here on this board or even through /feedback amount to idle speculation.  VI doesn't listen to feedback.  It's fun to know what people think, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubraellarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braellarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/22/02 9:32:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LFG-Has anyone thought of this sollution?</span><hr size=1> While last night i ran from veliouse (great divide) to kunark (overthere) to group with a friend.. big deal! thats why they are friends... i will run that far to help out.<br>
<br>
Sure i can solo, but i only solo to keep lv with my friends, other than that i group whenever i can, most people will invite you if you ask and you are the right alignments.<br>
<br>
Just chat to some of the compativle people in the zone, even if they dont group with you they might remember you name for next time, and maybe.. who know, you might be sent a tell sometime for help/group etc.<br>
