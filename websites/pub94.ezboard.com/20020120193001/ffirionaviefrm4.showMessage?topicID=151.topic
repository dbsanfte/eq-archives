Showed up to the Naggy raid with my cleric and all I saw at the ring in LS was moffukkas betta buy dis, and Ho this and that, and all sorts of things that made me cringe as a roleplayer. I was going to stick out the whole raid til power outage fried out my pcs power supply and knocked out all the power for a few hours, that was fun. Anyway to my point I guess, is FV turning into a standard Blue server with UBERS and DOODS or is there some hope the Roleplayers are out there somewhere en masse and have all the L33t ppl on ignore. Sad seeing what the server has become. Its no wonder the population is low. Grouping is next to impossible, communications are limited, the all on /roleplay was the stupidest part of FV, the TLC worked completely ass backwards from how VI planned it here and Roleplay exists in a mild to light moderate state. <br>Ok rant off, just sad to see the dreams I fought so hard for for so many years, yes years - RPs have been trying for a RP only server since month 1 after release, get washed away because Verant decided to use this server to BETA TEST more frivolous code no one wanted. /sigh oh well guess I'll make the best of this server and ignore the L33ts or just head back to a blue server where crap is so much easier to do. BTW most of the GREAT RP ppl I met in our travels to the high end game are all gone for one of the reasons I mentioned above. I knew ppl in the top 5% in lvls on this server that dropped off at 30 and 35th lvls when they could have made a difference in how FV evolved but left for greener pastures. Guess the Verant Gods wanted another sick joke to laugh at and made FV. Not sure if I should laugh or cry because this is NOT the server they promised at the fan faire 10 months ago. <br><br>Best Wishes Anyway!!<br>Stormwind<br><br>PS - may just start a low lvl Kitty Rogue and just play in the low end game til the RPers catch up in lvls, who knows.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ustormwindthunderpaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormwind Thunderpaw</A> at: 12/4/01 6:18:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=darkus>Darkus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 6:16:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> I like this server.

I earned everything I have and quested for. I had a regular group who played the same hours every day. In my previous post I mentioned that I knew alot of ppl that did the same and were similar lvls, most have left the server. MANY of the ones that stayed and are same lvls were corrupted by the doods and thier need for greed and gear. Fine thats thier choice so be it, it wasnt mine so don't tell me to look at myself as if I am the problem. I had alot of time to play, quest, RP and meet ppl yet still got the lvls done. The roleplayers may be casual gamers here and thats fine also. My original point was that most of the server isnt RP at all in any form and this isnt why the server was created. For a &quot;good&quot; race/class character to kill outright other good race/mobs isnt RP but it happens alot here.  Dood speak is not RP but is common in many places moreso than &quot;in character&quot; texts are.

Depends on a lot of things.  If I had an easier time getting into groups (i.e. finding people to group with) I'd probably be a higher level too, not because I don't like to roleplay, but because I like to roleplay at the same time as getting experience.  For me, roleplaying is interacting in-character with whoever I'm hunting with at the time.  It doesn't mean putting leveling on hold because I'd rather roleplay; they're not mutually exclusive.  Except for when I'm spending time working on trade skills instead of levelling, but lately I'm too poor to spend much time on trade skills.<br><br>FV has been a bit of a disappointment for me.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I haven't really found it.  I think the TLC and language barriers have done more to discourage roleplay than to foster it.  And I think the server has become more of a haven for people who either a) prefer to solo, b) make friends easily, or c) brought their own friends or guild to the server.<br><br>I don't enjoy soloing. EQ was my first experience with a multi-player online game and when I first started I didn't think I'd ever get used to grouping with people.  Now I'm just the opposite, I don't enjoy soloing even when I play a class suitable for soloing.  I'd much rather be in a group.<br><br>But-- I'd rather just find people at random, than have to rely on a regular group of people.  I miss the freedom of walking up to the gnoll spires in South Karana and finding a group of people I've never met and saying Hey, mind if I join you guys? and either being accepted or being put on a wait list.  I don't want to just send /tells to people I've grouped with before and asking what they're doing and if I can tag along.<br><br>And no, I didn't bring friends or guildmates from my old server.  The people from my old server who knew I was leaving for FV didn't want to come to FV, partly because they anticipated the very problems I'm finding here.<br><br>I'm not really finding people to roleplay with, in groups.  It's as though grouping for exp and roleplaying are incompatible.  The other night I was in a group in High Keep and we all were speaking human, so I started speaking a bit in goblin, and the response was ????? so I explained that since no one was speaking another language, and we were killing goblins, I thought I'd give a fast lesson in goblin (I trained 1 point in it at the guild).  And someone asked me if that helped my taunt, and I said &quot;what, taunting them in Goblin? Yeah, they're so offended by the way I massacre their language they want to kill me all the more.&quot;  That, for me, is roleplaying, and it's not incompatible with grouping for exp.<br><br>Basically the problem seems to be that no one agrees on a definition of roleplaying, and people are too quick to point fingers at each other and throw around accusations.  So yeah, we're ending up with a lot of the same problems as the other servers, only there are a lot fewer of us here, and everyone knows everyone else pretty much on the board, and that's not always a good thing.<br><br>-Giò,<br>being unusually wordy on the board tonight because she can't get in to Norrath... grrr.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 10:52:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> I try to roleplay... i slip in and out of rolepllay. when i get angry, there's no way i can RP.

EQ is about having fun and if you find fun being a Dwarf grouping with Ogres and Evil races then so have you or joining an Evil based guild because you can get more gear that way then like I said so be it. My 3 characters that I play were a must for the group we all started when we came here. We have always RPed, set story lines for every character and stuck to them. Guess my wording was a little strewn from the point but it was in essence saying that YES most of the high lvl ppl are not RPing and YES most of the server isnt either. I had a Troll roll up to me dragging a corpse and said to me in human &quot;Yo man, REZ THX!&quot; He was talking to my dwarf Cleric who is NG and I roleplayed telling him point blank that I have nothing to do with Evils or thier kind so he promptly lied to me saying he was neutral and was trying to be good ..... uhm yeah right. Out of kindness I tried Rezing him but it wouldnt take due to diety alignments as I knew it wouldn't. Guess the evils are too used to you Rezing em Heagan. The point is I guess that the majority of ppl here are not here for the core reason the server was put up and thats to play a role in your character. If doodspeak is accepted globally by all as some form as Ebonics is to English or something then so be it and I'll play along with the community as much as it will kill me to do it. As far as my 3 characters are concerned 2 are mules now and I only play one as a main but its how I can focus on guild utility as well as my RP views. Most ppl think I am just really really good at being a split personallity on all 3 but even that gets hard to do all the time. Cant type fast enough in character to keep up with the RP scenarios. Play how you wish, be uber wanna be if you wish, RP if you wish. Only the RPers will get my support from now on and thats how I wish it.

You chose a Dwarf Cleric of Brell - following ANY history of the Dwarven Conflicts with Evils or their building of Elven Cities or wars with humans and Ogres all from Lore on the EQ page would show you which direction your path would have lead. You looked at it more as I wanna group with anyone like you just said so that was your priority it WASNT Roleplay by any means at all. Like I said before it was your choice so was the choosing of Evoc as your specialty. Myself and others mentioned what the true calling of a celric is especially in the chosing of Specialization skills and you didnt even know what the skills were for. I can't blame you for not roleplaying esp when you dont know what your class limits and uses are so I wont. In a world where BRELL would truely control your spell ability, the first time you grouped with an Ogre, created by Rallos - Brells enemy, you'd LOSE your casting ability as a Cleric. Stormwind is true neutral forced by Verant since all druids are this but I follow Tunare. To group with DEs or Ogres or Iksars is just ludicrous from a roleplay perspective so I dont do it. You made your bed, you chose your style of play and the need for gear or groups far over any roleplay sense and thats how you want it , fine no biggie. Still boggles me how you wanted to join Covenant of Truth a purely N/G aligned guild, note the GOOD in that, but didnt see how we would have issues of you grouping with evils or supporting dwarven killers or such beasts, which was fine by you. Either you dont know what roleplay is, you dont care or just dont care what other ppl's style of RP is. So be it brother, no sweat really. You made the choices and avoided all insight anyone suggested to you as truth or near truth and joined an N/E guild so dont expect us to aid you. Sorry but we as roleplayers of good, reguardless of the added alignment by Verant, dont help those who aid evils in any way ...... THATS ROLEPLAY, thanks  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukarlithas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlithas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/5/01 12:04:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> I don't get it.

Does the server rules actually limit people's ability to interact in an IN-character fashion?  Does the server rules affects how a good aligned should react to an evil aligned?

I have 3 points, and I get this from www.everquest.com. Maybe you have some other source, maybe one you have written? But here is what the creators of the game have to say.<br><br>1. Brell and Veeshan are enemies. Not Brell plus good guys equal enemies of everything else.<br><br>2. Brell entered into pacts with Tunare , Prexus, Bristlebane and Cazic Thule.  He tried to convince Rallos Zek to side with him against Veeshan, but Rallos got kinda greedy and war ensued, which Rallos lost and was banished. Anyway when have you seen me be best buds with an Ogre? And past that, since Brell and Rallos aren't enemies now &lt;because it only says Brell and Veeshan are enemies&gt; what would stop me from befriending an Ogre, save his own pride from their defeat?<br><br>3. Brell is not a good guy. He is Neutral.<br><br>Why wouldn't you rez a troll? Brell and Cazic have a thing going. <br>When have you seen me group with Ogres? &lt;altho I have before, Oug comes to mind, you weren't there&gt;<br>I didn't click a button and choose evoc as my spec. I wasn't powerleveled by a consistant group of adventurers who let me sit around and heal all the time. I had to fight for what I have.<br><br>It isn't 'good and neutral' vs. evil. You make that up. That's your idealism. Mine says good vs. evil, fine. But I'm not good.<br><br>I'm neutral. Your druid is neutral, but you make up your own rules about how he sides with good and hates evil. Hey thats cool, your story has to fit somehow I guess.<br><br>So you go legitimize yourself and de-legitimize me. I don't see anything I do as non-rp. Hell I interract with people 50 levels lower than me, especially dwarves. There are more than a handful of people who knew or know me as Heagan the Hermit because of the length of time I went without choosing a guild. <br><br>And hey, like it or not, your guild isn't a strictly 'good' guild. You have neutral members which makes you a good and neutral guild. 'Oh but Heagan, I told you before, thats just game mechanics, our druids HAVE to be neutral'. Well thats your own argument turned on itself. You run to the EQ lore to say why I'm wrong, and in the process you are not only wrong but a rather verbal hypocrite.<br><br>KTHX <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/5/01 6:23:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> Geez, another thing.

And as for Verant's excuse that it's not realistic that you'd know what it dropped in the first place, well what if you can actually see the weapon that it's hitting you with and then you kill it and the weapon disappears just because you were so much stronger than it was?  And that's supposed to make sense on an in-character level??  /boggle<br><br>Language barrier hampers roleplay by making it much harder to communicate with others, and how can you roleplay if you can't communicate?  In real life if you don't speak someone else's language you can use gestures, point to things, learn specific key words that you can use to help you.  In the game you can't do that except for certain fixed emotes.  You can point at another character or NPC, but not at a thing, and you can't ask &quot;how do I say 'sand giant' in Ogre?&quot; so you can warn the ogre you're fighting with if you happen to see one approaching.  Besides, it's not realistic to think that people who live so close to each other would know nothing of each other's language.  And so on.<br><br>Lack of grouping doesn't in itself have to hamper roleplay, it's just what I've observed.  If you spend all your time soloing, while it's true you might be roleplaying and have a finely developed concept of your character and their history and beliefs and everything else, if you're not interacting with anyone else, what is the point?<br><br>&quot;Does the server rules actually limit people's ability to interact in an IN-character fashion?&quot;<br><br>The rules limit people's ability to interact in ANY fashion, in or out of character.<br><br>&quot;Does the server rules affects how a good aligned should react to an evil aligned?&quot;<br><br>Well, to a certain extent, yes.  Suppose a good aligned cleric of Nife wants to heal the wounds of an evil warrior of Zek, because she believes it is her duty to heal all wounds, but she can't because of alignment?  Some say this is enforcing roleplaying because a good aligned character shouldn't want to assist an evil aligned character; others say it's limiting roleplay by forcing characters to behave in a certain faction.  I don't have as much of a problem with the alignment rules as I do some of the others.<br><br>&quot;Does the server rules demand how a dwarf should react at the sight of an ogre (taking into their racial history in consideration)?&quot;<br><br>Actually?  If the dwarf were stronger, he'd probably kill the ogre.  But unless the ogre agrees to a duel, he couldn't do that here.  About the only way he could react that the ogre would understand, would be /rude<br> <br>&quot;All the answers are NO. It is the P-E-O-P-L-E that is responsible for that part, not the server rules.&quot;<br><br>True... my main complaint is that the server rules foster isolation, which isn't conducive to roleplay.<br><br>-Giò<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/6/01 12:42:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Heh.</span><hr size=1> How much roleplaying is it that a Rodcet Nife cleric can't heal Innoruuk-worshipping me?<br> <br>Easy.

There is plenty of oppurtunities if you make the time for them and try. I agree alot of folks here have no clue what true roleplying is, however, the vast majority will roleplay if roleplayed to. <br> I am an elf, I could really care less about what a gnome or even a human has to say most of the time. There are times I can get the meaning of what they say, even though I am not positive. <br> Level has zero to do with RP. It has to do with power gaming though. They are not necessarily exclusive, however those who focus primarily on levels seem to be less into RPing, not all just the majority.<br> I have enjoyed this server more than any other. I like going into Crushbone and seeing D'vinn, Crush , and even the Trainer uncamped. If you slow down a bit, and with the hell levels there after 30, folks will begin to catch up to you.
