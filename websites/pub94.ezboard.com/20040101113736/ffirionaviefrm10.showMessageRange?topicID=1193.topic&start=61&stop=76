The hallway was once again vacant.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will tighten up security...&quot; she murmured.<br>
<br>
She returned to her rooms...strangely bare of luxury for one of her position.  Material things had never mattered much to her - her room could have been that of a monk, or a pauper. Unlike the office, which was furnished with the trappings of wealth and power to dominate the visitor, her room had simply a bed, a washstand, and one torch for light upon the wall.<br>
<br>
She lay down for a moment on the bed, suddenly tired. This ceremony was needed, the God required it. Her temple in the Necropolis would then be infused with the power of Cazic Thule, and linked to Paineel. <br>
<br>
But ... what then. Her father... Sern Adolia would soon finish his own sacrifices on the moon, and she could not remain within the city as he and the other high priests returned.  For all they kept their bitter hatred from the rest of the Temple, it did not change the fact that he sought her death. Or that she despised him for the corruption of the temple, and had sworn to cleanse it of his domination, and return it to the True Path. In fact, she would even now be another pile of bones at the bottom of the hole, but for the intervention of the mercenary long ago, who though hired bring her back to Paineel to her doom, instead stopped her father and saved her. <br>
<br>
She sighed.  Life had been so simple once. To serve the God, to spread the Words of Cazic Thule.  She missed somehow the pure bright fire and faith she had known as a student - before she had seen the foul and twisted nature of her father, and the other priests ....  <br>
<br>
The new Temple would not bear this taint.. she vowed silently to herself.  In the Necropolis, the priests and priestesses would follow the way of Fear, and would not be distracted into the petty lusts and perversions of the flesh. <br>
<br>
She straightened, stood, and went to don the high ceremonial robes. It was time to talk with Meledi.  <p><img border=0 src="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/sigs/Littany.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melediweaver>melediweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dirges, a specialty</span><br>  Posts: 466<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/24/03 12:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=62>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> Her fingers reflexively played a complicated beat upon the table top, and she shivered a little in thin garments, missing the insulation of her armour.<br>
<br>
Tanare had gone off somewhere with the shadowknight, D'Ron Karr. Despite admitting to a slight relief (well more than slight) to the respite from the ongoing babble onslaught, she worried greatly at what they would do to the young ranger.<br>
<br>
The door opened, and a priest came in. His face was hidden in the traditional mask of the Faceless, no features were shown, just a blank, a void.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come with me bard. The High Priestess would see you now&quot;.<br>

Littany stands in the middle of the office, her ceremonial robes, and elegance, a contrast to the bard, who is disheveled from her stay in the cell.<br>
Littany smiles slightly, and pours a glass of wine, and hands it to Meledi<br>
Littany has offered you a Eternal Night Black Wine.<br>
Glug, glug, glug... You take a swig of Eternal Night Black Wine.<br>
Ahhh. That was refreshing.<br>
<br>
Littany says, 'Vendui Meledi. '<br>
Meledi says, 'Hello Littany,  '<br>
Littany says, 'You and I, we seem fated to encounter each other bard. I think the God has willed it so. '<br>
Meledi laughs.<br>
Meledi says, 'I need to have a chat sometime then with Thule. Tell him we’ve got to stop meeting like this. '<br>
Littany smiles faintly in spite of herself.<br>
Littany says, 'I warned you not to come to my temple Meledi.'<br>
Meledi says, 'I know, but I could not stand idle when you had my ward, Tanare, captive.'<br>
Littany makes a face.<br>
Littany says, 'Always thinking you can control events, always taking on burdens…..You are a fool bard, I had already decided to release her. Anyone who can disrupt and spread disharmony as she does will do more good alive than dead to further the cause of the Shadows.    '<br>
Littany grimaces again.<br>
Littany says, 'I decided I would be doing you too much a service to remove her. I am naut that kind. '<br>
Meledi laughs again.<br>
Meledi says, 'I am sure Sergian will be delighted at your decision.'<br>
Littany grins evilly.<br>
Meledi says, 'If you like, I shall take her home, Littany. And we will not trouble your hospitality further.'<br>
Littany nods slowly.<br>
Littany says, 'There is only one difficulty, Meledi *sighs*  The Moondark Ceremony requires blood for its completion. But, I have another woodelf in my cells, I suppose she will have to do  '<br>
Meledi looks dismayed.<br>
Meledi says, 'Another…of my League?  '<br>
Littany says, ' Nau Meledi, just some random wandering young woodelf, you do naut have to be concerned '<br>
Meledi says, 'Littany….   '<br>
Littany looks down her long thin nose at Meledi<br>
Littany says, 'Do naut be a fool bard. I offer you the chance to walk freely into the sunlight with your ward. Surely this is enough! '<br>
Meledi says, 'You know I cannot permit this…   '<br>
Littany grits her teeth.<br>
Littany says, 'WILL you NAUT learn Meledi. You cannot control all things. I offer you freedom, TAKE it! '<br>
Meledi says, 'I will not leave another to die to your evil God Littany.'<br>
Littany shakes her head in disgust.<br>
Littany says, 'You know why I offer you this chance, xas?'<br>
Meledi says, ' I know Littany, and it does not matter. If it is my choice….it absolves you of the promise.'<br>
Littany says, 'A blooddebt and a promise ….'<br>
Meledi says, ' Again, it is my choice.'<br>
Littany nods slowly.<br>
Littany says, 'And you would stand in her place?.'<br>
Meledi looks resolute.<br>
Meledi says, ' I would.'<br>
Littany hisses – sensing Meledi’s fear.<br>
Littany says, 'Perhaps it is best you die Meledi. You take on too many burdens. Perhaps it would be a kindness to let you find a new life, in the turning of the Wheel. Perhaps this death would be a teaching.  '<br>
Meledi is silent letting the priestess come to a decision.<br>
Littany says, 'We are naut very different you and I Meledi. I also can be kind. '<br>
Meledi cannot help herself and smiles.<br>
Meledi says, 'Littany – you speak of burdens. Don’t you sometimes also wish to rest? To just live free of responsibility and care?  '<br>
Meledi says, 'Lord Gray felt this, once, long ago. And so he came to stay with us, at peace at last in our halls. It is not too late for you Littany. You could leave this place, this terrible purpose of yours, and be free.  '<br>
Littany looks curiously at the bard.<br>
Meledi says, 'I know Lord Gray was your friend Littany, would you not like to come and visit with him?'<br>
Littany says, 'You waste your breath bard. Lord Gray chose his own path, he turned his back upon his guild and his God. I honor the memory of who he was, naut who he became. Another leads the shadows now, the Lady Didi'<br>
Meledi says, 'I am also his friend Littany, as I would be your friend, your….sister.'<br>
Meledi puts every ounce of charm and persuasion into her voice. Its harmony fills the room, soothing, for a moment lifting the shadows.<br>
Littany says, 'SILENCE! '<br>
Meledi stops suddenly.<br>
Littany says, 'Do naut use your voice on me bard, lest I have your tongue removed and nailed upon the wall of Darian’s Bar in Shadowhaven.'<br>
Meledi straightens, and says in a plain voice….<br>
Meledi says, 'And so Littany…. You let Tanare and the other elf go free, and I become your guest at the Moondark?  '<br>
Littany says, 'This is your choice, of your own free will? '<br>
Meledi says, 'It is.'<br>
Littany hesitates.<br>
Meledi says, 'I can write a letter, so that all will know, if you wish this? '<br>
Littany nods again slowly.<br>
Littany says, 'Xas,, a letter. Write it, and after they watch the ceremony, the woodelf and Tanare will go free. And in return, you give me the hours of your life, inside my hands.'<br>
Littany rings a bell, and imperiously tells the priest who scurries in to bring her parchment and a pen.<br>
Littany says, 'Make no mistake in this, just as you have choices, I have choices. And in my choice I will serve His Will.  Write then bard, and then  you and I, we will pray together to Lord Thule. And we will make our preparations for the ceremony. The Moondark is upon us on the morrow.' <br>

An erudite in dark red robes hastily steps through, his expression anxious and worried.<br>
<br>
He rushes past the various people, Koada'dal and Tier'Dal, Trolls and Frogloks, Dwarves and Ogres all in peace and comraderie in the city of the Plane of Knowledge on his way to the pillar which will lead to Luclin and the home of the League.  <br>
<br>
Vainly wishing that he could convince Littany to become as one of the inhabitants of New Tanaan, he realizes that such thoughts will not help at this moment.  The priestess is lost to such efforts.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the door to the halls of the League of Honour, Oligith searches for signs of recent passage briefly wishing he could read tracks even one hundredth as well as a ranger or druid.  Seeing the Halls once again empty but showing signs he can read of recent occupation, he sits down to write something all in the League can see.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I have just returned from the depths of the Heritic city Paineel with dire news. Our beloved Meledi Weaver has been captured by the High Priestess of Cazic Thule known as Littany and is to be sacrificed at a ceremony known as the Moondark.<br>

After a moment's thought, the enchanter casts a quick cantrip causing it to glow almost brightly before he leaves it where it will be seen by all.<br>
<br>
Knowing that the members of the League might not see it in time and wanting to make certain that Meledi would be safe, the enchanter hastily left the League halls to post the same message in the Grand Hall of the Fellowship. <br>
<br>
Several note Oligith's entrance but are quickly distracted as Kuladen increases the volume on his current attempt at adding to his fan club through song.  With a smirk at Kuladen's antics, Oligith affixes his glowing message to the wall and adds the title <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>To the friends of Meledi Weaver</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in large letters to the top.<br>
<br>
Fatigued at his haste and efforts, Oligith then proceeds to the bar for a few moments of relaxation and to give time for word to spread... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Sage Koada'dal Phantasmist of the 64th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zippusmaximor>Zippus Maximor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/26/03 4:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> The small figure works its way quickly across the Toxxulia Forest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bard...they think they have good ideas and they're <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wrong!&quot; he mumbles to himself, pausing for a moment to check his hand.  The swelling had gone down, but in its place the flesh had begun to corrode and bleed.<br>
<br>
Zippus passes through the gates of Paineel, undeterred by the skeletons swinging away at the tunnel walls with their picks.  As he nears the stone elevator going into the depths of Paineel he smiles at the skeletal guards and speaks.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish passage into the city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Keyssss?&quot; the Skeleton peers through empty sockets at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah,&quot; He flings open his robe, sending an arc of electricity at the guard, turning it instantly to dust.  He frowns, and sits to await reinforcements.  His plan may have been ruined, but he would not see the loss of another friend.<br>
<br>
Nodding, he reaches up and a drake coalesces from the air at his side.  He holds up a parchment, and the drake takes it with an annoying screech.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take it to Meledi Argus, it tells her that her rescue comes.  And it also tells Littany that if any harm befalls Meledi, things will go <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>very</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> badly for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
With an ever annoying flap, the Familiar fades back into the shadows.  Zippus buries his head in his hands.<br>
<br>
He quickly recoils in disgust.<br>

&quot;Cripes, my hand smells worse than Kyrial,&quot; he sighs.<br>

Designed for quick thrusts, it has a wickedly sharp edge and a deep blood groove in a curving design traveling the length of the blade.<br>
<br>
He winces at first as he begins to cut and smudge the blade with the poisoned flesh on his left hand.  He gives a slight smile at the emblazoned &quot;K a t c&quot; on his hand, before the pain returns sharply and he sheds a tear from the pain.<br>

<br>
I cannot thank you enough for your rescue of Tanare, Aurwina and myself. *smiles softly as she writes this*<br>
<br>
I sit once more at a table in Darian's Bar, warm and sipping an ale, and shudder a little to think how badly things could have turned out. <br>
<br>
I am sorry Zippus, your hand could not be cured, but must admit the clockwork one is very ingenious. Quea, I wish you could have succeeded in your attempt to crack the very foundations of that place. Oligith, your offer to retrieve my soul from the feet of Cazic Thule himself shall not be forgotten. Gerda, my silent and loyal friend, thank you for undoing the bonds that held me. Bakanome and Reidus, you are both paladins to your core, noble and worthy of honour. Wegwen, I am glad your blade found its way to support me. Fearuth, while I have not met you before, thank you for opening the door to allow my friends to enter Paineel, and although you may be exiled from Paineel, you are welcome to visit the League halls.<br>
<br>
And as for Littany, and the foul brood of the Shadows, one day we will defeat them totally, and drive them from this realm. Or, as we did with Lord Gray, we will show them the way to renounce their darkness.<br>
<br>
I remain in your debt, all of you!<br>
<br>
Your friend,<br>

So much undone as yet. The temple was not dedicated.  She felt this as an ache, an absense. Her God did not respond this morning as she prayed... He denied her his voice. She shivered, her Master would be angry, and above all things she wanted to please Him.<br>

As per his instructions on what he'd been paid to do, as he reaches the edge of the elevator leading into the depths of Paineel, he drops the box, and it lands with a sharp 'clack', right in front of the elevator.<br>
<br>
The Box is addressed to Littany, and below the small quill writing, there is drawn a large sad face with the words &quot;Sorry, hope you feel better soon!&quot; emblazoned below it.&quot;<br>

<br>
I'm really sorry things didn't work out for you, dear.  Honestly, I am.  However, I've told you in the past that I will not allow things like this to occur, and you did proceed with this plan knowing full well my opinion on such things.<br>
<br>
Thus, in the box out front of the city is a potion I aquired for you.  Upon drinking it, you will be transported to Everfrost Peaks, the closest I could get you to the Temple of the Plaguebringers, in the event that your hand has not been healed yet.  I also suppose this might be a good method of 'escape' for you should things go badly at the temple.  There is also something...special...in the box.  A memento of sorts.<br>
<br>
One of these days Littany, I'm sure you'll finally best me in your schemes.  I hope that day is long and far in the future.  Good day.<br>
<br>
Your friend,<br>
<br>
Zippus Maximor<br>

Fortunately for her, it had never quite dawned on her that she was really in deadly danger- except when Oggog decided he was going to eat her that is. <br>
<br>
    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Big meanie</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought as she looked back at the broken bones he had given her in his effort to prevent her from escaping the city before the sacrifice. She dimly remembered that the &quot;party&quot; was still going on when Ogilith told her that Sergian was waiting for her outside the city. Though she searched the city, the forest outside, the Plane of knowledge and the nexus without finding him- all of that was forgotten once she reached the bazaar and saw all the new outfits to try on.<br>
<br>
   The fact that others were there fighting to save Meledi who, unknown to Tanare, had volunteered to take her place in the cerimony, was a faint buzzing in the background of her mind. Tanare was still a bit upset with her guardian who &quot;cut her in line and got the cute outfit while i had to wear this ugly ripped up outfit that didn't even fit right&quot; when she had snuck out to go hunt with Dronkarr in the desert the day before the cerimony itself. <br>
<br>
   So when she ran off in search of &quot;Sergy&quot; she didn't think of wondering what had happened to Gerda, Oligith and the otthers who had come to recognize them.... of course she hadn't recognized any of them either as their illusions of erudite and teir-dal forms fooled her completely. As far as she knew they were &quot;Sergy's&quot; friends and that was all.<br>
<br>
   However she knew that the rest of the League was pleased to see her running about as Quea mentioned putting a collection together to buy her a new dress that she never got in Paineel. Tanare thought that was very nice of them but took it as yet more proof that her amazing cuteness just made people buy or give her stuff for no reason at all.<br>
<br>
   As she shopped some more one last thing flittered into her head, that she decided she must take care of very soon.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wait til i write to mother and tell her all this stuff that's happened, Littany bad dressy makey person wouldn't let me write to her so even though Meledy singy person must have written i'm sure mother will like want to hear from me anyways.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

  With a final nod to herself, Tanare continured her shopping. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=littanydthule>LittanyDThule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/28/03 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=74>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> As the rock wall opens, revealling the lip of the Hole, and the highest peak of the city, she pauses a moment, then steps out.She is alone, discretion dictates that she vacate the city in the early hours, before the return of her father and the high Priests.<br>
<br>
&quot;The next time I come ...&quot; she vows &quot;Will be on a dark horse, with an army behind me, to reclaim what is mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Almost she does not notice a small box upon the ground.. but a smell alerts her to its presence...<br>
<br>
Curious, she puts on her gloves, holds her breath, and picks it up.  She reads the note, and then, opens the box.  Her eyes are drawn to the central item.<br>
<br>
Nestled on soft white fur, is the object. The stench is overwhelming, the black veins, and decay, and rotting flesh make a travesty of what was once the hand of a gnome.<br>
<br>
Grimly, she stands a moment, and then slowly, she smiles.<br>
<br>
It is not a nice smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah Zippus.... you give me something, perhaps more than you know.....&quot; <br>
<br>
She takes a pack, and removes an enchanted container. Its contents (perhaps the brain of some strange creature) are discarded, and the box is placed within and it is sealed.<br>
<br>
Then silently, she moves into the mists of the  Tox forest... to find her way by hidden paths ... <p><img border=0 src="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/sigs/Littany.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/28/03 1:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> D'Ron had sat, meditating, for quite a while, review what had had happened within the temple.
