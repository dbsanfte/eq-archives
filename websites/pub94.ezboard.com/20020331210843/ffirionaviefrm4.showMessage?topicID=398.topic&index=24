Simple ideas for a character that just doesn't realize their actions are making it more difficult for others.  These are not concrete rules, and as was said by Bjorn and Kimaya, the best advice you'll ever be given is 'Use your own experience to decide what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
If someone would like to Roleplay a strong-armed melee cleric... all power to them.  They can just ignore all the advice.<br>
<br>
Good common-sense tactics on a blue server is also good common-sense tactics on FV.  'Roleplaying' server does not mean 'Free-for-all group tactics!  Everyone do whatever you feel like!  Cleric is tank!  Warrior is main healer!'  This would make the battles less than fun, as everyone would die all the time.<br>
<br>
I mean, if you want RP your warrior as an insane asylum escapee that thinks he is a healer... go ahead.  But you're not going to be very useful to anyone in an accual battle.  You're not going to go anywhere except back to bind point every five minutes.  And doing endless CRs is no fun... and it means less time to RP.<br>
<br>
I'd let they warrior healer in my group though!  They'd be a blast!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 1:59:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, you want general?</span><hr size=1> Cleric + melee = not very effective<br>
<br>
First I'm a cleric with my offence capped (200) 1hb capped (175) and guess what with the same level haste, I can't melee KS a warrior many season my junior even with a good weapon witch I borrowed from the warrior. We can't keep up with the double attack, dual weild, gear setup to proc weapons etc.. and it only get worse at level 40 ish we cap out our melee skills, they get better combat table, baetter weapons, alot more skill etc. If you're realy bored  parse out your damage and see what you're doing, vice a tank of your level or even one that is quite green.<br>
<br>
Now i do enjoy a good melee on occasion, but i only do it if my buffs are current, my party is healed, and I'm over 90m. My atk is 775 without strength buffs but We just don't have the extra melee skills to do the damage. You can get a bit of leaniancy from your group to do stuff like melee if they know that you know what you are doing.<br>

<br>
I think you are attempting to characterize my objection as RP hysteria, and also to gloss over the nature of the 'advice.'<br>
<br>
I did not rant on with a slew of !!!!! and therefore don't need to 'relax.'<br>
<br>
Such gems as (paraphrase) 'Shadow Knights don't even bother trying to be a puller till you're 60, leave it to the Monks.'<br>
and 'Casters if you melee you'll get a bad rep and wind up soloing your high level days because no one will group with you' and 'Monks the entirety of your existence is to Pull.  Dedicate yourself to learning everything about every mob to be able to pull' are NOT just useful tidbits like always use Assist, and play your class effectively and combine strengths with other classes.<br>
<br>
What they are is a Formula that says 'After 3 years in Production the EQ community has determined that these are the OOC Roles each class should play in a fight.  This will give you the optimum damage/minute and Mana Efficiency, allowing you to kill mobs quick with minimal downtime.  It has nothing to do with Characters of Roleplay.  It is about how YOU the Player utilize your Avatar in order to defeat the Mob AI.  If you ignore this you won't get along in the 'real' world of EQ.<br>
<br>
Am I saying that his observations are wrong?  No!  But what I am reminding people is that for many people they are looking for a little different experience on FV than being the most 'efficient.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 3:21:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, you want general?</span><hr size=1> No, it's simply that your objection comes off as being:<br>

<br>
It's just advice.  People need not take it if they think it's bad.  If they came to FV to be different, they can.  Steeltoe is just outlining GOOD tactics for those who want to be 'efficient'<br>
<br>
Is there more to FV than being efficient?  Absolutly!  But that doesn't mean we can't learn how to be good RPers AND be efficient.  Personally, I want to be a good RPer AND an good rogue.  I can take the advice, mix it in with my own experiences, and create my own style.<br>
<br>
A warrior RPing as the &quot;the most powerful being in Norrath, able to crush mountains within his fist!&quot; that consistantly gets his ass whipped by light-blue orc pawns isn't a very good RPer.  Some tips on how to become a better EQ warrior will really do nothing but enhance a person's ability to RP. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A> at: 2/22/02 3:26:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usteeltoefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SteeltoeFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 3:21:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, you want general?</span><hr size=1> Eliezer of Erudin - Everything you posted I agree with. This is a RP Server. Everyone should be able to play as they wish to meet there in-character personality, BUT when your in-character personality and play style reflects itself back at a group and dooms it to failure due to not playing your class as it was designed (intended?) then we have a problem....<br>
<br>
If you are in the deepest, nastiest part of Droga and your Insame Warrior begins thinking he is a Cleric and starts binding wounds on your Ranger in the middle of a 5 mob fight to the death I have issue with that... wouldnt you? If you answer no to this question then you are a TRUE Roleplayer and as a TRUE Roleplayer you would never travel with that maniac again....<br>
<br>
Hence my simple advise... play your character well, play and have fun, PLAY... but dont let your Roleplaying experience kill your entire group (I think common sense kinda dictates here...)<br>

<br>
Play your character how ever you want. Be whatever you want.

<br>
Actually that's not what I said.  What I said was to also remember that people may have some RP ideals that mean a /slight/ sacrifice in efficiency.<br>
<br>
A Shadow Knight can be a fine puller.  If that fits the SKs role and he is reasonably good at it should he NOT do it just because it doesn't fit the 'model?'<br>
<br>
When I played a Cleric I didn't melee.  I don't melee with my Wizard either.  But if I did and someone told me to stop being stupid and med I'd probably be somewhat offended.  No one is talking about having people go willy-nilly with Warriors insisting on being Main Healer with Bind Wounds.  What this thread has been discussing are the minutiae of Efficiency - I can see the next logical step being whether Warriors should Dual Wield or use 2HS.

<br>
First off, until yesterday, I didn't know about the stand-in-place thing, so you learn something new every day.<br>
<br>
In the groups I've been in, due to the relative paucity of clerics in our land, I tend to be the primary healer.  I understand my role is to sit back, meditate while everyone else does their thing, and heal people when they need it.  I'm pretty good at that, too.<br>
<br>
What I worry about, however, is how efficient my damage shields are and, even moreso, my damage over time spells are in group situations.  In the groups I've been in, unless things go very, very wrong (in which case I need all my mana for heals), monsters drop like flies.  If I put down a swarm spell, the monster's typically dead before it's gotten through even two or three tics.  I keep it memorized, and watch for opportunities to use it (as it seems to have a minimal aggro effect--much less than heals or direct damage blasts do), but I wonder if just tossing out a Careless Lightning when I want to do damage might be a better use of my mana.<br>
<br>
The same goes for the damage shield.  I use it habitually, and I know that it spreads the damage onto the monsters not being targetting, but the amount of damage, all things considered, is pretty minimal.<br>
<br>
Have faith that the members of your group know what they're doing.  Sometimes, appearances are deceptive.  I was in a group yesterday, getting pounded on by something, and I had myself targetted and was trying to put down a Shield of Barbs on myself.  One of my group members thought I was casting a root spell on a mesmerized monster, and some heated /tells ensued about my competency or lack thereof.   The casting visual effect of the Druidic Damage Shields is identical to the casting vidual effect of the root spells.<br>
<br>
Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, if you let your healer go down, you're in a world of hurt, especially if there's only one in the group.<br>

ABSOLUTELY! Totally agree with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But never get so deep in to the RP aspect that the efficiency goes through the floor. I agree totally. TOTALLY... I think there is a definate time when SKILL takes precidence over RP'ing...

I suppose my posts could be considered for them 5% of the times... do fun, funny, RPing things around me and Im laughing with you, but when the going gets rough I expect folks to buckle down and play there class... if yu can RP in there and still be professional and play your class well more power to you! But dont let your RPing get in the way for survival... (God I hope that is common sense among you hardcore Roleplayers... )<br>

<br>
Right now things are dying very quickly for you so some of your spells you deem worthy while soloing are put to little or no use in a group situation... this is normal my friend. DoTs are &quot;Damage over Time&quot; spells.... which means you need time for them to work themselves out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  When mobs die inside 60 seconds your DoT wasnt much good... so dont memorize it.. YET..... while in the lower levels your ability to heal, damage shield, harmony, SNARE (note... SNARE SNARE SNARE SNARE) and DD's are most importent. DD;s are quick NOW damage... use them... just dont abuse them. Heres a trick for you....<br>
<br>
When you cast a DD and the mob turns on you and starts kicking you like your neighborhood bully use to do when you were a kid then you will KNOW you did it wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Next time wait a bit longer to cast and see if you get aggro.... and so on and so on until you no longer get hit...<br>

<br>
I definitely keep track of the average length of fight and use that to gauge whether my mana would be better spent DoT or Blam.  I used to DoT everything almost right off, but it's turned out to be far more mana efficient to just pop off a lightning or two in some groups.  Also, I'm not afraid to use Stinging Swarm instead of Creeping Crud when appropriate -- more mana efficient when there are multiple fights that aren't hairy enough to require the tougher spell.  Of course, if the group is very efficient and I'm the healer, I tend to save most my mana for heals while Kenyon dishes out the blammo.<br>
<br>
If you have the time (and focus), run a quick tally of how many hits get off on the tank with your damage shield up to get a good gauge of how much damage it's doing vs. lightning or a DoT.  This is another time when the lower level spell could do the job, too, when mana's tight.  Of course, if there's multiples, I'd always recommend your best damage shield to increase the chances that the next time you heal, one of them doesn't decide to make you their new best friend...<br>

I'm in the same boat as Lasgalen, as a Druid, and he posted identical concerns that I've been having lately, though I am starting to find a comfortable niche.<br>
<br>
In full groups, I am always the healer, no exceptions. There just isn't anyone else to do it, and I don't mind it a bit, I really do enjoy it actually and think I'm quite good at it. However, when I'm at full mana, and we are only taking single pull after single pull, I feel like excess baggage because there really isn't much for me to do. I snare and throw a damage sheild on the tanks, but these take hardly any mana at all.  I always feel like there is something else I should be doing. I do keep everyone buffed with Skin like Steel as well and still have alot of time on my hands.<br>
<br>
What I've come to now is to not even bother with DoT's in a full group,  but if there are only a few of us and our tank is a Ranger, then I DoT them with Creeping Crud, it usually wears off before the fight is even over so it's worth it. In dungeon situations it's just a mana burner, however, I do always keep a DoT memmed just in case.  I do like to throw off Lightening if I'm full mana and it's a single pull but I always make sure it's ok with my group before the fight starts, noone has had a problem with it yet, again, as long as I'm full mana and not when it's a big pull, big pulls, all my mana goes toward snaring and healing. <br>
<br>
And I agree with Kimaya, I always keep a lower level spell memmed. If I'm the sole healer, I keep light healing memmed as well. If I don't have enough mana for Healing, I usually can go for a Light Healing and sometimes even that little bit can keep someone alive long enough to get to zone in a really bad situation. <br>
<br>
I've finally come to the realization that everything is situational for Druids since we're competent in alot of things but master of none of them, when it comes to groups. As much as it is frustrating to find the best use of my skills when in a new group, it has really been a huge learning experience on how to work with different classes.  <p>Narie<br>

Those who would best be served by it are those who have not played their current class before. The 'old hands' generally know when they can break the rules. I played a high end cleric on my old server and would often melee when mana was above 90% and we did not have any on ice waiting to be killed. I was mostly trying to raise my defense and offense for those truly awful situations when they might actually come in handy. Oh, and also to kill those stupid bixies quickly. I don't think anyone ever had lower Bixie faction than my old character. To my mind a responsible player learns her primary function first and experiments on 'down' or free time. And ask your group if its ok to melee, if your a caster or otherwise act crazy.<br>
<br>
Yes this is a roleplaying server. Learn to play your role. Then learn to improvise. As a cleric I had to substitue as an enchanter (with root), melee (may Tunare have mercy on us all), puller (complete nightmare) and nuker (fun esp. against undead). But these were not my usual role. On the other hand knowing that you can do them in a pinch and knowing how to do them as effectively as possible can be a literal life saver, as well as make for a fun group experience. In all things, good communication with your group is key. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=398.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=398.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=398.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=45><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=398.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=398.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=398.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
