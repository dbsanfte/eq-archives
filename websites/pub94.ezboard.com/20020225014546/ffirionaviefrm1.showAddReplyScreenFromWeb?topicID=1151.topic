It's time for some small changes on FV to remedy not the lack of people, but the problems that the low number of folks leaves us with.  Personnally, it's time for 2 changes.  When it started, it was fantastic, there were even too many people for the mobs to kill, now, you're lucky if there are 2 others in a zone with you.  I came here for the ruleset, but my friends list has been refreshed at about every 10th level because most on it always leave because they just can't take it anymore.  It's time for the players on the server to ask for some changes as otherwise, it'll only keep going down.  Anyone else notice we see about 1 person a day posting that they are leaving?  Well it's just going to get worst.  My original guild all quit and the one I'm in now has had about 25 quit as well because they couldn't take it.<br>
<br>
Anyone agree with me that some changes are needed?  Or do you like playing on a server where around 50% of the zones are totally empty and another 25% have 1 group in them.  I don't know, but finding someone who can find a group daily is getting pretty damned hard.<br>

I must confess I have recently taken a look at several other servers, but don't think I can play on a regular server...I love this server, met wonderful people during my travels---just wish there were twice as many players as the current number. <br>

It does seem like a lot of people have been quitting, but I am not sure the ruleset is entirely to blame. From what I have noticed it is usually those who have played the game for years, and are just totally burnt out.<br>
<br>
I think we a need a little more optimism here. Remember, there aren't a lot of players, but we CAN do something about it. Feneant may be right that some adjustment of the ruleset is necessary. Making it a BIT easier to learn languages would be a good start. <br>
<br>
The strategy I use is to help those who are new to the server and/or the game have as much fun as possible. Word of mouth can be a huge help when there are 30 servers to choose from and FV is at the bottom (well, top technically)<br>
<br>
Also, MANY players do not have any roleplaying backgrounds whatsoever. Those of us who do need to show them what it's al about, and how much it adds to the fun. I admit it may not be for everyone, but for me at least it gives depth to the game that isn't found in camping the mobs that give you the best XP.<br>
<br>
I think those players that quit FV after a short while didn't have that one really fun experience that you can only get on OUR server. As I've heard over and over on these boards, there is no going back! That said, we DO need more players to keep to fun going, so lets discuss and come up with ideas... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uebine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ebine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/19/02 5:42:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is dying... slowly but surely</span><hr size=1> Hmm I see a lot of new people running around.

Most normal servers will only have 5 in a group but not give you a spot because they are waiting for that perfect fit they want. On this server its oh we have an enchanter but what the heck we can have two.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/19/02 6:23:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The new folk ..</span><hr size=1> .. don't usually make it past level 5.  The tougher ones stick around to 15 or even 20, but it gets really empty around 25'ish.  I can run through zones that are great hunting grounds at that level and find no one at all.  There's only one person still on my friends list that I added before level 10.<br>
<br>
It seems like there's maybe one hot-spot for grouping for each of the major level ranges.  I've noticed that iceclad seems to be good for the 35'ish folk.  By good, I mean there's more than 2 people in the zone and they seem to be doing pickup groups (I was just there to get a mask).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what's causing it, but I suspect it's one of three: language, TLC, or character limit.  All of them can result in severe frustration if you don't carefully plan out your entire character from 1 to 60 and know precisely which class you want to play all the way up.  The FV ruleset is not for folks that don't plan ahead or don't know how to plan ahead because they're new.<br>
<br>
Shintou keeps railing about how the PG'ers are destroying his RP.  Well, the ruleset here is such that only a PG'er can survive.  IMHO, if FV was turned into a normal blue server, we wouldn't see a huge inrush of &quot;farming d00ds&quot;.  We'd just keep the ones that chose FV for the &quot;roleplay prefered&quot; description on the server lists. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/19/02 6:27:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/19/02 8:12:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new folk ..</span><hr size=1> do Verant employees even bother to read the polls, input and feedback from forums such as these? <br>

Since that time I have joined a really good guild (tinkers pride) and I learned through that about people leaving.  Once we had, I believe, over 30 members and now we have about 15 regulars.  I don't thank that is bad at all for a guild made up of only gnomes, but still...  For awhile I feared it was going to dip below 10 AND we are on our second guild leader.  If I'm not the longest running member then I don't know who else in the guild is!<br>
So, yeah, I know what your talking about.  The busiest city I have seen is Kelethin, but it's still not as busy as it used to be.<br>
Anyway, I have experiance with roleplaying which is why I chose this server and now with my new background, well, I can't wait to get into it more even if the populations not that high.  I will be loyal to my guild and this server until the end.  Which, either way, I hope never comes.<br>

FV is the last refuge of alot of people.  When they get their parade rained on here, they just leave.  I'd leave if not for FV, and if our server changed and DID get overrun by farmers, I'd be gone faster than you could blink.

<br>
I've had less problems finding groups on FV than I have on E'ci. In fact the lower population has made it EASIER to find groups. &quot;Balanced&quot; groups are another matter.<br>
<br>
I think the lower population helps a lot. Very rarely will you be turned down for a group because you aren't the class/role the group needs. Instead they'll take you and adapt.<br>
<br>
I've got a growing list a friends that I check for and see who's got room. Luclin has made travel much easier, and I spend a lot of time in a lot of different zones, not just hotspots.<br>
<br>
BTW if you're thinking of starting/re-starting in FV, consider a warrior/paladin/shadowknight. They seem to be few in number. But that's just what I'm seeing.<br>

Sad but True<br>
<br>
3) are Verant developers hearing any of this? <br>
<br>
Would they care if they did?<br>
<br>
I was among the first to start, I was the 4th player in Qeynos North, I'm 42 and still going, but man, there has to be something done to change it.  I play EQ on FV only and the second FV goes, my account gets cancelled again.  I watched my brother play on another server and it sickened me, it was like IRC or ICQ with graphics and more to do, but for every new player we get, 3 leave.  Quite frequently, we stand below the diety PvP server now... I'm not writing this thread as a whine, I'm writing it to say that we have to do something before Verant decides that the server isn't lucrative and offer to either send us to another server or remove the rules on ours to make it a blue server with RP preferred.<br>
<br>
<br>
I was considering asking Verant for 1 thing and 1 thing only, to remove anon to at least help us in getting groups... we went through most of the LFG today to find someone to join us and the closest we found was 5 lower than the lowest member in our group.  The other day when I asked those LFG, I got one that was 13 over our highest and one 15 under our lowest...  It's not a drastic change, but it does at least alleviate the whole grouping problems. <br>

How you dont gotta turn off your ooc to get some piece and quiet.<br>
<br>
There is some things I would like to see changed to make the server more productive....<br>
<br>
The roleplay/anon made so you can be unrolepay/anon...Hate trying to see what lvl people are or if someone I need for group is in area without using tells...<br>
<br>
Other few things are small and trivial and just my personnel preferances.<br>
<br>
Either way myself and my wife are now here to stay..<br>

Hysterical titles aside.  It's very easy for someone who is having a bad week (or generally a bad time of things) to assume his or her experience is universal, but in this case I must strongly assert that it isn't.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie, our unique rules set, and a relatively low server population go hand in hand.  We are rarely dead last in terms of population regardless.  I don't think we are in any danger of having our server closed in any case,  and if anyone is finding this unique environment difficult, I can only suggest that a reevaluation of priorities might be in order.  Most of us are still having a great time, on perhaps the only EQ server we would choose to be on at all, now.<br>

Our household supports two accounts, three regular players and we are all somewhat burned-out.<br>
Mind we have never played enough to have uber characters of lvl55+, but we have done many things to try and keep the game interesting, FirionaVie being the latest.<br>
I believe the game basically comes down to three things:<br>
LOOT, LEVEL and LOOKS ( I call it L-cube ). Many of us who fled blue servers to play on FV did so to a large extent as a negative reaction to L-cube and all it fosters on other EQ servers.<br>
Changes are needed, but not to the rules that make this server unique. FV seems to have many genuinely new players to EQ since Christmas...anyone else interested in helping to shape them up while playing their own characters also? A college, as it were?<br>

Friends left with me, we had grand plans...but over time, only I remained in Sullon Zek. The others couldn't stand/survive the harsh environment there.<br>
<br>
SZ is in one option a bit like FV: Constantly declining population and people leaving because of the bad points. I both love playing on SZ and FV because of the good parts of it.<br>
<br>
SZ in one way has a terribly immature population. Many griefers, 'dewds' and....plain idiots. Yet they have become part of the game. The guild I joined there used to have over 60 members, and was an evil RP-oriented guild. Yet we are about to disband since only three members are still around regularly.<br>
<br>
The good parts about SZ though is that it is always challenging. I normally hunt in enemy territory, which means I get ambushed at the worst moments, and have to deal with it instantly, I myself get to ambush enemies who most of the time have better odds, yet it is never boring there. The harsh environment of SZ is something I strangely prefer over a regular blue server: log in, seek group, get exp, get loot, log out.<br>
<br>
FV also has bad points everyone who comes here will notice: TLC (I like the TLC though), oppresive silence (even if there are 30 people in an area it's dead quiet, we don't have to listen to the ooc crap from blue servers, but total silence is annoying as well), one character and communication is hard with the language system.<br>
<br>
But when you look at the good parts of FV...this is the only server where I won't be looked strange at for being my character, being in-character, the only server where almost everyone I meet is a character, and not just a_level_x_class. The reason I started EQ years ago was because I wanted to play a mmoRPg...and FV finally made that possible (though Morell Thule also already had a very active roleplay community, so I had it better there then I would have on many other servers, like Veeshan and Prexus where I played before MT).<br>

I agree with Dreks.  I had the same idea.  If you put on your LFG flag, people should be able to see your level.  Maybe your class too.<br>
<br>
The only thing I would add to this is that I should be able to see all of the levels and classes of my fellow guild members.<br>
<br>
Language is only a problem if you let it be a problem.  If you take one hour and practice a language with someone (spam, zone, rinse and repeat)  you will have no problem conversing with someone.<br>
<br>
TLC is only a problem (for lower level quests) if you let it be a problem.  If I need a low level quest item because I didn't get it the first time around, I would create a PC quest with the goal being a bounty for the quest item.  For example, if I need to get Master Whoopall's head, I can create a bounty for the first person willing to go and separate Whoopall's head from his shoulders.  The other player gets cash or an item and I get the head.  I have a feeling this scenario is the basis for removing NO DROP on most items on FV.<br>
<br>
I have had a few characters on other servers.  FV is by far the best server.  The d00ds don't stick around here because the ruleset isn't &quot;easy&quot;.  Good, let'em go.  Create a character on another server and go sit in EC for ten minutes and you'll camp out and come back to FV.<br>

I think it would be very wrong to believe that those that leave are mostly &quot;d00dz&quot;. <br>
Actually, I think there are players of all kinds that leave the FV server, but mostly, I would imagine most of those are casual players. With the current rules in place, it makes it close to impossible for the casual player, if he or she is not in a big guild that is around when he/she is, or if he/she brings her own group when starting on the server.<br>
<br>
A damn shame if you ask me, since as most of you have already found out, FV is a server with a high percentage of mature and nice (role)players.<br>
<br>
(By the way, I am one of those people that started at day 1, but left after reaching level 20, due to the current rules. I am still lurking on the boards, though, since I hope the situation will improve one day, so I can re-activate my account.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
