The simple answer is yes.  There is favoritism on every board and 9/10 the moderators do not realize they are using it.  People are fallible and cannot always be fair.  I think that these boards do have a good group of moderators that try their best to stay fair.  Although I will say the comment by Ankles that Roberts post was deleted due to it being simply a flame and not trying to get to the real point is a bit off because I see simple flames all the time.  Maybe it is a good thing to bring it to the attention of moderators that you feel some sort of favoritism is taking place that way you they can examine what they are doing to see if they are inadvertently using favoritism.  This should have done in an email or somewhere private however.  Using the forum to bash the moderators just leads to mistrust and will achieve nothing in the end besides that chance that you might WIN the argument by posting things they HAVE to delete so that you can say they are being dictators.  Most problems can be discussed between the peoples involved and do not need to be aired over the soapbox appealing to peoples moral thoughts so that they will back you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 4:17:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Moderation- A Final Topic So more don't Pop up</span><hr size=1> /agree.<br><br>As an addendum, I'd like to add that the use of profanity in posts does nothing but belittle the poster.  I'd personally like to see all posts containing profanity deleted, and the posters banned if they continue to use it.<br><br>Why?  It serves no useful purpose.  It's offensive.  It is, by it's very nature, harrassment.  Further, it actively works against resolution of any situation by emotionalizing rationale in a negative way.<br><br>Ranting is one thing.  Personal attacks against others on these boards and use of profanity is another.  Ranting is the process of saying the rest of the world is wrong and that you are right (a generalization, but pretty close).  Profanity and attacks against individuals is not ranting.  It's being 14 with more computer than you deserve.<br><br>There.  That's my rant.  Note that I didn't use any words generally considered to be profane.

I couldn't care less about swearing or profanity use, I am certainly not offended by it, and in principle I agree its just words. But some people don't share this view, and out of respect for them, I don't use profane language.

They shouldn't have been advertising their thongs and their sexy ass.  However, there is no reason to use profanity.  Seriously if it was my child playing (You know some parents still care about their children in this day and age) and I saw that I wouldn't let them come here.  If you use profanity to simply cover up your lack of intelligence you should be banned and I am sorry his post talked about how it is all relative.  I am sorry but no matter how I say it people know what it means and for that matter if I say it are we sure the kids know what it means?  Have some respect and otherwise just grow up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udproberts01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DP Roberts01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/01 1:34:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For once</span><hr size=1> That is a truly ironic post.<br><br><br>Go back and bother to read Livak's post, then go read her other ones.  She often substitutes profanity with other words and I can't honestly say she makes a habit of swearing in the first place.   Her post was exactly what she stated it was-making a small point and nothing else.  Most of you simply love to jump to conclusions if you need someone to crusify, she just happened to be a convient target-a pity that it is the glamour of words and not the conclusion of them that matters here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/01 2:45:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   DP Grow up</span><hr size=1> Was there any point to start the post swearing?  No.  Her message would have been completely fine. And if I make up a new word and use it as a swear word yes it can be a swear word.  WHAT SHE MISSED IS THE DAMN POINT OF WHAT WE SAID.  IT IS ABOUT RESPECTING THAT MAYBE NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE THAT OR THAT MAYBE THEIR PARENTS DO NOT WANT THEM TO SEE THAT.  I hope that cleaned out your ears.  Yeah I swear but if I am in a store where kids may hear me I have the freaking decency not to swear because maybe their parents don't want them mimicing it.  Maybe someone that comes here does have a problem with swearing.  My god it is all about respect and if you cannot respect other peoples rights then I am sure glad that they will not respect yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=146.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
