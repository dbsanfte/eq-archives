Not only did you get a whole lot of new hot key slots, but also a lot of changes to the full screen view.  If you bought Velious you also got a new inventory screen.  <br><br>As I understand it, With Luclin they were going to get rid of the last of the old style items (like the trade screen) and maybe a few changes to other things.  I am looking forward to this indeed. (I hope they give you the ability to change the location of the casting bar and the net stats, now that we bards have the casting bar up all the time I have trouble seeing my net stats)<br><br>I too, think that they are doing a great job patching everything, as fast as possible.  I will patiently wait for the UI changes.  ( I would rather that they get the game shipped without the UI changes, like they did, than have to wait another month for the game to be released.)<br><br>Tenamin, 17singer on Firiona Vie <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umidwestpatriot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MidwestPatriot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/01 8:19:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I think Verant is doing a good job</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I think Verant has done a good job so far with this expansion and they are fixing many bugs/issues every day.  <br><br>I can not imagine another company doing a better job then they are.

The Test Server doesnt always have all the content, and with as much stuff as was done for this release (3 disc AND a ton of patching) there is NO way it was player base tested.<br><br>I have lived through the original release (started playing about 2 weeks after so missed the time of no access at all) which took about 7 months to smooth out Packet Loss problems. I have survived the release of both previous Expansions and knew that with this one there would be several days to a week of VERY poor play time.<br><br>BUT, again, this company had 2 previous expansions with the EXACT same problems with login and patcher congestion and STILL didnt think to add additional sites for patching. How hard is it to plan ahead based on previous knowledge.<br><br>I dont mind waiting for stuff that didnt get delivered with SoL, after all the new graphics and character models and advancement system are a lot of stuff, not to mention a new race, a new class and close to 30 new zones. I do NEED the new interface though. For some reason my Geforce 2 does not like to change screen sizes so when ever I do anything (trade, spell book) that reverts from full screen to old screen I suffer a 5 to 10 second blackout on each side of the change (down from 15 to 20 seconds).<br><br>No flame was intended here. I agree Verant has done a LOT and is pushing the envelope for this game. But they have a horrible track record on customer service (getting better I agree) and cant seem to remember their OWN headaches from release to release. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxyloxandkendara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xylox And Kendara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/01 11:30:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Was there supposed to be a new interface for SoL</span><hr size=1> You can probably solve that blackout problem by setting screen resolution same to ON.
