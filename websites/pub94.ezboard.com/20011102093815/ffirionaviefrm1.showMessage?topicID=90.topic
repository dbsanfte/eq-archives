<br>
If you’ve been reading this board for a while now you may have seen some ideas proposed by Cristianos Thex and me concerning setting up a server wide community of roleplaying guilds. Having seen our ideas were similar, and after getting encouraging preliminary feedback, we have got together to organize one. Below is a summary of the ideas we are hopefully going to implement.<br>
<br>
Our overall philosophy is to: -<br>
<br>
1) Inject political and diplomatic roleplaying into Everquest, alongside the character development and adventuring. <br>
2) To ensure guilds do not exist in isolation, but instead are able to work together to pull of large-scale roleplaying events.<br>
3) To create a more authentic, absorbing world for all.<br>
<br>
In order to do this we will primarily hope to improve communication within the FV community, by at the very least setting up a website (Cristianos has done this at Firionavie.tripod.com) with these philosophies in mind, and by communication with guild leaders who opt to join a “Coalition of Guilds”. Such a coalition will be used to arrange larger scale Everquest events than would be possible alone.<br>
<br>
The Coalition  of Guilds:-<br>
<br>
This will be a group of roleplay guilds working together towards similar aims. Any RP guild will be invited to join our coalition, regardless of their charter or history. When a guild joins the coalition, it will have to agree to a simple charter stating that it and its members will play within the spirit of Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
Guild leaders or representatives of each coalition guild will be expected to attend an ooc meeting in a chat room once a month to discuss any organisational issues such as amendments to the charter, or to arrange any particularly large events that will affect most coalition guilds. With events such as these, we may call for discretion on the part of representatives when discussing them outside the meeting, in order to maintain their authenticity. If the coalition becomes split upon any issue a “one guild, one vote” system will most probably be implemented, but we hope these situations will be rare.<br>
<br>
The cornerstone guilds :-<br>
<br>
The coalition may well be set up around the more elaborate aim of generating what I will refer to as “cornerstone” guilds (please forgive this term, its a little clumsy but I needed a new phrase to help me write this post). What I mean by this term is guilds that represent the foundations of a roleplaying political structure. They would represent community “hubs” round which individual races or theologies could co-ordinate their roleplay activities, and formalise their diplomatic relations with the wider world. Ultimately the planned coalition of guilds may expand to include many more than just the cornerstone guilds, but such guilds will be at the forefront of organising the coalition. If the coalition is thought of as a “guild of guilds” then the guild officers would be these cornerstone guilds.<br>
<br>
These guilds would be at their core pure roleplaying guilds, whose history is strongly tied to Norrathian history and lore. Cristianos is currently working on a Dark Elf guild, based around what we know of the Teir’dal royalty for example. <br>
<br>
The size or power of these guilds will not be a great issue, so long as they represented an influential faction, strongly adhered to Everquest’s storylines, had essentially roleplaying aims, and their leaders were dedicated enough to involve themselves in politics.<br>
Here is a list of some potential cornerstone guilds that could be set up with our ideas in mind.<br>
<br>
Neriak Royal House and Felwithe Royal House - Ultimately our idea could start working with just these two cornerstone guilds, but there is scope for as many more if people are willing.<br>
Any Other City Royal House/Local Government – like those of Neriak and Felwithe.<br>
<br>
And also some non-racial cornerstone guilds based on strong ideologies.<br>
World Trade Coalition – A guild for traders and thieves working from Freeport<br>
Human Peacekeeping Council – A UN style guild<br>
Underground Secret Order – A dark, clandestine order working for evil interests from Qeynos Sewers<br>
Protectors of the Land – A nature-worshipping guild from Surefall Glade<br>
<br>
Of course there are many other potential ideas, and these are just suggestions.<br>
<br>
The hierarchy of these might be based on Norrathian history, with the guild leaders and officer taking up positions as political leaders. For example the leaders of the Neriak Royalty guild would roleplay the Teir’dal monarchs. Alternatively, in other cornerstone guilds such as a human UN style council, the guild leaders would set themselves up to roleplay unofficial representatives of Human society. And of course quite often the rule of these leaders would be questioned and usurped by the masses, adding another crucial political roleplaying factor.<br>
<br>
Each cornerstone guild would keep in touch with each other, discussing and formalising their relationships. For instance the relationship between the Neriak and Felwithe Royalty would be one of constant state of hatred and bitterness, occasionally with a feigned offer of peace or assassination attempt from the Teir’dal. Felwithe and Freeport on the other hand might build up a strong history of peace and co-operation. Each cornerstone guild would forge alliances, declare wars and as more are created share a complex, intertwined political system. The interactions of these guilds will showcase the present political environment on Norrath, within which other political based roleplay could take place, at the level of coalition, guild or individual character.<br>
<br>
The cornerstone guilds will either communicate on an out of game messageboard or in game  in regular diplomatic meetings (once they have sufficient language skill). Only one member of each guild will have the privilege to speak at this “Global Council”, acting as an ambassador. Such activities might be mediated by a council of 6 truly neutral Tribunal worshippers, should we get chance to arrange it. Events and politics would be planned in a private ooc forum, then officialised in ic declarations of war/peace, viewable for all on the website.<br>
<br>
Cornerstone Guilds and other coalition members :-<br>
<br>
If this idea becomes really popular, each faction might be represented by several aspiring roleplay guilds, with only one being able to be the cornerstone guild. Also many people will be setting up guilds with different motivations, or who will wish to work independently from some of the cornerstone guild plans, but still retaining strong ties with this serverwide guild co-operation. Whatever the situation, we intend to create the coalition of guilds as a wider organisation, with more than simply cornerstone guilds. The cornerstones will simply act as a focal point for several similar guilds with similar political interests.<br>
<br>
This is where the cornerstone guilds will have another, crucial role to fulfil on FV. They will not exist in isolation from other non-cornerstone guilds, but instead will take up a central role in coordinating the interaction of them between one another. <br>
<br>
Any other guilds that are part of the coalition will be encouraged to set up diplomatic relationships with one or more cornerstone guilds. These relationships may be good or bad, but always representing a strong connection between the guild and the cornerstone. For instance a Dark Elf guild might use diplomatic channels to establish complex relationships such as strong ties to the Neriak Royals or friendly alliance with the Ogre Warcouncil. So the Teir’dal cornerstone would keep them well informed of their events and the Ogre Council would call them up in times of great trouble. <br>
<br>
Another Dark elf guild however, might disagree strongly with the way the royalty handles the politics of Neriak. This relationship might involve them reluctantly helping them, whilst always trying to undermine their hold over other guilds. Eventually the relationship might decline into civil war, where they even try to overthrow the monarchs of the cornerstone guild.<br>
<br>
These guild relationships will be discussed and maintained in a similar way to the cornerstones global forum mentioned above. Forums for local diplomacy would be set up at each cornerstone guild website.<br>
<br>
Some of the events this system could help organize: -<br>
<br>
Multi-Guild raids – In its simplest form the cornerstone would keep affiliated guilds in contact with one another in order to help create successful raids.<br>
Guild Wars – A very important part of what were planning. The cornerstone guilds will have the role of creating a suitable political atmosphere in which war between two or more guilds could take place. Most of the events the coalition will set up will be based around complex multi-guild warfare (At present the /guildwar function is more limited than would be ideal for this - we may press Verant to make some simple adjustments to the rules on FV)<br>
Racial/religious festivals – On Norrath, festivals are the main chance adventurers get to unwind. Many races would hold annual festivals together in their home cities, and the cornerstones could organise many guilds to participate in them together. It is possible that such events would take place based on the in game calendar and could incorporate everything from inter-guild tournaments to language fairs.<br>
Roleplay events – The coalition gives a prime opportunity to create roleplaying events that are complex and political in nature. From the assassination of kings to the signing of peace treaties, it could create more depth and continuing storylines, open to the participation of all.<br>
<br>
Of course the coalition would not keep a monopoly on arranging large events. Even if your guild is not particularly interested in interacting with the cornerstone guilds, there will still be the opportunity to contact them about events you are planning, as a way of publicising and gaining support for it. <br>
<br>
Here’s a simple example of how things might come together in a storyline, and what in game events might be arranged to roleplay it over a few weeks: -<br>
<br>
The Tier’dal Royal House pay a large sum of platinum to the Norrathian Order of Thieves to assassinate the Koa’dal Royals (secret diplomatic event). But one elven guild has affiliations with the Felwithe Royals, and the Thieves Order, and obtains information about the assassination, and stops it just in time (a high profile duel during a Felwithe Royal Ceremony). By saving the High elves, the guild gains high praise and a celebration in its honour by all the guilds that support the elven monarchy (Festival event in Kelethin), but is driven from the Thieves Order in disgust (chain of guildwar events between several elven allied guilds and thief allied guilds). <br>
<br>
The eventual hope would be that politics permeated down to the character level. For example a wood elf might roleplay a falling out with a rogue friend over the situation described above. It would give characters something to discuss once the talk about the characters biography has been exhausted. Events might inspire a character into a crusade against a certain race, or influence what motivates them in their adventure.<br>
<br>
We intend to keep as much adaptability as possible in our setup to help encourage support from a range of people, and to allow for the inevitable changes that will occur on FV over its lifetime. Cornerstone guilds may rises and fall, alliances made and broken, and elven blood may be split. We also intend to keep consensus and democracy as core factors when setting up this, to prevent any guild running rampant and trying to tell others what to do. Every guild that joins the coalition of guilds will have equal rights, and we will try to ensure that any hierarchy in the system is kept to a minimum, whilst people on “power trips” are prevented from spoiling other gamer’s fun.<br>
<br>
So if you –<br>
<br>
1) Are making a guild that would fit as one of the cornerstone guilds<br>
2) Would like to be part of a cornerstone guild<br>
3) Have a guild that would be interested in a joining the coalition of guilds and developing strong relationships with the cornerstone guilds.<br>
4) Want to contribute in any other way<br>
5) Have comments, good or bad, about our ideas<br>
Then contact us at the e-mails addresses shown, or post below. We need as much feedback as physically possible in order to gauge the level of support and interest in this idea, and adjust the scale of our plans accordingly. <br>

I do however see its also going to provide alot of work.<br>
<br>
I know this is something the fist would definitely eat up. Our history is located on www.1stfistoflight.com. It is more popularly known as Bloody Kithicor, but it was how it transpired where I played and those events lead to the culmination of the 1st Fist of Light being formed as a result. We are the army that stood to defend Lanys from her armies at Bloody Kithicor and chose to remain in existance to continue to fight evils knowing &quot;something&quot; was afoot, just unsure what.<br>
<br>
Hence our &quot;crusades&quot; began and we started to investigate the affairs of Norrath. Hence we uncovered the plot of the Bloodsabres to overthrow Qeynos and summon the Avatar of the Plaguebringer. We have also discovered and continued to peruse Norrath adventuring to uncover other tales that lead us elswhere upon adventures.<br>
<br>
One concern I have, what do you do when one guild develops an issue with another or one guild for whatever the reason refuses outright to have any interaction with the other? Then what?<br>
<br>
Secondly guilds in and of themselves have their own internal logistical issues to contend with. Something to consider, this council although a wonderfull idea, will also be an &quot;added agenda&quot; on the list of respective guildleaders to deal with. I for one know that I am going to be very busy, I am already busy alone just making preperatory plans for the fist reformation as it stands.<br>
<br>
Are we interested in being apart of this? Absolutely, consider our hat thrown in with the lot.<br>

<br>
Your first concern :-<br>
I'm not sure how we'll handle this as yet. *Hopefully* such cases will be rare but maybe something should go in the charter about this.<br>
Your second concern :-<br>
One of the purposes of what I call the &quot;cornerstone&quot; guilds will be handling the extra workload that this generates. These guilds will be set up on the understanding that the extra oppurtunities they get will come with responsibilities, and their structures will probably geared to dealing with the workload. So these guilds will be delagated with most of any extra work there is.<br>
I would encourage the creation of a diplomatic officer in your guild, who is soley delagated to communicate with the coalition.<br>
Also, I don't see the most complex ideas being implemented for a while, at least not till after the fuss of guild creation/recruitment has died down.<br>
<br>

I think your concerns are valid; however, I view the Coalition of Guilds as a whole, to be Norrath's version of the UN.<br>
<br>
Many nations within the UN do not interact with certain other nations but it still functions (somewhat.)<br>
<br>
Take for example the United States and the USSR during the cold war.  Both exsisted in the UN as part of the security council. Both had veto power in the council. But, we co-exsisted somewhat peacefully for 40 - 50 years.<br>
<br>
I can see the same happening in Norrath. My guild might not like your guild, might not interact with your guild and might even go to war with your guild.<br>
<br>
Both guilds would still exist in the Council of Guilds although I would hope that some actions, whether it be peace talks, sanctions or even talks of removing one or the other could occur.<br>
<br>
To not have disagreements between guilds, at least to me, would not be natural.<br>

<br>
If two guilds disagree in character the coalition would cope well with these disputes. It will be a Norrathian forum for diplomatic talks between factions, and we would never expect all the factions to agree at all on many things. After all some will be mortal enemies. <br>
Most friendships and alliances will exist as smaller agreements between indiviual groups of guilds, and not nescarrily throughout them all. For a quick example the &quot;good&quot; factions might rally behind the Human and High Elf guilds, whilst the &quot;Evil&quot; factions would back Neriak and Cabalis, with both always being in a state of war with one another. Some factions might try to broker peace between them.<br>
All alignments would be welcome in the coalition, and in character disputes between guilds will be set up and arranged ooc as part of its organisation and the roleplay.<br>
<br>
But I took Banegrivm to mean out of character disputes, such as if one guild accused the other of encouraging greifing or non-Roleplaying. Then they might refuse to co-operate with them till they were removed from the coalition. This could cause some serious problems if we can't find an appriopriate way to deal with it.<br>
<br>
Just thought I should make that distinction to reduce any confusion. We shall be dealing with both ooc and ic situations, which can cause a little communication difficulty. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=buxton>buxton</A> at: 10/1/01 8:12:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D1C3B5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/01 7:54:14 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *Coalition of Guilds - Read Me*</span><hr size=1> Bix and Sav, again I totally agree.

<br>
One thing that would be cool, IMO, is in the assassination attempts. But, you have the problem of it not being a PvP server. So how would events such as that be handled? Would members of guilds be required to turn in their Tome of Discord?<br>
<br>
Maybe VI could add a new command&quot;/pvp&quot; that lets you toggle PvP for the purpose of these events (or mass wars, etc).<br>
<br>
It would also be cool if we could have a closer &quot;line of communication&quot; with VI and we could request certain things be changed with the server. For example, if the Dwarves monopolized the alcohol industry/trade, we could petition (or something) to VI to have alcoholic beverages be removed from vendors (or the price raised considerably). And then any PC caught selling alcohol without paying a hefty tax to the Dwarves would be smitten (and smitten good!) lol. With the ability to do things such as that, it would make the RP experience much more immersive, and actually make the Guilds a bit more involved in the world.<br>
<br>
Ok, that went off on a tangent. Sorry :P<br>

Also, I am working on a Guild Management System ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.databound-software.com">www.databound-software.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> - it still has a *ways* to go), and hopefully I can get it finished sometime :P If so, we could probably host guilds on firiona-vie.com (if Christianos takes me up on the offer to use the server) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>

<br>
As for the organization or the coalition, it seems more to me that it is more of an out of character organization than an in character one.  The cornerstones would likely have alliances with their allied guilds, so the only in character bind would be the aforementioned 'UN council'.  My idea is to have a cornerstone guild to head up the aforementioned UN tribunal, and that cornerstone's allied guilds would be various reconaissance or peacekeeping guilds.<br>
<br>
This goes to my next topic, which is sort of secondary to the coalition itself, but could have a great impact.  Guild alignment structure.  The Neutral Tribunals that oversee the UN is a great idea, but it may be a more fair if the head council consisted of all three neutral alignments (N, NG, NE).  In order to have them as part of the same organization, however, Verant would have to implement a guild code that would not only allow a Good/Neutral or Neutral/Evil guild, but may allow an Orderly/Neutral or Discordant/Neutral, or perhaps simply an Orderly, Neutral, or Discordant Guild.  This would allow a much greater customization.<br>
<br>
For example, a Trade organization would most likely have little need for good or evil if it truly wishes to trade in every city, but order would be a great concern for them.  A peacekeeping guild would more likely have to be orderly (for keeping society in place) or neutral (to provide several viewpoints of good and evil, but to not have favoritism).<br>
<br>
I will be posting this idea to the Dev boards for consideration, and hope that others find this an interesting enough concept to also join me.  By the way, what is the e-mail for this sort of input?  I want to make sure my opinion is at least seen.<br>
<br>
Thank you, and hopefully this all works out.  It goes much deeper than anything else on any other server, and provides a great environment for us to role-play in. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uspinnerofmoonshadow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spinner of Moonshadow</A> at: 10/1/01 1:35:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D1C3B5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=calrathan>Calrathan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/01 2:07:38 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=EQ000052.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *Coalition of Guilds - Read Me*</span><hr size=1> I was thinking of starting a guild dedicated to thieves and the god Bristlebane...but im not particuarly good at HTML so I don't know how I would do a website.

A gang of thieves could have a lot of use to such a coalition.  As noted, you could be hired out as spies or assasins.  Or if more dedicated to thieving, you could set up Black Market contacts with the World Trade cornerstone to fence off items you've... 'acquired.'  And we may not feel safe sitting next to you, so we'd have to watch our purse.  Then again, you don't have to mention what you are.  Just attach yourself to a part of the coalition, under another guise and you'd be hired by that area for work or do your own contracts.  It is also entirely possible for you to set up your own cornerstone to form a thieves' alliance in the coalition.<br>
<br>
And the webpage shouldn't be that much of a problem.  Either find somebody in your guild skilled in HTML, or learn how to use a quick homepage maker, such as Frontpage (though I shudder to mention anything made by MircoSuck).

To anyone who anyone with a guild wishing to join, i'll stick up a list in the guild section for you which i'll modify. Post after that with your guild description etc.<br>
I would assume that any website related ideas should be e-mailed to cristianos as she is starting up a communty website where this coalition will run from. Thoughts about its structure are best aimed at me.<br>
<br>
Heres some quick comments on the above posts<br>
Dinaek - i was probably thinking that assassinations would be made using the /guildwar function. The leaders would arrange it without telling  most of the participates, and then during a major event a group of high level assassins would infiltrate near to the victims. When they attack, all chaos would break loose...<br>
I agree with keeping close contact with VI. We should be able to work with them in organising GM events for example. I'll probably contact them once we have a few more arrangements in place.<br>
<br>
Spinner - Having seen what you and others have written about the ooc and ic organisation, I could probably adjust the overall in character structure slightly :-<br>
A neutral tribunal team (probably barb shamans) of 6 would run a human guild. The guild would probably be made up of all neutrals, with its primary goals being the creation of order, justice and peace. They will head the UN style world guild council, which tries to encourage world trade and relations. A good bit of storyline could be made to explain how this would come about.<br>
This council would call together the chief representatives of each faction - the &quot;cornerstone&quot; guilds. Each would report  the opinions of their allied guilds and other political events, and the events discussed. <br>
Calrathan - By nature the council would inculde a cornerstone from every major faction idea - even thieves, as the tribunal leaders would want to bring order to all, and of course thieves would be a primary target for this plan.<br>
<br>
Other guilds would not have a direct prescence in the global council, but instead have to influence world events by putting their support behind the which ever cornerstone represented them best. This might suit a lot of guilds with unusual charters not nescarily related to any specific faction (for instance a guild involving many different races under its own agenda) They would be the crucial &quot;floating vote&quot;.<br>
<br>
That seems a good basis for the in character organisation. The ooc one should be less hierarchical I think, with all discussing ideas and going of a consensus of opinion. I don't believe the in character supreme leaders should hold those positions ooc.<br>
<br>
Kyaeil - this brings me onto your point on how to avoid destructive politics. Comments and suggestions on this would be useful if you have them, as they are the major worry in this system.<br>
<br>
Feiht - I would consider any druidic environmental political faction would welcome halflings, and keep a stong tie with the RV faction. But halflings would also have good ties with dwarfs and gnomes, whose mining and technology would be against nature. Such suballiances will make this very interesting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=buxton>buxton</A> at: 10/1/01 3:32:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#D1C3B5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=calrathan>Calrathan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/01 3:36:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=EQ000052.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *Coalition of Guilds - Read Me*</span><hr size=1> Good idea, I think if I make a guild it will be a combination of thieves and assasins alike.

Well I think this sounds like an incredible idea IF it has the organizers dont get totally burned out.. I would love to support it with Dante's Inferno, but would like to see that you have a good team of support first. I honestly think that just setting up our guilds at first will probably be a lot of work, maybe the coalition should come along in 3 months once the guids are alittle more establuished and have defined some character. I would also think that the organizers should themselves not be guild leaders because IMHO guild leading is more than taxing enough.<br>

Averes - A ligitimate point about workload. Theres no point planning all this and getting sick of it 2 months later.
