<br>
I just spent a day doing the (or trying I should say) Shaman (Vah Shir) quest line. If I had done it here on Firiona Vie I would not be able to complete it alone. <br>
<br>
My shaman is now 6 and has not finished the part to make the container for Merchant. Why? Because you need brewing skill ( at 10 points I finally managed to make the 2 sweet water but they were not trivial), you need  pottery skill ( I have failed 8 times trying to make the pottery part so far, including twice at the firing part).<br>
<br>
I twinked my cat with leather armor and  a fine steel Mace also about 20 PP. which means I had what I needed to raise my brewing skill to 10 before I even tried to make sweet water. Which saved me a lot of Xakra bile for the second part.<br>
<br>
The dogged insistance by you and others that these LOW level CLASS and RACE specific quests are not affected in a nearly undoable way by TLC (notice I didnt say impossible, since they are doable, of course making love to an elephant is doable to, but I wouldnt want to try) is a red herring. <br>
<br>
I killed Xakra larvae in the pit (only hunted in the pit). I killed the beetles in the pit ( I paid for the hairless hopper hides by the way) I had to kill skeletons in the pit when they attacked me. And I killed (finally at 3 and above though tough at 3) Scorpions. I managed to find 12 Xakra Bile and 13 Scorpion blood (all no drop, so effected by TLC) You need both. plus water to try and make sweet water BY 6th level 90 percent or more of the non scorpions are light blue. Meaning effected by TLC, since Light blue at 5 and 6 give NO experience ( a requirement to get items effected by TLC).<br>
<br>
What is my point?  The MAJORITY of new players will NOT be able to do these quests because TLC will be involved at lvl 5 and above. Unless of course you think every newbie has access to 20 PP (never mind the armor and weapon they arent that important , though do effect survival). <br>
<br>
Now I agree if you wait untill someone posts all the ways to do the quest ahead of time AND you avoid all the skeletons AND you get lucky at brewing and pottery AND you get lucky with the rare drops AND you group with NO ONE  AND you put off the acyrlia quest till absolutely neccassary for the quest (it raises you to almost 2 and is required just to get the quests started) AND you wait for the ground spawn on the mud AND you put 10 points of your training in Brewing AND you put 10 Points (though even at 10 I fail every attempt ) in Pottery (a skill I might add you are NOT warned you need ) AND somehow you get the needed cash (without hunting any mobs but the quest mobs) to buy the water (needed for brewing and for pottery) and for the firing sheets (needed for pottery) you might succeed at getting the container made, but I havent found out what the next step is, nor what other potentially trivial mobs (at 6 mind you) I still have to kill for quest stuff.<br>
<br>
Dont come here and claim that TLC when it effects such low level, class and race specific quests fosters ANYTHING good. The Vah Shir quests are examples of WHY TLC needs to be tweeked, but it wont ever be cause it was abandoned. <br>
<br>
Where does a newbie Vah Shir get the money to buy ANYTHING from other newbie Vah Shir? Go hunt there and sell there and see how much cash you aquire while strictly sticking to quest mobs. AND what of bags? They arent cheap either, All the ones I bought cost 2 to 10 gold, money you need to save (if questing and not twinking) for the water and firing sheets (and forget armor till after 6)?  Cant do the bag quests because that will level you into a TLC problem to fast. Oh wait I know use the parially devoured cloth bags that drop in the pit, of course the only hold TINY stuff.  And did I mention the mud does not stack? SO you have 16 slots (counting bank) to accomplish all this with and NO armor and NO new spells except the two you started with (since each 1st level spell costs 1 plus gold and most 5th level spells cost 5 to 6 gold.<br>
<br>
But rant on how GOOD TLC is and that NO quest is every made impossible by the LOVED TLC. Bury your head in the sand an pretend that it fosters roleplay and enhances the low level quests by making them so hard to do nearly no one can accomplish them with out help. And INSIST loudly and constantly that no quest is impossible to do cause it is TECHNICALLY possible to accomplish it. <br>
<br>
Ignore all the posts about low level quests and dismiss all the posts with specifics on why quests dont work with out help. Dismiss all us &quot;whiners and complainers&quot; as mad power Gamers , bent on gaining levels fast and not questing (though every post IS about a quest). Yup I am a MAD POWER GAMER that MUST have thet SUPER UBER Vah Shir class item   (you know the one that is designed to be done at low level). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/5/02 1:11:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> Chip,<br>
<br>
Now you are just going back to the same old tired cries of saying that not everyone needs / deserves to get every item. What does that have to do with the issue we are discussing? You asked for an example and I think I gave you one.<br>
<br>
Your right, not everyone should be able to get every item in this game. Thats why Verant developed faction. Bane can explain how faction would prevent folks from doing quests and getting items. There are also Diety specific items, class specific items and race specific items. None of these have anything to do with the TLC arguements.<br>
<br>
Not everyone will get their epic. Thats a fact on ANY server. However, the oppourtunity to get an epic (or do any quest for that matter) IS presented to every player. If a player WANTS to do their epic (or any quest for that matter) they should be allowed to and not stymied by code that is not well thought out.<br>
<br>
In the dwarven paladin example I gave above (which I noticed you didn't respond too), I doubt there would be anyone who would consider that reasonable. If you can't acknowledge THAT then perhaps we will never be able to agree on this issue.<br>

Twotribes, why?  I have never said that, I have never said the TLC is not difficult/problem.  <br>
<br>
I have only stated that it is not 'bugged', broken, impossible.<br>

Twotribes,<br>
<br>
Perhaps you are just not a very good gamer if your not twinked or have lots of plats?<br>
<br>
I do not know many players that needed 20pp and a full set of leather armour at level 5 to attempt to complete their quests or survive hunting in the Level 1 newbie area (the Pit).<br>
<br>
1) I managed to perform my beastlord quests without the need to TWINK or spend more than possbily 2p at level 5.  <br>
<br>
2) I have seen a number of various other players do the same. (look at the ratio of players that HAVE completed these quests or are able to hunt in the pit without full sets of leathers).<br>
<br>
3) I had seen numerous hairless hopper hides drop and on merchants when I was hunting in the pit.  I still can find alteast one per day if I check the merchants periodically.<br>
<br>
4) I have seen both Xakra Bile and Scopion Blood on the merchants almost daily.  In fact I have actully seen Hopper claws, hopper hides, Xakra teeth, Hopper eggs and other 'quest' items all on merchants.<br>
<br>
5) I actually put training points into my 'tradeskill' to help with success rates (did this at level 5).  If you did not know, you can train up to skill 20.<br>
<br>
6)  I lost my cloak and had to repeat the first level Beastlord quest at level 17.  I was able to get the items I needed by checking merchants and bartering with Lower players in the pit.<br>
<br>
It might simply be that your basing your tactics on 'Items + Money&quot; might not be the best approach when dealing with the TLC (and thus would explain your unhappiness with it).  <br>
<br>
So, again, the TLC is not the problem.  The TLC is not 'bugged' or 'insanely difficult'.   The problem is the mind set of the player.  <br>
<br>
Try 'Thinking outside of the box' to solve a problem, rather than simply rant about how it is broken.<br>

Plat for newbies on Luclin:  All over the place in Shadeweavers.  Kill hoppers.  The higher level ones drop claws which can sell for as much as 3 plat.  Chitterlings are a bit tougher, and require a magic weapon (do your quests and you'll get one, or kill poachers for one) but they uncommonly drop 'glowing chitterling wing' which sells for over a plat.  Go into the first cavern of Paludal out of Shadeweavers and collect mushrooms.  They're ground spawn and sell for 2 gold plus to the vendors.  and they stack.  Kill hoppers for scales and either sell them or turn them in for armor.  Skeletal Hunters drop up to a plat (got a plat off one already).  All the lesser shades drop shadowsilk commonly, which you can use to make shadesilk armor.<br>
<br>
The newbie quests are hard.  No doubting that.  But you only need to do them if you want to run the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons.  You can run the other quests in Shadeweavers to make seriously NICE armor (better than any other newbie armor out there) and incredible newbie weapons.<br>
<br>
Luclin zones are about quests.  Don't want to do the newbie ones?  You don't have to.  There are still incredible items to be acquired via quests in Shadeweavers.  There are more quests to be had in Hollowshade which haven't even been found yet.<br>

So with that in mind I would like to challenge you directly.<br>
<br>
First, please let us know that if you think the paladin example I gave above is reasonable, or unreasonable of Verant to expect players to go through.<br>
<br>
Second, define the word &quot;bug&quot; for us, or &quot;broken&quot;. See, in the ASP company I work for, something can be bugged or broken if it is &quot;not working as intended&quot;. If that is your definition as well, then many of these examples are indeed broken because it would be absolute insanity for us to think verant intended to create situations like they have for some of these players.<br>
<br>
I would be happy to answer any challenges you would like to put before me with regards to TLC if you will answer mine.<br>
<br>
Edit: Here is a real world example<br>
<br>
Microsoft word 2000 had an issue where sometimes the page numbering would not be correct. Folks that use it alot will know what I am talking about. Well, its not impossible to get around this. You could number the pages manually and the feature didnt always fail, but by your defintion this wouldnt be broken or a bug. It sure is by mine.<br>

<br>
Do I consider your Dwarven example a &quot;broken&quot; quest example? Good lord no! What you describe is perfectly feasible.<br>
<br>
A good guild (and, I'm looking for one, I'm not happy with my present one at all) will host language fairs (mine does, for that matter. If you haven't gotten to excellent in another language by level 20, your doing something wrong. I got to very good in Elvish in the Warrens simply by grouping with any elf I saw. <br>
<br>
But, thats just one example. What you describe is merely frustrating, its not broken. <br>
<br>
I do think that the TLC needs tweaking. Has it broken any quests? I haven't seen any examples given yet of a broken quest. <br>
<br>
I got a barnacle breastplate at level 11. To get that, you have to kill a diseased shark (blue at 11), then loot an item affected by the TLC. When the shark dies, it spawns around 4 tiny sharks, which also drop an item affected by the Trivial Loot code - and you have to be level 5 or below to get those items! Is this quest broken by the TLC? Course not. I just hired a level 4 (had to go to qeynos to get him) and had him kill the tiny sharks for me. <br>
<br>
I am going to do this quest again - even though the shark is now green to me. I'll simply have to hire a level 11, and a level 4. It only took me about 4 days to find a level four willing to do the job last time. Broke? No. Difficult? Yes. <br>
<br>
Your example with Word is spot on. Under normal circumstances, that page numbering is broke. Under the rules of FV - which are abundantly clear on their web site, it isn't, because you have a clear work around (manually numbering the pages.). Sure its more work, but thats the point of FV - to make the game more challenging, and thus more fun.<br>

Your post kind of lends strength to my arguement (in a twisted sort of way). This goes back to &quot;what is reasonable&quot;. To use your own words, is creating situations as &quot;frustrating&quot; as the paladin example acceptable? More importantly is it what Verant intended? <br>
<br>
I dont think it is because we can assume that what verant intended would have been based on server population and I think its safe to say  FV's server population did not meet Verant's expectations. A larger population would have supported more player interaction and an economy. The lack of the expected population is causing these &quot;frustrating&quot; situation to be more difficult than expected. This is why we are asking them to tweak TLC.<br>

<br>
No, I do not think this is unreasonable.  I would consider the 'quillamane' cloak for the mage epic closer to unreasonable, but I don't expect that to change, nor do I consider 'Quillamane' to be bugged, or broken.  It's just a major pain to get.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  See, in the ASP company I work for, something can be bugged or broken if it is &quot;not working as intended <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Firstly, I provide two very specific examples of 'bugs'.  Notice that they are not subject to 'opinion' of whether or not they work, the simply 'DO NOT WORK'.  So I basically define a bug as 'NOT WORKING'.    But lets use your definition of &quot;NOT WORKING AS INTENTED&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As I said, it's not a bad thing if items become more rare on this server. In fact, I'd call it a good thing. Players on this server might have to adjust and accept that just because they want &lt;quest item in question&gt; does not mean that they will ever get it. I would love to see a server where the items that people think of as 'required' are sometimes just not obtainable. People will quickly discover that those items aren't as indispensable as they think they are. And people that have such items will be that much more unique. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The above is a quote from the SONY DEVELOPMENT BOARD from ABSOR.  Thus, in your above senerio, the TLC is working as expected.<br>
<br>
Ok, I have answered your two challenges.  Now please attempt to focus and answer my one simple challenge.<br>
<br>
Are there any examples of TLC Bugs (not working as intended by VI, not the player) that would warrent the Removal of the TLC??<br>

Just that it be re-examined to prevent fustrating incidents like the example I gave (and the othr quests folks have brought up).<br>
<br>
You're not differntiating between what is intentionally difficult (rares like the AC and Quillmane) and what has been become unintentionally difficult because of TLC.  The quote you used from Verant ASSUMES all of their conditions have been met, which they have not, unless you belive that Verant intended the server population to be so low. Don't tell me you believe thats what they intended to? If you believe that it was Verant's intention to have TLC create these kind of conditions for their players on this server  than there will be no arguement in the world that I can to convince you otherwise.<br>
<br>
Using the definition we have agreed upon I strongly believe that these issues submitted by folks are indeed proof that TLC has &quot;broken&quot;  some quests.<br>
