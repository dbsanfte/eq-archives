the reason was to slow down competition, at the time I'm not sure how I felt abuot it, but it's pretty obvious to me now how rash of a decision it is, due to the 5 or so guilds (which don't include BoW or the guild they were trying to slow down) that have to rummage through the post-wakening zone<br>

It seems like the upper end guilds on this server are rather responsible, so if they choose to do it, I'm sure it will be done responsibly (i.e. let everyone know approximately when so they can be around for it). Thanks for doing the research on this subject Rollen - proves you guys care about the server more than 'other' aspects of the game.<br>
I think VI might put the Gnome mask and perhaps some of the other pre-awake ST gear back in with PoP. I don't think Primals will make a reappearance in their previous form, but there is really no reason for them to take out the Gnome mask etc. This is of course all conjecture tho.<br>
<br>
PS Lacus, I was kinda dissappointed hearing you say that BoW's reason for waking the Sleeper was to hold competing guilds back. I was from Torv and I remember you playing on Torv - people always accused BoW of doing what you confirmed but I didn't really believe it - thought it was all just mudslinging. Oh well, not like it matters, I will probably never play on Torv again - I like this community better. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxxgreydawnxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XxGreydawnxX</A> at: 9/23/02 9:43:50 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxreynnx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>x Reynn x</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 9:52:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> I believe Verant stated that if the Sleeper was still asleep on the server when the change went through, then it would still stay asleep.

<br>
Congrats on killing Ventani.  Great accomplishment.<br>
<br>
What other people did on other servers is left on other servers.  I'm sure many of us have our own reasons for coming to this server and we should leave it at that.<br>
<br>
Wake the sleeper or not, it is up to Reso.  They can kill the 4th and can decide it's faith.  Everyone pretty much knows the real reason that you would wake the sleeper, and you acting naive about it is a bit amussing.  I'm sure you understand the server backlash for waking the sleeper.  Try to find a way to stop any other guild from getting primals easily and still have the server think that waking the sleeper was a good thing.  There have been many post already stating that getting prismatic is way more difficult (new ST) than getting primal (old ST).<br>
<br>
Once again, I say congrats on the kill and the choice is up to you.  Don't skirt around your intentions and you should tell the server why you really want to wake the sleeper.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urubisthenome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rubis the Nome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 9:56:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> I think waking the sleeper is a terribly bad idea personally.  If you like masks of tinkering and scepters of destruction at least.  I mean, I think Solusek Ro has 3-6 masks and about 4-8 scepters.  Also has 3 at the very least guilds that could handle all the warders at this point and probably more if there weren't issues getting everyone keys.  But the primary first biggest uber guild went in before others had a chance practically and woke him up leaving a ruined zone.  It did get them N ToV to themselves until they were done getting everyone in the entire guild equipped, but hurt the server as a whole.  Its even worse to do it here since primals are droppable.  Just my two cents. <p><p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373025>Rubis<BR></p></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 378<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 10:50:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> Actually Rubis it is better here since primals are dropable. People do not actually need to go into ST to get primal and I am sure a few people will just ebay them once they are over prolific. Also people saying that the new revamped ST warders are more difficult than the current ones have not fought the current warders since the resist patch. First is about the same as he was, but 2nd and 3rd got alot more difficult. I am not sure sure about 4th getting tougher or not since we never tried 4th till after the resist upgrade.<br>

If we do wake the sleeper I will probably hold a lottery of some sort for the gnome mask I have in the bank for all the non-gnome bards and rogues that are 55th+.

normal warder clearing takes ~30 mins for 1-2 SoDs, 3-4 1h primals (and 2hers, other trinkets like gnome mask)<br>

post-awakening sleeper takes about 45 mins - 1 hour for prog and MotG, about 50% chance overall for ONE 1h primal...maybe 25% for 1hp, and even lower for 1hb...shrouds, SoDs gone permanently, replaced by gimp prismatic scales quests ... oh and if you're desperate for primal, as most guilds are in ST after awakening, you can take an hour and a half or two hours to clear down to FA for a small chance at another primal<br>

You can't take a newbie raid force into new ST.  Anything past MotG on the way down to FA and warders takes forever in new ST.  Not just 1-2H, but 4-6H just to reach the FA.  There are new mini-bosses along the way that drop AP, too.  Then you have the new warders to deal with.  New ST is tons harder.  The only good thing about it is that AP drops off all kinds of stuff, not just MotG and Prog.  You can also get ancient spells from things (ultra rare).<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone has completed any of the quests yet in new ST, so people are still unsure if there is anything worthwhile there.  They all seem relatively long, though -- collect drops from all across the zone and then hand them in.<br>
<br>
I don't think any guild on FV is ready to take on the new ST and from a pure risk v. reward aspect, there is no reason to do so.  New ST is a lot more work for roughly the same or poorer items.  The only reason to do the wakeup, IMHO, is to see if VI did a new nifty transition script.  If they did, it would be a really fun thing to experience.  Well, the new ST is a fun zone-crawl type of raid, but when I do that much work I like to see nice stuff dropping for people, not &quot;sorry, pass, I have better&quot;.  NTOV is a lot more fun and a lot more rewarding than new ST. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Commoner's Chevalier</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 1:03:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> Maybe someone should try to ask Verant the question...of whether waiting to wake will make a difference... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 2:11:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Waking the Sleeper</span><hr size=1> If ancient spells drop in the new ST then you can not expect Reso to leave Kerafyrm asleep for long after the new revamp is available.<br>

<br>
They aren't.  The Developers have posted that if your sleeper is asleep, the zone will stay the same.  That reason is now gone.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If the server gets more out of the game by keeping him asleep then I will push for keeping him asleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yah, warder loot is still some of the best, unreplacable loot in the game.  The fact that Shroud of Longevity is still the best monk chest peice even including VT should tell you something.  There are plenty of reasons to keep him asleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am posting on some other boards that have developers browsing often hoping for somebody connected to fill us in on what will happen. Everything else is just guessing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Considering the Developers have made an official post, it's not guessing.<br>
<br>
&quot;If ancient spells drop in the new ST then you can not expect Reso to leave Kerafyrm asleep for long after the new revamp is available.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is a very lame reason Rollen.  You have obviously heard about levels 61-65 being added into the game.  Ancient spells are now obsolete.  Just wait until PoP comes out and you will get all the level 61-65 spells you need.<br>
<br>
Now, considering Coinfist has made a public statement that Resolution will *NEVER* wake the Sleeper, I feel confident that they won't.<br>

I think one ancient spell has dropped there since it went live on SH and it wasn't for us, so I don't know for sure -- anecdotal report only.

To block Fire and Fury and Awakened Souls at the chance for 4th warder loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uramuhthunderclap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramuh Thunderclap</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/02 4:54:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, as to ..</span><hr size=1> Actually Viren I dont know about all classes ancient spells, but for mages the best pet haste spell is Ancient : Burnout V and there is nothing better then it in PoP listed at this time. and yes having a spell that buffs your pet for 80% haste and +atk is way better then a 65% haste. <br>
