Soloing is easy ( well not difficult ), although I usually have a cleric that likes to tag along with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Plus, gnomes are just oh so CUTE!<br>
<br>
Oh and did I mention that you can buff not only melee but casters?  Clarity and Haste are very nice buffs to assist any group!  Mezzing comes in handy as well....especially in dungeons!  Jewel craft has been expensive so far, but the benefit of making my own jewelry has paid off!  Not to mention that even the lower end rings and such still do bring a profit. Plus the new armor quests are pretty nice considering you don't have to be level 50 to get them!  Ahhh so many benefits, so little time!<br>
<br>
Must be going now...gotta get my next spell level so I can have an endless supply of mana!  *cackle*<br>

You have access to the vast majority of spell effects, in addition to having a huge number of spells per level, so you'll find yourself shifting between spell sets and blowing a large chunk of cash on spells. Combine this with the fact that getting a fair share of the loot may be difficult, depending on the group, and you can expect to be low on cash quite often. You can also expect to be low on mana, as everyone will demand something of you that will make balancing things difficult; once you get Augmentation at 29, the constant expenditure of mana for hastes will be reduced, but the expense of your slows and buffs will more than make up for it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Enchanters are primarily a defensive support class, much like a Cleric. Due to the fact that, if you're good, you can turn a deathtrap into an easily winnable situation, you'll rarely lack the opportunity to group. Soloing is more difficult, especially if you don't have an extremely high Charisma, as your primary mechanism for soloing is Charm. You can, of course, use the classic &quot;root-and-nuke&quot; method, but the fact that your direct damage spell line (the *one* direct damage spell line we get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is all-or-nothing, easily resistable, and inflicts precious little damage while having a stun component for that extra bit of taunting will make this path difficult. The Animations help, but they're easily destroyed if nothing else is there to help them. This is a function of the fact that an Enchanter's job is to improve the efficiency of the group, not to destroy their foes.<br>
<br>
So, as much as I love playing my Enchanter, I have to admit it's an acquired taste. If you like grouping, don't mind dying (Enchanters and Clerics tend to be the first people to die, mostly because of the aggro levels of their spells and the fact that they're chain-casting them), and have a very high situational awareness, you might like the class. If you want to be the character who stands out in the forefront, taking the enemy down with your magics or melee, a Druid or Shaman would be best of the four classes you mentioned. If you want to be constantly asked into groups, Druids and Clerics are quite popular because of SoW and powerful healing/resurrections, respectively.<br>
<br>
I can offer more advice on enchanting if you want; Illudin is now in the 30th circle of mysteries, and I'm more than happy to answer questions about the class both in and out of character. It's a tricky class to play, but depending on what you want to play, it can be very rewarding. <p>Illudin Arbitrator &lt;Society of Adventurers&gt;<br>

Also, my biggest complaint as a Druid was the constant downtime to regen mana, unless I had a breeze or clarity.  I had hoped having constant access to breeze or clarity would solve that with the enchanter, but it sounds like that may not be the case.  Have they done anything else in the last 10 months to reduce mana downtime for casters?<br>
<br>
I'm leaning toward the Shaman, if only because I already have a Druid.  I've been reading that neutrality allows you to group with anyone, which seems like an advantage.  <br>
<br>
The official site mentions an exp bonus or penalty depending on alignment.  How does that affect a neutral class?  Only a bonus for an all neutral party?  If a good/evil party adds me, do I ruin their bonus?<br>
<br>
For either class, are there any deity selections that have serious impacts?<br>
<br>
Especially for the Vah Shir, are you KOS in any major race areas or towns?  I don't quite understand about turning apprehensive merchants to indifferent as a vah shir shaman- does sneak do that?<br>
<br>
Any other subtle considerations to know about? :-)<br>

<br>
Also played a druid to 53.  No hands on experience on enchanter class.<br>
<br>
I first started playing Shaman on a server switch.  Played  a ranger up to 47 before kunark, and really enjoyed the utility magic and ability to melee.  Shaman seemed the caster type that best fit my play style.  Like to mix it up a bit, can be self sufficient, but also can make a big impact on a group, or even a raid's success.<br>
<br>
Well it wasn't exactly what I had in mind.. You can melee fairly well up to late 20's after that you are pet dependant in that respect.  I thought it was a Wisdom class.  In reality it is a HP/AC class, more like a melee in that respect than a caster.  Why?  at 24 level shaman get a spell called cannibilize.  With this spell they convert 50 hp into 25 mana.  Essentially you are never out of mana as long as you have hitpoints.  The size of your mana pool (wisdom score) becomes secondary to things like hp's and hitpoint regen (also get regeneration spell at lvl 24).  Many very successful shaman in there 50's have wisdom in the 130's.  they instead wear gear to increase AC (prevent getting hit, leaves more for mana conversion) and hitpoints (more for mana conversion).  <br>
<br>
In groups you will buff a lot.  In raids you will buff even more.  <br>
<br>
The true power of the shaman is in debuffing though.  We get the the best line of slows in the game.  Enchanters are second to us in slows and we are second to them in haste.  At lvl 60 the shaman's best slow is 75%.  Without this some encounters are just impossible.  By slow, I mean that the monster will be doing only 25% of its normal damage output if slowed by a lvl 60 shaman.  We get the malisement line (mages are second to us in this) which is similar to the enchanter tash line, except its resistable until the level 60 version.  We get the cripple line, along with enchanters.<br>
<br>
So, you say.. Enchanters can slow, they can tash and they can cripple, plus they get mana regen.  In these ways shaman and Enchanters are similar, but in one important respect they are not.  Shaman have priest class hitpoints and they have chain class armor.  Enchanter slows cast slower and have longer refreshes.  A resisted slow by an enchanter means a dead enchanter in alot of cases.  <br>
<br>
Shaman is a fairly easy class to play, a fairly difficult class to really excel in.<br>
<br>
Anyways this is just a perspective on the shaman class that people don't figure out until higher levels, you should try and figure out how you see yourself.  Are you a bigger than life metal clad figure (all shaman races are medium to large) who is always in the front of the battle, ripping the will to fight out of the enemies throat by brute force?  Or are you a Robe wearing cultured caster type, using subtlety and guile to do the same?  Play what feels right to you. <br>
<br>
Both types are for control freaks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Its just how you go about gaining that control....<br>

The Barbarians of Halas are amiable. This is helpful because spell prices in Shar Vahl are very high. It is worth the time to travel to Halas for spell purchases once you are able.<br>

By using Sneak, you can get behind a merchant and have him regard you indifferently regardless of faction. This allows you to get better prices if the merchant is ordinarily apprehensive. Dubious merchants won't trade at all unless you sneak up behind them.<br>
