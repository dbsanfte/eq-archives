<br>
This last month I have had to deal with some of THE rudest and immature people I have come in contact with.. all over ONE real woman.  Before you start tossing stones at her..<br>
<br>
In my EQ playing career.. almost 4 years now, I have been stalked, abused verbally, and harassed in what is primarily a male-dominated society... the constant flirtation over my character.. the *BITCH* when I refuse advances.. etc.  It gets on my nerves.<br>
<br>
So we took someone into the guild that was having the SAME problems I have had all along.. old story.  She was *dating* someone in the game... he took it too seriously.. she backed off... he freaks out.  We took her and her RL boyfriend into the guild and did so quietly.. she said nothing about anything to us.. and WHAMMO!  the tells started.<br>
<br>
It seems her old guild is out to ruin her name... just because the guild leader was spurnned.  Sheeeesh.  It has gone WAY too far and ending in a petition so far today because I am sick of the constant tells... but I thought since there was an excellent post about RL feelings on here that I would extend that... <br>
<br>
Here was this mornings conversation.. notice where he admits several times that they are actively policeing anyone who comes in contact with her... /rude  And that they will ban any members who talks to her.. which of course excludes themselves and anyone who wishes to harass those around her.<br>
<br>
I finally went to their website and asked them to leave us alone... because *chatting* was getting nowhere.  And the new round of crap began =P<br>
<br>
Sure this is a game.. but people DO get hurt.. AND there are freaks on here too.<br>

Thankfully since I moved to FV with my rl boyfriend and our character are Always in a relationship, I haven't dealt with it on FV.  Something similar did happen on our old server and was one reason we moved here.  Before Silvan and I were together I did make the poor choice of getting involved with the guildleader.  When Silvan and I got together though that had to stop, the guildleader kept making lewd comments, assumed that our relationship wouldn't change just because I was now involved with someone.<br>

Thank you for bringing this to public attention, it's about time someone stood up against it.<br>

Nope, I agree completely with ya.<br>

However, in situations like this, we REALLY don't know enough details to flame/pass judgement on either side.<br>

Sar had a stalker that is now aggravating the shit out of Kerridwynn.  She told similar stories.  I'll have to ask Kerri what char she's playing now. Anyway,I digress. The sheer amount of mental instability on the net(in any &quot;chat type&quot; venue) is sort of scary to me. <p><center><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/traesig.jpg"><br><i>Still keeping things sane(or not) at <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner" target="_new">Sar's Corner.</a><br>Yes, you can touch my <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=588147" target="_new">clothes.</a></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syrienne>Syrienne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Misery</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stalking on EQ</span><hr size=1> Like I said..

<br>
Achsia came to our guild and did not mention one word about her previous one... she joined to be with her RL boyfriend... then these tells started.<br>
<br>
Next thing I know I am hearing from other members that I am not the only one getting tells.<br>
<br>
To me.. a systematic attack on someone is ridiculous.  <br>
<br>
I personally dont care what happened in her old guild.. if she were flirting with the entire lot of them.. I DO NOT CARE (Although her character is a drow, and she does roleplay... but it is hard to believe that she is suddenly going to change her personality overnight when she joined my guild)<br>
<br>
When people ask you to stop doing something like tells and such.. DO IT.<br>
<br>
They have gona far beyond any *roleplay* that they might feel they are doing.  If this truly were the real world and I had these logs and witnesses to conversation I could get a restraining order based on this.. but it is not... and unfortunately I cannot.<br>

I also know of several females who play male characters simply to get away from this type of behaviour.  My character likes to flirt.  This is harmless fun and most of the males on the server I believe know this and enjoy flirting back.  Unfortunately the few who can not seperate RP flirting from RL flirting are the ones who cause the problems.  I suspect they are also this way in RL which is kind of scary.  <br>
<br>
For the guys out there that not only get the difference, but help make the game fun for us women. . .thank you.  Most of the men like that I have found get just as angry if not more so about this type of behaviour.  I personal think you guys are in the majority, but it only takes one jerk to make the game a living nightmare for someone else.<br>
<br>
I do hope this gets solved and you can get back to enjoying the game.<br>

Two things leap to mind.<br>
<br>
A)  Turn logging on.  In the EQ config file, I believe changing it from :<br>
LOG = FALSE<br>
<br>
to <br>
<br>
LOG = TRUE<br>
<br>
will do this.  Clean it out every few weeks if nothing untoward happens.  It logs everything, yes, but it will only end up being a few hundred meg at most.  (Yeah, that *is* a lot of text; but it's better than missing something important).  This ensures if something needs to be reported, it can be.  In extreme cases, I imagine e-mailing Sony with the relevant text would be equivalent to a petition.  I assume they can verify anything sent.<br>
<br>
B)  Ignore now has 100 slots.  While I don't believe it will get rid of emotes in the vicinity; it will eliminate the direct communication that seems to be the major problem.  <br>
<br>
Far far better to have 100 people on ignore than to be run off by harassment.  Get your friends to copy your ignore list if you are worried about someone trying to stalk you by proxy (and, of course, character assassination).  <br>
<br>
And of course, you also get to revel in the fact that those on ignore will shrivel up and die without someone to harass...<br>

I'm not trying to judge her here, just suggestion you make sure you have taken an objective view of things. <br>
<br>
It looks like Imasu has tried to control the situation on his guilds side, there isn't much more he can do. Telling an entire guild they shouldn't communicate with someone or else be /guildremoved is a bit extreme. If thats the case then I would believe they are taking the problem very seriously. It is hard to imagine the kind of chaos that would have to have been caused in order for my guild to issue that kind of order.<br>
<br>
Ignore is way to solve the problem if civil negotiations don't work. Maybe not the best solution, but it will somehwat alleviate the problems in game (obviously not on message boards or anywhere else out of game though). <br>

<br>
Now, that said, I do want to say this. Many of us realize very well that it's only pixels, but since this is a RP server, and our characters only see that cute little elf in the bikini, sometimes we are driven to give wink and a flirt. Now, if you told my character after that wink and flirt, to go away and never bother you again, he'd beg for forgiveness and never do it again. No questions asked, that's just the kind of guy he is. Some characters might not be that way. I in no way want to justify what those stalkers do, they are scum of the lowest kind, just don't think we're all whack-o's just because our characters like the ladies of Norrath. You are all quite irresistible, and not just for your lovely forms either. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/constiens/leondias-sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trinketsummoner>Trinketsummoner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 1:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stalking on EQ</span><hr size=1> Sadly, stalking and obessive behaviour are more commonplace than a lot of people think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/trinketsummoner/sig5.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I didn't make it to level 5 without having a bard follow me everywhere trying to impress me that he could track my corpse and having random folks come up to me with flirting emotes.  I would respond &quot;Um...that's great and all....but I'm a guy&quot;.  That was the first and last female character for PoTrakon.<br>
<br>
I have never understood in-game relationships.  Maybe it is because I am a bad roleplayer and don't see the point.  I don't think anyone can deny that, for some people, the line between in-character and out-of-character romance can be blurred, causing situations like the one above.  I can only imagine what it is like for dark elf and wood elf females in particular. Trakon is a lizard so it is fun to joke about how sexy he is and other harmless flirtation since lizards are so butt-ugly.  I love the rare occasions when a female lizard is in the group for old-fashioned leezard flirtation--the only thing uglier than a male lizard is a female lizard.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

During this conversation it was agreed that she would go to Syrienne and explain some misconceeptions she'd personally had to things said by &quot;outsiders&quot; meaning those not in Syrienne's guild nor those in ours.  It was also agreed that the I personally would speak to our guild leader who has had Said *stalked* on IGNORE since the day after she disbanded, because she would CONSTANTLY send him tells.  She wished to &quot;clear the air&quot; and end this is what she said to me.  <br>
Which to be honest with all of you I do not think was her goal but I did say I'd pass on the message.  I know for certain that not one person, has harrassed said *stalked* much less really spoken to her in well over a month.  <br>
I can say every day I hear from &quot;outsiders&quot; stuff which she's said about us,hence the post on our boards to discontinue FUTURE contact with her, to resolve that issue.<br>
<br>
I can say honestly that all of this is rather inflated, and those of you that said there are two sides to every story...well that's an understatment to say the very least.  These people are wonderful, kind and very generous, said *stalked* didn't fit in well,  she chose to leave, so be it.  After which, several in this guild, in other guilds and strangers..... total strangers came to us stating she'd bad mouthed our guild leader, the guild etc.<br>
 <br>
Truth or fiction, inflated or flat out lies, I do not know...and honestly I don't care, no one CARES in this guild...but obviously she does...which is the core problem here.  <br>
<br>
Enough said you all think and say what you wish, cause after all this is a game...and well I couldn't really give a shit cause I was there I know the truth, and I am above all of this slanderous, petty drama.<br>

As a matter of fact, she went on my ignore list almost immediately after because she kept talking to me (and she's the ONLY person on my ignore list).<br>
<br>
The post Imasu refers to above, was posted there a couple weeks ago when &quot;this person&quot; and friends were found causing problems with several of my guild members in Nek forest and seeing that any contact with her was going to create an ongoing issue, I made the post.  It was put there specifically to avoid this kind of problem.  Again, everyone in the guild ignored her and let the issue drop.<br>
<br>
Imasu contacted YOU Syrienne, because he cared about your guild and took it upon himself to let you know of the past history she'd had with TWO guilds now, before she joined you.  Not so you'd ban her, not so you'd be jaded against her... simply so you could prevent the same situations happening behind your back.  Right or wrong, that was his intention... to save you trouble.  I know of no other tells to you or anyone else.<br>
<br>
Irregardless of whether anyone believes us or not, our guild has no desire to interact with &quot;this person&quot; in any way.  If anyone's not letting things go, it's the person in question, and now YOU Syrienne.<br>
<br>
There has only ever been one post under that thread until you yourself posted a response, Syrienne... and Seb deleted it before I could stop her because it was inflamatory, threatening and downright rude... and basically had no business being in our private guild board.  You should feel lucky she deleted it, as it would not have done your image any good.<br>
