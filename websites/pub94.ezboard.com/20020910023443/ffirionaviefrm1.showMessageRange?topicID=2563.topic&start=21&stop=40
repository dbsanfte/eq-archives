It's amazing how homosexuality gets linked to roleplaying in an attempt to denegrate both in the powergamer's discourse.  I've noticed that very few self-identified roleplayers say that powergaming is &quot;gay&quot;.  On the contrary, roleplayers and roleplaying are called &quot;gay&quot; (or &quot;ghey&quot;) with a certain amount of frequency.  While my personal response, IC &amp; OOC, is &quot;Yeah, I'm gay, what's your point?&quot;, it does reveal something about the anxieties of those attempting to make that link. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

The Firiona Vie server alignment system was a bad idea, good riddance.<br>
<br>
Please do not reinstate in any way the old alignment system.<br>
<br>
If you do create a new alignment system, please make it realistic, self correcting, GM alterable/customizable, faction-based, and fun-promoting.<br>
<br>
Please do not let intolerant, stick-in-the-mud people re-ruin this server or return it to the prejudice simulator that it was before the May 8 patch.<br>

I don't know how it was like back before that infamous patch.  But I can tell you that any restrictions to grouping, at least in my brief experience, would make this server almost impossible to play on.  As it is, there's never anybody to group with in the best of times.  While it's true that my character is only level 17 currently, he's only been in 4 groups his entire life.  Why?  Because there doesn't seem to be anyone playing on this server!<br>
<br>
One thing that I have noticed, however, is that the people you do run across tend to be better players, or maybe just kinder players.  I wonder how much that has to do with the fact that FV is a roleplaying server or because there are so few people that we are less likely to burn bridges with the few others we come across.<br>
<br>
I had been playing on E'ci, but the overcrowding was starting to get annoying.  The standard newbie leveling zones were packed (yes, I played a lot of twinks).  40 people in Oasis, competing for things to kill.  50 people in Lake of Ill Omen.  People LFG all over the place.  On Firiona Vie, my experience has been that you rarely find enough people in a single zone to form a full group (and 95% of them are /anon or /role), and that's assuming you ignore level restrictions.  And now you want to make it even harder to group?  No thanks.<br>

They think roleplayers are a small comunity and that's why they changed the server to what is it now *at times I do wish we had a server transfer but then everyone from the old servers would complain and want more chars*<br>

Look at the service now, they make us pay more and they seem to have fired most if not all the GM's.

They seem to view us as a very small niche, and EQ seems to have moved on to more of a social game than anything else.  I do think with EQ2 they are trying to garner interest in the story that many people don't know exists, but I don't think their history will keep many subscribers once something remotely comparable comes along.  And I think that is roleplayers or otherwise.  Sometimes they remind me of drug lords who know we'll do anything to get a fix...well they'd **** a brick if everyone would up and leave all at once.

I'm not here for the low server population; in fact if you had actually READ my post, that was my biggest complaint.  I'm here to have fun on a server that isn't (or at least shouldn't be) filled with l33td3wdz, power gamers, and jerks.  The role that I play just happens to coincide fairly closely with my own personality.  Believe it or not, playing on a roleplay server doesn't mean that you have to &quot;speaketh in faketh Olde Englisheth&quot; (although I do appreciate Captain Roleplay, hehe)<br>
<br>
So in other words, my character is fairly open-minded and isn't racist or classist.  I play a halfling ranger, not &quot;a high-elf cleric that refuses to speak in any language other than Elvish because all other languages are inferior, and, and, and he drinks a lot, and refuses to wear sleeves to show his support of the underpriviledged&quot; or some such nonsense.  Not every person in a fantasy environment has to fit into a pre-defined niche.<br>
<br>
So, as part of my character's role, as a follower of Karana, he doesn't hate anyone.  Does Karana choose not to rain on lands where evil characters live?  Am I not allowed to choose my own friends, or is it more of a &quot;roleplay&quot; feature that I allow Verant to choose who I may group with?<br>

I do like the idea of XP bonuses or penalties, I like that very much.<br>

I would like alignment to be variable by faction, it would make for some interesting grouping and faction questing.<br>

Hmm Deities, tuff one but there should be quests to change ones Deity, that again would add variety and make for some interesting story lines.<br>

Alignment even in the PnP games was never intended as a law of nature, but as a consequence of character.  Your characters history (including race) determined initial alignment and if your subsequent actions deviated, a good DM would adjust your alignment, perhaps with severe consequences, such as your now misaligned diety getting pissed off at you.  Alignment should be an indicator of character behavior, not a hard-coded racial prejudice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 703<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/19/02 4:45:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2563.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alignment should be ..</span><hr size=1> I like the idea of using XP-bonuses &amp; penalties to encourage/discourage certain groupings.

I also like the idea of making alignment fluid, but I suspect that the programmers at Verant would roll their eyes at the work they'd have to do to implement that on just one server.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The first, however, we know they can do--they've done it in the past on our server, so they already have the code. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

I had a similar idea of just putting PC's on the same faction system as NPC's. Your 'personal' faction would be set by your home city/class combination (i.e. Necro from Neriak = The Dead, Necro from Ak'Anon = Dark Reflection, and so on). When you group, there would be a check against the other members of the group as to their standing with your faction (and vice-versa). Enforcement would be by faction bonus/penalty based on individual standing, so that amiable/indiff./apprehensive gets no adjustment, dubious and lower gets a penalty, kindly and up gets a bonus. This would be more realistic than being based on an arbitrary alignment, as would the effect on reputation (faction) be more realistic than an XP penalty. Linked to this would be other changes: /con would have to work PC-to-PC, so you can tell someone else's faction standing with your own; Making all or nearly all races startable in every city for those RP situations (like, say, a Ogre raised by Humans) where starting faction would be 'non-standard'. There would have to be limits on the faction hit as well, like one hit per login per character (the faction check happens once and isn't checked again as long as you're logged in.) It's something to think about, anyway... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/02 1:07:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2563.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alignment should be ..</span><hr size=1> Nice idea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucobra102.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cobra102</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/02 7:52:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2563.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alignment should be ..</span><hr size=1> Actually it is a very nice idea and closer to a &quot;realistic&quot; situation. It would however drive a coach and horses through the existing faction system around which much of the game is built. <br>
<br>
Instead of my human cleric having to do strange quests to penetrate an enemy city, all he has to do is group with it's residents a while, and then group with his own kind again to restore it. In a way this is I suppose exactly what he would do, earn the trust of the enemy to infiltrate their city and then he must re-earn the trust of his own kind or remain suspect. It makes a deal more sense than giving stacks of wine to an NPC.<br>
<br>
It would require major changes to the game engine. It would have to be weighted for group composition and duration. It will never be done because the population of FV does not justify such a re-write. Good Idea though.<br>
<br>
On re-instating the old alignment rules I think it is too late to turn back the clock.<br>
<br>
From an RP perspective much of the best fantasy is based on rebels, renegades and exiles who forsake their own origins in search of a different destiny. It is much more interesting than the race-hatred stereotypes which (if I may say it here) reinforce intolerance both in EQ and RL.<br>
<br>
I mean think of the books that would never have been written if Alignment rules had been imposed in Fantasy Literature.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzarsissrazorscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarsiss Razorscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/02 9:51:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2563.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alignment should be ..</span><hr size=1> The original alignment restrictions were a bit silly to begin with. The idea that evil is evil, good is good and neutral is whatever was just an arbitrary drawing of the line. Not all evils are created equal. Racial or diety restrictions would have been more approriate to a RP server. Does that eliminate or make the end game more challenging? Yes, but it would have preserved the integrity of the socalled RP server. It would have kept the current plague of blue server rejects from overrunning this server to get to their ::cough:: achievements ::cough:: in the end game. <br>
<br>
VI sold you out from the start by not setting concrete rules. They caved in completely on May 8 when they announced you could RP any way you want. Yeh, just like on the other servers! Anyway it's too late to close the door now. It would not be fair to the RP NOT ONLY NOT PREFERRED BUT NOT ACCEPTED players to suddenly find they couldn't play together. <p><CENTER>
