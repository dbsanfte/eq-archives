He was big for a Teir Dal, nearly as big as a warrior, and his hands were quick. While the Ebon Mask claimed no formal allegiance with any of the houses or to the king or queen, individual members were known to dabble in politics. It was the morning after Zalindra’s ascension.<br>
<br>
“What?” Naelaelayle coughed wearily, the casting last night had taken a lot out of her, dark bruises still marred her gnarled hands, testament to her struggle with the much younger Teir’Dal.<br>
<br>
“House Chath’elg’Caress has closed its doors to the Ragar’Golhyrr.” The assassin crowed.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth could tell by the swagger in his step that Malingrad was more than ready to take credit for the entire affair himself.<br>
<br>
“Calm your joy, son, it was not through your efforts alone that this alliance was averted.” His mother growled.<br>
<br>
“Of course,” Malingrad laughed, “How are your hands mother.”<br>
<br>
While at home Malingrad preferred to ignore his brother, who he secretly called the true thief. Weather the resentment was feigned or not, Maelgroth could never tell. It seemed to him, the life of the assassin was more suited to Malingrad than that of the necromancer. <br>
<br>
Mael’s own hands were stiff and sore, and he was exhausted, it had been a very difficult and complex spell that had animated the hands.<br>
<br>
“What are they saying happened?” Maelgroth croaked.<br>
<br>
“Nothing, other than the ascension of Zalindra was ruined when De’Nav refused to consummate the union.”<br>
<br>
“What are they whispering?” Naelaelayle hissed. She was more tired than she had ever been, and the sight in her left eye seemed to be gone.<br>
<br>
“Well that’s the interesting part,” Malingrad chuckled sweeping some of the food off the table and into his mouth. “Can’t you get mother something better than rations?” he glowered at his younger ‘brother’.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see you turning you nose up at it.” Mael snapped back. <br>
<br>
When they were younger Mal had beaten his little brother regularly just for kicks. He could still do it too, but now Malingrad sensed it would be much more difficult.<br>
<br>
“Rumor on the street has it that De’Nav refused to consummate after he saw a pair of hands peel off Zalindra’s face. A household guard has been blamed officially for the event and was promptly tortured to death, but the loss of face…,” the assassin chuckled grimly “…is too much for either house to bear without blaming the other.”<br>
<br>
“So there shall be war.” The old Teir’Dal cackled.<br>
<br>
“There is war.” Malingrad enthused, “I have accepted contracts for the deaths of several members of both houses. I had not expected to become wealthy from this vendetta.” At this he patted his bulging purse. “I am not the only on taking money from the feuding houses, the knives are out!”<br>
<br>
Someone brought up outside of Neriak may not have understood the intracies of what Malingrad was saying. Maelgroth knew well the protocols of house war. There were several stages, the first, the closing of the doors, signified the cutting off of formal ties to the other house. No business would be done between the houses until the doors were opened. Allied houses were expected to close their doors as well. To date none had. This was to be a feud directly between the Fire Hags and the Truth Finders. <br>
<br>
Such feuds were often shorter in duration than those that brought in their allies, since the number of principals involved was fewer and ancillary grudges did not come into the feud. Single house feuds were rare and renowned for their viciousness. No house could back down once war was declared, and the other houses kept score, such an affair was a disaster for the loser and usually left the winner weaker than before.<br>
<br>
Malingrad’s statement that the knives were out, meant that fighting had begun. It would usually start with the murder of a few low ranking house members, those cousins or nephews on the periphery of the family, store keepers, guardsmen and other non-entities. The true powers of the houses would be hidden in their fortress mansions, planning strikes and counter strikes at their enemies holdings. Poison, rumor, fire and steel were the currencies that these former allies would deal each other now.<br>
<br>
The fact that both sides were hiring professional killers further underscored the deadly intent of the combatants, both were going for the jugular.<br>
<br>
“Do not forget our purpose here.” Naelaelayle pointed out. “We still have much to do. I will see the Waes’Harventhars restored to their position before my death.”<br>
<br>
“Of course mother.” Malingrad said patronizingly. <br>
<br>
“Since you are so well connected, brother, I suppose you would have no trouble in getting another invitation?”<br>
<br>
“Of course.” Malingrad smirked. “Where would you like to go? The royal ball?”<br>
<br>
“We require an invitation to an affair at house D’Vir.” Maelgroth had placed the mask over his face once again and had spoken the last in the old tongue, speaking as the head of his house. It was something he had never dared. He was unsure why he did it now. Partly anger at the way his brother treated their mother, partly frustration at the lack of respect shown to him and partly elation at the small victory achieved last night all contributed to this gamble.<br>
<br>
Malingrad stopped chewing on his food and stared at his masked brother. Getting an invitation would be quite a challenge, house D’Vir was not to be trifled with. “Have a care you don’t try to grasp what is beyond your reach.” The assassin hissed, his hand crept dangerously towards his dagger.<br>
<br>
“How can I, when it is with your fingers I do my reaching?” Maelgroth countered, removing the mask.<br>
<br>
“How indeed, I shall do your will in this thing.” Malingrad replied in a mocking tone, still he addressed Mael in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
Naelaelayle quivered with pride. She loved Malingrad as her true son, even when he did not understand her goals. Maelgroth, however, seemed to grow in power and stature before her eyes. Hearing him speak as the head of his house, and listening to the way he cajoled his older brother into doing his duty was a wish fulfilled. For a moment she glimpsed what life would have been like had the Waes’Harventhar’s never fallen.<br>
<br>
Across town Nystyre relaxed in his study. It had been an eventful night for house D’Vir and an even more interesting morning. The great houses had survived by working together to keep the more ambitious younger houses weak. Sure they would feud with each other, but they had grown too few to risk really harming each other, to destroy one of the great houses would create a power vacuum that would place all at risk.<br>
<br>
The alliance of the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr had been a dagger aimed at the heart of the old houses. Now that knife was cutting into two upstart houses. He had made discrete inquiries to determine the identity of the house that had taken such delicate and brutal steps. None of the old houses took the credit even indirectly, this was truly unique, such a coup was always bragged about.<br>
<br>
None of the younger houses possessed the maturity to make such a play, or the wisdom to keep such a move secret. No it was not them.<br>
<br>
Many openly speculated that a new house had decided to make its presence known. There were many candidates, some from the more powerful guilds would make their own alliances and settle in town, but Nystyre made it a habit to keep informed of these individuals. He had his own theory.<br>
<br>
“How could I refuse such a beautiful request.” A honeyed voice crooned.<br>
<br>
Nystyre turned carefully, his mansion was warded with spells and traps as well as guards living and dead. He had been expecting a visitor but had done little to relax his protections save de-activating some of his most singular defences. His guest possessed the skill to reach him with little trouble, but he wanted to keep his privacy as well as retain a few surprises if this knife ever turned against him.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, you have always had good taste.” Nystyre smiled, pushing a small bag towards the newcomer. She was dressed for work, armor, daggers and other implements of her craft rested in their appropriate places. He had always admired her professional attitude even if her adherence to platinum bordered on a mania.<br>
<br>
The female carefully opened the bag. Inside was a single platinum earring, the mate to the one that had been delivered to her quarters the night before. They were exquisite in craftsmanship, not flashy, not gaudy, classic in their workmanship.<br>
<br>
“As do you, how may I be of service?”<br>
<br>
“No doubt you have heard of the feud that has erupted between the Fire Hags and the Truth Finders.” Nystyre waited a moment, hoping that his guest would share what she knew of this matter, someone with her skills would be highly sought after by both sides. When she did not react he continued, “I met house Jindurn’Plynnar last night.” That caught her attention.<br>
<br>
“Really, what did you think of them?”<br>
<br>
“Lets say I was impressed by what I saw, obviously someone is playing the game of houses very well.”<br>
<br>
“Someone new?” She asked, sliding closer to Nystyre, she smelled of jasmine and leather, a heady combination.<br>
<br>
“That’s what everyone is saying.”<br>
<br>
“You don’t pay me to find out what everyone is saying.” She replied petulantly, sticking out her lower lip in a very attractive pout.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, I think it is not a new player, but a very old one. Find me this missing house.”<br>
<br>
With a giggle Kyri Velkyn disappeared into the shadows, leaving the scent of jasmine and leather.<br>
