     This means that you can pump out as much dual wield damage as a warrior (pretty much)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> * Rangers get spells </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
     This means you can buff, heal, damage shield, sow, snare and use some DD spells and Dots - that's hardly useless now is it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> * Rangers get track and outdoor spells to help them pull</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
     And they make good use of them<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> * Rangers get Critical hits with bows</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
     Shadowknighs/paladins dont get critical hits nor do bards, bards get dual wield but no double attack, knights get double attack but no dual wield.....rangers also have kick! so can do even more damage.<br>
<br>
Ohh come on, you can fight just like a warrior, have ATK raising spells to help improve your damage, you have wepon proc spells that adds damage procs to your wepons, you can kick and use Damage over time spells, direct damage spells and you have a series of buffs, heals and utility spells like See invis, cammo etc.<br>
<br>
You are Self reliant, you can do things a warrior can never dream off and still do decent damage in between! you can pull and track rare spawns! GOD man open your eyes and let people see what good things you can do.<br>
<br>
Note: Harm touch is a piece of candy....with my disc i can do 1400 damage at lv58..... That's not that 'be all and end all' it doesnt make me god, Harmtouch without disc at low lvs is one single wizard nuke, i hardly call being able to nuke once every hour or so......special...... and one backstab is pretty much more damage than my single 800+ harm touch without disc.<br>
<br>
If you want to be Pure damage without takeing hits, be a rogue, if you want to do damage and take hits be a monk, if you want to take hits and have more options and configurations and tactics be a ranger! if Glory is all that matters be a high lv warrior and MT for your guild and friends...... if you want to roleplay your deity as a fighter pick a religeouse warrior/ranger/bard/shadowknight/paladin or rogue and stick with that.<br>
<br>
Being a ranger is not easy....You need to learn how to work with others and them to work with you....Once you do that you are a valued group member. And people 'will' invite you.<br>

Well, within the limits of what my group will tolerate, anyway.  In guild-based groups a necromancer or shadow knight is frequently not welcome.<br>
<br>
My advise has to be to not get too hung up on what other people think of your class.  After 4 years of class balancing or so, things are close enough that everyone has a job, or should be able to find one, unless they really don't understand what they are playing at all.  Play your class because youi enjoy it, not because someone just told you how great they ate.  If the only reason you are happy with being a ranger is because the last guy told you how great they are, the next time someone tells you they suck you are going to be unhappy again.  Find some class to be happy with for it's own sake, ranger or otherwise.<br>

<br>
I NEVER had so much fun! it was amazing.<br>
<br>
Have played a shadowknight since, sure it was rough.. i remember patchs and new spells, i remember getting lifetaps and re-rolling to test them out, i remember 4 casts and oom because we payed 4x the mana per spell (labeled mana cost) and when they took that patch of ages later we could lifetap 4 times as much!<br>
<br>
I remember when we had no decent wepons, when shiny brass halberd 'was' uber and bronze armor was the 'full' tanking armor! Times were hard and we didnt even know it! GREAT!!!<br>
<br>
What Valquiss said is correct, play what will keep your interested, or you will never be happy....sure i felt down on my SK and still dont think they 'are' very powerfull...but fact is i cannot play another class nearly as long as i play a shadowknight, i get bored and always end up as one again, it is the perfect class for me and i like knowing that, but also hate knowing that!<br>
<br>
Shadowknights are looked down upon in general because not many people know all of there options, skills and abilitys... or twinked warriors seem so much better... Well i say sod that! <br>
<br>
Ohh one big correction, i &amp;^%$ hate rangers!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no matter what they get they want more more more and take take take...... by far Rangers are the most Balanced Hybrid and are not a bad class by far... but people palyed sucky whining rangers far to long and stained the class's name forever! and it will never change.<br>

<br>
As a ranger, I CAN tank if the situation needs it. I CAN do amazing damage with a bow, even before archery mastery. Example, at 51 on non rooted mobs I could hit for low 200s per arrow. With trueshot disc and at 56 i have done crits over 500 lots of times. I CAN track at a much higher level than any other class, and sort by distance too. The best advice I can give is build some trust in yourself and your friends. You will be amazed what you can achieve. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210273" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/leebradleyadams/Iulisig2.JPG" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 513<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/17/02 8:38:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you are a Ranger, Look at this please !</span><hr size=1> One thing to remember about rangers is that they reach the so called power of the class early. They peak around 30  and after 40 have to change tactics to compensate for the chain and poor defense they have.<br>
<br>
Take a shadowknight for instance, they dont get powerful until after 30. It is just how the class works.<br>
<br>
I prefer Hybrids to straight class charcaters. Cant play a caster well, always want to hit stuff. And I get bored real quick if all I can do is hit stuff. I have a Ranger as my main and have 3 sk and 2 paladin as alts. I like to play with different races and none are very high ( best I have is a 30 sk ogre).<br>
<br>
The limitations of the Ranger are offset, for me, by the ability to do more than one thing.<br>
<br>
A ranger can tank, prior to 40 they tank very well, after 40 they have to be more conscious of the limits of their armor and hitpoints. A ranger has offensive spells and utility buffs. Sk have offensive spells and paladins have buffs and defensive spells ( until late in life) with good heals.<br>
<br>
Braellar put it pretty well too.<br>
<br>
Each class has some sort of limitation. Some arent as noticable as others, but they are there. Rangers peak early and pay for that in the later levels to some degree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umarrtty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marrtty </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/17/02 9:24:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1402.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you are a Ranger, Look at this please !</span><hr size=1> Greetings board troll!  <br>
  I have been a ranger since the game came out.  I must have seen this post 1000's of times in the past on many boards.  And not just for rangers, I seem to see this topic posted somewhere for every class.  <br>
  IMO there is no such thing as a bad class in this game.  All classes have good and bad points.  All classes depend on the skills of the player.<br>
  Granted I have not played the much balywhooed end game, (as if I care about the high end game! I imagine I could do about 10 high end raids before I got bored and deleted my toon, only friendships would make me not delete). Even with 3+ years playing the game as a ranger I have not gotten this high before (Level 44) But, at level 44 and after having grouped with several other rangers at the same level this is what I have noticed:<br>
<br>
  1) all the classes seem to die quicker at higher levels then lower.  In my 20's &amp; 30's a caster could last long enough for me to pull the monster off of them, I have always personally prided myself on saving casters.  Not now, when they take argo...they generally die...right quick.  Only class(good aligned ones) I have seen actually getting stronger are bards.  Granted some last longer then others, but as far as grouping goes the sum is much greater then the parts.  Yes melee classes last a little longer.<br>
   As far as rangers go, I have noticed that I tend to last longer then my peers.  I have all ivy armor, and some goodies I have been able to buy in the Bazaar(certianly not uber).  My HP and AC  are similiar to others I group with.  But I have noticed that people seem to have switched to dropped armor, and away from quested armor, and they seem a little weaker for it.  I have not crunched the numbers, but rangers at an equal level do not standup as well as I can.  It is my opinion that the equipment and the skill makes the Ranger, not the class it'self.<br>
<br>
 2)  I have only played rangers.  I tried some other classes but I could not stand them.  With sense heading, tracking, sneak, hide, camo, levitate, and SOW.  I am the master of my environment.  I know what is near me, it's con level, I know the dirction to safety (zone/gaurds/etc).  I can out run most things, Out of doors no animal can beat me, and most are my friends.  Granted others have some impressive abilities, bards are fast, rouges can sneak much better, etc.<br>
  I do not know how so many can stand being blind, and oblivious to their surroundings all the time.<br>
<br>
Well this is long enuff.  Please don't reply with tired old stuff...For example look at everlore's ranger board and try and come up with something other then the same old crap.  I think most on the FV server are not looking for the same old blue server, cleric/tank/nuker combo line of talk.<br>
<br>

At that level your spells are detuned druid spells that don't seem to work very well. At 22 Panic animal was somewhat of a disappointment, it fizzled alot and didn't last long, but as I grew in levels it became alot more reliable. Root was the same way, the only really good utility spell I had was snare. But even so, I was a reasonably good tank, had great taunt, and a few good buffs.  <br>
<br>
Things definately picked up at 30 with sow, and a generally better feel for playing a ranger.  At forty in the outdoors I am a pulling and tanking machine.  With harmony, root, snare, careless lightning, and SoW I can find any mob, harmony, single pull, root any adds and bring a clean pull to my group. I can easily taunt mobs off of healers, casters, and rogues.<br>
<br>
  In highly competitive zones like Everfrost (mammoths), and Rathe Mountains (giants), a ranger can beat most other classes to wandering mobs, tag with an arrow at full sprint, and then tank the monster when back at the group. Then dual weild, double attack, kick, and nuke. Your like an armored food processor.<br>
<br>
When you just don't feel like looking for a group, you can go out on your own and kill with great efficiency. We can be a very independant class if we want.  We can also hunt in high risk areas because with /tracksort distance you'll always know when a big bad player killing beast is nearby. And with snare, and sow you can always tuck your tail between your legs and head for the zone line.<br>
<br>
We can camo to get into places other classes need help with. At first camo is pretty sketchy, but i've found it's fairly reliable at my current level. I'd say it drops early 10% of the time. In your 30's camo and sow are indespensable. Any time I'm traveling through the Great Divide, Eastern Wastes, Kael Drakkal, or other zones with agressive mobs, SoW and Camo make for smooth sailing. Groups also benefit from your ability to SoW.<br>
<br>
I feel like I could go on, but I don't want to inadvertantly attract the nerf bat.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell I love playing a ranger.<br>

Strictly speaking from guild use...it doesnt matter much.  Every class has its use, some greater than others.  Just look at previous posts to get that answer.<br>
<br>
Now if its just grouping....the best evaluation is who you hunt with.  Shaman/SK or Shaman/Monk duo's are probably best in the game...hands down.  The wife and I (Shaman/SK) are really very dominant in most places.  Malo, Malosini, Slow, Darken, Fear, FD pull, summon corpse, Torpor, HT, leech, 2 pets 39/37 in levels, Haste etc etc....<br>

I love it!  Even at level 4 it's useful.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And it's great having a ranger in my enchanter's group so they can find special mobs for us.  Grouping with a ranger can help a person get rich through special drops.<br>
<br>
At the mid-levels that I'm at (31), rangers seem to tank decently well, though I'm generally in groups with at least two or three meleers that share the aggro.  Not to mention that since I'm an Enchanter, the tanks are only being beaten on by one mob at a time.  But at least in that case, rangers make a good addition.<br>
<br>
The fact that they can snare the mob helps a lot in groups with no druid, or a druid that's acting as primary healer, saving their mana.<br>
<br>
Also, if I'm duoing or small grouping with someone as my enchanter and no healer, I'd rather have it be a ranger or paladin than a warrior, for the simple fact that they can heal themselves (albeit slowly, between fights).  And they have a little more versatility, with their buffs.<br>
<br>
Of course, it helps that my guild has several good rangers that are skilled people and also nice.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/velsig.jpg"><BR>

Why bother being a druid? Woot heal ... clerics do it much better anyway. Nuking and porting? Wizards do it better. Melee? Warriors beat them hands down. Track? Rangers do it better, and have access to it from birth. Why bother being a druid? What's &quot;good and needed&quot; that a druid offers that other classes don't provide?<br>
<br>
Oh, and in case you haven't noticed, rogues have to be in a specific spot to backstab - behind the mob. Who can draw enough aggro to keep the mob on them while the rogues backstab? Rangers.<br>
<br>
It all depends on what you want to play. I like being able to throw up damage shields on my party, buffing attack, helping the cleric relieve some of their mana usage, being able to use Spirit of Wolf. Oh, and I like my 99 point criticals off my nice friend Mr. Talisen at level 43, without AA. Saved my butt quite a few times.<br>
<br>
Sorry I'm a little testy about this, but a druid calling a ranger useless is kind of like the pot calling the kettle black since rangers are the druid hybrid. Oh, and a group of rangers took out the Nexus Scion on another server.

Everquest is balanced to the high-end game, because not everyone can be level 30 forever, in fact few people can.<br>

Level your ranger to 60 and you'll be able to do a considerable amount of melee damage, have cool buffs, and have neat disciplines (weapon shield).<br>
<br>
Get him a good bow and you'll do amazing missle damage (use your trueshot disc).<br>
