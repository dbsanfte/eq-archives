Salty gusts of ocean breeze picked up Siava's hair, twirling it around her nose and into her eyes as she leaned against the edge of Sirensbane to peer out over the water. She looked into the horizon at nothing in particular as she kept to her side of the boat.<br>
<br>
Siava usually had a one track mind about certain memories and visions, but not this day. Today was reserved for scouting and pure focus with no room for mistake, so idle thoughts were put to rest. Her mission was to track the routines of the Sisters on the Isle of Erollis. A small nagging voice in her head reminded her that she might not have to harm the citizens of this small island, but if she had no choice, she wanted to be prepared. <br>
<br>
She could feel the accusing stares boring into her back from the lighter elves as they neared their destination.  Siava didn't care though. She was on scouting duty and these pale creatures couldn't do a thing about it. Siava propped her elbow on the ledge, cupped her chin in her hand, and stuck her backside out purposefully as she rocked on her heels as a silent insult. The ship pulled up to the dock. <br>
<br>
Siava waited for the others to disembark and Sirensbane to resume her course before jumping overboard.  The drenched elf pulled herself up on  the bank of the isle several feet away from the dock and set up an inconspicuous camp until nightfall. When darkness blanketed the ground, Siava crawled up the hillside on her belly; a tactic the Indigo Brotherhood had taught all warriors since they didn't get magical abilities to hide themselves while moving. She eyed a short haired female on the dock, slight in build and quite young. She averted her eyes to a tree in the distance and spotted another Sister. Several more roamed between small shops, quietly chatting in passing. Keeping herself in the darkest of shadows, Siava pressed herself against a thickly trunked tree and craned her neck to closely inspect her targets. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Arrrr! Who be ye on me properties, dark landlubber?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Siava felt a sharp poke on her back, but remained still. Odors of grime and ale crept into her nostrils as hot breath bathed her neck. <br>
<br>
Siava swallowed loudly before giving a raspy reply. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ahoy! Siava Eir' Thal at yer service.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A thick calloused hand grabbed her shoulder and spun her around. Siava cringed slightly as she eyed the unshaven pirate. Even though it was as dark as a shadow wolf's pelt outside, she could still tell his teeth were blackened by the lack of hygeine and he smelled like he hadn't bathed in days. <br>
<br>
The pirate held his cutlass up to her throat and put his face close to hers. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ahoy ye say? Only we respectable men o' Gunthak say 'Ahoy'. Where ye learn t'speak that word?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Siava recoiled sharply at the stench of his breath, but looked him straight in the eye and flashed her brightest smile. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Badeb Alescore o' th' Dread Gnome Pirates took me in under 'is wing 'n taught me 'e did.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Siava winked at the filthy man as she spoke. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;'e also told me ye 'ad the finest grog right 'ere on this isle!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> It was a lie, but Siava figured empty flattery could get her out of sticky situations. Something else the Indigo Brotherhood taught her. <br>
<br>
The pirate stroked his chin on her last comment and then burst into a roaring laugh. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;'e did, did 'e? 'e's right y'know. C'mon, lass. Let's see if'n ye kin tell me a bit more 'bout these gnome pirates 'n tell me why yer out here while we share some o' that grog.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He peered around intently and lowered his voice to a whisper. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ye got any t'spare while yer at it?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Siava chuckled and nodded her head as they walked further towards the other side of the island to join his crew on the beach. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ahoy, ye scalleywags! This 'ere be ....&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the pirate asked Siava quietly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;..erm...what's yer name agin, lass?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Siava.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Arrr! Siava! She said she 'eard we 'ad th' best grog o' th' island. Dayle, bring 'er a bottle o' that home brew. Time t' splice th' mainbrace!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He was encouraged by &quot;yer's&quot; and &quot;arr's&quot; that were belted out with enthusiasm. Siava sat next to the pirate by the blazing bonfire after Dayle had given her a dirty bottle filled with a murky liquid. Not wanting to disappoint or insult her host, Siava brought the bottle to her lips and tilted her head back. She nearly choked. The drink felt as if it set her throat aflame and made her eyes water, but she coughed and held up a thumb,  which prompted a chorus of applause and back pats. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;By th' way, me name's Zyle. Zyle Bensmill, but ye can call me Zy. E'eryone else does.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Zy chugged on his own bottle and licked his rotten teeth with his pink tongue. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;S'tell me, lass, why ye snoopin' out 'ere on th' isle?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Siava explained her intentions to Zy via practiced pirate lingo. Zy gave full attention to her tale and concerns, nodding at appropriate intervals. When she was done telling him about the elf blood she'd need in the future, Zy leaned back on the sand and propped himself up with his elbow. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ye know, if'n I see ye out here 'armin' th' fine lasses o'th' isle, I'll hafta hurt ye.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Siava's eyes grew wide, but she didn't say a word. Instead, she nodded with comprehension and took a swig from her bottle. Zy continued, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ye see, e'en though we be considered the scurve o' this 'ere ocean, these fine lasses o' th' isle take care o' us. We got a deal, we do. We give 'em some o' our booty and they pay us back by lurrin' wee folk 'ere for us t'plunder, and....&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Zy blushed slightly before speaking again. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;...they also be givin' us booty in return if'n ye know what I mean.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Siava blinked at Zy, then brought a hand to her lips to muffle her laugh. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I....&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, She fought her lungs desperately to hold in another fit of chuckles. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I know what ye say, Zy, 'n I understand. I won't be touchin' yer....booty....since ye explained it t' me th' way ye did.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Siava found it highly amusing that the pristine wenches of the island would dare touch these hoodlums, but she'd not ruin any sort of pact they had made. <br>
<br>
The two looked at each other, laughed loudly, and clinked their bottles together. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ye'd make a fine pirate someday, lass. I ain't ne'er met none o' them gnome pirates, but if'n they consider ye a friend, they be fine in me books. Ye said somethin' 'bout a..Badeb, was it?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Siava nodded. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Ye consider 'im a true mate, lass?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Siava nodded again and told Zy about how helpful he was gathering certain componants and how he got his nickname of the Panty Pilferer, to which Zy responded with a hearty &quot;Har Har&quot;.<br>
<br>
By this time, both Zy and Siava were more than a little tipsy. They were down right drunk and talking like the best of friends that had known each other their entire lives. He patted her knee and smiled up at her with barely open eyes. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I want ye to give this t'yer mate Badeb.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> As he spoke, he unfastened the small gold earring he wore in his right ear and placed it in her hand. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Only true pirates kin wear it 'cause it be a symbol o' Gunthak, which means he be made o' fine stuff. 'Tis true! If'n me 'n me men e'er cross paths with ye mate 'n he wears this, he be treated like a brother.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Zy emphasized his statement by closing his eyes completely as a broad smile touched his lips. He balled up his fist and thumped it lightly on his chest over his heart. <br>
<br>
Siava beamed a drunken smile at Zy and placed the earring through her earlobe for safekeeping until she saw Badeb again. The rest of that night was a blur of loud laughter, raging fires, and throat scorching brews. . <br>
