<br>
When you sign up for a raid, scheduled at a time late on, with no loot is reserved, that's what you expect when you get there.  So, you've spent two hours beating giants and buffing up.  Fair enough, it's fine.  It's 3AM by this point, we charge the Lady ten minutes later.  She falls pretty quick (she did her good old fashioned 205 routine on me before she died, I lived this time, a first in a Vox raid).<br>
<br>
Yay!  Book drops!  It's about 3:30AM by now, and I'm really faltering.  It's getting even later for other people.<br>
<br>
We get to the rolls.  I have my /random button ready.  And then out of the blue, the /random ability disappears.  Why?  The friends of one paladin (Suometar in this case, no sense in not naming names) jump in, basically telling every other paladin not to roll or face the consequences.  With a heavy heart, we don't.  Three other 52 paladins sat there, probably half way between gobsmacked and happy for Suometar.  The looting goes on.<br>
<br>
This isn't a regular &quot;I L0st teh l000tz!!111!  F4g0tz, ur gh3y!!111!&quot; post.  I'm not calling anyone teh sukc or anything ridiculous like that.  Honest to god, I'm really happy Suometar got herself out of the 52 rut, because I know exactly how much it sucks (we were talking about it the other day, apparently, although neither of us were too close to how long Korhil waited, we were well on our way, and we'd both started around the same time).  However, on a no-claims raid, where the only drop you're interested in is for your epic, it's 3AM, you expect to get there, have it drop and at least have a chance to say to the planned receiver &quot;Here, honestly, you complete the epic, I'll wait longer.&quot;  It's NOT a decision that should be forced on people.<br>
<br>
There will be those who say &quot;Wanna complain about ph4t l00tz??  Go run your own $*%&amp;in' raid!!&quot;  I have tried, twice so far.  The planning stage took a day too long unfortunately (I make a point to have a core of 15 people ready to go, and pick it up from there) and twice the dragons were reserved, once by the Tribbles, the other by the Fellowship.  I'd run a raid if I ever though I had a chance of getting at the poor bastard of a dragon (hoping to this week).  I've also been told by several people to make the loot that I want reserved.  I can't do that.  Why?  It's crap.  You can't just reserve an epic drop on something like Vox or Naggy.  These guys are just about the only gankable dragons that most guilds have the power to do.  Everyone deserves a chance at their drop.  Everyone.<br>
<br>
I don't mind losing anything in a fair /random roll, heck, I'm happy for people.  Hell, I wouldn't have minded if the question had been put to the paladins present &quot;Guys, Suo's done a really good job here, will you give the book up for her?&quot;  The answer would have been yes, the paladins on the raid were some of the nicest I've known.  Forcing it was not the way to go.<br>
<br>
Scotty got the RBB two weeks back at Vox, I didn't get that.  I actually had to fight for him to get that (at the time, we had casters rolling for it, I had to point out repeatedly that it was simply a melee item, then search through the rolls to find the highest one, then point THAT out repeatedly).  He's been using it ever since, it's great for him.  I'm happy for Bromax, Korhil and everyone else who won a book over me in a dragon raid.  I'm happy for Suo, being finally able to complete Fiery Avenger.  I've told all of these people that if they want an extra hand for Miragul, they have it from me.  However, going on a raid where supposedly nothing is reserved, at 3AM, and then having it dropped on you that you're no longer allowed to roll on something you've been waiting for (in this case either the burnt or frost book) for something like 8-9 raids.  Even worse when the first person to /random gets a 319 and you think &quot;YES, I might stand a chance!&quot;<br>
<br>
That's all I really have to say.  I'm sorry if I offended anyone, and ironically, the raid leader had nothing to do with this ridiculous situation (she actually laid down the rules and was going to follow them until what I can only describe as a pressganging).  I'm very happy for Suometar and hope she'll let me kill Miragul with her.  No hard feelings to anyone, but it had to be said.  I've done too many dragon raids and lost out fairly too many times to honestly let this one fly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1584<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/02 6:49:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> That's not good form at all</span><hr size=1> They really should stick to the declaration or they end up abusing people's trust and leading them on with false hopes for loot.  However, odd things can happen in these situations.  I recall one time where our raid leader asked us to come help him kill the Queen in Chardok for his epic.  He also invited a warrior friend of his, who (he said) wanted to see what the fight was like and how to do it.<br>
<br>
So, we kill her and suddenly, this other guy wants the drop and our raid leader says to let him take it.  Seems our leader had asked us to help him, but then had promised the first drop to his friend.  The friend got all kinds of nasty tells just like you did (ie. don't loot it or we'll all be very pissed off).  Not a good event.<br>
<br>
Could be something along those lines happened.  Guild all thinks it's for their Pally, but the raid leader promised open unbeknownst to them.  My one advice to you on this kind of topic is to never keep silent.  If you want it, go ahead and roll.  The long suffering act just gives the dynamite more time to breed up before the fuse gets there.  If they try to play games with you like they did, they're unlikely to help you in the future anyway and are probably not worth cultivating. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 582<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/02 7:05:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God this is strange...</span><hr size=1> I heard about this and I was both happy and a bit concerned.  A bit of back-story, since it's hit the boards.  This was a Fellowship raid, btw, and I'll take it upon myself as Saga's Ambassador to the Fellowship to answer for this early.<br>
<br>
Suometar has personally led at least 3 raids against Vox that I know of, possibly more.  She often has help, but she's always leading.  The raid after THREE books dropped, two of them won by non Fellowship attendees, concerned friends finally managed to force a reservation the next time, and of course that's the raid no book dropped.  This time Suometar did clearly post there were no reservations.  She's too damn honourable for her own good sometimes.<br>
<br>
The raid where three books dropped there was also a paladin who felt presured.  Again, no doing of Suometar's.  She almost had to force the book down his throat to make him take it, but she did.  She was also offered the only book won by a Fellowship member, of the three.  That was from Ninichka.  Again, she refused.<br>
<br>
I don't have the kind of explanation I might offer that would easily make sense to experience raiders, and I wasn't af Vox this time, but the truth of the matter is that the Fellowship are not experienced raiders.  We have the size and the force to do some impressive things, and we have been lately, but the Fellowship as a whole is stumbling though all the same old issues when it comes to fairness on raids.  We don't need to invite non-Fellowship members on a Vox raid, and certainly not the assortment of Paladins virtually certain to show up, but we tend to anyway.  Because no one has really confronted issues of fairness yet and how to deal with that on every level.<br>
<br>
So people are interjecting their own ideas of fair, which is both well-meant and potentially very explosive.  I always say post your rules and stick to them, to avoid confusion after the fact, and this is why.  But really that's a simplistic solution and only deals with problems, and not the core of the question.  How to be fair?<br>
<br>
I can tell you the Fellowship raids to have fun, not for loot.  I can tell you this is the first rumbling of dissatisfaction I've yet heard, and thank God it's mild.  And I can certainly tell you if casters were rolling on a Runed Bolster Belt it was by mistake.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As a Fellowship raiding leader I'm dealing with this same problem now, and I've stuck my personal raids on a points system lately.  I don't know what's &quot;fair&quot; any more than the next leader, but I'm stumbling along trying to find it, anyway.<br>
<br>
I can also say that Suometar will probably be very distressed by this thread and will probably try to give her book away.  I don't know what will come of that and I won't presume to predict.  But I just want anyone who reads this thread to know that this isn't what the Fellowship is about.  We're just amatuer raiders, slightly distressed by the complications arising from our unexpected successes lately.<br>
<br>
Now, that all being said, I'd like to ask all Fellowship members who aren't ambassadors to refrain from posting here, so we can take our minor issue behind closed doors and deal with it in private.  If there are responses that need to be made here, Fellowship ambassadors will do it.<br>
<br>
Bakanome, your concerns will be addressed.  I'll be in touch.  I'm sure you realize you still have the option of expressing your concerns on this public board if you wish, but I hope you'll leave this alone unless and until you find private means aren't working.<br>

The whole guild were holding back at 52 until everyone who needed one had their scales.  We ran open raids whenever we could and helped heaps of people get their Epic drops from Naggy and Vox.... everyone except our Guild/Raid Leader, Tarin.  He worked his butt off running raids every weekend and still couldn't roll to save his life! Haha...  <br>
<br>
With the whole guild holding back for him (not an enforced rule, just something we were all doing to help him) it was getting frustrating so Tarin defaulted the scale to him in the next raid.  This was advertised as such on the Battlefield Forum before the raid so that all attendees were aware of the fact.  We also are painfully aware that for the most part the rest of the stuff that drops isn't too great so we donated &quot;loot&quot;.... which consisted of, amongst other things, Blue Diamond Bracelets and a bunch of stuff for the Earring of Solstice Quest.  This worked well.  No one got upset as everyone knew what the deal was.  <br>
<br>
I think to default something to one specific player at the end of a raid without mention of it beforehand is wrong.  Even if it wasn't officially defaulted and was more of a &quot;it's only right&quot;.  It may well be the right thing to do, and I don't question that Suometer deserved the drop as running open raids is, from what I hear, a nightmare, however, it should have been decided before the raid... not after.  <br>
<br>
Just my opinion.... heh... for what it's worth... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://groups.msn.com/_Secure/0LgB0cCsQU3QShBmWKBUjgsaxKvnHLO7kjqh6vUS!eNoRYZ5BDua43ewBq7Cyc48hE7aOtAWdXa8/Petasia.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=petasiarah>Petasia Rah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/02 9:43:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God this is strange...</span><hr size=1> Oh...

<br>
I was on this raid last night, and at no time did I see on raid channel pressure to not roll on the book. Suometar called for the roll as she promised.  I know I was very careful not to do anything in /ts either, for Suometar is very very scrupulous on the fairness of her raids. I cannot of course speak for all the raid members here.<br>
<br>
Both Timwin and Suometar rolled, and after a pause Suometar was declared the winner with the higher roll. I admit we were all very glad for her, and I personally made a vow that I would lead dragon raids until every other paladin on that raid got a book - because I was so impressed that folk would act in the selfless way that I saw!  Actually if you read the log of the text I sent to Valquiss I was happily saying that I would lead until all shamen got books, but this represented a personal over-multitasking confusion and does not really apply LOL &lt;Valquiss knew what I meant! &gt;  I repeated this statement to several who can confirm it.<br>
<br>
Our only question was whether Ninichka, Trallos or I would lead the next raid, as we were all talking over who should have the priviledge!<br>
<br>
I am sorry you were up so late and felt disappointed, we actually took the dragon down much faster with Suometar leading than the last raid where I led &lt;I dont think you came to that one as the book was reserved if I remember correctly&gt;. <br>
<br>
Once I am back home I will reread the log and see if my memory of events is clear.  However, at least I can assure you that I have made a promise to the paladins of this Vox raid, and will do my best to keep it.<br>

&lt;caveat&gt;  I am not a fellowship ambassador, just a member, my comments are attributable to me alone....<br>
<br>
Sumatai did say in Chat that he would duel anyone who rolled against Suometar.  This was mostly tongue in cheek, but may well have not been read this way by outsider's.<br>
<br>
Bakanome.. the Fellowship takes care of its own.  Suometar had definately earned that book, it should have been reserved (or the reservation should have been specifically passed on from the previous raid). At times we may forget that there are invitee's on some of our raids, and those folks may end up feeling excluded as you did.<br>

Fellowship Hate raids that I have been involved in have one major loot rule... First timers don't roll on Breastplates and Legs.  This is to reward repeat attendance.  I personally don't think a rare quest drop should be randomed to folks who have shown to one raid, may never show again after getting what they need, and aren't invested in the fellowship (unless Fellow attendee's no longer need).  These are really not open raids.  <br>
<br>
I am not saying you are in this category, I do think however that very explicit raid loot policies need to be outlined from the start of a raid's sign up, and then followed.  <br>
<br>
My heart goes to Suometar, she will likely give up her book, as that the type of person she is, after reading your comments. <p><br>

That's the unedited log (I even left in the guild bits in Finnish), from the time I asked for the Paladins to roll for the book, until next item on the loot list. How many times am I supposed to ask for you to roll? How long am I to wait if you don't? It was late, a lot of people were tired, including me, and I wanted to get the rest of the loot done so we could get people out of there.<br>

How is that claiming loot?<br>
<br>
As it is, I will give the book up for a reroll between all Paladins who were present. I'll get with Bakanome, Durum and Tinwin in game and set up a time and place for it.<br>

That one WAS bad.  Misunderstandings...  But the RBB did go to a rogue that is using it.   End of Story.  Raid leader overruled the casters, basically, and rules were modified for the future.  Yay.  The runed bolster belt does have stats that a caster could use, and would be better than their current belt.  It can happen with any ALL/ALL item that happens to be great for one class and so so for another, with a need-before-greed situation.  <br>
<br>
I dont think its an accurate reflection of our raiding situation overall.<br>
<br>
As to the book, I was zoning as the book was rolled on, and so I missed the conversation, but I do remember Meledi letting me know that Suo won by rolling, and that &quot;hardly anyone rolled against her&quot;.<br>

<br>
The epic for all people is a level of achievement, especially to have earned it.  I am not implying that Suo didn't by my last statement, just that I understand peoples over powering desire to get it.  And remember on many other servers 3 raids is a dream come true for one of the books.<br>

It was not my wish that people would be pressured, and I don't like it one bit that they felt so. I claimed no loot, and I asked for all paladins to roll. As I was the raid leader, I hoped they would listen to me.<br>

I tried to make it clear that all paladins were allowed to roll. I am left wondering what I did to make them think otherwise.<br>

You are not at fault for the presuring in any way shape or form, in my opinion.  Even when there were calls in the raid thread on the Fellowship board for you to reserve the item, you still stood by the concept of it being unreserved.<br>
<br>
As I was there last night (and had an awesome time on my first ever dragon raid), I will attest to the fact there was a long pause between the call for the roll on the book and the awarding of it, all the while Suometar was asking for others to roll.  I don't know why her log shows such a short time (and unfortunately I cannot access my log right now since I am at work).  <br>
<br>
Not being a paladin and only nearly 46, I can't know what it is like, yet, to have to watch as yet another piece to my own epic goes to someone else.  I don't even think any of mine are level capped (not just TLCed), so I won't have to agonise over staying one level perpetually if I want my epic.  I don't think -any- of us who aren't Paladins stuck at 52 can really know the feeling.<br>
<br>
Oh... and as a side note, Bakanome was not an &quot;invitee&quot;, he is a member of a guild that is a full member of the Fellowship.  I also do not think he joined Saga as only a means to get into Fellowship raids as a member of a member guild to further his own goals.  Not all of us sign posts with our guild tag or not always.<br>

<br>
Personally, I'd put most of this on the non-roller's shoulders and just move on.  I've missed bidding on drops I've wanted many times during raids due to inattention to the loot calls -- typically setting things up for the next set of pulls in dungeon crawl raids or working on CR for dead people.  It happens.  It's not the end of the world.  Calling for a solution that starts out &quot;if everyone would ..&quot; usually fails.  OTH, those that start with &quot;if I would ..&quot; usually succeed.  So, remember to roll and be sure to insist on it if you know you'll be upset later if you don't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blakkon>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 576<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/02 7:04:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This one is an odd one</span><hr size=1> &quot;Oh... and as a side note, Bakanome was not an &quot;invitee&quot;, he is a member of a guild that is a full member of the Fellowship.

It is being talked out on the Fellowship boards, to whatever extent I can get it moved there, and it is being talked out on the Saga board also.  Which is why I tried to shut this down as fast as possible after it appeared here.  This really isn't Soapbox material, since no one is interested in flaming anyone about it.  Just one of those little problems that creeps up, that needs to be dealt with.  But dealt with behind closed doors, certainly.<br>
<br>
It's of some interest to the community, I suppose.  I know I didn't really understand the issues regarding this sort of &quot;fairness&quot; that I would be encountering before I started leading raids.  Finding some distribution system everyone can be comfortable with has got to be the second hardest thing about raiding, ranked just after the task of unearthing a sufficent number of clerics.  If anyone is reading this thread just for interests' sake, that's the major lesson I would offer.  Think about it in advance, you will need to.<br>
<br>
Mainly I think the discussion on the Fellowship board has been sluggish because our EZBoard server seems to be in slow-mo.  Not sure what's wrong with it but everyone is mentioning that.  Everyone concerned is thinking sincerely about how to avoid misunderstandings in the future, and that's the main thing.  And Suometar has stated her intension to roll for the book against each and every paladin who was at the raid, as I pretty much expected she would. Not sure what will come of that, but I do know she would offer.<br>
<br>
Once again, that's my position as Saga's ambassador to the Fellowship.  I won't be posting again.  Folks can keep this thread alive here if they want to, but I'd really suggest otherwise.  And no, Oglith, the mods won't lock this just because we ask.  Come on, you're enough of a Soapbox veteran to know that.  I don't like having this here anymore than you do, but the way to make it go away is just to stop posting.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As I will now.<br>

Locking this thread... in part because I play favorites to the RP crowd...<br>

It's not a punishment lock or anything, so if Bakanome or friends wants to continue the discussion in a new thread they're more than welcome.  But it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>sounds</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like things are being resolved in game and on Fellowship boards (assuming it's somewhere at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub69.ezboard.com/bthefellowship62953">pub69.ezboard.com/bthefellowship62953</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, Ezboard moving too slow for me to dig around and find the exact thread).<br>
