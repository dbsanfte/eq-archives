He had been here for a week, and Biddleback's Ale Hous was becoming his new home... The bar had gotten full as the news spread from clan to clan of his arrival and his Tales... King Mac, father of Dihce the exiled, had come to hear these fantastic tales of Ogur honor and battle...<br>
&quot;Ach... Tael mae ah tael ,&quot;<br>
&quot;Very Well... hmmm... what tell should it be... hmmm... how about my Tale... the story of my life... yes that'll be it... Sit down my gud King and listen to the Tales of my like... Battle... Freindship... Honor... and Ogur Romance... HAR HAR HAR<br>
Drachma sat back in his stool... and ordered Swill for he and the King...And his tale began<br>
<br>
My Tale... started when I came to Oggok... and began to learn from a rather scrawny Halfling teacher captured by my mother... trying to raid from her cubbords... but having a kindly nature she did not feed him to me... but he taught me the way of other races... that would probably be the reason I do not speak as other Ogurs... any way on my 5th season... I began my training in the Shadowknight arts... as the custom was for my line... I went out and slaughtered all I saw... As I neared 6 my mother gave me a scroll... with the ancient teachings of Trachma I and Drach, my ancient ancestors, and also gave me a letter of Introduction to Oaggrak the Strong... the Holder and protector of my father's most sacred possesion... The Gooranga Spiked Club... as I took it from him... a power erupted from me... Rallos Zek gave to me power unimaginable... and I went Insane... Madness gripped my heart and I stalked off... Wolves stood at my side as I killed Shopkeepers and took from their flesh... as my ancestor Trachma I had done... Then when I neared my 8 th season Rallos Zek visited me once Again and binded my soul to his... and I was more then mortal... I was part of a God... but I was still Mortal... <br>
I began walking down a path towards the river... living with the thought of Killing and eating people who I knew was to much for me and I prepared to drown myself... then I caught a glimpse of a Shaman about my size... and I ran over to him... His name was Gloorm... and We grouped together... and began hunting... joy was back in my heart, though every ounce of disipline kept me from going back to the huts and eating the Ogurs there...<br>
As I began to reach my 10th season, a thought over whelmed me, I should Join a guild to learn more of the other races, I began searching the many Orgurs and races that traveled into the Ferrott until I met a Human... he gave me a letter of Introduction to Aalini, a Barbarian... I then made my way to the Oasis of Marr, and camped at the Docks their until finially she made her pressence known in the guise of a wolf... Thinking the Wolves of Rallos Zek were again to be by my side I Called it ... but it vcame not... It began to speak in a foreign language... &quot;Aer ye Draechma...Ogre&quot; <br>
&quot;What language you speak...&quot;<br>
Understanding my pridicment began speaking Human...<br>
As the hours passed I was let in... Then after many seasons as I was hunting Orcs with Gloorm... I met a Troll... called Axus and annother a younger Troll named Nazkak... We hunted<br>
had been hunting for many seasons, when a young maiden... Named Thryth came and asked about the Ogur and Trolls beside me... I explained to her of who they were and translated all they said vicea versa... and They were let into the Family of Tribulation...<br>
<br>
As the Seasons past I began thinking of my fathers death and knew my answers could only be found in Neriak... As I searched Neriak a lovely Dark Elf came to me and pushed me into her room...(/ooc Soory can't go further on that tale... It was true but can't go further...hehehehe)<br>
After words I met an Ogur... named Kraker... we became freinds right away... and hunted in the mountains of Lava Storms... that is where I met the love of this Ogurs young Life... Stariza... The three of us hunted and pillaged the countryside... and as the time went on Kraker joined the ranks of Trib... Stariza however had began to join a guild...<br>
My love for her grew and Grew then I found from the Ogurs of Neriak that the Greenbloods wander the mountains of Butcher Block... I asked Stariza to come with me but she could not... she begged me to stay but I knew that I had to avenge my father's murder by some unknown killer... I journeyed to Freeport and finding the first of the ignorant racism of humans from the militia of Freeport I began to charge the city... knowing I was not strong enough gave up... I went to the Guild hall... and requested Help... a young magician stood up... &quot;I am Urth, I will help you...&quot;<br>
Urth cast invis on the me and I made my way to the docks and set sail for Faydwer...<br>
<br>
Urth showed me the many dangers of the land... and I began to journey farther and farther tot he center of the land... Finding a Greenblood, I interogatted him and found the Truth of what happened... High Elf Platinum... was the source... and Erudite greed... Deciding to make my time spent here worthwhile I began journeying to Dagnor's Cauldron... and marveling at the beauty of the place where the last battle was fought in the Dwarven-Ogre war... I entered Unrest and Hunted... and spent 4 seasons hunting in the zone... As  time went on I sent a message to Gloorm to hurry here and take advantage... Season's went by and I decided to explore more... then I saw it the Spires...<br>
I gained passage to Luclin... and I feared the worst... And my horror was realized... Trachma's bane had survived... the combine had flourished here... anger pulsed within me and suicidle thoughts entered into my mind and began to deul for money... defeating all in my path... 26 victories and I still wasn't satisfied... Then came my only defeat to a Dark Elf... who allowed me to live... and calmed my mind... Rallos Zek began to pulse even stronger within me and the image of my father's murder began to play inside me... as I witnessed the Erudites murder him... I swore vengence that day... and vowed to kill every last God that dared to hold me to the curse... Rallos Zek was pleased and he began granting my every desire... I am Drachma, Son of Trach... One with Zek...<br>
<br>
Drachma stood up chugged the last of his Swill... patted King Mac and walked up to his room to sleep... The Barbarians departed and awaited his next tale <p><HTML><BODY>
