I can't see how you could rez KoS to CoV people in any of the hallways north of the door.  The chicks are certain to agro and kill the freshly rez'd people -- no safe spots there for rez'ing.  I've pulled both of them south, but I really <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>hate</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> doing that.  If you don't clear the hub, someone KoS always gets too close and pulls a train.  If you do clear it, it takes a long time.<br>
<br>
I don't think anything beats having a CotH mage on CoV and CotH'ing up to the pre-Aary corner as far as efficiency for ToV goes.  Run CoV mage up to corner pot before Aary, CotH FD'ers, invis rogues, 10-min invis'ers, then clerics.  Kill chicks when the first short invis breaks all the while the coth team chugs away at summoning the raid.  Once you get used to the chick break, it typically takes about 40-60 minutes to do both Ikky+Eashen if you pull North instead of South.  'Course by the time you get that used to them, you probably don't care about the drops, either.<br>
<br>
BTW, I've pulled all of TOV both KoS and not.  The only time I really cared about being non-KoS was very early on learning the zone and for questing.  It was very helpful for both of those activities.  Using FD/q on names wasn't worth the effort to me after completing the quest.  Knowing how easy it is when you have a non-KoS CotH'er makes me very unwilling to use a slower more difficult method.  Also, my preference is to save tools like a vox-stick or rez goo for something more unexpected in the way of CR than to burn them up on a normal insertion.<br>
<br>
THink we've diverged enough from the alignment issues for RP'ing and raiding guilds issue yet?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=witherweaver>Witherweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 356<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 11:01:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1951.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For the ..</span><hr size=1> &quot;.. &quot;hallway before ikky/eashen&quot;, you mean one of the cubby-holes in the hub?

We've done it before.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've pulled both of them south, but I really hate doing that. If you don't clear the hub, someone KoS always gets too close and pulls a train. If you do clear it, it takes a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
You only need to rez a mage and cleric, then you can coth everyone into a corner on top of each other.  And tell them not to move.<br>
<br>
The hallway to which I'm referring is the one just west of the door to the Aary/Eashan corridors.  After going nort at the Hot/WToV/NToV intersection, take the first door left past the ancient wyverns, past that room is hallway, the east wall of which is safe to coth to or rez as long as you don't move far.<br>
<br>
As for divergence, my point was that *technically* no class is &quot;necessary&quot; - that is, every class has a substitute, it's just a question of whether or not that substitution is sensible  (like, susbtituting a handfull of druids for a cleric isn't really practical, nor is using paladins and necros for rezzes all the time).  You never actually want to substitute, but in theory it's possible.<br>

<br>
This is innacurate aggro has nothing to do with spell immunity. As a Paladin I use my level 9 and 15 stuns to build aggro. they are cheap and fast casting I can also toss in flash of light if needed. The fact that mobs past 55 are immune to the stun effects of these spells, has no bearing on them still being royally ticked of at me for trying to cast it on them. For purely aggro purposes paladins can Hold aggro just fine even against chain casting wizards. ( well maybe not if said wizard was actually trying to get aggro for some strange reason <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I always have to use FD to drop agro during fights when a paladin is tanking.  Even warriors hold agro better than paladins.  Root is about the only thing a paladin can do to help manage agro and root is not applicable for nearly every raid-level target you could name.<br>
<br>
For raids and non-warrior tanking roles, you're looking mostly for a class that can grab agro instantly and play with a critter for a long time to keep it from annoying the raid to death.  Both SK and Pal have the HP, AC, and self-healing to do that.  SK has far better agro -- they can grab anything nearly instantly.  Pal has better self-healing.  Of the two, the agro is typically far more important.  That's why you usually see only SK's doing the off-tanking for raids.  It's not because paladins can't, but because SK's are better keeping agro.<br>
<br>
The other reason SK's do the off-tanking is that Paladins make great back-line healers for AE damage.  SK's can't do that.  I love having a Paladin in group during a raid on AE stuff.  Wave of healing, high hp, and the general melee-gear orientation of a paladin compared to other healers (hp, ac, resists) means the back line stays alive for sure with a paladin healing it.  Eh, that and the fact that if there's no paladin healing the back line, there's typically no one at all healing it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 640<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/02 2:11:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1951.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh, I've never grouped ..</span><hr size=1> You aren't grouping with the right Paladins.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Credit where credit is due, and to Willus this time.  Tanking in the Plane of Nightmare, at level 52, he was able to hold agro so well that I (the enchanter) was able to throw Tash almost the moment the pull was engaged, and I was done casting slow most times before the pull got below 90%.  There was about a literal three second pause between tash and the slow, and that's all.<br>
<br>
This is a very old argument and I don't have an informed opinion, since I haven't played both to significantly high level.  But believe me, I've had the pleasure of working with some great paladin tanks.<br>
<br>
Valquiss<br>
<br>
P.S.  Willus was over-equiped for his level, but not with procing weapons.  The equipment was what kept him able to tank in Nightmare effectively at that level.  But the spells held the agro, and any paladin has access to the same. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~02rybakj/Valquisssig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=witherweaver>Witherweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 363<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/02 2:41:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1951.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh, I've never grouped ..</span><hr size=1> Paladins are on par with Shadow Knights for holding agro, though Shadow Knights are probably better.

<br>
All else being equal, for melee agro,<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights &gt; Paladins &gt; Warriors &gt; Monks,rogues, etc.<br>
<br>
..Assuming that the warrior is decently equipped (dual wielding fast weapons with a good agro proc, SoD's or the like).  If your warrior isn't well equipped monks and rogues can easily bump ahead of him, but then they usually end up getting plowed if they fail to escape/evade/FD.<br>
<br>
Of course chanters, wizards, and shamans can almost always steal agro easily if they want to, but they tend to either die or give up their agro to someone else (concussion, etc).<br>
<br>
However,  a good Shadow Knight with KEI can keep agro from a chain nuking wizard if the wizard gives him a few second (5+ probably) at the beginning of the fight.<br>
