I met a guy there around 10th season and I befriended him and we grouped a lot and even though I leveled faster then he did, I helped him a lot on that server, because we had a friendship.<br><br>Well that was last summer and autumn.  Anyway, I just returned back to the Firiona Vie server a couple weeks ago.  I have a second account for the purpose of blacksmithy.  Many know this.  Anyway, was chatting on MSN messenger with this guy from fennin ro, the day before I came back, and thinking that it would be cool if he came over to the server, I asked him if he would.<br><br>He said it would not be worth the effort to start over on a new server, unless I could help him out a bit.  I said sure, I would be willing to powerlevel and let him use some of the items from my second account's character.<br><br>Well, both of my accounts at that time were closed since I had been gone from Friona Vie for 3 months.  This guy already had two pc's and two accounts of his own.  I gave him the login and password to my second account so he could transfer only the items he could use off of my character onto his new paladin.  (OK this is where I expect everyone to flame me...dont give out your login and password...yada yada yada). <br><br>Anyway, he was pysched about going to the new server now, and I was thinking this would be pretty cool too.<br><br>After we got off the MSN chat , I was thinking about all the stuff my Blacksmithy paladin had on him, items that really had just the sole purpose of helping with his blacksmithy, like jewelry I spent a lot of plat on which add a lot to both INT and STR simultaneously, and a ring of the Goblin Lords I looted from Sol A, plus a testament of vanear and a stein of moggok.  So basically the jewelry , the testament and the stein I did not want him to take or keep.  And I immediately sent him an email requesting that he leave those items on my guy since they are not instrumental to be a paladin, and my guy needed the stats the provide in his blacksmithy.<br><br>Still he would be getting a cracked darkwood shield, cloak of the icebear, sporali defenders blade, Blackened Alloy Bastards Sword, bracer of elrossi, full set of banded armor, and some spore covered armor.  ( all of which are items I looted or made myself )<br><br>Well, the next day I logged onto Anloq and found him completely naked, except for two toolboxes and some food and water.  When my friend got on, I asked him if he got my email and he said 'no'.<br><br>Anyway let me cut to the chase.<br><br>He ended up giving me the jewelry back and the stein and testament, though he was not happy about it.  HOW CAN HE NOT BE HAPPY ?!!  But (because I am nice and we had been through so much on a previous server), I spent 8 - 10 hrs powerleveling him.  Plus, I gave him the jewelry back around his 10th season under the condition that he return it to me by his 15th season, and he agreed.<br><br>I figured it would take him 2 days to get to 15 and Anloq would not need it before then.  Well, he decides to reroll his high elf paladin just before his 15th season and makes Qizzinart a half elf paladin.  WTF.<br><br>I ask for my jewelry back now, because Anloq needs it for his blacksmithy.  'Rerolling' was not part of the arrangment, and now it will take him much longer for him to make 15, (esp since I was not planning to powerlevel him again-though I did not tell him this yet.).  I have been generous to him so far, in exchange for nothing.  Even on the other server, in reflection, I realized I was always the giver and he the taker.<br><br>Well, he says, &quot;no way&quot;.  He states that the conditions of the arrangement were that he can keep the jewelry until his 15 th level.  He insisted that he needed the str now, since his character's strength is only 80.  <br><br>I say 80?  wtf.  What did you put your stat points in?  He insists that a half elf paladins base starting is 65.<br><br>Bullshit, while we are talking about this in MSN chat , while I am at work, I go to the casterrealm site, and paste the link to it for him to go there too.<br><br>Clearly it states the base str at 80.  So, if str was so important to him why didnt he put points into it to bring it up to at the most 100?  He eventually states that he was wrong and put his points into wisdom.<br><br>Well, that's not my problem.  I want my jewelry back.  None of this was part of the deal.  Anloq had a lot of ornate chainmail to make and I dont want to lose any of the materials to failure without having all of my int items equipt:  Items I spent alot of time acquiring.<br><br>to be continued. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p><b><font color = "blue"><i>- Anders Silverblade-/<a href="http://pub69.ezboard.com/bthefellowship62953">Vagabond of the Fellowship</a>/-<br></i></font></b><br><b><font color = "purple">"This above all : to thine own self be true."<br>William Shakespeare, Hamlet  <br><br></font><font color = "green"><br><a href="http://andrewpc.homestead.com/index.html"></a></font></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umidwestpatriot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MidwestPatriot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/02 12:38:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=516.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Do not trust Qizzinart, the half elf paladin !!!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ok continued...<br><br>He refuses to give me my jewelry back.

Your fault for giving him the account information, but I'll go easy on ya for that, cause you can't always tell someone is a jerkoff ahead of time.<br><br>Second, and much more your fault is giving the stuff back to him the second time, after him being an ass about giving it back. <br><br>You are correct it is not your fault he's a dumbass and put all his points in wisdom, which is really a second or third consideration for a pally. STR being #1, STA being another. <br><br>If the agreement was 15th season, that meant for THAT character. The yagoff re-roll's, not your problem. This person would no longer be on my friends list, and once I got my stuff back, would be on /ignore pretty quick. <br><br>You really have no remedy here from the GM's unfortunately, so your kinda out of luck. Just hope this guy gets 15 soon and THEN decides to give you your stuff back. <br><br>/agrees with your decision to post his name etc...
