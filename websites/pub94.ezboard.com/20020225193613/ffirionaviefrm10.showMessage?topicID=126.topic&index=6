He read it over and over, thought about what it meant, what she was trying to say, and how he could possibly respond.  It was truly over.  Nothing more could be said or done to change that, it was over.<br>
He ran across her at random points, mostly just exchanging a smile, or waving hi.  He didn’t speak to her anymore, cause he simply didn’t know what to say.  He still wanted to be friends with her, she was amazing, and he enjoyed spending time with her more than he liked doing anything else.  But it was so hard to spend time with her, wanting it to be more than what it was.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One day she cornered him, and forced him into a conversation.  And they talked about a lot of stuff, the normal chitchat conversation starters that everyone does so as to make the conversation more comfortable.  Slowly, the topic wound its way to be about them, and the way things were between them.  He sensed a chance here, there could be an opportunity to resurrect everything, and to bring about the relationship that should be.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You know,” he casually mentioned, “we’ll always have questions about the two of us and what could have been.  There’s one way to answer those questions right here and right now.  A simple kiss would solve all the problems.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve been down that route before,” she turned and answered. “And it didn’t work out prettily.  Besides, I don’t have any questions, and I don’t wonder anymore.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He reeled from that last statement, and felt his heart drop out of him.  Not even a week ago, she had questioned everything she knew, wondered if what she had was as great as she thought, and dreamt about life with him.  How could that have changed so quickly?  How?  It just wasn’t possible.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I love you, as deeply as one person can love another, but strictly in a plutonic way.  I don’t think about life with you anymore.  I don’t know why it stopped, but it did.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The world was going dizzy, everything was spinning, and he couldn’t breathe.  Why did she affect him like this?  Could it be possible?  He had never been with her, admittedly they’d shared a bed, twice now, but nothing more than cuddling had ever happened.  They had talked a lot, and shared small pieces of their soul, and the more he learned, the more engrossed with her he became, and wanted to know every and anything about her.  Could it be?  Could he be falling in love with this girl, and not even realizing it?  He truly hoped not, another heartbreak like that would destroy him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day she wasn’t in the market, but a flame from his past was.  She quickly recognized him and ran up to him, hugging him, and kissing his cheek.  She pulled back, and he looked in her eyes, and saw comfort, saw love, saw home.  They went to a local tavern and drank and talked about the old days until early in the morning, when she went home with him.  In the morning, she got up early and left.  When he awoke, she had just returned, and moved her stuff back in.  Once again they were together, and he smiled, pulled her over to him, and fell back asleep.  Comfortable, safe, and happy in her arms.<br>
