She was quite pleased with herself today as she had had what she would call a successful first day of gathering.<br><br>&quot;Ahh...this is the life.&quot;, she sighed to herself, &quot;out of that boring classroom and out on my own ready for adventure!&quot;<br><br>She checked her belt pouch which was brimming with rat whiskers she had collected from those poor diseased rats that seemed to be quite common in the hills.  Her teachers in the Temple of Deep Musing had given lengthly lectures on the various fauna in the region and hinted that the local merchants would pay good copper or even silver for various parts of these animals. <br><br>Jaynee just couldn't bring herself to harm the cute little rats that squeeked about scavenging for food, and the lil baby kobolds running around barking and growling she found sorta cute.  The diseased rats were okay as they were suffering, she was doing them a favour. <br><br>Thinking about other animals she had seen today, she decided that her favourite were the great sleek pumas that prowled regions further in the hills. She recalled her teachers &quot;Beware the pumas, as they have been known to think a gnome as prey!&quot;  Jaynee discounted the notion in her head, &quot;They just need some good ol love!&quot;, she said out loud, and giggled to herself.<br><br>Now that she thought about it she really wished she could have been a druid.  Friends with all the animals and turning into trees sure sounded like fun.  &quot;I think I'll ask that druid lady that lives nearby how to go about...&quot;<br><br>Jaynee gasped in shock as a sharp pain entered her chest...looking down she saw the tip of a rusty sword protruding there dripping her own blood.   Her vision started to fade as she slumped to the ground...<br><br>...<br>...<br><br>Hazel climbed what seemed the hundredth hill muttering to herself, &quot;I don't seem to recall the part in my dark visions of grandeur, where I was striking terror in the local rat population and amassing a horde of rat parts...emissay of Bertoxxulous indeed I'm a glorified exterminator...&quot;, still cursing under her breath she approached Jabober who was standing over its latest kill.<br><br>&quot;Whiskers or fur this time Jab? ...I swear this is just sooo...&quot;, she stopped abruptly as she realized it was no dead rat Jabober was standing over.  She approched slowly and nudged the crumpled body with her boot.  It rolled over and Hazel gasped to see it was Jaynee!  She had lived a few houses over from her in her childhood.<br><br> Hazel stood there silent for a moment, then shrugged.  &quot;I never liked that annoying *#$@% anyways......oooh a big pile of whiskers here in her belt!  That saves us some time eh, Jab?&quot;, she grinned.<br><br>&quot;Well let's get back to town, we have some dealings in rat parts that need to be taken care of....poor Jaynee she really should have kept a eye out for those nasty 'pumas' eh Jab?&quot;, she giggled and elbowed Jabober in the leg.  Jabober stood there staring vacantly, not noticing in the slightest that Hazel's elbowing had caused one of its teeth to fall to the ground.<br><br>Hazel skipped along humming a quiet tune while basking in the glorious sunshine.  She was quite pleased with herself today as she had had what she would call a successful first day of gathering...<br><br>/ooc Coming to join the ranks of FV =)<br>Looking forward to seeing you all!<br><br>Hazel...cute lil menace!<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvengyr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vengyr</A> at: 3/30/02 6:44:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 322<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/31/02 8:24:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lunarpages.com/maladominus/exhibit/malasmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A lovely day in Steamfont...</span><hr size=1> wow! <br><br>after reading her background story.... what serendipitous blessing from the Plaguebringer that I stumbled into Hazel wandering about Qeynos and making her pilgrimage to the Shrine of Bertox.....she has been an awesome participant in the Dread Gnome Pirates! <br><br>arrrr! <br><br>/em gives Hazel her tricorn pirate hat <br><br> <p>--<BR><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=143287">Maladominus Poxbringer </A><BR>Munchkin Plaguecaster, Evil Pirate, Sex Symbol</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A> at: 4/2/02 8:54:11 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showPrevMessage?topicID=29.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showNextMessage?topicID=29.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.threadControl?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48>Ye Olde Coffeeshop</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
