She found herself in a place that reminded her vaguely of Neriak--dark charcoal stone buildings, appearing blueish gray with her night vision.  In the distance, she could hear sounds...sounds that while she couldn't quite place what they were, seemed to be suited to this type of location.  Sometimes, as if in a form of ritual, creatures hidden out of sight from her would lift their voices in praise to the Father and Creator, Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
As she moved amongest the corridors and buildings, wondering aimlessly, she caught sight of some of the creatures of this strange land.  Minions of Innoruuk all...from Clerics and Disciples of The Father, to the Spite Golems and Revultant Rats...all were like her in one aspect...a creature of Innoruuk.  And from all of this, from the stone walls and parapets guarded by gargoyles to the cobbled stones beneath her feet, a Presence existed.  It was for Kallee as if every pore of her being was infiltrated with this presence, as if it throbbed within everything around her.  She could feel it, taste it, breath and smell it...she was sure if she looked close enough, she could see it and touch it.  The presence of Hate.  It filled her, ran through her veins and permeated her heart.  The familiarity of that one single emotion that she used to define herself.<br>
<br>
She felt at Home.<br>
<br>
A commotion broke out somewhere near her, and she whirled around and followed the sound.  There before her, in a courtyard like area, stood a horde of adventurers, dressed in their fighting best, weilding weapons the likes of which she had only dreamed of.  A cold sensation of reality hit her...Lightwalkers, every one of them.  Humans and elves, gnomes and dwarves, they had entered this place, her Home, and they were killing with exacting precision the minions of her Father.   And she realized, if they spied her, they would kill her as well.  She hid into the shadows and watched the fights...<br>
<br>
And then, after a particularly grueling scene, where Kallee believed perhaps the creature would defeat these interlopers, a Paladin dealt the death blow.  With its dying breath, the creature hissed a warning, &quot;Foolish mortals....By following the path of hate you will become a tool of Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kallee gasped, and the Paladin turned, perhaps sensing her in the shadows.  &quot;Be careful, young one.  You may be next,&quot; she said, waving her sword towards the dark elf...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And Kallee awoke with a start, reaching instinctively for her weapon.  She sat up then, and took several deep breaths.  It was a dream, and yet so real.  Could such a place exist?  Surely not in this world, Kallee thought.  But she was disturbed on a deeper level.  She was certain, the dying hiss of the creature was directed at her.  Hate....it is the way of Innoruuk, of this she had learned even as a child.  Yet she had thought foolishly she could guard her hate for herself, and use it to her own advantage.  Assuming that following her path would put her in direct confrontation with The Father, she had accepted these consequences.  Now she was not certain.  She thought more on it while trying to retain the fading images of the dream.  Could a Teir`Dal ever work without Innoruuk beside them, stoking the hate?  Perhaps regardless of what she did, her choices and actions, she would always end up a tool of Innoruuk.  And if so, what did that mean of her future?...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p>Kallee<BR>
