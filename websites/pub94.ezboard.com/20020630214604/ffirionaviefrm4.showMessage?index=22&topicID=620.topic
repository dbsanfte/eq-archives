<br>
Reason 2) Only 1 character per account rule, Rep's are more valuable here, on my old server (and any other of the 30+ ones) someone can be a ass, ninja loot naggy etc, KS whatever from whoever and at the end of the day, sell it all, and make a new char and lvl back to 50+ within a week with all the phat gear he scammed out of people.  1 char per account deters the people that would do that from this server, cus they have to click delete<br>
<br>
Reason 3) newer server, alot hasnt been done yet.<br>
<br>
Reason 4) 99% of items are not no drop<br>
<br>
Reason 5) As of yet there are no uba euro guilds Killing ever big mob before the rest of us wake up<br>
<br>
Thats 5 good reason i can think of off the top of my head.. i'm sure given the time I can remember the others<br>

She'll get respect from me over that pretty much indefinitely.<br>
<br>
Reply 2) - 5) <br>
<br>
This server was created as the &quot;role-playing&quot; preferred server for a reason.  The ruleset was developed<br>
here for a reason.  These 2 things have gone hand in hand.  When it no longer has a majority of players who care about role-playing, then you'll be seeing the &quot;uber euro guilds&quot;, and all the other things you didn't like elsewhere, because then we'll end up just like the other servers.<br>
<br>
So you end up coming across as someone who wants all the advantages of being *near* the roleplayers, now if only you didn't actually have to cope with them.... oh dear.....<br>
<br>
Instead of complaining about RPers, you should be out there thanking them every goddamned day for letting this &quot;experiment&quot; of Verant's go as far and as well as it has.  You should be Roleplaying your little heart out, at least 5 minutes a day, when it doesn't cost you anything else, to help maintain the atmosphere we have here.<br>
<br>
You should be hanging out in the newbie yards, helping people by your own behavior learn what it means to roleplay here, and what might be expected of them, not as you suggested in your original post, some kind of condescending patronage, but folks who actually enjoy taking time with newbies whose only &quot;crime&quot; is that they don't have a clue to help get one.<br>
<br>
And to answer the subject/topic of your post, some RP'ers are soo lame because out of any given group of people, some of them are lame.  Take 1000 ballet fans, and some of them are lame.  Take 1000 football players and some of them are lame.  Take 1000 network news anchors and most of the them are lame (ha-ha).  Take 1000 politicians and 998 of them are lame.<br>
<br>
I myself don't try to go around *dictating* to others how they should do their roleplaying.  But people who use /shout for inappropriate topics, /auction anywhere but cities or for inappropriate topics, etc., are going to get on my bad side regardless of whether they're RPing at the moment or not.<br>
<br>
And people who *demand* my attention and assistance in dungeons and then put down my role-playing that I'm trying to do with them as a result of their own behavior - well, 'dey don get nuttin'.<br>

<br>
To me, it always seems as though the folks that make an effort to stay in character are a lot nicer than those who dont.   Yes, there's some folks that play evil characters and use this to justify their rude behavior... but on this one character server, they dont last long.<br>
<br>
I dont beat up on folks that dont roleplay using &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;O'I&quot;.. but if they start spewing ooc comments, yes I will beat up on them =P  So maybe I am a roleplay freak.. or maybe I simply have trouble maintaining my roleplay illusion when someone else is discussion the latest football scores or the fact Fire and Fury or Resolution killed uber_mob03 again. (So what, I say!)<br>
<br>
For being on a roleplaying recommended server... you gotta get used to roleplayers... just dont stray into ooc and I'll be fine.  <br>
<br>
As to the reasons you are here... I agree with Ayida. You like the rules? Then help keep the server alive, keep the atmosphere alive the way it is. It isn't folks that dont roleplay that keep that atmosphere, that's for sure. <br>

That is what I see ooc, shout and auction used for on other servers.<br>
<br>
Its not a hard thing to respect the intent of the original channels. Disrespecting that intent, disrespects the roleplayers on this server, since the system is set up for them. Complaining and arguing about your right to misuse a system at others expense will get no support from me.<br>
<br>
Even the complaints regarding roleplayers attitude belongs on other servers. <br>
<br>
/ooc: If someone in a restaurant is shouting stupid comments so that everyone on the block can hear it - I will complain. Both to the restaurant owners and to the police eventually, if it continues. The person who made the shouts is not able to stand behind a &quot;I can so I will&quot; attitude; disturbing the peace is disturbing the peace and it punished accordingly. Just because we have a limited police force on FV, doesn't inherently mean you are right. People here are just able to be more vocal about their RP wants and needs than on other servers. Ooc shouts and auctions interfere heavily with their game play, and completely unnecessarily.<br>
<br>
We have rules here, we like them enforced more stringly than on other servers. Verant stopped helping us, so we started taking it into our own hands. No appologies, now or ever, for simply expecting that people use the various channels as they had been designed, and as they are clearly marked EVERY time you use them.<br>
<br>
If you didn't start to use the shout and auction channels in an inappropriate manner, then this issue would never arise. You started the problem. YOU asked for a response, by broadcasting so all could hear. Then, whatever answer you get, you label as &quot;anal&quot;. Clearly, you think more of yourself and your opinion than you do of other peoples, and you insist on broadcasting it loudly and inappropriately.  Essentially, you demand us to drop roleplaying to cater to your dimwitted, self serving attitude. &quot;I don't care if they are roleplaying, I am not and I should be able to wreck their environment by misusing the game tools provided.&quot; Putz.<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, it is your choice to be rude to others, and to broadcast your opinions on a channel that requires all to hear when you already know 90% of them have nothing to do with the comment. But, you are judged by your choices when you decide to ignore other players requests to respect them. <br>

Came directly after my post and used the word Jerks wich I took as Plural as in more than one Jerk. And figured you may have been pointing at me as well as Raines. And being as it was a personal attack responded in kind. Although judjing by your above stated opinion one could come to the conclusion that you fall under the Hardcore RP catagory refered to above. That in my opinion is no better than a Hardcore d00d. Im just glad I have alot of friends that fall into the happy medium catagory. Sure hope you enjoy getting into other peoples buisness and infringing on other peoples play style. Because RP or D00d your still no better if thats how you play.<br>

Everybody is biased.  Everybody is still allowed to have their opinion.  Ellywig even apologized for taking things to a personal level - not that I see Ellywig as responsible for that - things were getting personal long before then and yet you still feel the need to try to bash her (it is a her right?  I can never tell with those gnomes... it's just so much effort to look down at them).<br>
<br>
Don't bash the gnome.  Now gnome punting... that's another story...  Come Jabober, let's play ball <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Erm...  If you had actually read the story behind the frogs, you'd realize that they are actually the equivilent of the High Elves on Antonica.  They are a perfectly good race.  Killing a live froglok who wasn't trying to kill me is ENTIRELY against my paladin's belief structure, and there's no way in hell that I'd ever do anything but duel trolls for killing the frogloks.  Why do you think there is a quest for Ghoulbane now?  Simple.  A lot of paladins complained that there was no RP reason for getting a holy sword by dragging it from the cold, dead fingers of another, uncorrupted paladin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=620.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=620.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=620.topic&index=29><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=620.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=620.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=620.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
