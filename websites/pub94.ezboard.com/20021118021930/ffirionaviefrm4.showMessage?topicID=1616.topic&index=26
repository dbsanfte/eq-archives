<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This guy made a good point<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
How do you know exactly, if you don't read the post where he tries to make the point? The fact is that there were many other bad things said in that thread that bear relevance to Tzaroth's comments. The reason he brought those quotes here is because he was going to flame the guy and instead of doing it in General chat he thought he would bring it to the soapbox (at least that's what I can guess. No other reason to do so). Kinda funny that you throw your lot in with someone you never even met without taking the time to see what the fuss was all about. Reminds me of the dad trying to put their kid's bike together without reading the instructions and then taking it back and bitching at the store that sold it to him when he screws it up.<br>

Refer to all of my previous statements if you still don't get why this pisses people off. Personally, I have and will continue to welcome new players to this server unless the new player comes in and starts badmouthing one of the reasons this server was started his first day. I'm sorry that you were treated so badly by other players when you decided to start playing on FV. I'm sure you RP just fine and I'm sure you have spent a lot of time fleshing out your Baldisking character and family Rugisbad. But when you started, if the first words out of your mouth upon landing on the shores of FV were &quot;I could give a #### about roleplay.&quot; I would have treated you poorly as well. <p><div align=center>

To me, it's about respect. Am I a hardcore roleplayer, no, but I do roleplay sometimes with certain people, I have no backstory though or anything like that.<br>
 <br>
However, just because I don't roleplay much, and my guild is not a RP guild, doesn't mean I don't have respect for the people that do. At all times since I started here I have always been aware that this is a roleplay preferred server and respect it as such, and respect the roleplay community.<br>
<br>
When someone roleplays with me, sometimes I roleplay back a bit, but I always speak in complete sentences and never use &quot;lol&quot; abbreviations, et al, when I'm in range of other people's earshot, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Basically, if I'm not in guildchat or private conversations, I don't say anything where others can hear me ooc. Who am I to ruin someone's experience? Is my fun more important? No. Being a part of the community and thinking of your fellow players is more important. I do enjoy seeing other's roleplay, I've seen some great encounters, and I think those that ignore it or disdain it are really missing out.<br>
<br>
I came to this server because I was brand new to the game and had no clue what all those different servers meant, and roleplay preferred sounded interesting. But I didn't come here for just roleplay, nor loot, nor tlc or no drop, or low population or anything, was just a fluke choice. As for the reason I've stayed, well:<br>
<br>
Ever wonder why so many non-roleplayers love this server? Alot of it is because the roleplayers have created an atmosphere here you can't find anywhere else.<br>
It's a bit two-faced when people come here saying there is no other server like it, then give disdain to the people (the roleplayers) that helped shape the very things you find so wonderful.<br>
<br>
There are tons of us on this server who are not roleplayers, yet we have great experiences, great friends and are heartily welcomed.  I have never found that the roleplayers see a non-roleplayer on this server and start getting the plank ready for no other reason. <br>
<br>
This guy is getting flamed, not because he doesn't roleplay but because he comes to our boards, and his first sentence in his first post is &quot;I dont give a #### about roleplay&quot;. Hell, even I found it obnoxious as hell. It's disrespectful. <p>Laraly Muddlefoot<br>

I have zero problems with someone coming to a board or server and saying &quot;I could give a fuck about RPing&quot;.  I also say that if you want to flame the guy for it, that's your right.  Everyone has a right to be an idiot.  <br>
<br>
The guy who comes to a roleplaying PREFERRED server and doesn't want to roleplay and openly says so is no more idiotic than the guy who rp's constantly, flames said individual, and polices other peoples action, and even advocates FORCING others to roleplay (yes, it's been said on this board, see any topic with the words rp enforced).  Both of the people in question are fucking idiots, in my book, but I'm not going to try to change either one.  <br>
<br>
Do I roleplay?  Sure do.  In say and emotes.  In my book, anything else is ridiculous, unless I assume my character has telepathy.  That's me.  Don't want to RP that way?  Don't.  I'm not going to change my way and I don't expect you to change yours.  I'm right for me, you're right for you.  <br>
<br>
FV is a great server.  Very little no drop items, TLC, great people (in general, even those that don't roleplay and will let you know it) and a low population make for a very good server.  I was talking to Syll the other day, and one of the first things I said when he asked how I liked being back was that the people here are great.  Sure, you get your closeminded idiots, your d00ds, your trainers and your KS'ers, but in the end most of the people here are pretty cool.  Tzaroth's a great guy, he helped me out, RP'ed with me, and helped reinforce how fantastic this server is.  I disagree with him bothering to flame someone in this case, but I still like him.  Bald's a guildleader in my guild, and I agree with a lot of what he says, but I understand that not everyone will.  You can disagree with someone and still get along.  Don't burn your bridges because of one disagreement. <br>
<br>
That's my opinion on the matter, I know you've been waiting all day for it :P<br>

Too much work. Obviously as GM's we had to keep an idea about the price of goods and services, in some campaigns we even had to estimate GDP of kingdoms. But never to any detail and nothing I would even remotely call a working economy.<br>
<br>
Besides... the GM giveth and the GM taketh away! It was always more fun for the players during the &quot;struggle&quot; than sitting on their throne's trying to balance taxes. If my players got too rich.. I just made them poor again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a

<br>
You claim to be defending role-playing, and then refer back to Dungeons and Dragons as a model to defend your points?  The day you start rolling a D20 to determine who your character likes and doesn't like and stick with the results I might begin to at least consider the idea that you are consistent, if misguided.  As it is, you are just pulling anything at random to support what you want without worrying about consistency.  Defend what you care to defend for its own sake, if you want, claim EQ would be better without a working economy and you might have a point.  But please, don't refer to the authority of Dungeon's and Dragons.  It makes you look absurd.<br>
<br>
Let's just clarify Bane.  FV was set aside (supposedly) to be about role-playing.  Not your version of what a fantasy world should be about.  Not Gary Gygax's version of what a fantasy world should be about.  No one promised anyone Drow, Hobbits, or Gully Dwarves.  It just said it was a role-playing server.  Rant against those who don't want to role-play if you want.  I might even agree with you.  But claiming that haggling over the price of a magic sword isn't role-playing?  Laugh.  You aren't an RP Nazi, you are an RP Marxist.<br>

I couldn't possibly disagree more. In D&amp;D I never rolled a D20 to see who I liked or didn't like. I don't know where your getting that off of. It couldn't be farther off.<br>
<br>
In fact, I don't know of ANY table top RPG that uses a system where you randomly decide who you like.<br>
<br>
As to EQ and the history of RPG's, I hate to tell you...but Norrath was someones first edition table top D&amp;D campaign world that Brad adapted when Smedley asked him to help design a virtual online world. Secondly, this game may not even exist if it weren't for games like D&amp;D who pioneered RP in gaming.<br>
