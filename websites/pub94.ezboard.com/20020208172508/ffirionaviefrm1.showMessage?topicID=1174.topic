Well, read below.... <br><br>They end up focusing on raiding and KILLING THEIR OWN EVIL DEITIES in preference to taking down targets like Tunare or the other good/neutral deities. <br><br>Now don't get me wrong.... I totally understand that some epic items can only be obtained by raiding the evil planes like Fear or Hate. That's an understandable reason. <br><br>What I don't understand is that ever since Verant introduced some of the &quot;goodlier&quot; planes like Tunare's Plane of Growth.... the overwhelming number of guilds (both good and evil designated ones) still overwhelmingly choose to organize raids based on the fact that it's much more convenient to kill evil gods like Cazic in Fear and Inny in Hate. <br><br>Let's take a theoretical example. I'm a necromancer of Bertoxxulous. I'm a role player. I like to RP evil, perhaps not as strongly as other players....but I do prefer to stay in character when possible. <br><br>When the time for my epics and such comes.... I find out that I can obtain ALL my epics without needing to raid Bertoxxulous and his Plane (I'm not sure if its active yet) <br><br>So I ask myself.... why the heck should I even participate in a raid against my own god if I were to be invited in such a raid??? <br><br>As role player I would consider that a totally repulsive idea!!  Slaying my own deity when there is no pragmatic reason to do so.... other than the lust and greed for phat lewt.... is a distasteful idea to me. <br><br>So what happens when my GuildMaster says: <br><br>&quot;Maladominus, you are an ass.... we really needed you to help us out in the raid against Bertox, but you refused to come along for role playing reasons. Please leave the guild ASAP.&quot;<br><br>So now what? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>Please folks, I would appreciate your input, wether you agree with me or disagree with me.

He cons warmly to Iksar and the only way to change that is to kill him. Iksar would have no problem with raiding the plane of Hate seeing as Innoruuk is just as much their enemy as Tunare. Verant also once said that Innoruuk would be proud if his children hated him so much that they tried to kill him, so actually raiding hate is an all around okay thing for everyone to do.<br><br>The reason people don't go after Tunare is actually because Tunare is I hear much MUCH harder to kill then the other gods, and I hear she dropped horrendously crappy loot. So it's generally just not worth the effort and time it takes to kill such a powerful foe. I heard that they improved her loot but she's still VERY hard to kill. I'd love to kill her sometime though, but I don't think I'll ever get the chance.

On the previous servers I've played on.... many guilds BEGIN their foundation as a so-called evil-oriented RPing guild. But in the later levels, they become sellouts.... they gradually forsake any RP house rules they may have for the ability to rake in PHAT LEWT from any and all types of raids..... regardless of what they kill or who they kill. <br><br>The reason I bring this up now is because hardly any (or maybe a couple at most) guilds are of uber caliber yet on this server..... but there will come a time when many of the RP-ing guilds on this server will become epic-capable.... and then thats when this will become an issue....... that may tear people apart. <br><br>I do appreciate your sentiment....I would feel the same way if my guildmaster chastised me for sticking to my role playing ideals. <br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A> at: 1/23/02 4:17:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 4:17:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1174.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.atlantic.net/~tukka/hand.gif height=42 width=42></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should Evil RP Guilds focus on killing GOOD deities?</span><hr size=1> Well, one thing to remember about evil is that it is generally defined by one's lack of morality, virtue, honor (or whatever word you want to use).  In virtually every work of fiction I've read (and many non-fictional historical accounts), &quot;evil&quot; individuals are indeed &quot;sell outs&quot;.  They will betray their friends, their leaders, even their religion and their gods if it suits them.<br><br>Is it a betrayal of one's god to stand against them and fight their other minions?  Perhaps, but I think it's a lot easier for an evil character to rationalize his fight against his own god and his own god's minions, based on just what those gods are the gods OF--Hate, Fear, War, Death.  By allowing themselves to be consumed (and consuming others with them) by these things in a raid on their deity's plane, are they not simultaneously honoring their god, even as they make an attempt to destroy that god and his local minions?<br><br>I would agree that dark characters would make an obvious enemy of light characters and deities of Light (though right now the only &quot;Good&quot; deity you can kill is Tunare, and she's a toughy by all accounts).<br><br>I think there enough ways to explain/rationalize raiding one's own deity's plane for evil guilds... and obviously, it was part of Verant's &quot;vision&quot; to have evil characters killing their own god (evident in the fact that shadow knights have to raid both the planes of Hate and Fear to get their weapon, and the fact that you don't get negative faction hits for Innoruuk/Cazic worshipping factions for doing so).<br><br>Now, a supposed roleplay guild kicking out a character for not participating in a raid (for roleplay purposes) would just be stupid.  If the guild can't raid an area because a couple people don't want to fight their own god, then they probably shouldn't be trying to raid that area anyway... and if they can raid those areas with a couple people opting out for RP reasons, they ought to respect that decision and let them stay in the guild.<br> <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT><BR>EverQuest characters:<BR>Tukka (Brell Serilis)<BR>Velsor (Firiona Vie)<BR>Xumbraxa (Torvonnilous)<BR>Tuono (Morell-Thule)<BR>Quinsta (The Seventh Hammer)<BR>Crink (Rallos Zek)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A> at: 1/23/02 4:18:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 4:21:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1174.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should Evil RP Guilds focus on killing GOOD deities?</span><hr size=1> Good info Zildrax. <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Verant also once said that Innoruuk would be proud if his children hated him so much that they tried to kill him, so actually raiding hate is an all around okay thing for everyone to do.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>OK, this is fine with me.

(I should probably do that just in case something trivials out).<br><br>Here's my thoughts.  Any guildmaster that would kick you out of the guild because you refuse to do a raid isn't worthy of your time.  He obviously doesn't care about you as a person, and I don't think anyone, guild or not, should be commanded to play any certain way.  You have a real life, you may have other things interfering with coming to a raid.  Surely they wouldn't kick you out if you missed it?<br><br>So what's the difference in that you refuse to partake?  Sure, they're less one necro, but big whoop.  Chances are that if you aren't interested in the uber loot, and they are to the point of throwing off all RP, then they aren't exactly what you're looking for.  Myself, I'd leave them.<br><br>Still, there are certain reasons why one might kill his own god.  Take the story of Lanys T'vyl.  She attempted to repiece the sword Malevolence, which weakens Innoruuk with every death it takes, just so she could kill Innoruuk and take his place.  And she is his own daughter.  So why shouldn't dark elves try to kill him, to assume their rightful place as Lord of Hate?<br><br>I don't see why any Cazicite would want to kill Cazic-Thule, except for the Trolls as they were abandoned in favor of the Iksar.  They could have some vengeance issues playing.<br><br>And hell.  I'd try to kill Tunare, if my RP guild decided they wanted to do it, phat lewt or no.  It's RP.  Imagine the fun I'd have walking around telling all the lowbies how my guild and I smacked around their god. <p><center><font size=+2><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bmaidensfancy">Shiden Kaidan</a></font><br>Tier'dal Knight<br><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/"> Firiona Vie</a><br><font size=1><font color=red>@}</font><font color=green>--,--'---- </font></font><br><i>"You have no power over me."</i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=celle>Celle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 5:37:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1174.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should Evil RP Guilds focus on killing GOOD deities?</span><hr size=1> Has anyone read the Dragonlance series?

Anyone who has taken high school or college physics knows about this. <br><br>Thus the philosophy of Bertoxxulous and his followers are simply stressing the darker side (and unpleasant side) of the natural laws of balance.  Those of the goodly alignments see this decay and deterioration as something perverse and evil. Yet there is nothing untruthful about it..... it's a normal part of the balance of nature. <br><br>Perhaps what makes Bertoxxulous &quot;evil&quot; is the fact that his power (as a deity) thrives on this natural process of decay, and that his followers are encouraged to &quot;accelerate&quot; this process of decay and entropy. <br><br>As for the relation between Bertoxxulous and his followers.... it's quite simple, really:  <br><br>1) Every mortal will eventually fall to the natural process of death, decay, and decomposition. <br><br>2) Bertoxxulous' power thrives on this process, thus his followers are encouraged to speed up this process. <br><br>3) In return for their loyalty, especially for the necromantic followers..... Bertoxxulous promises them life after death.... in essence, he promises them undead immortality as a way to CHEAT the natural process. <br><br>4) In essence, Bertoxxulous plays favorites with the mortals. Those who oppose him will suffer the fate of death and decay, where they deserve to be cursed with sickness and disease and suffering and once they die they will be nothing more than the worthless soil in the earth. Yet those mortals who are loyal to Bertoxxulous have a chance to be promised immortality...... undeath.... undead life. As far as the most successful necromancers are concerned, this is what is considered Lichdom. <br><br>In most fantasy games like D&amp;D, Lichdom is cited as the ultimate form of undead, it's a form of near-immortality.....oftentimes portrayed as stronger than a vampire. It's also an EQ spell of course.... tho the spell is nowhere as impressive as the original mythical concept of the Lich undead. <br><br>So those who serve the Plaguebringer are nowhere near self-destructive. They are not suicidal people, nor do they look forward to dying very soon. They have a lot of work ahead of them.... and often times, they know that their work is hindered by the diametrically opposed powers of life and growth (Tunare, Karana, Rodcet Nife) <br><br>Ever wonder why Bertoxxulous worshippers are default alignment Discordant Evil?  It all comes back to entropy (disorder).  Verant actually had this one well thought out. <br><br>/end lecture<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugoestwoodwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goest Woodwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 10:33:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1174.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should Evil RP Guilds focus on killing GOOD deities?</span><hr size=1> If the situation were reversed, (Good killing good dieties) it would be very difficult to justify through RP.  <br><br>I think several good points have been brought up for evils killing evil dieties, that is less of a problem.

True lichdom is still a considerable achievement according to EQ lore.  Take Miragul's story, for example.  I think that the Lich line of spells in EQ only make you a &quot;lesser&quot; Lich of sorts.

again on testFV trying to recreat my old warrior.<br><br>When the server went live i chose Roddy the enchanter, as opposed to my old warrior, but all the people who played on test who were going to form our nice evil bertoxxulous guild never arrived so i retired my human for grouping reasons... all the necromancers sped ahead of me, and non of the dark elfs would group with a human.. so i was left a solo enchanter and there was no fun in it, so i returned and made a dark elf shadowknight who i totaly enjoy.<br><br>I know a lot, heck i would be bold and say that on the servers that i have played i have not met somone who has come close to knowing half the piecs of information i know about the bloodsabres.<br><br>Pretty much all the info you can find on alakazams on bloodsabres was submitied by me, but for some reasons my name didnt appear on it, and some 'false' name did, even though the email was cut and past onto the site.<br><br>There are extreems of the bloodsabres, and why i believe most of the opposing guilds hate them, is not because they kill... is because they keep the dead.. in undeath.<br>They re-use the corpses and revere in the different stages of death, often haveing corpses who still serve the guild in undeath more than any raised skeleton.<br><br>Home to not only necromancers, shadowknights but warriors, rogues, enchanters, magicians and wizzards.. a lot of classes to chose from.<br><br>The different classes have different roles within the guild and different actions, the shadowknights are concerned with offensive strikes at there oposing guilds, the necromancers are concerned with there dark reserch and the clerics are the voice of there deity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0
