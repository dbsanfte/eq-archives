class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> How am I a hypocrite?  Please do enlighten me.  Do you know the definition of the word? To put it plainly, it means that I&quot;m a hypocrite if -I- use market channel in an ooc fashion, while telling you that it's wrong.  Yet, I always use it in character... so please, do tell me, where am I a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
And if someone wants to ask an entirely ooc question that's related to gameplay, it's simple enough.<br>
<br>
a) create an ooc channel and use it. Yeah yeah nobody uses it, so it's not really feasible. But that's what YOU really want.<br>
<br>
so another more reasonable solution<br>
<br>
b) &quot;ooc: How do I adjust the light settings on my monitor?&quot;<br>
and then the folks that know the answer can /tell the person.<br>
<br>
As to GM events.... what's that got to do with market? Why should folks care about it that are there to buy and sell?  Most Gm events are set up to only involve a limited amount of folks, if suddenly it's announced in market by some overzealous individual, then it defeats the event's purpose.. that of challenging individuals currently present in the zone.  IF a GM wants more participation, they have something called a global announcement channel. I'm sure you've seen it, that bright yellow color going &quot;Arena event in 30 minutes in Lake Rathe... folks of level 30-60 welcome&quot;<br>
<br>
As to shouting cross zone.. that was changed a while back, all shouts go across the zone now.<br>
<br>
As to you telling me that I should leave the market channel if I dont like it... well you are losing yourself a potential buyer for one.  Another, you are actually saying &quot;go away, roleplayers suck&quot; .. well not quite, but close enough.   There should never be a reason for any roleplayer on this server to feel like they dont belong.  There are plenty of other servers to go to for non-roleplayers, where ooc is common.  There is no place for a roleplayer to retreat to from here. Market channel is 100% a roleplayer's domain, just like bazaar, or *gasp* Greater Faydark... <br>

<br>
Counterpoints:<br>
There is already an OOC channel called 'market'. It is used by players OOC to sell and also for general chat which is legitimized by the silent assent of the masses using the channel (100 players isn't exactly a mass but it's what we got). Despite what the channel name is, it isn't used purely for /auc anymore. The fact is that most people congregate there because it is one of the only active OOC channels regularly used on the server and there is a need for an OOC channel. While idle chatter isn't encouraged, it isn't really discouraged either except by a vocal minority who happen to base many of their arguments on a RP basis which IMHO doesn't apply to an inherently non-RP channel.<br>
<br>
Cross zone shouting in this case means across 2 or more zones. I play a lot in FM and most of the time, I am the only one there. It wouldn't be feasible for me to wander zone-to-zone shouting for help, especially if (if we are still following my example) I am nearly blind because of my graphics problem (this is just an example of an OOC use which is necessary - there are many others).<br>
<br>
I am not saying RP sucks in any way, shape or form. I am and have always advocated a distinction between RP and non-RP. I recognize the value of each, I feel they should be kept seperate and distinct and I feel that there are places and times where each should or shouldn't be used. You can't avoid the facts that market was created to be and still is an OOC arena. I still haven't heard a RP justification for its existence which is necessary if you are going to argue this point. RP should be based on the world of Everquest, and in this world, there is no GOOD way to explain Market, so that by definition negates its validity as an RP arena.<br>
I don't want to make RPers unwelcome, but on the other side I don't feel RPers comming into a non-RP forum and flaming people for being OOC is right. That's like joining a running club and announcing at your weekly meeting &quot;Running sucks, I don't do it and neither should you and if you do I will yell at you. We should all rollerblade instead and since *I* am a member of this club, we should do what *I* want because otherwise you are excluding me and making *me* feel uncomfortable.&quot; Yea, but you are still a member of a *running* club.<br>
<br>
You must be able to separate RP from non-RP and accept the use of both. If you get completely immersed in RP you can get in trouble like those people down it the steam tunnels under Princeton or whatever college during the 70's.<br>

<br>
But as soon as a person logs into the game, and become their character, everything should be treated as roleplay by default... EVERYTHING.  (Unless indicated ooc'ly.)<br>
<br>
The market channel is by NO means a non-RP arena, except by folks like you.  It's called &quot;market&quot; for crying out loud... not even the standard &quot;auction&quot; it is called on most servers.  Market implies trading and selling, and that's quite feasibly done in character.  As to the fact that it's global and that such things dont exist on the world of Earth... well I roleplay these types of differences as simply being part of Norrath. My character doesn't view getting a tell from someone 10 zones away as strange.. my character doesn't view the fact that we got &quot;zone&quot; in the first place as strange... my character doesn't see global channels as strange... they just ARE.   The rules are different for Norrath than they are for Earth. As such, no, the market channel is not inherently out of character.  Please, do post everywhere for folks to use the ooc channel for the chatter.. the folks that truly are there just listening to buy/sell wont move.. but if you want to help some youngsters, by all means, use it.  It does exist, it's just not as popular.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the way my character views the market channel is different from the way that you (the player) sees it. As such, I'm not a hypocrite. But maybe you are... since you consider a channel named &quot;market&quot; an out of character domain. I'm sure the market channel was created by roleplayers to buy and sell.... and you are simply one of the ones ursurping it from what it's suposed to be. Quite frankly, the fact that you think you are justified in calling it &quot;ooc&quot; is ridiculous to me... if it were ooc, it's be called THAT!<br>
<br>
I also stated, use of the market channel in an ooc fashion is fine. But it should be considered a priviledge, not a right, to speak ooc'ly... aka preface with &quot;ooc:&quot;  <br>

I am having a rational, reasonable discussion, a discussion as the player, not as the character. My character would never speak to you about these things. I make a distinction between what my character says, and what I do.. I'm not her, by any means. I wash regularly, unlike her, and my own archery skill sucks.  However... you apparently simply play yourself and not your character. Roleplay is pretending that you are your character. Sometimes your character can be very similar to you, sometimes very different. Heck, Shintou isn't a murdering callous dark elf in real life.. <br>
<br>
The world of Norrath is a fantasy world. It exists so we can pretend the outside world doesn't exist, if only for a little while.  I dont endorse crawling in tunnels late a night in the real world, trust me. Or anything foolish otherwise.  Those players would've gotten into trouble with one thing or another, no real reason to blame roleplaying per se. That's like that dad that neglected his son because his Norrath raids were more important. It's not the fault of Everquest, it's the fault of the player if they cannot distinguish reality from a game.<br>
<br>
As a game, I reserve the right to roleplay and immerse myself entirely. That includes the market channel.  It would not include a channel that's named &quot;ooc&quot;.<br>

The arguments you made in your last post summed this principle up quite well. When I hear you RPing in market, I will leave you alone (as I always said I would, although I still don't know how you can reason it's existence in RP especially since it circumvents the language restrictions which are in place to forster RP - kinda like wanting to have your cake and eat it too). When I speak OOC in market, I expect the same, not the RP police asking me to use speach conventions.<br>
<br>
Whether we agree on the use of market or not, we both agree on the principle of &quot;respect others and the way they play&quot; (within PnP and the EULA of course), which others did not follow (and I am not naming a specific event because it is irrelevent here).<br>
<br>
As to why and when the channel was created, I cannot say since I wasn't on this server at the time. But I can tell you how it is used now and only very few people attempt to RP over it. Whether it's right or wrong, people use the channel as both /auc and /ooc now despite the name. If you spend time on the channel you already know this. It is beyond the scope of these message boards to explain the sociological issues as to why this all happened, but I can tell you this: I am annoyed when the market channel is cruising along, everyone there seems to be content with the discussions taking place and someone decides to join and police the way everyone is using the channel.<br>
<br>
Go back to my running club analogy and think about how you would feel if you were a member of that group who enjoyed running. Why do you think we were all mostly pissed at Nexen? It wasn't so much the SH exploits it was the attitude and lack of respect for the way others play the game.<br>

There was some incident where someone either committed suicide because of some RP thing or killed someone else, but it involved RL death due to RP. I remember this because when I was younger my parents dissapproved of my playing RP games because of this event but it's a good lesson to learn for a lot of people - It's just a game and not worth getting worked up about.<br>
<br>
Hell, I even started this thread to try and get some good discussion going since our file servers are down now and I'm bored out of my mind at work. It's not because I'm pissed that someone took the time out of their RP life to complain about me not putting () or &quot;&quot; or OOC: in front of my message in market, although I feel I have valid points.<br>

Someone once upon a time started talking about how Micheal Jordon rocked, and after trying to get him to shut up, the roleplayers had no choice but to leave the channel or listen to him spout his nonsense. Of course that means that others now think it's ok too.<br>
<br>
Now you come along and tell me that's the way it has always been and because of that it is right?  Blegh. That's the same type of argument kids use when trying to convince their parents &quot;But Mom, all the other kids do it!&quot;<br>
<br>
You are right. I'll avoid market channel. I already have. If I use it, I jump in, put in my message, and leave it again.  If someone spouts in VERY ooc and irrelevant fashion (I get more peeved at the folks that have a big huge discussion about non-eq related stuff than the folks that discuss how to change their gamma settings etc.)  ... I have no choice but to go away. <br>
<br>
So on the one hand you say 'go ahead and roleplay' .. on the other hand, you have no wish to at least compromise by having the *gasp* inconvenience of typing ooc before your question about Britney Spears... I have no choice but to listen to the drivel, just do others the favor and add those three letters to anything in a public channel that's not labelled &quot;ooc&quot; (which duh, has ooc as default.)<br>
<br>
I'm no angel by any means. I'm not an extreme roleplayer. But I have little patience with certain discussions in real life, why the heck would I want to listen to them in a fantasy game?  The market channel certainly is a feature of Norrath, not a feature of CNN or MTV and as such should be treated as a priviledge.<br>
<br>
It doesn't take much to please roleplayers like me. Trust me. Just preface your sentence.. but then again, that was your original complaint. *sarcasm* ... typing 3 extra letters is just too much I guess.  Nevermind the fact I CAN&quot;T get away from to another global channel that easily. Otherwise there'd be an ooc channel, a rpchannel, a tradeskill channel, a &quot;good&quot; &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; channel, a &quot;port&quot; channel etc etc.<br>
<br>
Just because it's the only global channel that's actively used does not give anyone the right to make fun of others. It does give everyone the right to be treated nicely... and considering this is the roleplaying server, that means deference to the *gasp* roleplayers.. so preface your ooc statements with ooc...<br>

I'd like to see an RP justification for the market channel.  How do you explain talking on Market while you're out in the depths of a dungeon?  That's VERY ooc, no matter how you word your WTB message.<br>
<br>
So, got one?  You explain how you can possibly justify the Market or any other chat channel through roleplay, AND you explain to us why we have to go out of our way just to suit you, and maybe we'll change.<br>
<br>
And I'm a roleplayer, so please don't classify me as a d00d or anything, thank you.  I'm looking for serious answers here.<br>

Oh, and about Mazes and Monsters...it all started with a book by Rona Jaffe.  The book was very good.  The movie with Tom Hanks wasn't.  Righteous bible thumpers across the nation now quote it as true occurences, despite the story changing with each telling.  I've heard the kids came from anywhere from California to Michigan to New York.  I personally think it's all an exploit, just pushed on by the wonderful Jack Chick and his adorable pamphlets explaining that roleplaying is a tool of Satan. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 1:40:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well</span><hr size=1> &quot;So, got one?

<br>
Here take this self-help test - which is IC and which is OOC?<br>
<br>
- Hello fair maiden, how are you. Do you by anychance know of a good inn nearby - I am weary of my journy from Qeynos and must rest the night before I head south to the fabled land of the trolls.<br>
<br>
- Hey man, are you camping the AC? I don't want to KS you and will respect it if you are.<br>
<br>
The first one is IC, the second is OOC. How did you score? If you didn't get that right, you might need some psychiatric help or at least some time off to go take a walk or something.<br>

I don't really think they should be discussed over market. If someone decides to, I won't snap at them, I will probably just not pay attention. Personally I don't feel the marketplace is a good forum for these discussions.<br>
<br>
What I am talking about is ALL game related OOC. We're talking about spawn times, weapon delay, damage ratio, haste caps, video/sound issues, zone bugs, crashes, questions on mobs, advice on where to hunt etc. All of these have to do with game mechanics and are not IC. This is the kind of stuff that I will respond to and discuss. Frankly I could care less what is going on with Pakistan, Jordan or Britney unless MJ just KSed Quillmane from you, Britney is wondering if a WS or a Lammy is better in your primary or Pakistan is about to wake the sleeper.<br>
<br>
BUT, if people want to talk about it on market, I probably won't flame them, I'll just let it go in one ear and out the other so-to-speak - it will scroll up pretty fast anyways, once so-and-so /auc WTB: Vindi BP for the 5th time in 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
ALL of my posts were about EQ related stuff. I don't talk about world events with the rest of the EQ community. I talk about world events with my coworkers at lunch or my girlfriend after work.<br>

But touching on what communication channels are IC. There is only say and distance-limited shout (which was made into zone wide, and thus very OOC). So that leaves only say.<br>
<br>
So now are those advocating default OOC speak in other channels saying that just because technology permits us in EQ to speak telepathically that we should automatically expect OOC speak in those modes? sigh...<br>

A lot of the technological improvisations in game are to facilitate gaming experience.

<br>
I fail to see your point.  Are you suggesting that these are IC modes?  And what do you mean by 'advocating default OOC speak in other channels?'  When you say things like default, or other channels, you should really specify what you mean.<br>
<br>
I think it is wrong to flame people just for not saying OOC WTS SCHW as opposed to WTS SCHW.  One argument was that we are lazy and inconsiderate in not typing an extra 4 characters before our market message.<br>
<br>
I don't get what you're arguing for though.  Are you saying that we should think of some way to incorporate being linked together in /chat channels as some form of roleplay? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaeona.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caeona</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.midsouth.rr.com/yamahaman/lostboy/ff8gifs/Ellone.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 11:00:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Woah</span><hr size=1> I am saying, there is only ONE true IC communication mode, which is SAY.<br>
<br>
Given the barrage of telepathic modes available to us, we have the choice of making our conversations IC as well. It really is up to us to make every interaction we make as IC as possible. I can and will understand the need for OOC like some posters have discussed, but I do not think it right that these channels are automatically/by default thought of as OOC as opposed to SAY.<br>
<br>
I am not saying we should imagine some way of explaining why we are even conversing telepathically. I am saying why can't we converse in other channels in the same style as when we do in SAY?<br>
