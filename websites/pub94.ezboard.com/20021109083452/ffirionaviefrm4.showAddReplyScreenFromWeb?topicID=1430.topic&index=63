misconceptions.<br>
<br>
Humans are NOT the top of the food chain.  In our “natural” environment, the great cats and larger canids are a bit higher up on the pyramid than we are.  It so happens that we have been largely able to take ourselves out of that particular Darwinian contest, but don’t mistake that achievement as a justification to label yourself a carnivore – you’re not.<br>
<br>
And of course, the whole “food chain” image is just a convenience anyway.  Being at the top or bottom of it is not something to be sought or avoided – it simply occurs.<br>
<br>
Next, the taste thing: humans taste bad to sharks because we are not the sharks’ natural prey, not because of some evolved “bad taste”.  We certainly taste just fine to lions, and have for millions of years.  We also taste pretty good to a wide range of other animals, from mosquitoes to vultures to wolves to – so it is said – other humans.<br>

Natural environment is that we are intelligent and possess tools to defend us from the big cats. The big cats don't have that, so we win. Now, when a mountain lion happens upon an unprepared camp site... yeah, the lion prolly wins. But humans are smarter than the lion, and so they don't allow that to happen often.<br>

Animals eat to survive, and most would be happy to gnaw on something that doesn't taste that delicious if it means living through the winter.<br>
<br>
   You can usually identify taste preference by animals that are willing to spend more energy capturing and eating something than they get out of the meal.  I watched a whole pod of killer whales on Discovery channel chase a blue whale and her calf for several hours until the baby wore out, then they drowned it, just so they could eat it's jaw.   That's a hella lot of energy spent for a whale jaw, so it's pretty safe to assume that it's the killer whale equivalent of Pocky.<br>
<br>
   Wolves don't generally attack humans (there've been 0 recorded deaths to non-rabid / non-captive wolves in North America in the last 2 decades or so), so I don't think we're terribly delicious to them.  They scavenge dead humans because a free meal is a free meal, even if it tastes bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

   Big cats on the other hand, that's prolly a different story.<br>

<br>
Normal, healthy animals do not hunt and eat humans.<br>
<br>
Almost all cases of maneaters are animals that became habitualized to it, it is not a normal behavior.<br>
<br>
Saying I am the top of the food chain is not making a case for being a carnivore you dolt. I am an omnivore. I can and will eat almost anything, that puts me at the top of the food chain. It is not saying I am at the top of the food chain that allows me to eat almost anything. The cart before the horse reversal of my argument is absurd.<br>
<br>
There are very few true omnivores on this planet. Humans bears and pigs are the only ones that leap to mind. Bears are hunters, pigs scavengers, and humans somewhere in between.<br>
<br>
But the same is true for carnivores and herbivores, there are few who subsist on diets entirely of one or the other. Herbivores injest insects as they graze. These insects are animals, they get digested all the same. Likewise most carnivores manage to ingest vegetable manner. For a carnivore, not much of this is digested, but some is.<br>
<br>
Most animals are omnivores to some extent. Very few are designed as omnivores.<br>
<br>
Ok, I share the top of the food chain with bears and pigs, that doesn't make me at all uncomfortable.<br>

<br>
I’ll accept Wikkin’s objection that our current environment is not “unnatural” – I actually agree with that assessment, which is why I put “natural” in quotes.  Let me clarify my stance by changing “natural environment” to “environment in which we evolved” to differentiate it from the one we find ourselves in now.<br>
<br>
Except in very isolated areas, only sick or ailing top predators (wolves, great cats, etc.) attack humans today.  However, that was not always true, nor was it true as recently as a century ago.  <br>
<br>
Though the attacks by the two lions illustrated by “Ghost in the Darkness” were astoundingly atypical, villagers and workers in some areas of Africa would regularly build stockades to protect themselves from night-time lion attacks.  <br>
<br>
Tigers still regularly attack, kill and eat the fishermen who venture in to the Sunderbans… no matter how fervently those folks believe they are at the top of their personal food chains.  The trick of wearing a mask on the back of one’s head is apparently no longer working as well as it used to.<br>
<br>
Most large carnivores (the ones that have historically hunted humans for food) have “learned” hunting behaviors.  That is, their hunting styles and prey is not hard-wired into their behavior, but learned though experience or taught by their pride/pack/pod/whatever.  Almost all of the large predators are flexible enough to prey on whatever applicable creature is most abundant, easiest to bring down, or easiest to stalk.<br>
<br>
Because of that, saying that man-eating behavior is “habituated” and thus unnatural is a bit of a cop-out.  Lions in the Serengeti are “habituated” into bringing down zebra or wildebeest in the same manner that the Sunderbans tigers are “habituated” into attacking humans.<br>
<br>
Finally, traditional depictions of “the” food chain (which is a conceit) have “pure” carnivores at the top, occupying a place in which no other creature actively preys on them for food.  I will grant that an omnivore or even a herbivore can occupy this top spot in a given food chain (elephants are very rarely preyed upon), but up until a few hundred years ago, humans did not enjoy this position.<br>

Then they eat whatever smells like their mother's mouth. So yeah, certain behaviours are learned, to a certain extent in animals. Most animals have learned to avoid humans, because it usually leads to bad things happening to them (dodo, passenger pigeon) If a species doesn't react well to changes in it's enviroment, They will perish. <br>
Tigers will and do regularly prey on humans, because individually, we aren't very strong, which is why we probably developed social skills in the first place. What places us at the top of the food chain is our ability to reason and plan, and predict the results of our actions.<br>
Pretty amazing when you think of it, that we have evolved so much that our enviroment no longer plays a role in our species development, because we force our enviroment to change to suit us. <br>
Being omnivorous gives us more food choices, we are not a niche species. We are the Bard of this planet. If Vegans feel the need to restrict their diet to only part of the available food scource, that's a choice they were designed by nature to make. I don't personally agree with it, but I'll defend, to the death, their right to make a choice.<br>
