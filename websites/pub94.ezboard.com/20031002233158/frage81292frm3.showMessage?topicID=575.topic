<br>
Additional Information:<br>
1) Long ago had some positive dealings with Taleryan.  Was first<br>
approached about joining FaF at level 56 by Charrles.  I got a couple<br>
more tells here and there, but every time declined politely, to continue<br>
gearing up and getting levels and AAs via a small 3-person charm group.<br>
Recently, Uliamarath sent me a tell, and I asked if it would be possible<br>
to raid with you to get an idea of if I'd like to apply.  I was allowed<br>
to do so, and you met every expectation I'd have for a guild I'd want to<br>
be a part of, so here I am.<br>
<br>
2) What I'm looking for is pretty much the most competent and efficient<br>
guild on the server, with self-sufficient members who take the initiative<br>
to do what needs to be done, with minimal internal drama, and I think<br>
Fire and Fury is that guild from what I've seen so far.  I want to have<br>
fun, see all the content I can, keep advancing my character, and keep<br>
variety in my game play.  I think Fire and Fury is the answer to those<br>
goals, especially now that most of my important AAs are out of the way,<br>
(with a couple major raid-beneficial AAs to go).<br>
<br>
3) I think I'd bring a few things to Fire and Fury.  First, though I'd<br>
need some flag work, at least I can start participating from a gear<br>
perspective without really needing emergency gear-up.  I'm in good shape<br>
for FT and focus items with the important basics taken care of.  My<br>
hitpoints and mana pool are pretty acceptable for an applicant I'd think.<br>
Also, I'm a pretty positive person when it comes to dealing with other<br>
people.  I'm polite and encouraging, with a can-do attitude.  I'm not<br>
going to complain if you need buffs, that's my job.  I'm also<br>
intelligent, self-sufficient, responsible for myself, I anticipate well,<br>
and so on.  If I don't understand, I ask, and I know to ask someone in<br>
a tell to avoid making multiple people take time to answer.  I am a<br>
competent player who can be relied upon to do what you expect of a<br>
cleric in a raid.  I would make it my goal to be as minimal a burden on<br>
the rest of the guild as I get up to full raiding speed, and aside from<br>
learning the specific culture/routines of Fire and Fury (acronyms you<br>
use for buffs, channels to join, etc) I don't require a lot of input to<br>
get the job done.  I'm also reflective: if something I do doesn't go<br>
well, I think about why, and figure out what I need to change to make<br>
it work.  I won't make the same mistake over and over, because I'm<br>
always analyzing my mistakes to learn from them.  I think I have the<br>
personal and in-game qualities needed to become a productive member<br>
quickly.<br>
<br>
4) Gravely has no guild history on Firiona Vie.  I've been a part of a<br>
small group (3 people or less) who's done some low-end raid content for<br>
fun.  As a joke we called ourselves the Lewt H00rs.  Iumuno (a fellow<br>
applicant) and I are sort of the base of that group.  We tend to stick<br>
together, as we've played together, mostly in the same guilds (on<br>
Rodcet) for nearly 4 years.  Iumuno is the only person on FV with<br>
access to my codes, and he is welcome to use them as he sees fit when<br>
I'm not around. Likewise, I have access to his codes, and know how to<br>
use them when an enchanter is needed more than a cleric.<br>
<br>
5) I played in a raiding guild (Axiom Shift) on Rodcet Nife for almost 2<br>
years.  We were trying the zeks in tactics when I left.  That guild was<br>
well-respected for accomplishing a lot with its numbers and fairly casual<br>
playstile (2nd guild on Rodcet in BoT, etc).  Many of its members went on<br>
to join Ascent (the top raiding guild then and now on Rodcet Nife) and<br>
were welcomed because of the reputation the guild had earned.  Rather than<br>
taking that path, I chose to play on FV with Iumuno after he switched<br>
servers to play an enchanter here.<br>
<br>
I was a 65 gnome shadowknight in Axiom Shift for about the 2nd half of my<br>
time there.  Previously, I was a rogue, up to 61.  I switched mains<br>
shortly after Planes of Power was out.  With both characters, I took the<br>
initiative to gear myself up as much as possible on off-raid times, rather<br>
than relying on raiding as my only source of gear improvement.  Before the<br>
rogue, I played a wizard to 54, and I've played a twink enchanter to 54 as<br>
well.  When raiding, I was often asked to play a missing cleric or<br>
sometimes a missing enchanter, because I seemed to be one of the few people<br>
who both enjoyed it and could do a good job as another class.  So, I got<br>
some good experience raiding as a cleric before Gravely was ever born, and<br>
some experience raiding as an enchanter.<br>
<br>
Gravely was powerleveled from about 10 to 40 to catch up to Iumuno, as I<br>
rolled her specifically to play with Iumuno on FV.  From that point on<br>
we grouped for xp and started farming stuff.  It took about 6 months to<br>
get 65 and 100 AAs, and I'm pretty happy with where the xp is.  I've<br>
raided as a guest with a few guilds here and there, and in pickup stuff,<br>
too, just to keep up the practice.  I've got a lot of raid experience,<br>
split somewhat evenly between rogue, shadowknight and cleric, with some<br>
old pre-luclin wizard experience.<br>
<br>

Unfortunately, my system froze when I hit &quot;get messages&quot;, so I tried ctrl-alt-del, but it was totally hung.  I then pressed the power switch and held it for 10 seconds to force a poweroff, because that's all I could do, and then pressed it again to restart, and try again.<br>
<br>
That's when I was greeted by the lovely<br>
<br>
&quot;Windows protection error.  You need to restart you computer.  System halted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eww, I thought, that sounds bad.  I'll try restarting.  Same thing.<br>
<br>
Again, and again the same thing.<br>
<br>
This is looking bad.<br>
<br>
So, I did a web search on the other computer, which is web/email capable (I'm writing from it now, in fact) but hasn't worked for EQ in over a year (it's old... Win98, Celeron 366 OCed to 550, nVidia TNT2 card, lots of RAM but sucky CPU, etc etc, and the patcher won't even run on it now without an error/failure except for 1 time in 50, and then even if it will load EQ (with no new models, everything turned off, etc) it will usually crash to desktop the first time I zone or someone sneezes in-game, and the patcher bug resumes).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I did a web search on Windows protection error, and found a nice troubleshooting page:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;273738">support.microsoft.com/def...-US;273738</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
However, following the troubleshooting steps on the page to the letter, every single thing (lots of crap to disable, and about 25 reboots involved), I still got the blue screen of death/windows protection error.  The only way that machine will boot is in safe mode.  It's basically now totally useless.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what's wrong with it, but at this stage, it's old, the motherboard won't support my new GeForce FX 5600 (it freezes after roughly 3 minutes in EQ, and it's not a power issue, as I tried an Antech True-550W power supply), the system has had strange freezes (like the one that started this mess) now and then for a couple years, etc.  I'm tired of dealing with its crap, and it's time to replace it.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  I'm away from EQ until I can build a new system (not letting any OEM build it, since they put in crappy motherboards that don't support hardware upgrades for more than a year, etc).<br>
<br>
Sorry, and I really didn't intend to have something like this happen in the middle of application, but at the moment, there's nothing else I can do about it (except maybe a complete system restore, but I'd need to back up data first, and sorting through that could take a long time, and I'm not even sure if I can burn CDs in safe mode) there's no guarantee that'd work, and I could sure use a new system anyway).<br>
<br>
Any good motherboard/cpu combo recommendations would be appreciated.  I'm thinking some sort of nForce2 chipset with an Athlon XP 3200+ or so (2.2 GHz), but haven't decided yet.<br>
<br>
Sorry,<br>

I'd eliminated everything except the graphics card/drivers, because in safe mode, the device manager wouldn't let me disable them in the hardware profile.  I'd blown away drivers for 2 other cards I'd tried in the machine earlier, before the bluescreen problem (they didn't work, the machine froze every 3-4 minutes, motherboard conflict or something, tried a 550W power supply at the time and that proved it wasn't a lack of power, so I returned one and kept the other for this new system).  Anyway, I finally read the info on the (correct) driver for my existing card and it mentioned something about details not available because there is a problem with the driver or hardware.  Well, I wish I'd read that about 20 hours of debugging ago, but I thought I'd try to get some information about the driver files.  Bingo, one mentioned vmm.vxd and another vdd or something.  Those were mentioned in a blue screen error when I blew away all the monitor drivers and it momentarily booted in normal mode (but had this different blue screen error instead of the Windows Protection Error).  Well, I wasn't sure exactly what would happen if I blew away the only remaining (and proper) display driver (for my GeForce2 card), but I figured at least it would do VGA mode or whatever it's called (like it uses in safe mode), because when you build a new machine, you at least get 640x480 with 16 colors VGA mode before you install video drivers.  So, I blew it away, it tried to find a driver to install, I walked away for 30 minutes, came back, it was asking for a CD or something, I hit cancel a million times, and then installed fairly recent drivers from nVidia that I'd saved in an installs folder for upgrading the drivers.  It prompted me to restart, so I did, and damn if there was no blue screen of death this time.<br>
<br>
So, it looks like I'm back.  Even if EQ won't run (I'm checking that next) at least the new system is in the mail from 6 or so different vendors in parts and pieces, and I'll be ready to build it when everything arrives.<br>
<br>
Off to test EQ now.  Sorry about my absence!  Also, even if everything is working, I have an exam for my Modern Geometry class tomorrow (on euclidean and neutral geometry, luckily not in too deep into the hyperbolic stuff yet), so I'll be gone tomorrow (Tuesday) evening.  Also, dinner with grandparents and parents on Wednesday evening, but I should be around for the latter part of the evening/night if this machine holds together. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think I dinged from fixing a blue screen error...<br>

I bought my last 4 PCs from them.  They're a small shop in Palo Alto staffed mostly by Stanford students.  Tell them what to build and they build it.  They're all nice and geeky, too -- they're up on which parts are cheap, which are reliable, and which are fast.  You can shave a bit off doing it all yourself, but if you're at a point where saving time &gt;&gt; saving money, you'll like them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/brage81292.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gravely>Gravely</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FaF Standard User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/23/03 5:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=575.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely_face_60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Another update...</span><hr size=1> EQ works fine, I'll be back for real starting Thursday (and around late Wed. night). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/brage81292.showUserPublicProfile?gid=waii>waii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I r Euro!</span><br>  Posts: 1133<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/23/03 6:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=575.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another update...</span><hr size=1> sweet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=238692" target="top">Waii</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->TEXAN !!<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Waii.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
