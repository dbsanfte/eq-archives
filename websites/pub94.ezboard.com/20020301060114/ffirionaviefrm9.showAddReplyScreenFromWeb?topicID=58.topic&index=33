class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Left Wingers</span><hr size=1> The reason they have not worked on a large scale is because it is impossible. The concept of communes, sharing equally of resources and property and such are not applicable to a large-scale sovreign nation. The main reason for this is that it is that it cannot be accomplished on such a large scale without a strong centralized authority on how resources should be distributed. Basic human nature says that most of us have some desire for ownership and material possesions of some kind. Even the societies that have paralleled Communist ideals the most (inter-tribal community within Native American tribes), the need for possession of material goods was not schelched. Yet, on such a small scale it worked rather well because the management and distribution of resources and services was simple. You could put a name or face to the person you needed to deal with. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, when it grows beyond just the local community human nature starts to kick in. Without the face and inter-personal contact we tend to forget the reprucussions of our actions. This leads to the breakdown of distribution of goods and services due to corruption, which is exactly why all the &quot;Communist&quot; nations required strong authoritarian governments to survive. history has shown that without a doubt that as human beings we are inherently selfish (I suggest all are, but would not discount someone who said some are not). It is fairly clear to me that there is a very natural explanation for our selfishness if you consider our natural history. I won't go into depth about that as it is a difficult discussion. In any case, with few exceptions, history has shown the selfishness of the human spirit. It has also shown that to be amplified as more people come into power.<br>
<br>
Another problem with such a Communist society is one of self-preservation and protection. With no centralized rule and no governmental structure a communist government would be victimized by stronger nations. Darwin's laws are amplified in struggles for sovreignty. The ability to mobilize for war or conflict would be nearly impossible with a stagnant economy, which is a given in a Communist society. That is, economists have always said that if a pure Socialist/Communist society might be established (despite the hurdles to achiving such) the economy would be stable, but would be stagnant and perpetually poor. Growth would be entirely unlikely due to the numerous economic roadblocks, most notably the incredible hierarchy and beauracracy that would be required to produce and distribute goods. One might say, war is NOT inevitable and that other nations would nto victimize a &quot;peaceful&quot; nation. If history has shown one thing, it is that there will always be those who wish to aquire power and possessins through brute force.<br>
<br>
I would like to think that we as human beings would be capable of such a society and make it work and prosper. Unfortuantely I am a Realist and understand that our very nature prevents this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/30/01 5:17:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Left Wingers</span><hr size=1> Exactly! Communism will never actually work because of human nature. It is an interesting concept, and it works pretty well in Civ2 (was Sid secretly a Communist?) but it would never work outside of a small village setting. <br>
<br>
I think what we can all agree on is that extremes of right or left are bad. Moderation in all things, kind of like what we have, is preferable.<br>
<br>
As far as a weak populace that depends on the government leading to the takeover of those people by a repressive regime. That is a true enough fear. How does it stack up to a terrified populace literally throwing all of their carefully guaranteed rights to the wind after a massive terror attack? Because that is what we are doing now. These new measures are supposed to be ended at the end of a 4 or 6 years, I forget which and I am too lazy to go check CNN again, but what do you want to bet we don't? After all, Income Tax was supposed to be a temporary measure to pay for WWI, but the politicians liked it so much they kept it.<br>

<br>
I recall my discussions back in college with a colleague who believed that it was possible to move completely away from capitalism to a society where anything one needed was available at no cost.  My response was:  &quot;how will these things be prioritized if, looking at things realisticly, there are not infinite supplies of all things?&quot;<br>
<br>
That was the sticking point, and is the reason why communistic societies tend to fail.  It is human nature to want to better one's place in society and one's security overall.  We tend to do this by providing for any future dearth of supply by creating a surplus from which we may draw.  A good example of this is in most individuals' refrigerators.<br>
<br>
However, in a true commune everyone has exactly what they need and there is no surplus other than the communal surplus.  All individuals are equal and have an equal say in how the community is run.<br>
<br>
Athens was a good example of why this form of decision making didn't work so well, even if it wasn't a commune.  Athens, as a democracy, required a vote before anything occurred.  However, it became necessary in times of war for a tyrant to take power for the duration of the war and then for that tyrant to be deposed following the war if he would not step down voluntarily.  So, in practice, not even Athens could maintain a pure democracy and it was just a city.<br>
<br>
On the largest scale NO pure governmental method works.  Fascism falls apart because it largely depends on the popular support of the population.  Once you get over a few millions, any disgruntled percentage is large enough to launch a rebellion.  Dictatorships fall apart because there's no good way to transfer loyalty to a single leader.  Monarchies tend to fall apart because they foster elitism and disenfranchisement.  Oligarchies fail because they inevitably turn into dictatorships (which are then overthrown).  <br>
<br>
Of all the developed forms of government, the Nationalist Republic seems to be the most enduring.  However, it is my suspicion that even republics cannot stand the test of time, for no other reason than because it is human nature to attempt to gain control of our environment, and that includes political systems.  Every free society is simply an attempt to stave off dictatorship, tyrrany, and oppression.  I sadly believe that regardless of the nature of the government, these forces eventually hold sway, are overthrown, and are replaced.<br>
<br>

If human nature was one set pattern, Communists wouldn't exist, end of story.<br>
Societal nature is a whole nother story now ain't it? You are instilled with the values of your society. Hence, were Communism to ever be implemented and generations grew up on it, you would notice a shift in general &quot;human nature.&quot;<br>

I agree, that Communism has never been implemented on a large scale.  However I do not believe it would work any more than pure democracy would.  Both are efficient and fair on the small scale, but inefficient on the large scale. <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>
