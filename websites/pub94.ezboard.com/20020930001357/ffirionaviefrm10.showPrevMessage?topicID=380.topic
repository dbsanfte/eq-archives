One would be hard to convince that such tranquility was possible earlier in the day.  A venomous lamprey had charged straight through the guard tower and across the bridge into town.  The guards did nothing.  It slithered right in the center of town.  A figure was seen running up the ramp into the great temple, and the determined creature pursued.  Perhaps Firiona Vie herself then placed this lost creature deeply again in the woods, among the ruins from whence it came, for none of the guards engaged it and no trace of it was to be found.<br>
<br>
Kunark, the land of old memories.  There was something unique of this land, something that you'd never feel quite like anywhere else.  This land was ancient.  Running among the goblins and the sarnaks and other creatures that times forgot gives an appreciation for the history of the land.  Deep in the death mines under the Frontier Mountains where the goblins have created a one way entrance into <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> their</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lair, you can smell the death of ages past.  The creatures here survive because it is what they've been bred to do.  The weak do not survive here.<br>
<br>
The bright glare of Luclin rises laboringly in the purple sky.  An ashen face peers down through the planks in the dock, frowning at what he sees.  Slowly, Eonin floats out from the dock and settles to just inches above the sand.  Under the dock, Lolani begins to stir.  Don't get up on my account.  Eonin smiled as he knew he'd caught Lolani totally by surprise, both in his presence and with his telepathy.  Stay right there, you look comfortable.  I'm just going to talk to you for awhile.<br>
<br>
Lolani pushed herself into a sitting position and gazed in wonderment at her friend she'd not seen in so long.  The visions of his conversation began to ricochet in her mind.  Wonderment as children, battling orcs to try to attain maturity, the fights in Unrest, an ill-gotten voyage to Freeport, tears of joy as a family formed, wars fought in Kunark where skills where honed and a fighting unit began to form.  The death of Eonin, the birth of Brazzelbe, a small doll, an enchanting shamaness, cheers at Sul's and Pequod's wedding, the slaughter of Redwind, the death of Brazzelbe.  All these flashed at once before Lolani's eyes.<br>
<br>
There are things that have awakened inside you that you were not supposed to feel.  The cycle was supposed to've been broken.  But of this I am forbidden of speaki<br>
<br>
Lolani startled awake, bolting up and hitting her head under the dock.  The pain heightened her senses as it always had.  I am not meant to waste away under some dock.  Our Mother has granted this journey of life to perform great deeds for all of her children, not to rot like some tattered sandal, discarded out to sea.  Crawling out from under the dock, Lolani inhaled deeply the fresh ocean air of Firiona Vie.  Ahh the dawn of a new start...<br>
<br>
Eonin screamed in delightful agony.  He knew he would be punished for mentioning the curse and part of him welcomed it.  It was his way and pain pleased his fiery god.  But his friend had been warned and perhaps this was enough to break the curse, and for that he'd endure the pain. Hell, he'd even relish it.<br>
