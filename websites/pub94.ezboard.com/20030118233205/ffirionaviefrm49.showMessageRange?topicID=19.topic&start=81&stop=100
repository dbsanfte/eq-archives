<br>
This gripe came to me at 1:00 am, after I worked an entire day, so, I was rather tired and irritable. An excuse? No... but it is the reason for my lack of caring. Plus the fact that I was hunting giants with a small group and didn’t have time to deal with it with the care that I normally could have, not without suffering a XP lost of 3 to 3 1/2 blue, either to Vivienne or her hunting companion.<br>
<br>
Before this complaint came to me, I just received a /tell from a player that I have known for some time who was in the Nek/Neriak area. He informed me that he was listening to the obnoxious /shouts from the complaining individual all night - and that he basically got what he deserved (“being a dink” was the phrase used, amongst others). Why would he do this? We aren’t close friends, just happened to have been in Sel’quar together. Who shall I believe? A person that I have known a long time, somebody I know with integrity not to take sides (and who Aailan essentially called a liar)... or a random voice, somebody that I do not know. I was being fed two sides of the same story, and each side was in opposition.<br>
<br>
But, what was the greatest cause of my irritation with the whole mess was the fact that just that night, I was trained twice by a bard pulling numerous giants and cyclops’. The first time I have to run to the zone (thank god for J-boots) and the second time I saw her run right past, with a giant or two in two, but I had time to get Vivienne out of the way. Their reason for the train? Vivienne was sitting in the spot they have been pulling down for the past 3 hours, even though she was there for at least 1/2 an hour with no bard running by. My point is, I was pissed, and I dealt with it... with the bard and her group in question... I did NOT go to her guild leader (as a leader playing Vivienne the way I do, I have enough things to deal with in regards to my own character, and I wouldn’t want to bother another leader with something I can handle with the offending party myself). Neither did I threaten GMs or black-balling on a public forum, which is what has been done, and is being done here.<br>
<br>
Do I condone training? Not really, I would NOT do it to somebody myself. But, like I said, if I was attacking Felwithe, and a young highelf brought the guards down on me (which I effectively see as summoning the guards /shrug) I would have dealt with the guards by either killing them or running to zone. Either way, I wouldn’t have faulted the young one for their actions (especially if I was overheard uttering obnoxious /shouts) as I faulted the bard in Rathe Mountains. I might even compliment them on going beyond their means to drive Vivienne out of their city.<br>
<br>
If Aailan or his companion died as a result of Mythria’s train, I would have ensured a 96% resurrection for him at the soonest possible time (as my cleric friend with her epic was awake at the time), and even dragged the corpse to the zone myself. But, they didn’t die, they made it to the zone, and instead of dealing with it with the offending player herself, he chose to involve others, insult every member of my guild on a public forum and run to the GMs for a rather minor transgression in the grand scheme of things. It could have been dealt with simply with the offending party, but no, Aailan went out of his way to try and get Mythria in trouble with me (and I know he said that, confirmed by two parties).<br>
<br>
In essence, I was tired and irritated already, and his “running to the teacher” only served to irritate me even more, so I do apologize for not dealing with this issue appropriately as befitting the leader of the Sisters of Myth, now that I have had time to relax and look upon the events with clearer eyes. It is just sad that he couldn’t wait before slamming me and my guild in such a manner before it could be dealt with civilly, at a better time for everybody. <p>What is the point of living if life is not spent dancing on the edge of the razor-blade?<BR>

You cannot legitimately expect him to reserve judgment on SoM. He had a very negative griefing experience with some of your members, and when he tried to bring the matter to your attention, you basically laughed at him. What, should he have waited until you were good and ready before complaining? He had, IMHO, good enough reason to besmirch the SoM reputation by posting the log here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 8:02:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Well said Vivienne<br>

I wouldnt be to overly concerned about the opinions of some of the dinks that will undoubtedly flame you regardless of what you said. Personally I don't think you or your guild has lost any face or respect from this instance in my eyes. Things like this happen every day, most people have the good taste not to bring it here though. Personally the only person I will watch my back around will be the fucktard that posted the log in the first place. Ive had similar things happen on this server that involved officers and guild leaders that have flamed you in this post. Hows that for hipocricy, but thats neither here nor there. Just wanted to let you know not everyone on FV thinks your the Devil because you didnt bow down to the nobel RP pally dinkoff.<br>

Vivienne:<br>
<br>
I said this to your guildmate, I'll say this to you.  I'm not convinced your apology is sincere because you've used it as an opportunity to attack Aailin.  However, that's neither here nor there because he's accepted it.  All that means is that I will regard your entire guild with deep suspicion.<br>
<br>
You have no one here to blame but yourself.  If you comport yourself honorably, then no one will have any logs to post about you.  You brought this upon yourself.  Do not blame Aailin for what was done to him. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

<br>
Mythria, the one accused of doing this claims she did NOT pull any guards. Her words to me were &quot;being such a new player, I wouldn't know how to pull guards on somebody&quot;. She is 12th season and just started playing. And when I mentioned &quot;train&quot; to her, she didn't know what I meant. In fact, she stood in the corner and watched as the guards attacked him. In my experience, pretty hard to pull something, then stand and watch as it turns on somebody else without getting killed first /shrug<br>
<br>
Perhaps since she was the only person there and quite vocal about her curses in RP, she stuck in his mind. But, if this is the case, alot of fine people have just been slandered over a gross error.<br>
<br>
Edit for this addition:<br>
Apparently there was two other teir'dal there, a male and female looting their bodies at the time Mythria was there. By the way, she claims that she was also challenged to a duel, which she refused... /shrug... just bringing up her side of the story. <p>What is the point of living if life is not spent dancing on the edge of the razor-blade?<BR>

This holier than thou asswipe flaunted and threatend her with the log and this verry board with his first two comments dealing with the issue. Never once did he explain he &quot;had no desire to post it or go to a gm&quot;. His first statments were more of a in your face bow down to me because i got the goods on you. His lack of credibility and blatent misrepresentation of the truth in that one statement tells me enough of his character. Kinda funny how he posted a log that totaly blew that whole statment out of the water directly after the comment. Oh well mabey he thought nobody would catch it /shrug<br>

Actually she has every right to act in a less than favorable manner tword this obviously less than reputable character. She is not to blame for anything other than sticking up for people she knows and cares about. Even in the face of the many flames on this board. Are the people that tell her they were being harassed by this fellow any less credible because they are low lvl?, or that they are not regular flamers on the soapbox?. Sure he got trained for being an ass, dose that excuse him for being an ass? it god damn well dose not!. Is what they did wrong by the PNP yes it is and im sure they know that. PNP isnt the issue here, the issue is there is a guild full of nice people being slandered by an asshole.  <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 763<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 9:02:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Dorphen:<br>

If they hadn't trained him, there'd be no &quot;slander&quot;.  Further, &quot;slander&quot; only applies if he were lying about them.  As far as has been established, he has not.<br>
<br>
Let's go to the root of the problem here.  Again, wisdom dictates that if you don't want to get into these kinds of situations, don't do these kinds of things.  It's really that simple. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

<br>
 I was simply pointing out the fact that he made statements that were contridictory to HIS OWN log in his opening statement. And his statments in that log led me to sway more twords beliving he probably wasnt 100% honest in the fact that they were harassing the inhabitants of the city. And concreted the fact that he was itching to post the log here and cause further problems. Wich brands him a troublemaker and not worth the time it takes to post about him. The only reason I posted at all was in defence of a guild leader who is being repetedly flamed for reacting in a &quot;human&quot; manner. You see some of us are humans here and react to emotions and react to peoples negitive attitudes in a negitive way. Not everyone can follow every rule and be a fucking logical Vulcan 100% of the time.   <br>
<br>
If he hadnt taunted and demeaned them there wouldnt have been a &quot;train&quot; there'd be on &quot;slander&quot;. <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 765<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 9:20:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Dorphen:<br>

They were not forced to do it no but they did it none the less in the only way they had available to them. Its like the kids that shoot people in school for picking on them. They are to small and weak to beat them up so they tip the scales in their own favor. Its a human reaction to get back at people for doing you wrong. Is it right to walk into a school and shoot people hell no. But you also have to look at both sides. Is it right for people bigger than them to bully them around? no it isnt. What I see here is a bunch of people saying its ok to be the bully but its not ok for the little guys to fight back.

Do you know how they could've fought back? They could have logged the offensive text and posted it here or reported it to the staff. They could have /dueled. They probably had better faction with any remaining guards, and a swarm would have come down upon the last two of the raiders.<br>
<br>
Breaking the rules in the name of the 'little guy' is still breaking the rules. I'd imagine that's why people think it's silly to have wars in the name of God, since most doctrines say that it's sinful to kill.

Certain epics require raiding cities.  So calling it silly is laughable.  Verant intended for people to have to do it.  Verant specifically wrote rules to ensure that it was legal and training to prevent it was not.  <br>

The taunting is called RP.
