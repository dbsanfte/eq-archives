<br>
Let me start off by saying that RPing denotes some lack of manners when it is done in a RP way.<br>
<br>
If you are a &quot;good&quot; and come up to my evil and ask for help...out of RP...for example &quot;how long is this spawn?  How do I do this camp?  How is this quest completed?...etc etc etc?&quot;  All I ask after I help you is a simple &quot;THANKS&quot;.  If I cant help you a simple &quot;THANKS ANYWAYS&quot;.  Thats it nothing more.  That is called courtesy.  <br>
<br>
Now if your a neutral or evil and you come up and beg for buffage or saving or whatever I expect the same if its out of RP.  For example I would consider it complety RP for a High level Shadowknight Lord to come up to a lowly ogre Shaman and demand a sow or feel the wrathe of his power...and not thank the Shaman.  Seems resonable in a RP atmosphere and as long as we know its all in the spirit...no problem.<br>
<br>
But if you are neutral Dorf Beavis who is running through my path and a shamans path and beg prolonged for a SoW....when you get it some sort of acknowledgement would be cool.<br>
<br>
Ok. Thats it.  Funny thing is this doesnt even affect me.  It is just what I have seen happen to many others here on this server and I dont like it.  I dont like seeing people act like selfish selfcentered children who cant show some respect for others.  The language barrier is not an issue.  A simple /bow would have worked.<br>
<br>
Ok now thats it.<br>

I snuck down there, avoided aggro'ing like 98% of the mobs, most of which were yellow or red to me (and mind that I'm an Ogre, pulling for a half-elf that doesn't have the sense to sneak herself) and after going down to the depths, grabbing the corpse, then sneaking back dragging it, I find out I have the wrong one.  Well, no thanks anyways or anything.  I'm pretty sure something rude was said, but she asked me to escort her down to where I found it...apparently her other one was nearby.<br>
<br>
So I took her down, snuck past them all, we found her corpse, she looted it, then I told her to follow me because it's harder to get out of Blackburrow than get into it.  Rather than follow me off a cliff and take probably a max of 10 damage to her (it was 4 for me), she tried to walk down the slope, aggroing a red and at least 2 yellows, and they killed her.  Then as I was trying to find her (I thought she had lost herself til I noticed she was dead) they attacked me.  I jumped in the water, but couldn't exit it and finally the red followed me in and slaughtered me.<br>
<br>
Next thing I know, I'm being insulted.  *shakes his giant ogre head*  I'll never understand why all the rude people in the world deem to play elves.<br>

<br>
I played an ogre sk, with a Mace of Shadowed Souls and a RyGorr chestpiece. The thing I disliked most about the character was that I was sooo slow. No Jboots, Tboots, and can't stand tossing money into SoW potions. I am not the type to pester people for SoWs, so I lived with being slow, even though I hated it.<br>
<br>
So what happened? I started using the mace and people constantly asked me for SoWs. &quot;Hey look! It's an ogre with a mace! Can I have a sow please? Can I have a sow please? Can I have a sow please?&quot;<br>
<br>
I've played characters that can cast SoW, and it can get a little frustrating getting asked all the time, but I'm a good natured sort and would usually help out. But when you can't cast it, hate the fact that you are moving so slow, and are getting asked for sow a lot...it gets downright annoying.<br>
<br>
But, this post started out about manners, and this is the part that really cheesed me off. Many times, I would tell people I couldn't and they would be pissed at me (or continue to ask), thinking I was simply refusing them.<br>
<br>
I've always enjoyed a little roleplaying so I tried to say things &quot;I'm sorry, I can not invoke the spirit of the wolf&quot; or &quot;Ye'll be needin to find a shaman for that enchantment&quot;. And some people would still be clueless, and either whine at me &quot;please, it's for a CR&quot; or berate me &quot;jeez that's rude, it's only a little mana&quot;.<br>
<br>
I finally had to make a hotkey that bluntly said &quot;/say I am a Shadow Knight and can not cast SoW.&quot; Almost everyone got that, but even then, some people wouldn't bother reading what I said.<br>
<br>
So, when it comes to manners...if you ask someone for a buff and they say &quot;no&quot;... then move along. Maybe they have a good reason for not casting on you (like they don't have the spell, lol)<br>

My curse is playing 2 support characters druid/cleric both following the &quot;Light&quot; path. My good natured soul has me break RP often times to actually help an evil. I help most people I meet reguardless but cringe helping evils. Reputation is everything to me and my purpose in EQ, it characterizes who I am and who I will help again in the future. If I aide an evil and he says to me in character &quot;You know your place was to help me pale skin&quot; &quot;Fear (insert evil diety here)'s follower and do my bidding&quot; Of course I would begin to tear him to shreds in character but would respect his RP and probably help him again for no otehr reason than just to RP Argue with him. For a player to waltz up to me and pull a &quot;Hey gotta CR, pop me wit a sow man&quot; I am gunna cringe again but do it because I like helping ppl but let that same person NOT thank me then he can gurantee NEVER getting my aide again. <br>
<br>
Many people are learning the hard way that reputation is everything, especially when one char per acct. You cannot hide from who you are or what you have done in the past here. To make amends to those wrongs is the right thing to do. I have ppl on ignore from way back in the first weeks of FV for just being childish. I have since removed almost all from ignore and just keep a log of whose been less than ideal to aid or support. Ignore is just not big enough dangit, besides when on ignore they can never make amends. I know Heagan is prolly gonna see this and go nuts because I have one of his friends still on ignore from way back. He fails to see how ones mental childish views cannot be overcome or amended by apologies etc, the mentality is still there. /rant off Hope some of this made sense!
