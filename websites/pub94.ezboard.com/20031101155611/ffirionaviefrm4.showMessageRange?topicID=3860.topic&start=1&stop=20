I ignored her thinking perhaps she was misguided or that she wasn't aiming her emotions at us. Then she began to speak. <br>
<br>
She spoke my guild name and then once more, shook her head in disgust at my husband, who is a Dark Elf. She asked what he was doing, to which he didn't reply as he was busy teaching both my daughter and I new languages. I sent her a personal tell and enlightend her that he was teaching us ( his wife and daughter) languages and asked her why she inquired.<br>
She then retorted 'Wife and Daughter??? thats even worse!'<br>
<br>
It was quite obvious at this point that she had a problem with the fact that my husband, a dark elven Necromancer had married me, a wood elven Druidess. <br>
<br>
My question is - who is she to judge? It may not be her personal choice but what right does she have to dictate who can and can not fall in love? I was sickend by her biggot attitude and the way she took it upon herself to spread her misery to people who'd never done anything deserving of it.<br>
<br>
To this Dark Elven Enchanter of 58 seasons I say this -<br>
There is a difference between being a biggot and roleplaying. Being rude to another person just because you dont agree with the way they live their lives is not accpetable under any circumstances, Especially not if it doesnt affect you in any way. If you dont like it, move on. I pitty people like you.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=757539" target="top">Korynna Shadowhawk</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->-Proud Mommy to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=773913">Julyete</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Seriously, isn't this same issue like ten threads down?<br>
<br>
Roleplaying server.  Some people won't like races that hate each other according to the backstory being married or even grouping.  Am I one of them?  No.  But just put them on ignore if they bug you.  Too many words have been wasted, too much time lost to this issue that isn't even an issue anymore.<br>

No, it isn't my place to say *OOC* that it's wrong for you to do that. But it just sounded how you said it that the person who did this was simply roleplaying. And sometimes that's just how other characters react. <br>
<br>
Just as you say that they can't tell them what to do, you can't tell them that they can't react to a situation thier charatcer may not like. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

This I am sure was never meant for you to take as OOC.  Please remember that a dark elf is a evil race which believes that all other races inferiour.  Therefore by marrying and having children with a wood elf he is considered to have weakened the race.  Pure rp that is all it is.<br>
If your going to be on a rp server please get less thinned skinned about different forms of rp.  <br>

See, there are a lot of people who RP that dark elves should not mate outside the race as it dilutes the gene pool.  And there are those who believe that it doesn't matter.  Neither RP belief is more correct than the other.<br>

Jaranna believes in bigotry on Norrath.  However, PoJaranna does not believe that anyone who refuses to practice inter-racial marriage is a bigot.  I am just wondering how you came to the conclusion that this enchanter was a bigot in real life.

That the many gods that created Norrath created sentient beings of their own design, to further their purposes?  That Innoruuk created dark elves from an ancient high elf king and queen, twisting their forms over centuries and turning them into hateful beings that want nothing more than the complete and total extermination of Tunare and her minions?<br>
<br>
No.  You just made the extraordinary leap of faith that this person was a bigot in real life.  Norrath IS NOT 21st century Earth.  Stop placing judgement on people for acting in a manner very much in line with the small roleplaying framework we have been given.<br>
<br>
I despise bigotry in real life, but I choose to not have my character group with certain folks, and I would not accept you and your dark elf husband, because it's anathema to my character's belief system, and that's that.  Get used to it, because it's something you are going to encounter again and again on FV.  It is a fact of life here, and that's why it's a dead horse.  Look outside of your little world you've created and try to think about how other characters might view things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roosekevdrosa>Roose Kevdrosa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.wtv-zone.com/Lasher/LashersLair/heartspin.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Firiona Vie's Personal<br>

I play a Tier'Dal Shadow Knight who worships Quellious and is a member of Kelethin Legions. I quite openly display my guild tag in game and I get shit from other Tier'Dal about my choices and how I am a traitor and blah blah blah. I got shit, all IC mind you, when I was involved with a Fier'dal bardess. <br>
<br>
In Norrath, races hate each other. Its a fact. Politicly correct people do not exist. Had this occured IRL, ie. you and your husband being of difrence race and some one coming up to you and insulting you for it, that would be wrong<br>
<br>
But IC bigotry exists because its game lore. Thats the way it is. I hate to sound rude, but if your character married a tier'dal necromancer, the epitom of evil in most cases, most of the world will look and say &quot;that aint right&quot;, because the game lore dictates it as such. <br>
<br>
If you cant handle the IC bigotry that will plague you for the rest of the time you are married to a inky necro, leave or reroll. Its goin to happen and it will happen more often as well. If your husband and daughter, im supposing they are IRL, are playing and you three wish to play together, right on. I support that, but make the same sided characters. <br>
<br>
If you didnt like that one run in, you wont like the next 1000. They will occur. Lord knows HOW many times I've had to defend my characters actions to other Tier'Dal and the &quot;good&quot; races.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/warden4423/newzaith2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
1.  Select another server, doesn't matter which one.<br>
<br>
2.  Do the &quot;New Character&quot; creation, select &quot;Wood Elf&quot;, and read the description of Fier'Dal.<br>
<br>
Notice that they don't actively &quot;Hate&quot; <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> race except Tier'Dal?  They may be dismayed by many races - Iksar, Troll, Ogre, etc., but they don't actively &quot;Hate&quot; any race but Tier'Dal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but I've used the description that the game designers left as a basic guide for my character.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC, I think that Tier'Dal ladies are quite cute.  And many of them are absolutely wonderful roleplayers, from my experiences with them (and they're usually antagonistic towards me, which I expect from them).<br>
<br>
IC, I'd like to see them all spitted on pikes and displayed around their hometown, just for effect...<br>
<br>
The fact that a Tier'Dal was upset at seeing you and your husband together is just the tip of the iceberg, in my humble opinion - there are a lot of Fier'Dal that would have similar reactions.  And most likely that person was simply reacting according to the racial hatred that exists between Fier'Dal and Tier'Dal - it was nothing personal towards you, the player.  I get the creeps every time I see Seraphimm (Koda'Dal) hanging out with Rebelle,  but I simply look at her as a &quot;fallen angel&quot;, for lack of a better description.  How each character reacts is different, just like in real life.  But I'm certain it was nothing personal to you, the player.<br>
<br>
But that's just my 2 copper's worth...<br>

P.S.  As for my own little dig at this topic (I rather agree with all the above, i.e. character actions do not equal player opinions and if you don't understand that basic tenent of role-playing you need to seriously re-evaluate yourself) I'd like to add that on this same basis, we could accuse Sony themselves as being horribly racist.  When was the last time your saw an orc portrayed in a positive light?  How come as soon as you see one you assume it's there to be killed?  How racist of them!  How racist of them to even suggest that racial tensions might exist in the first place!  How...<br>

Sometimes in trying to take somebody down by appearing more sophisticated than they are, one ends up achieving the opposite effect.  Apparently, the Atlantic ocean is still an effective cultural divide for some, even in the days of the Internet.<br>
<br>
If you'll travel across the sea to a lovely little country where English was first assembled, you'll discover not only a surprising number of Everquest players, but an endearing array of expressions and slang in their language that is wholly their own.<br>
<br>
As for the racial hatred, there's a reason I play a neutral character on a roleplay server.  People will generally choose to love or hate me based on personal preference rather than a larger issue, and I am obligated to hate no other player based solely on how they look.  It's perfectly okay with me if people want to play that way -- that's specifically how the game was set up -- but it's such an incredibly unpleasant way of thinking that I don't even enjoy pretending.  I think I'm just not a very good actor...<br>
