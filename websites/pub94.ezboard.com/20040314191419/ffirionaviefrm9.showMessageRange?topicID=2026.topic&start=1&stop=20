Yes it is like EQ in that it is an MMORPG with dedicated servers. I was in the PS2 Beta and liked quite a bit of the stuff they did with it, but it wasn't necessarily my cup of tea. A bunch of my RL friends are jumping into this though so I might just buy the PC version and give it another shot even though I am getting free PS2 Hard drive loaded with FFFXI (( though that won't be released until March, bleh... )).<br>
<br>
FYI this game is very very very group dependent, and don't expect to be able to solo past about level 20. There is one job (job=class by the way) in the game that can solo effectively and that is the beastmaster. Grouping however is pretty easy as there is a nice &quot;Form Party&quot; menu that you use when LFG. You have your raids as well, though in FFXI they are called &quot;alliances&quot; and allow for a maximum of 3 parties of 6 players.<br>
<br>
Any race/job combination is possible, and if you don't like a job that you pick you can always change to a different one, there is no need to start a new character. Theoretically, if given enough time, you could level every single job up to maximum. However, many of the jobs must be unlocked through different quests, and you only start out with the basic jobs available, such as Warrior, Black Mage, White Mage, etc. You are allowed a primary job, and in addition once you reach level 18 and complete the appropriate quest, a support job as well, which can be a maximum of 1/2 the level of your current main job. However, you don't gain experience for your support job, so you essentially have to switch back and forth, leveling up two jobs to get the most out of your support job. For example let's say you level up a black mage to 18, finish the support job quest, and then change class to white mage and level it up to 10. When you switch back to Black mage you would be a 18BM/9WM. If you switched back to white mage as a primary job, you would be a 10WM/5BM.<br>
<br>
Personally I started out as a warrior, and unlocked Dark Knight and Samarai, and got that combo going and it pretty much owned. The Black mage/white mage combo is pretty powerful, but so many people are playing mages that it was nice to try something different. Also expect to see a lot of Tarutarus running around.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am talking about these little bastards here...<br>

<br>
I have a few questions about FFXI that have not been addressed by any of the media I've seen regarding the game.  For starters, to what extent does this game resonate with its nominal series?  From the looks of it, it bears more of a likeness to the first titles, and to some extent FFIX and FFT.  At a glance, it appears to have been modeled on the mainstream MMORPG fantasy genre.  The return of the job class system and its potential for customization is a staple of the series, but the similarities end there, based on what I have gleaned from demo footage and screenshots.  Granted, that's hardly conclusive.<br>
<br>
One of the hallmarks of the Final Fantasy series is the roundabout way of transmitting common themes that establish a vague sense of continuity.  The system of spells, and the recurring enemies that individualize the series.  That's one of the principle draws for me, anyway.<br>
<br>
So, twenty questions:  <br>
<br>
Are there any familiar items or weapons?  Are there degrees of spells (e.g. Fire, Fira, Firaga)?  Is it possible to cast summon spells (e.g. Bahamut, Shiva, Ifirit)?  How many jobs are there really, as I have seen only a few mentioned on the official website?  Can you learn special abilities from equipment, or is it level-based?  Is the combat interface point and click or turn-based in Final Fantasy fashion?  How difficult is it to advance in level compared to the langorous crawl of EQ?  How expensive are these World Passes required to play on the same server as a friend?  Are chocobos costly, and can anyone ride them?<br>
<br>
More like ten questions, actually.  If you could disclose on some of the mechanics, I'd be much obliged.  For a game to which I have been looking forward for some time, I am not very knowledgeable of it.  Truthfully, I have my doubts.  The concept of a Final Fantasy MMORPG is almost too brilliant to be credible or viable. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.projectbag.com/cowboy_bebop/thumbnails/andy08_t.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-large;"> + </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.projectbag.com/cowboy_bebop/thumbnails/andy02_t.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-large;"> = </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://ic.pricegrabber.com/muze_images/Video/Covers/54/102754_89x160.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=targok>Targok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/03 8:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2026.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FFXI</span><hr size=1> I plan on buying this since I'll have a PC capable of running it come Sun.<br>

First off the official English site just launched so let me drop that here for those interested, and then on to your questions.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>For starters, to what extent does this game resonate with its nominal series?

Granted, that's hardly conclusive.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I think this is a fair statement. The fact is that like all FFs, Vana'diel is a unique world. One of the cool things about FFXI though is you do get cutscenes from taking on/completing quests, and I think there is a more immersing feel to it than your typical MMORPG. Square is supposed to also constantly keep the game storyline flowing with new areas, new quests, changing world events, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are there any familiar items or weapons<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> You will see a lot of familiar names, such as mithril bronze, and brass weapons. All weapons and armor have a minimum equipable level, and an of course you have your items that give   HP, MP, stats, elemental resistances, etc. As far as other special abilities, in the instance of weapons if you are talking about effects like elemental damage, or inflicting silence, then yes. You won't see stuff like clickies as you do in EQ. However, there is very high level armor that gives special abilities such as increased/decreased hate, reduced casting failures, or increased magic skills.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are there degrees of spells (e.g. Fire, Fira, Firaga)? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes, but they are old school as in Fire 1, Fire 2, Fire 3, etc. Once again many of these names will ring similar, blizzard, thunder, aero, water, stone, sleep, flare. White magic is similiar with Cure 1, 2, Protect 1, 2, Protectera 1, 2. For White magic, cure is for a single target, and curaga is for the party, stuff like that. Black magic, you have your standard spells and then your Group spells to attack groups of enemies.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Is it possible to cast summon spells (e.g. Bahamut, Shiva, Ifirit)? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Oh definately, if you are a Summoner <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . You will again notice many familiar names again, such as Ifrit, Shiva, and Leviathan, and also each summon gets stronger attacks based on your level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How many jobs are there really, as I have seen only a few mentioned on the official website?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Basic Jobs: Warrior, Monk, Thief, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage.<br>
<br>
Advanced Jobs: Paladin, Bard, Dark Knight, Beastmaster, Ranger, Summoner, Samurai, Ninja, Dragoon<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Can you learn special abilities from equipment, or is it level-based?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Special abilities are strictly level based.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How difficult is it to advance in level compared to the langorous crawl of EQ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Unfortunately you are not going to get a break here. If anything I would say leveling takes even more time than in EQ, but I don't find it to be quite as tedious. The combat system is one of the elements I enjoyed, and it is incredibly fun and addictive. Plus, since you will nearly always be fighting in groups for much better experience, not to mention how easy it is to find groups, it makes it a bit more enjoyable. Based on my experience, I think for a familiar player it would probably take about two weeks worth of constant 4-5 hours of leveling a day to get to 30. For someone who is completely new to the game and wasn't in beta, you are looking at a significantly longer amount of time. This does not include the fact that you will probably find yourself spending a great deal of time on quests and getting to know the world initially. I am sure nearly everyone will want to take time to do the subjob quest at level 18, and then proceeds to level up a second job, if they haven't prior to completing the quest. Not to mention if you want to unlock one of the special jobs you will need to be of appropriate level, and then do the quest needed to unlock it. Then of course you will be starting that job from level 1.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How expensive are these World Passes required to play on the same server as a friend?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> The cost of a world pass varies by how many players there are on that particular server, and buying one in the Beta netted you 5 uses. I have heard that this might be reduced to 1 as the servers fill up. Initially, they will not be very expensive at all, around 100 to 150 Gil which not very hard at all to raise. However as more and more people begin to populate the server, the price of the pass will continue to increase. I have heard on some of the most populated servers, they go for around 1500 Gil. I guess this helps serve as a check and balance to keep server populations relatively equal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Are chocobos costly, and can anyone ride them?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Anyone can potentially ride them, but you first get your chocobo license by completing a quest. To do this you must be level 20 and you have to kill a certain enemy to get 4 or 5 of a particular grass item to feed the chocobo. Once you get your license you can then rent out a chocobo to ride, and they are relatively cheap, like around 100 gil. I also think the price goes down as you increase in level, though I don't quite remember.<br>
<br>
I will get into the battle mechanics a bit later, I am posting from work so time is of course a bit limited, but nonetheless as I said is unique and fun, and definitely one of the best parts about FFXI. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=samuraicowboy>Samurai Cowboy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://studiocyen.net/blue/mini/comeon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/03 11:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2026.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Thanks, Deldrach.

After viewing the benchmark demonstration, I must say that this looks to be one of the most aesthetically satisfying and stylish MMO's around.  I'm geared up for purchasing it when it debuts.  Given its prior release in Japan, I am interested in seeing how smoothly the stateside launch goes.<br>
<br>
Either way, there is a sub-job called Samurai, and I hear it beckoning me. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.projectbag.com/cowboy_bebop/thumbnails/andy08_t.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-large;"> + </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.projectbag.com/cowboy_bebop/thumbnails/andy02_t.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-large;"> = </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://ic.pricegrabber.com/muze_images/Video/Covers/54/102754_89x160.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/03 4:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2026.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Already laid down a prepay on the thing, though it'll be low-resolution for me.

<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-size:medium;">Deldrach's FFXI Job FAQ v 0.10</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> First off, there are three general rules for main/sub combinations.<br>
<br>
1. Race does matter. I hate to say it but in FFXI more so than EQ this is very true. The fact is in EQ it is not very hard to max your INT as a Wizard no matter what race you are, but if you are a high level Taru Taru Black Mage in FFXI with full artifact armor (best armor in the game at the moment), you will have a great deal more INT &amp; MP than a Black Mage of any other race. This cuts across the board with stats for other races/jobs. When other players are forming parties, if you are playing an uncommon race/job combo you will probably be passed over quite a bit, but such is life. However if you are a Hume, one of the advantages is that since you have pretty good all around stats you can switch jobs easily and still be effective, allowing for much more versatility. Keep this in mind in whether you plan on experimenting with a lot of different jobs, or specializing in just a certain one.<br>
<br>
2. Don't mix Melee and Magic! Yes, I know that Ninja/Summoner sounds pretty cool but it is just not going to be viable, and neither will that White Mage/Paladin. Just don't do it!<br>
<br>
3. Advanced Jobs generally do not make good sub Jobs. (With the exception of Samurai for most melees)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>II.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Now on to class explanations.<br>
<br>
1. Monk<br>
<br>
These guys make great damage dealers and have a good deal of hit points, but don't expect them to tank because they don't have much defense. I have heard that high level Monks are a great asset to groups, but they suffer from a midlevel funk and can be a bit tough to level.<br>
<br>
Preferred sub jobs: Warrior, Thief, Samurai<br>
<br>
2. Thief<br>
<br>
There are a lot of Thieves running around in Vana'deil, and for good reason. After level 30, Thieves get an ability that is essential for helping to control hate (aggro) in a party. They also are pretty good damage dealers as well, and are a great job/subjob for earning Gil. In fact, Thieves make great subjobs for nearly any melee class.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior, Monk, Ninja, Ranger<br>
<br>
3. Warrior<br>
<br>
For a melee class, Warriors are fairly well balanced and versatile. Depending on the sub job you chose, they can be either the second best tank in the game or can be a decent damage dealer as well. They can use a variety of weapons, but their preferred weapon is the 2-handed Axe, and their weapons skills provide good damage all around. Warrior also makes a very good sub job for any other melee job.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Monk, Thief, Samurai<br>
<br>
4. Black Mage<br>
<br>
The Black Mage is there for one purpose, dishing out the pain. They are the second best damage dealer in the game and will often sub White Mage as well to act as a backup healer. Just watch your hate and don't get hit and you will be ok. Black Mages are always in high demand.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: White Mage, Red Mage, Summoner<br>
<br>
5. White Mage<br>
<br>
Well you probably don't need to ask what these guys do. These guys are there to heal party members and make sure everyone makes it through the day. WMs have a few support spells as well.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Black Mage, Red Mage, Summoner, Bard<br>
<br>
6. Red Mage<br>
<br>
You hear the term jack of all trades used quite often to describe Red Mages, but I don't think that really sums up what they can do. First off nobody can enfeeble(debuff, slow, paralyze, Bio 2) like these guys can, and they are always very sought after for groups, particularly after level 41. At level 41 Red Mages receive what may well be one of the best abilities in the entire game, the spell Refresh, which is a spell that increases MP regeneration. In addition they have good attack spells, a fast cast ability, and can also serve as a primary healer in place of a White Mage. Their melee skills tend to die off after about level 20, but if you are a Red Mage, you probably will never have to look very far for a group.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Black Mage, White Mage, Summoner, Bard<br>
<br>
7. Paladin<br>
<br>
In FFXI, Paladins=Meatshields, plain and simple. They are the best tank in the game...period. If you are a Paladin, you will be expected to sub Warrior for that job's taunt abilities. I have heard of a few Paladins that sub White Mage, and use Curaga to gain a great deal of enemy hate, but I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior<br>
<br>
8. Dark Knight<br>
<br>
These guys are the 3rd best damage dealers in the game. Think Rangers from EQ. They can really dish it out but they can't take much damage and would make horrible tanks for any foolish enough to try that. Based on my experience from the Beta, I think you are going to see a hell of a lot of these guys running around, and getting groups may be a bit tough because of this. They are known for using a Scythe, and their trademark weaponskill, Guillotine, is just plain awesome, and the damage from a high level Dark Knight subbing Samurai is a sight to behold. Managing hate however can be extremely tough, and so you will probably see a lot of these guys sub Thief to help in that department.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior, Thief, Samurai<br>
<br>
9. Summoner<br>
<br>
I must admit that my experience partying with Summoners was very limited, but the Summoner is not quite the job that people think it is. They serve more of a group support role than that of pure damage dealer, and their summons can't stay out for very long because they are huge MP hogs. With a Summoner in the group, a Bard or Red Mage becomes that much more vital for MP regeneration. If you want to deal damage, put on the funky BM hat instead.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: White Mage<br>
<br>
10. Bard<br>
<br>
Quick! What is the most sought after job when forming a party? No not a White Mage, it's a Bard. Now what will be the rarest job to find in FFXI? Yes, you guessed it, Bards. I am not going to go as far in saying that Bards are required for high level groups, but it's pretty damn close. Their songs provide a whole array of enfeeblements and stat enhancements, in addition to being great healers with a bit of damage dealing thrown in as well. Want mana regeneration? Get a bard to sing Ballad. In addition Bard Songs don't use up any MP. It is almost beyond belief how much more effective Mages can be when there is a Bard present.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: White Mage<br>
<br>
11. Beast Tamer<br>
<br>
This was the only class I did not have the opportunity to group with in the Beta. There are tales told of their great soloing ability by taming a monster and then using it to attack another, which is similiar to charming in EQ. I am not sure how well they can function in a group, but I know that just encountering one in Beta was pretty rare, and I don't expect many people will choose this job.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior, White Mage<br>
<br>
12. Ninja<br>
<br>
These guys are well known for their ability to dual wield. They do pretty decent damage, and I have heard as tanks if you really burn Gil on equipment and their Ninjitsu skills that their tanking ability rivals that of even Paladins. However, this is very costly as their skills require Gil to use and so this can be a very expensive job if you want to get the most out of it.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior, Thief, Samurai<br>
<br>
13. Ranger<br>
<br>
Bar none the Ranger is potentially the king of damage in FFXI. I say potentially because like Ninjas they are very expensive. In fact they are the most costly job in the game, because they must pay an arm &amp; leg for ammo, namely bullets or arrows. If you are a Ranger you can expect to be poor. Rangers of course use bows and guns to attack from a distance and their Scan ability is similar to track in EQ. I'm sure a lot of Rangers will probably sub Thief to help out in the money-making department.<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior, Thief, Ninja, Samurai<br>
<br>
14. Samurai<br>
<br>
The Samurai is the key to chaining weapon skills which allows for the party to dish out a huge amount of damage. I expect a lot of party leaders will be Samurais for this reason. Their own damage dealing abilities are so-so, and they have about average statistics, but in combat you can expect to be very active in starting up skill chains. The Samurai is probably the only advanced class that can be subbed effectively as well for this reason, though since their Concentration ability(which charges TP and allows for quick use of weapon skills) isn't gained until level 30, this job only becomes popular as a sub job at very high level, 60 .<br>
<br>
Preferred Sub Jobs: Warrior, Monk, Thief<br>
<br>
15. Dragoon<br>
<br>
Grrr.....I want to like this class, I really do. Dragoons were after all one of the really cool elements from the FF series. However, in FFXI from my perspective they are a huge disappointment. Their defining ability is not their various jumps (most of which suck), but their pet Wyvern. Yes Dragoons are primarily a pet class. If it dies, they will be gimped for quite some time until they are able to summon another one, and I believe that ability has a 2 hour refresh timer. Even with the Wvyern I was never overly impressed with their damage capability, though it does get a cool breath weapon depending on the Dragoon's subjob. You do get to name it as well which I guess is a plus. There were a lot of people that did the quest for Dragoon in beta, and sadly I expect a lot of people will be choosing this job simply because it's a &quot;Dragoon&quot;. Finding a party may become very difficult, but who knows I could be wrong.<br>
<br>

<br>
When you both install FFXI and log in and create a character, you don't get the chance to choose which server you will be on, and there is a good chance it will place each of your characters on different servers. However, what you can do is create a character, get a little bit of Gil, and buy something called a World Pass, which will initially not be very expensive at all. What this does is you can use this and it will give you a code that you then give to your husband so that he can put it in and get a character on your server. World passes will have 5 uses, so you can then use it 4 more times to allow other friends to put in a code and move their character to your server as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maushi>Maushi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/27/03 10:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2026.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Final Fantasy XI</span><hr size=1> Deldrach,<br>

That mini-FAQ is has alleviated much of the obscurity surrounding the jobs and their respective functions.  Still, I think I'm deadset on Samurai.  Theme is paramount.<br>

I don't think it's got an RP-preferred server, but I'm betting over time one will develop. First, you'd have to get a grounding in the world and it's lore after all.<br>
 <br>
Hmm....maybe I'll start with Red Mage/Bard if I can hack it. Always did like being a status fiend. :P<br>

There are already 29 Japanese servers, and from what I have asked of the importers in forums, there is no RP preffered server. There will be additional servers of course for the NA launch, and I am sure RPers will gravitate towards one eventually. Also a thing I haven't mentioned, all servers are located in Japan, but this never amounted to any type of problem with lag. Even those in Beta who were playing on a 56k said that lag wasn't an issue as long as your computer could hack it. The only problem I heard of with any sort of lag was at the end of Beta event where every single Beta tester was in the same area, along with a lot of the unique NM, but that is of course to be expected <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . What this also means is that though our servers will consist primarily of NA players, we will be playing alongside some Japanese players as well, which should make things fun and interesting.<br>
