Her name was Marlayna(or something close) and she looked human, looked to be a fighter, or a rogue or something of the like. She asked if she could see one of my swords, and after telling her that I don't hand my blades to strangers, I told her what she watned to know about it. She then mentions my apparent age, and I try to explain to her that my rank of power doesn't reflect my age, etc. Then she proceeds to tell me that my story was weak and unbelievable, even in a fantasy setting, and that I if I wanted to be a twink, to at least have the balls to own up to it.<br>

Honestly, do you believe that all characters must start out in abject poverty?  What is wrong in roleplaying a spoiled nephew, a heiress, a prince of the realm sowing wild oats....<br>
<br>
Whats wrong is that YOU don't have that option available to you.  On FV, even more than on other servers its how you play not what you wear that makes you what you are...  Don't be jealous of the good fortune (or old friends) that some have, just work to build your own gear and your own friendships.<br>

<br>
I'm not the jealous type, and the only time twinking has ever affected my gameplay directly is when there's a twinkie backhanding everything in a low-level zone and not looting.  (But hey, at least when there's nothing to hunt, new folks could at least loot the leftovers...)<br>
<br>
As far as twinking and Kimaya -- The only thing I remember being given to me is some druid food after I lost everything at 5th (thanks to whoever you were! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  However, not only would I take any extras someone offered me, I'm hanging onto a couple teeny extras I've picked up for when I eventually find someone who could use them.  As I start taking down bigger threats and pick up better things, I'm more likely to give away my extras than I am to sell them for two reasons:  I hate selling, and I'd much rather my handiwork go to someone who needs it, even if that isn't me.<br>
<br>
So I guess I have a question: Why do people care about twinking? <p>---<BR>

In the past, I have been a HUGE advocate of not twinking.  In the end, I chose to go this route, exchanging a lot of Sar's stuff for things a fighter could use,etc, because I thought it made RP sense.  Sar didn't DIE exactly. She was....purified, and in so doing, she lost all the things that had come from Karana. And none of her gear was godgiven really.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I understand not liking twinking; I'm sometimes emarrased by my gear and my lvl, although not so much anymore with the exception of my sword(but Sar bought that right before the...cleansing, she considered it an omen).  I think what got me was the absolute &quot;you're twink, so don't even bother to roleplay&quot; crap. I apparently am pretty proud of how I've handled the places Sar's gone.*shrug* <p><p align="center"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner"><b><font color="#710672" face="Black Chancery" size="-1">Sarhea</font></a><font

Then when someone is having a bad day, e.g., they get killed several times through no fault of their own, or through good RP (but it still hurts), or they have a bad group experience somewhere, or they're lonely, or whatever; then I see if I have anything to brighten their day. <br>
I also have been known to hand something to someone for a nice bit of RP, when it seems IC to do so.<br>
<br>
Now I am only a 33rd season enchantress on her 2nd real character.  So I don't have godly stuff to drop around.  But why *not* help someone.  IC-wise, sometimes it would be breaking RP to *not* give someone something.  I try not to let the &quot;physics&quot; of the gameworld dictate to me how I should roleplay.<br>
<br>
Finding a halfway decent RP reason to do it is rarely difficult.  And then there are presents for my friends and loved ones.  Birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  And of course you don't want to give them something they already have. <br>
<br>
Powerplayers who twink don't bug me.  They're doing their own thing and I hope they have fun.  Roleplayers who reroll characters or make an Alt (whole new account, not a minor thing on FV), already have invested hours and energy in acquiring some decent stuff.   And if someone is roleplaying well, I don't give a hoot or hollar about what &quot;equipment&quot; they have.   It's already tough enough. <br>
<br>
I am cautious about giving equipment to someone who is playing the first time, because learning about stuff is fun, and if you're handed *everything* on a silver platter, you might miss some stuff or get the wrong idea.  But giving a 1st season person I just met who seems nice a single platinum won't ruin them.  I gave a new character I met in Neriak a single platinum and a splitpaw belt, when I was 20th season about.  Now he's 50+ and so far beyond me it's laughable, as far as level goes.  I don't get to see him much, but I enjoy his company and we have fun chatting.  Now clearly, with that rate of advancement, he didn't *need* what I gave him.  But it was a pleasant bonding experience, and nicely played at the time.  I like to think that I saved him several hours on that first day, and that he expertly parlayed that into assisting his subsequent rapid attainment.  A newbie would have not known for quite some time how useful what I gave him was.  He knew immediately, and his thanks were heartfelt.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, beggars who won't lift a hand to save themselves leave me cold.<br>
<br>
Just a few thoughts from someone who got really excited when in a duo she killed the EC griffin this week for the 1st time, ever.  Lots of folks in EC at the time cheered us (we can hunt without fear of the hungry griffin!), and it felt like a public service.  The rush was fabulous.<br>
