<br>
I have been playing EQ from day one. I have a few 50+ charactrers across different servers. <br>
<br>
I left my other server to come to FV for the RP experiance... My other server was Xev. I was a member of Shadowclan, a RP evil guild on a non RP server. <br>
<br>
I am fluient in the Drow language and have posted many stories on the SC boards that have made people gasp/cry IRL.<br>
<br>
I have the RP thing down.<br>
<br>
So here I am on FV. Where almost every guild is RP... no one is hogging the orc camps cause of twinkage... and everyone loves it here.<br>
<br>
I made a dark elf rogue. Been playing him for a week... have made zero friends. Have talked to 3 people total. 2 were in a non RP mannor (not my choice) and the other was a brief RP encounter. (Although my character really POed the other character)<br>
<br>
So I run off and start focusing on LVLing... maybe double digits will get others attention... <br>
<br>
So I'm getting beat down by a leatherfoot scout and a yellow conning ogre with a lammy and a yellow conning SK in full plate just stand there and watch me die. Conning yellow at lvl 2 = 3... no?<br>
<br>
Then I start seeing all these dead NPC corpses laying around unlooted and think that it is odd... then I get the answer... over 50% of the new characters in nek are twinked and dont need to worry about loot. <br>
<br>
*sigh*<br>
<br>
A few days of this go by and I try again... and I see it all again... I approach a fellow Rogue on the freeport dock... I inspect him... I shouldnt have done that... He is sproting a Dragoon Dirk... I say  'wow, you killed a dragoon and took his dirk?' he says 'LOL'<br>
<br>
*sigh*  <br>
<br>
He then comments that he is not a twink... rahter, he informes me that he is a GM doing a live quest and that I shouldnt get upset. He then tells me that I dont understand this server. <br>
<br>
I think I can understand something such as an EQ server.<br>
<br>
I give the guy some history about myself... much like I have done here and ask him what he thinks I should do. He tells me that I should make a halfling and get him to a high lvl quick then twink a rerolled character. *sigh*  wasent he a guide a moment ago?<br>
<br>
When I tell him that I can speak the Drow language he says then he now knows that I am a true noobie, dont have any other characters, dont know anything about EQ and am a Baulders Gate fan. <br>
<br>
?!??!?!?!<br>
<br>
I ask him to explain...  he says that I used the word Drow... thats a D&amp;D thing... not an EQ thing... well.. for anyone else that thinks that... you are correct... EQ calls then Dark Elfs... RPers call then Tier'dal... twinks call then Inkys.. and in general conversation the term Drow is used to describe the language... none of the websites with translations call it the 'inky' language or the EQ DE language. <br>
<br>
But anyway... I'm now a true noob who knows nothing about EQ cause I use the term Drow.<br>
<br>
Anyway... my point is this... I dont feel it... I have read the posts here about others leaving their server for FV and fell in love instantly with the atmposphere... <br>
<br>
I have been ignored and insulted in less than a week... and it wasnt in character... I can hang with someone RPing a 'mean person'... but like I said... I have only RPed one time. <br>
<br>
Is everyone on this server an elitist? Why are the RP chanels password protected? Why do RP guilds have lvl restrictions on a RP server? Is it cause Im a DE/Inky/Tier'dal/Drow?<br>
Should I make a rivvil? (thats a member of any race that is not made up of blue-skinned elfs who have white hair for all you who dont speak Drow but speak Tier'dal)<br>
<br>
Should I follow his suggestion and cheat? Make a fast lvling halfling and then Twink a reroll? I have 2 accts and I could do it easly... Should I also use phrases such as LOL and dewd and phat ewber lewt?<br>
<br>
Anyone want to welcome me to this server? <br>
<br>
Anyone have any suggestions at all?<br>
<br>
I think I have done nothing more then express my frustration with the many negative experiances on this server (less then 2 positive ones) and shown my eagerness to be a part of the community.<br>
<br>
No, I dont think that it will happen in one week... but come on... It has to be better then this. <br>
<br>
Look for me ingame if you wish...<br>

<br>
I have had some very good RP experiences and made some great friends, but it did take some time. I have not played any evil races, so I cannot speak to them specifically, but I did generally play my characters normally, and went to the normal hunting spots, and then tenaciously held on to whoever RP'd with me. As friend or foe.<br>
<br>
In general, I made up the story that I wanted to RP, and then proceeded to do so on my own, while adding to my friend list whenever someone else participated.<br>
<br>
Getting into an RP guild helps. If you prefer evil, then you might try an Iksar. They seem to have a strong RP community.<br>
<br>
We have a raging debate on this board about whether a person that twinks themself could possibly also be an RP person, but whether you think so or not, the low population will always tend to get new players assigned here, and the &quot;Non-NO DROP&quot; code will also tend to lure power gamers from time to time, so there you are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Don't give up, because I HAVE found it a neat place!  And if you do insist on playing a dispicable twisted evil Drow, then I shall be happy to RP hating your guts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Wraithbane<BR>

<br>
You expect everyone and their mother to come up to a level 2 Teir'dal and roleplay with them.<br>
<br>
What makes you so special?<br>
<br>
That's why there's level limits on some RP guilds.  To ensure that the average member isn't just some d00d that says Season instead of Level so he can someday get an Eyepatch of Plunder or something.<br>
<br>
If you want roleplay, you MAKE your own roleplay.  Honestly, you can't expect any of the newbie areas to be teeming over with it, because more than half of those characters are visitors from other servers that will decide to go back, and almost a quarter more are people that are here just to enjoy the low server population and all that it entails.<br>
<br>
You never made a character on a PvP server ever?  I know I have, just to mess around and see what it was like.  I decided it wasn't for me, so I left.  So I should go to the PvP boards and complain that the servers don't have any PvP just because I'm level 4 and couldn't find anyone to fight an epic battle with?<br>
<br>
My first suggestion would be to get out of Nektulos.  A few good roleplayers, Nektulos is the GFay of the dark side.  Even just as far as Freeport will usually yield you nicer people.<br>
<br>
My second suggestion would be to make yourself known on this board with something other than ranting and raving, then work out in-game roleplay from what occurs here.  I've had a few good roleplay experiences with people that I would have never met had I not seen them on this board and sought them out.  One of my best friends on the server, and in my opinion is a great roleplayer, was over 20 levels higher than me when we first met.  If I had not sought this person out, I would have never had any of the great roleplay that's gone on between the two of us.<br>
<br>
My third suggestion would be consistency.  If you group with someone who isn't a roleplayer, either disband, or keep roleplay withing /gsay.  Don't stop acting like a roleplayer the minute peer pressure gets to you.  Chances are some roleplayer will wander by, hear you say 'ding 4!' and wander away in disgust, if you aren't consistent.<br>
<br>
My fourth suggestion would be to lighten up on the Drow ordeal.  Alot of people think it's very OOC to take something from somewhere else and inject it into the game.  Alot of people, however, love saying Vendui and Abbil.  But if someone puts you down when you're doing what you love, just put them on ignore and continue doing what you're doing.  If you take to heart every snide comment you'll ever get, you won't ever find any happiness.  Water off a duck's back...you won't change the world by worrying.<br>
<br>
My fifth and final suggestion is to give it another chance, and stick with it.  It may get frustrating, but the roleplay is out there.  Stick to your guns, get your surname, try to join a nice guild, and keep an extensive friends list when a prospective roleplayer rears his head.  Most of us who yearn for roleplay won't snuff off the opportunity to have more of the stuff.<br>
<br>
Good luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uyera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/02 1:56:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2376.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My first week on FV (a week I'll never get back)</span><hr size=1> Yes, I expect people to come up to a lvl 2 and RP... cause this is a RP server...  /duck<br>

RP on this server comes and goes...like tides. Sometimes there's a lot, and it's wonderful. Sometimes there isn't, and it sucks...but then again I ignore any and all d00ds. Ignore them, yes. Yell and kick my feet and hurt their feelings, no.<br>
<br>
As far as all that 'rp comes more with higher levels', I have to disagree. I'm 17, and have been young for most my time here, because I'm not on the normal treadmill and have been doing other rp things. Hey, learn Elvish, travel to Gfay and harass the weed elves. Or learn human and do it in Freeport. =) <br>
<br>
Sitting at the dock and on the boat are great places to meet people and learn languages. Heck, I'd take a round trip boat ride just to argue with some Pally.<br>
<br>
Xas, some people I guess would look down upon the Teir'dal vendui aluve stuff...but most of them I'd wager are not Teir'dal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have never met one person that said Dood, lighten up with the vendui crap, plz. At least on this server anyway. It creates great atmosphere, IMO. And who cares if some rp nazi is TELLING you how to rp YOUR character?  If I had a plat for every &quot;Greetin's m'lady, how art thou? Aye, the moon doth grow heavy in season&quot; I'd be a very rich blueberry. But did I once complain? Of course not. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Don't give up. This server is by far the best EQ server. Without it, I would have quit EQ months ago.  <p><Font color="#FF0033" link="#FF0033" vlink="#FF0033" alink="#000066">

I will say this, generally it seems to me that most are RP-lite, as in they are in character about half the time and OOC about half the time...usually people switch back and forth depending on who they are grouped with and what is going on.  However the one rule of thumb that I think is fairly important is not to OOC in Say or Shout...people don't always stick to it, but its SO much better than on a blue server.<br>
<br>
I've had great religious discussions, lots of fun bartering, and some pretty wacky experiences (Hey, I'm a Bristlebane bard, what can I say?) I've also been in groups where its Kill Kill Kill...there's enough of both though that you can find what you are looking fairly easily I think...as an evil race it will be a bit harder to travel (especially without the boats) this will make it harder to find people to fit your style I think.<br>
<br>
I didn't find a whole lot of RP until about level 10ish, then it seemed that a few doors opened up...but I also have travelled all over the place meeting people, give it some time.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't worry about the twinks...more loot for you anyway, skill is hard, equipment is easy...and twinks can RP as well as the next guy if they want to.<br>

When I got EQ back in March of this year, this was the first server I came to. I'd heard about it before (since it was several months established by the time I actually got to play), and instantly decided that RP was the way to go. Thus, I've learned (and still have many things to find out) about the game on FV, and will not leave FV until I quit EQ altogether. <br>
<br>
My first character (short-lived, due to inexperience with game mechanics) was a Half Elf Rogue of Freeport, and I basically just wandered around for several hours trying to find my guild house (this was back before they moved the spawns to right next to your guild leader). The first RP experience I had (though I didn't hear anyone talking OOC prior to it) was running into another person. They were talking about their husband or something, and they were also drunk. So I said a few IC things, blah blah blah, moved on. Then I met Dyshira Bladeshine on the Freeport docks and asked her IC if she knew where my guildhouse was. She said, &quot;Yes -- but are you sure you should be asking a Paladin about such things?&quot; And so she became my first /friend, and since then I've cycled through probably 72 characters, trying to find the right one. Oh well.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I have not seen much RP on this server (though it's understandable, considering that I haven't really played a character past ten, and I keep switching RP communities). I know that Lasgalen RPs, Dyshira RPs, this nice girl from the Circle of Sisters does, Kloevis and I think the rest of the Twilight Bastion does, and Zildrax (we'll miss you) and the rest of Skathris Ven'Sho vehemently do. Also, many of the others on this board. They're all good people.<br>
<br>
So I guess, what I'm trying to say is, that you will find RP if you're looking for it. You'll find non-RP if you don't.<br>
<br>
I hope you stay here, if only so that we might, someday, outweigh the population of d00ds. It still gets me that out of, what, like 40 servers, they continue to click on the one designed for RP (well, at first it was). But that's a rant, and it doesn't belong here. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=skrag>Skrag</A> at: 7/22/02 9:01:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umyrielle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myrielle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/02 9:39:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2376.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My first week on FV (a week I'll never get back)</span><hr size=1> Well now,<br>

I have had some fairly sketchy experiences in my whole week in Nektulous as well - <br>
<br>
But, so far, the good outweigh the bad.  Take yesterday, for example - I ran into an educated Troll, and ended up getting whirlwinded into an impromptu language faire / orc hunt that was some of the most fun I've had in EQ in one day, ever.  Even Shintou ran by &lt;I can't believe I missed it&gt; and apparently got miffed at the troll who spoke Elder Tier'Dal better than he did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But anyway, don't give up heart - I suspect that out past the Forest, there are many more people who have a better sense of RP than that which roams Nektulos - there are even some of us in that bloody place, massacring orcs and such. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Sounds like you've got the &quot;stuck in n00bie zone&quot; blues. If you'll look through the archives here, you'll see we get about one such post every few weeks, though your case sounds particularly heinous.<br>
<br>
Here's the sad, sad fact: A lot of d00dz come to FV for the low server population. They can PL and twink and whatnot to their hearts' content. For whatever reason, though, most of them don't last too long. Maybe they get sick of people ignoring them when they say stuff like &quot;d00d SoW plz k thx.&quot; Maybe they find TLC cuts back on their farming, so they pack up their spades and hoes and head back to  a server with more fertile soil. Who knows?<br>
<br>
So you end up with a lot of non-RPing twinked out d00dz hanging out in the newbie zones, but not a lot in the mid-levels. For that reason, a lot of mid-level folks (i.e. me) will often avoid newbie areas. We hate the shouts, the WTB/WTS/WTT auctions, the begging. In my opinion (and you'll find there is some controversy over this, and a lot of folks don't agree with me), the problem has only gotten worse since they dropped the CR's for under level 10.<br>
<br>
I've got a few suggestions that you might want to take:<br>
<br>
1. Just try leveling up into the double digits and get the Brell out of the newbie zones. It's not that people here are elitist in the sense that they don't want to be seen in the company of a level 2, but rather that the places where there are lots of level 2's have a lot of d00dz (as your experience demonstrates). And don't listen to the person who alleged to be a GM -- just level your current character, don't use a halfling to twink something else.<br>
<br>
2. Try hanging out in taverns and striking up conversations with folks there. If possible, find a tavern that sells nothing but booze, so that you don't get folks coming in there for food and water. You'll probably spend some time just sitting around alone, but when folks do eventually come in, they are probably there to RP. When you find me in a newbie zone, I'm usually at the tavern getting hammered.<br>
<br>
3. Find some in character reason to RP with someone else. Perhaps advertize that you are looking for a mentor? Find a guild to join? Find one other nasty inky to become the Bonny to your Clyde (or visa-versa)? If you can find just ONE other person, then it'll be your passport into the wonderful world of FV.<br>
<br>
Don't give up. I'm sorry to say that the newbie zones have been given over as d00d ghettos, and you are stuck in the middle of it. Once you get into the mid-ranges, though, you'll find you never have to speak to a non-RPer if you don't want to.<br>
<br>
By the way, if you happen to run into me, I'd be happy to chat with you in /tells, but Gnosis doesn't much care for dark elfy-types, so IC I'll probably just avoid you.<br>

Alas sometimes a good experience takes time, glad to here you found some fun interacting with Sel'quar. My house and theirs have a formal alliance. (joint channel between the two guilds) All I can say as many of the rest have said it to stick it out, the role players are out there and as the guide saying that about drow, the official stance of EQ is  drow is D&amp;D and has no place in EQ.

If I had not been out on a Deathfist Scout Sweep (Innorouk take all of them to the Hells, I say, as long as he leaves their bones for me!!!) I would have had the pleasure to see the indomitable Shintou out-spoken by a Troll, in the elder language of his own race. <br>

Don't sing my praises too loudly or there are those who might suspect me of having higher intellect than your categorically daft, unassuming Troll. That's the last thing I need, let me tell you. Everyone in Grobb will accuse me of being &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;literate.&quot; I'm too sensitive to take peer ridicule in stride!<br>
<br>
/laugh<br>
<br>
Certainly, I've only recently met Shintou, but I've heard the opinions of others concerning him and have witnessed firsthand his diatribe. It did prove an amusing distraction, and I was able to further evaluate the unique nature of what I would call the traditional Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
Shintou, for all of his sound and fury, doesn't pause to consider his own position through in its entirety. Despite this, he takes it upon himself to make certain that everyone within ear shot of him hears his hateful propaganda. The fellow's ideology relies on rather circular reasoning that invariably returns to ad hominen abusive arguments, poisoning the well, or some other completely off-topic and irrelevant hostile oath.<br>
<br>
Even so, he has a following of would-be Shintou's. One would think that his &quot;bad boy&quot; image would only have adolescent Teir'Dal females swooning. Yet, in actuality, there are many less impressionable persons who hold him in high esteme. Curious, indeed.<br>
<br>
But, maybe I'm missing the big picture? After all, I'm only a stupid Troll in a contrastingly brilliant world.<br>

IC, I view the Drow words as a slang-dialect that you either know or you don't, just like learning English doesn't mean you'll understand the heavier slang of cockney.  (Want a funny time?  Try telling that last sentence to a friend in-game when they have the language-filter up, then wonder why they don't understand what you're saying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  OOC, I find heavy use of Drow words kinda inconsiderate to folks who don't have the D&amp;D Drow supplement handy, let alone the same website compilation you're using with words other folks added and made up.<br>
<br>
And since others have put out tons of great advice, I'll just quickly add my vote to calling Nektulos the &quot;other side&quot; of GFay.  Stick it out through the low levels, get to know folks who'll RP with you, and things should start moving for you.  Play around with character types if you want to, take some time to find out where you're happy.  Chances are good there's a group of folks that'll make you glad you met them, you just have to find them.<br>

Good luck!<br>

Gnosis, I think, has hit it right on.  Most of the responses here have great suggestions and support… and on that note, I would like to add MY first few days experience on FV.<br>
<br>
My mate and I were fully ready to learn our new home and surroundings and train up in our tradeskills to keep ourselves protected and armed.  But we weren’t on for 20 minutes before we got tells inviting us to come to the bank for “something I was keeping for just such an occasion” gifts of armor and weaponry.  I was actually at one point trying to decide who of the three people calling me over I was going to follow.  The genuine kindness and generosity of the people we met was pretty overwhelming.  And they all RPd!!!<br>
<br>
I am very excited to be playing a Vah Shir.  Ever since leaving EQ several months ago, I was always fascinated with the upcoming expansion and the new race (big cat lover in RL).  But my man and I were burned out and quit, a story for another time, or perhaps not at all hehe  All I can say is so far it is so great to be back.  It’s a whole new game for us; new race, new zones and a new server.  <br>
<br>
With the gifts bestowed upon my mate and I, we were able to hunt more efficiently and there seemed to always be someone in the vicinity to aid us or provide “run-by” buffings.  Now leveled up to 9, my mate and I were thrilled to be able to continue the line of kindness by giving anything we could not use to those younger than ourselves.  It felt great!  This is what I want in a server home.  People who actually play their character and help each other.  What a concept <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have played a couple of dark elves as well, and on more populated servers you can still be ignored out on the newbie log.  Even worse, the noob mentality and KSing there is more widespread than I imagine it would be on FV.  <br>
<br>
Never fear, I am sure you will find more pleasing adventures once you finally peek your head out into the East Commons area.  Or better yet, get leveled up and fly to the moon, us kitties haven’t really seen many dark elves, and our curiosity has the better of us, as usual.<br>
<br>
For now, my mate and I obey the call of the animal spirits to help us further in our adventures.  We look forward to the day when we can finally see, with our own eyes, the other races that inhabit our mother planet of Norrath.<br>

Alot of it is a matter of luck.<br>
<br>
My best results often come in asking questions of groupmates in order to encourage roleplaying.  Asking about their homeland, ideologies, experiences in context gets them started off on the right foot, I think.  That leads to my own introductions and it's far easier to stay in character when everyone else is.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, however, there just isn't that right feel within the group, and everyone goes silent except for the mana status reports and incoming messages.  8(  I guess you take the good with the bad.<br>
<br>
Like everyone else said, if you can find someone who roleplays, is around your level, and likes to group, add them to your friends list right away!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
As far as restarting as something other than a Dark Elf...<br>
<br>
The worst /shouts I ever heard on this server came in East Commonlands.  Next would be Greater Faydark.  Nectulos Forest actually didn't seem that bad.  Misty Thickett was generally quiet, but alot of auctions were going on.  Steamfont was a very nice area to grow up in.  I think any newbie zone can experience a bad day or two.  Aside from East Commonlands and Greater Fay, I never really saw an innane running conversation in /shout.  Mainly just a large volume of auctions in zones that have their newbie armor quests implemented.<br>
<br>
I was actually surprised at the number of people who were hanging out near Neriak and how generous people were in Nectulos.  Again, I think it's more luck than anything.  If you are going to stick with your rogue, I'd suggest doing some traveling so you can meet more people and hopefully connect with a few roleplayers.  If you're not stuck on playing a rogue, it might be easier for you to start a class that can solo/travel more easily in order to get a better feel for the entire server's personality and perhaps find areas where there are more people you can enjoy interacting with.<br>
