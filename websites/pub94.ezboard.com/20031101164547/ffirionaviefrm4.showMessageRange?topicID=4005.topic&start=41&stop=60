The LDoN dungeons are custom made for your group. A dungeon that is a challenge for a level 65 character would chew a level 55 character up in very short order. A dungeon that is a challenge for a level 55 character is something that a level 65 might be able to solo. I think that a 7 level spread for the 50+ crew is pretty generous. <br>
<br>
Yes it is unfortunate that you can not enter the zones with all of your friends. But do you really want the lower level members of the party spending 90 minutes putting their armor back on? Or the higher level members /yawning at the MOBs throughout the adventure? I know I don’t.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have no intention of entering an LDoN zone with anyone below level 60 and I would prefer that everyone be 65.  I want the best that the zone can throw at me and I want to have my best chance at beating it.<br>

It's in place to balance the dungeons themselves, and it is the perfect level range.  It's the point at which classes begin to use their usefulness in a group compared to their peers.  My ingame wife is 55th, I'm 65th.  In the past two days, she's gained probably 70-80% exp and it usually takes her (and usually me) an age to work up the energy to experience.  Thanks to LDoN, she will soon be closer to my level and I can take her to all the places I hunt without the risk of her being resisted and/or dying.  That suits me perfectly.<br>
<br>
The experience itself is perfect too.  It's not elemental planes, nor is it Plane of Valor/Bastion of Thunder.  I see just enough improvement in my experience bar to make it all worthwhile.  In the end, I forget I'm even getting experience and it's actually a pleasant surprise to see my exp bar has jumped as much as it has.  If I want AA, fast, I go do BoT or the e-planes, but after this, I won't be daily grinding there anymore.<br>
<br>
Caillou, seriously.  You haven't even been in a dungeon yet, right?  So why are you complaining?  Infact, why is anyone complaining about unpacifyable mobs or aggro ranges or anything like that?<br>
<br>
These encounters are dungeon crawls.  They are not exp camps.  They are not boring-set-up-a-camp-lets-go-grind encounters.  They are designed to kill you.  You need your wits about you.  They are not controllable camps.  You take a chance.  If you decide to investigate too far, there is a chance they will hit you with something nasty.  I wasn't swearing at my screen when I put a bitten victim to rest and found three spiders jumped out of the corpse.  Instead, it made me wary of the next time it happened.  I was so impressed at what they had done and damn it, it gave the place atmosphere!  No back spawns meant not only was I wary of what might come behind, and it also made CR easier.  It ALSO means that you don't need a wizard/druid/graveyard to exit the place.<br>
<br>
You die in dungeon crawls.  It's the reality of it.  Sometimes you get hit hard, sometimes you don't.  I'd rather die laughing, knowing I was killed by the dungeon after a supremely hard fight than spend six friggin hours in BoT at exp_camp_01.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted that there are many other unused zones similar to these that while they may be less scripted, they are also suitable for dungeon crawls and not similarly level restricted.<br>
<br>
The raids however seem to be designed for elemental guilds and plane of time guilds.  I'm not sure, we'll find out soon enough.<br>
<br>
I'm with Tinwin.  You've all gone soft <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Look beyond the restrictions, grab an aligned group if you want, and smash through the place.  Three paladins, a cleric, a wizard and a bard can tear up Mistmoore.  The only thing I recommend you do is take along haste.  Haste more than anything.<br>
<br>
The beta testers were dead wrong about this one.  I personally think they just wanted to complain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roninsenshi>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia<br>Jihad on that ass!</span><br>  Posts: 2253<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/11/03 9:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4005.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: LDoN Level Restrictions</span><hr size=1> The Beta testers forgot one thing.<br>

They forgot how evil I would feel after rescuring the Tier'dal priestess trapped in the 'Hiz and bringing her back to her mate, one of the woodelves at the North Ro Outpost.<br>

Hear me Roar. Next I'll be casting Snare and Root. And for my final trick, I shall turn into a tree.<br>

Other then the lack of 'evil inclined quests' (granted Wayfayers aren't what you would call dark and evil anyhow - but they could of given the cities some say into various quests.. maybe something they can look into when they expand on this great Idea) LDoN owns. <br>
<br>

Its fun, and it what it should be. Those breakable chests are a nice touch, the traps are a nice touch (I was laughing my ass off when the rocks fell from the sky on poor Bajnok when he tried to open the door heheh) and it shows that the scripting was well done.

Not that I can't see the content immediately, but that the chance of me seeing it at all is about nil with Caillou and Nykiyra based on the level range of my guild and the Fellowship.<br>
<br>
A friend asked me to bring Caillou on yesterday for some grouping and to possibly go to a dungeon.  He was a no-show (he thought he sent me a message saying he had to go away for a bit), so I looked into getting into a group with another person, one of the Fellowship, who was asking in their channel for anyone wanting to go.  In the moments between my saying yes (he is 58, Caillou is 59) and reaching Everfrost (I was in Knowledge when I said yes), he got a group (maybe from guild) and I was too high.  *shrug*  No, I did not stand around for an hour or more at the camps LFG.  I really really really hate doing that.  So I admit I didn't &quot;try hard&quot; to get a group.<br>
<br>
Yes, it might get better in a week or three.  No, it won't be the place for planned hunts with guild or Fellowship friends.  Granted, since I have been playing a new character with my RL boyfriend whom I have jsut recently got into the game (our characters are now 31) and I would much rather be playing with him, part of the problem with Caillou and Nykiyra not having opportunity to go into a dungeon is my own.  I am only switching over for planned things or when my RL boyfriend is doing other stuff.   I decided a few months ago my ire with EQ was brought about by my lengthy soloing/LFG sessions, so I won't do that any more.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=larraquemeleagrance>Larraque Meleagrance</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.rogers.com/fvresidents/smile.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Radical Dreamer</span><br>  Posts: 2212<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/11/03 11:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4005.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.rogers.com/fvresidents/smile.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: LDoN Level Restrictions</span><hr size=1> For the love of god.

The end result is that it makes the dungeon challenging for the group.  Without the level restriction, they would become trivially easy.  Case in point:<br>
<br>
My first LDoN dungeon consisted of two level 65s, two 62s, one 61, and one 59.  Average group level was 62 1/3.  We completed the dungeon with 45 minutes left to spare.  Everything we fought was DB to me and my mana bar never got below 80%.  I only nuked once per fight because the mobs would be almost dead before I could get a second nuke off.  <br>
<br>
On the second dungeon, a level 65 replaced the level 59. So the average group level went up to 63 1/3 (+1).  Mobs were still DB but they hit a helluva lot harder and I ended up nuking 2-3 times a fight before it was dead.  My baby woke up so I had to gate out and camp.  This caused the group to fail the adventure because they couldn't add someone to replace me.  Had I been able to stay, we had a decent chance of winning.  But it would have taken a lot longer than the 45 minutes it took us to win the first dungeon.<br>
<br>
If the original grouping rules were in effect, folks would add lower level characters to the group in order to lower the group average level, which in turn would make the dungeons too easy.   So I congratulate SOE for having the foresight to have a system in place that prevents that. <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

HOW THE HELL did you ever meet people and make the friends you have now without 'pickup groups'? WHAT is wrong with pickup groups? I met some of my best friends via pickup groups (Hello sweetie (Rinjai), Hello Damissak, etc). Sometimes sure, you get screwed with a pickup group -- thats the chance you take -- you learns your lessons, and then you move on, end of story. I've honestly had very few sucky pickup groups though, and I in fact used to be complimented for putting together really good pickup groups when I was younger (you know the kind where everyone just seems to mesh and you have a special kind of synergy together, and you all say: I'm adding you to my list of friends! Want to group again sometime??). Folks, look at LDON restrictions as a way to meet new people. Some of you have become downright snobbish it looks like in regards to whom you might group with. You never know if the next pickup person you group with turns out to be a wonderful person that you wish you'd tried grouping with earlier when you had a previous chance! Or: What if that person is a new person, only been playing 6 months or so, when you've been playing 2 years? I mean come on folks. LIVE a little.<br>
<br>
So what if you die? Easy in these dungeons to get your corpse and get a rez.<br>
(you just wait for your body to pop outside the dungeon if you've no pally, cleric or necro with you).<br>
<br>
I've really enjoyed myself so far. Mostly just been going in with guildmates and some Fellowship folks so far, and we've had 2 successes out of the 3 I've gone on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We've got a 7 level spread through the group usually so the challenge is difficult but not impossible.<br>

As for Nykiyra, it's the same as any raid the Fellowship runs.  Some you can go to, some you can't.  You can't expect me to believe that Nykiyra goes to every single Lux group, with multiple level 65s in zones she can't even access.  It was a necessary evil to ensure the expansion was balanced and fun for all involved.<br>

I can't group with Kemmy.  Yeah, that sucks.  Yeah, I wish the minimum level was a tiny bit lower so she could come, but I'm not willing to write off the expansion entirely before I even join a group just because I can't. <p>Sir <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190029" target="top">Bakanome Gwendyll</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I'm complaining more because of the level limit, which I still think is stupid, and nothing I've read here has swayed me otherwise.  56 grouping with a 65 is *not* PLing.  I don't care about arguments there, that's my opinion and I seriously doubt its going to change.<br>
<br>
No, whoever said it will encourage PLing is right...I now have 2 mages to level up so they can actually group with two of my other friends and we can try some of these dungeons...together...because that is how I enjoy dungeon crawls. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But a pick up group in LDoN is at a hinderance. Lets say your mission is to kill 51 mobs in 90 minutes. That means you need a puller that can single pull or good crowd controll. In the harder versions of dungeons, mobs can be unmezzable or slows are partial. <br>
<br>
I have done several with friends, and one pick up group. With friends, we all knew what to do, from experince, and the more dungeons we do, the better we get at them. The puller is a paladin that can pacify and single pull. Worked like a charm, we had a very good team. There was even times as the wizard, I could sit a fight out. We had a few times for med, but for the most part, it was pull a room, move in, pull the hall, pull the next room, move in. <br>
<br>
In the pick up group, no one wanted to pull, the cleric didn't want to pacify, no one worked well together. We bailed on the mission 10 minutes into it. You can't go into one of these with a time limit and spend half the time working things out.<br>
<br>
That is why pick up groups aren't that good in LDoN. Outside of LDoN, you have the lesuire of taking your time to tweek a team and find a system that works. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gravely>Gravely</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/11/03 4:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4005.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely_face_60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: LDoN Level Restrictions</span><hr size=1> Pickup groups are not always evil but people tend to get burned by them enough they aren't willing to risk it.  Why?<br>
<br>
1) people in pickup groups have no sense of loyalty to each other built up by friendship.  Getting kinda tired, and the group wiped?  &quot;/gs hey guys I'm really tired, I think I'm going to hit the hay.&quot;  In a group with friends, and one is about 30-45 minutes from a ding?  &quot;/gs hey guys, lets get ____ his/her level and then I'm gonna go to sleep&quot;.  Lack of loyalty to each other results in people sometimes not willing to take the extra steps to make the group succeed, but just going to bed or leaving to find another group, etc, at the first sign of difficulty.<br>
<br>
2) Lack of confidence.  Groups work best when everyone has confidence in everyone else.  If I hesitate to aggressively heal the tank who grabs aggro on a 3 pull, because I don't have confidence in the enchanter to lock things down asap and keep them off of me, the tank dies, then we all die, and things suck.  Don't tell me everyone who comes to a pickup group has confidence in everyone else automatically, because I've seen them not demonstrate it.  For example, even if I choose to heal said tank, the tank might not choose to have confidence in me and in the enchanter, and might not do what (s)he can to step up and start taking hits.  The enchanter might not have confidence in the group not breaking mez and might root mobs on the tank instead.  I go ahead with my heal, heal again, and suddenly root breaks, and I am dead.  All sorts of bad things happen when people lack confidence in each other.  Sure, a pickup group with a chance for members to earn each other's confidence does well after a while, and those are fun pickup groups, but it's not always the case.<br>
<br>
3) Peoples' gear/skill vary greatly.  When you group with friends, you tend to have a similar equipment and skill level as they do.  Even if you don't, you know what to expect.  In a pickup group, you might be looking for a tank, choosing a level 65 person, and thinking &quot;hmm, my friends/guildmates/etc who are paladins have about 7,000 hps with cleric buffs, so I'll plan accordingly&quot;.  Then, you get to the dungeon, and your paladin starts dropping like a rock.  You land a crit heal with him/her at 33% and discover it only healed them for 2986 out of the 3800 your crit was for.  You do some quick math and your paladin tank has less than 4500 hitpoints with virtue (1405) and brells mountainous (225), so they're running under 2900 unbuffed.  You were expecting 5500+ hps.  How you react maybe says a lot about you.  If the group can handle your tank having half the unbuffed hitpoints of your rogue, but being good at giving the rogue a back to stab, and not dying because of defensive AAs or whatever, and healer mana isn't a problem, then great.  But if your tank maybe doesn't have the defensive AAs, and due to levels the mobs are nasty and hit for 9% of your tanks buffed hitpoints such that you can't even risk using Complete Heal, and you're healing twice as much as you expected, well, it can make you feel frustrated, and want to leave, or not give the group your all.  Similar things can be said about being excited to add a 65 rogue to the group only to find out he's using a slime coated harpoon and locustlure, or adding an enchanter with 583 AAs only to find out the person just picked her up on ebay 3 days ago, and she's wearing an oracle robe, has 150 intelligence, 130 charisma, and 1100 hps unbuffed.  Even the reverse works.  Suppose you're level 60ish, have run 3 only, haven't had time to work on gear too much because you're a casual player (which I support by the way!)  You're in a group, and you've managed to find 4 other people with similar gear/level/AA situations, and so far you're happy because everyone in the group meets expectations.  Now you're looking for a cleric, and you use the LFG tool, and find a 65 cleric as the only cleric lfg.  You send a tell inviting them to come do an LDoN dungeon and they say &quot;whew, I thought I'd never get a group, thanks!&quot; and comes running to join the group.  Someone notices the cleric is throwing around level 65 spells, right clicking an endless supply of items, etc, and eventually it comes up that the cleric has 492 AAs, elemental planes gear, plays 14 hours a day, has 5500 unbuffed hitpoints and 6500 unbuffed mana, etc.  You might worry they are not going to be happy with this group.  You might feel a desire to prove yourself or live up to their expectations that might sour the group (maybe you won't at all, and if not, good for you).  And, depending on this cleric's personality, it might be great or might be awful.  If they are constantly dropping hints that they're unhappy or find the group inadequate, it can wreck your fun, right?  But if they are positive, encouraging, etc, like everyone else, it can be great.  What I'm trying to say is that as a player, you may have certain expectations based on what you bring to EQ (time committment, level, gear, skill, etc.  If the group doesn't match those expectations you might be quite disappointed.  In pickup groups, you get what you get, and most people don't interview potential additions to the group extensively before inviting them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I can totally understand people not enjoying pickup groups for reasons coming from the above.  They might view 3 positive pickup groups as insufficient to make up for 1 bad one.  They may just be unwilling to lower expecations.  Whatever, it's their choice.  Personally, I usually prefer not to do pickup groups, but will from time to time, especially if I'm feeling rather social.<br>
<br>
I think LDoN indeed makes pickup groups even more iffy because most missions have a high focus on damage output (DPS or mobs killed per session or whatever (different things... a high DPS group that doesn't keep 1 mob mezzed/rooted in camp might kill slower than a lower DPS group that never waits for a pull)).  Because you have a need to be efficient and kill quickly, and a goal to reach in a timed environment, there's going to be more pressure and higher expectations.  People need to rely on each other, and take the risk that everyone in the group will do their job.  Basically, it's going to exasperate the problems of a pickup group, at least in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not anti-pickup groups (had a fun one the first night of LDoN) but I can understand where anti-pickup group people are coming from, especially if they put a high emphasis on success.<br>

<br>
Amen to that. I don't normally do pick up groups, most of the time I am able to group with guildmates, friends, or friends of friends. Last night I decided to take my alt ( level 44 cleric ) out and get a pick up group, try to ding 45 and maybe succeded at an adventure. Well thanks to some awesome people in the pickup group I did exactly that! Even succeded twice! That was her first time ever in a pick up group and I had an absolute blast!<br>
<br>
That said, I'm really enjoying LDoN. Sure there are things I don't like ( Boxes are the debil mmkay? ) But over all I am having a grand old time. I think the 7 level limit is not a bad idea, it will just take a while for folks to get used to the idea of it and compensate.  The 90 min. time limit adds the challenge to push my self to top proformance and efficiency and to feel good about myself when my team succedes.  I've failed 2 missions and I've won 2 missions, I had fun each and every time. I think that many are focusing too much on the &quot; failure &quot; aspect of it and not enough on the fun of the crawl. That said I do kinda think the leaderboard thing is silly, but I'm not gonna be bugging with it so ... meh. Ambivalent.<br>
<br>
I think that a lot of folks are complaining a bit prematurely on things, I mean, it's only day 3 now. Give it time to settle, give yourself time to learn how to function in this new setting, and give other people time to get used to the new rules. And yes, death and dying is going to be part of these things, any good dungeon crawl has that element of danger, which I think is WAY more fun than grinding in the Dreadlands with constant pulls and no down time. If that is more of your kind of adventure then no one is stopping you from taking advantage of it.  <br>
<br>
My only rant is that a friend compleated the same mission as I at a differant time and his group got 17 adventure points where mine got 6.... I definately need to find out how adventure point scores work. Both my successful missions were compleated well within the 90 min so I don't understand the large discrepency unless either a) he was mistaken or b) the fact that he is in his 50's and my alt is in her 40's ? /boggle I'll have to read up on it.<br>

If you put me in a dungeon that was made for lvl 53 or lower or a 65 wizard that could ae the place... its not the xp... its the 51 adventure points that are awarded. There would be almost zero work to get the best augments and items that you could buy from the merchants. I think the restrictions are great and makes the dungeons more fair. It does suck that I cant go in them with some friends, but if I could it would be more exploiting the system than playing the game. Thats my 2 cents. <br>

Dungeon crawls are fun.<br>
<br>
I haven't had much luck with pickup groups yet, but I do understand both sides of that fence.<br>
<br>
The level restrictions are a great idea. Can you imagine a group with 3 level 65s and 3 level 50s? That would make a avg level 57 or so dungeon, right? And the 65s could probably trio it (if not duo or solo it), making it not really any fun for all. Level restrictions make the dungeons more challenging. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=224459" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://sigs.kupatrix.com/smallillustration2.JPG"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4005.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4005.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4005.topic&start=61&stop=64>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=4005.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=4005.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4005.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=4005.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4005.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4005.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
