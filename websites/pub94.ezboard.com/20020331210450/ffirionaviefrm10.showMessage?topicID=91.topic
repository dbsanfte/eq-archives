For how long she had no idea.  Not far enough because she still heard him say those things. Because she'd still felt Karana's blessings leaving her. Because she could still see that she'd been wrong.<br>
<br>
They were all wrong.  It was all the same, Hate, Love, Fear, Sorrow.  <br>
<br>
She could run clear across Norrath and to the moon and not run away from herself. She had to be who she was, but...but today she..she could just run...into North Karana, still running, then she fell, wasted, and exhausted.<br>
<br>
And alone.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/01 8:39:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cursed.</span><hr size=1> And just like that, it was over. Genashai, bloodies by Shintou's weapon spoke the final words before she blasted him away.<br>
Simply.. Three little words.. the same three that runined his life.<br>
<br>
I love you..<br>
<br>
And with that, it was over.. Finally free from Sarhea, Free from Genashai, free from love..?<br>
<br>
..Nay.. he only laid in Neriak.. Being resummoned once again..<br>
His sprit.. as usual.. it had to be destroyed.. for he saught comfort in pale arms..<br>
So he went back to them all, floating on wings of Weakness and Self Pity.. as he looked to Velve.. already carving the Symbol of Innoruuk into his head..<br>
A curse laid upon him for his Insolence.<br>
<br>
Shintou pleaded to Velve as Sarhea lookedi n Horror, pleased that Velve Destroy him.. and the weakness that he had become.<br>
Velve did so, Quick slashes with that weapon destroyed his Soul instantly..<br>
<br>
But it just appeared in Neriak.. once again..<br>
All he could hear was Velve's voice.. almost taunting him..<br>
<br>
&quot;Walk this land.. and know your shame. Know your weakness. This is Innoruuk's will, know how weak you are. His curse.. it is over for you..&quot;<br>
<br>
Sarhea knew that it was over.. her shattered heart slowly able to pull itself slightly together.. enought to leave his corspe there..<br>
<br>
But For Shintou, he thought he could get out of his weakness by fighting both the ones that Shown him True Love, Genashai and Sarhea..<br>
But he only brought him into a pit of more weakness..<br>
He had finally reached the bottom. The bottom of the pit.. his heart not being able to understand, to comprehend the thing that he had been denied so long..<br>
So he made himself stand.. and he went back to his armor..<br>
<br>
And Shintou did finally return, taking his common armor.. slipping it off of his corspe and placing it on himself.. slowly as Velve's words of the curse rang in his head..<br>
His eyes seemly shook with Depression, confusing emotions stiring with him as he took his armor, finally placing it onto him.<br>
He held out his hand to his body, and it disapeared..<br>
The carving of Velve upon his head.. and the Curse..<br>
He took off his helm as he looked across the desert.. the sun just raising into the sky over the Horizion..<br>
And he spoke.. not a tear falling..<br>
<br>
I will not walk no more in weakness. Innoruuk, father, I have failed you.<br>
For that, you should destroy me. You have not.<br>
You wish me to hang my head down to the sand? To live in depression forever? Sarhea is gone. I have no more stresses upon me..<br>
I have gotten as bad as I am going to get. I am going to go out, and I will become strong once again.<br>
And I'm going to go back, and I will see..<br>
<br>
Ayanamii.. he almost forgot about her.. Her and Morgen..<br>
<br>
I will train once again.. and Father.. I will kill them both.<br>
<br>
Alone if I have to train by myself, that is fine.. That is my curse, then let it be so. I will train, I will become strong..<br>
No more will I sit following your worthless Daughter. I will find my own Strenght within your way...<br>
<br>
His words disapated in the wind as it blew against him.. as he looked outwards.. knowing that his path would not be easy..<br>
But why would he wish it to be easy. Challenge makes one strong.<br>
...There you go Shintou. Just like you used to say..  <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"><a href="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo">Shintou Shinai</a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=91.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=91.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=91.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=91.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=91.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=91.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
