He sits right next to me in RL about 6 feet away. And btw he knew exactly what the guy was saying and said he could kiss off. And rightfully so, there was no attempt whatsoever to reson or ask for any sort of compromize. And if sombody in the guild would have asked me to leave because he complained to them. I would have told them to go sit on it also. Like I said I have 0 tolerance for rude people 0 as in none at all as in denatta period end of list. If your rude to me you get nothing and no guild leader no guild member no person on the face of norrath will ever move me in my stand. <br>
          But on the other hand if your polite and courteous and friendly with me I can be the best friend you ever had. I love helping people and grouping with people and having a general good time. Ask people that know me they will tell you. There is absolutly no need for behaviour like thier's I mean come on how hard is it to just ask someone if they will let u camp somthing? And you may belive he has a right to ask other people in the guild for help with me. But if you look at the log I had said a total of 5 words up to that point. I was waiting for him to ask me to either leave or share. I would not have left but I would have waited for him to get his spawn. I see people like him as whiny crybabys that look to try to talk to sombody that has &quot;authority&quot; over you to get thier way.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dromel>Dromel</A> at: 1/2/02 7:42:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:08:43 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> Neither party was very clear on anything.  The original poster made little effert to work out what they wanted. Going instead directly to a basic threat of sorts. BUT the second party made ZERO attempt to indicate tolerance or a willingness to arrange a compromise.<br>
<br>
This is assumeing of course that the conversation posted is correct. I assume it is since the second party hasnt claimed it wasnt (though they did add a previous part unknown to it).<br>
<br>
Both sides should understand that they acted in a way that offend the other. And if it is standard practice from them both, I forsee problems for both in the future.<br>
<br>
As the original camper, a tell should have been made that specifically asked the intention of the other, once it was clear both wanted the same thing. By the same token the second party should have been more willing to indicate a willness to come to some arrangement.<br>
<br>
Rudeness begets rudeness. When you purposefully avoid offering compromise and then ACT like compromise was an option if only the others had seen through your rudeness........<br>
<br>
The above paragraph applies to BOTH parties.<br>

Read what others have written....any thread....pick a post.<br>
<br>
Read your posts here.  You sound and type like an idiot.  Your communication skills...lets just say...lack a bit. <br>
<br>
I have no idea or judgement on this but I did read the whole thing.  From what I read...your an ass.  Not from what accurred but simply from what you've posted.  I would recommend that both parties work on more effective communication skills here and in game....maybe this all could have been avoided.<br>

Just my 2cp but I had to voice this one, just rubbed me wrong.<br>

And btw there are no recognized camps on this server. So if you find him first more power to ya. But if we do to bad.'<br>
<br>
There is your willingness to negotiate. Your view on what is right on the server, and your form of sharing is clearly stated. That was said, btw, while you were sitting on the spawn spot. My, I'd have a great opportunity at finding him first, eh? <br>
<br>
You arrived at a camp that was obviously camped (the PHs were all dead). I have no doubt that you would share (even envoke PnP) if the jester had been camped by even or red cons to you. Since it was camped by players who conned blue to you, you simply ignored the fact that we were there. You could easily KS us. I did assume that you were logging out at first, since that's what respectable people do when they want to wait their turn for something. Ten minutes later you were still running around killing the mobs that previously had been a nice source of exp for me. It was obvious that you have no respect for your fellow players. <br>
<br>
This is not a PnP issue, btw. If you read the log, you'll not see any text where I claimed the camp as my very own, or demanded that the intruders leave. I only asked if he realized that we had been there in order to determine what kind of person he was. Sure, I hoped that maybe he was stupid enough to not realize we were there and then leave. I asked for an officer referral for the same reason, that is to determine if this was guild policy. You can read that intent in the log. I had already decided to abandon the camp. There are no items in the game that are worth real disputes. There are no items in the game that would compell me to banter back and forth with pricks like Dromel. I trusted his words in game. He stated his position and that is enough for me. <br>
<br>
For the life of me, I can't see where I was rude in this matter. If someone would be so kind as to point out the text, I would be grateful.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:48:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> I agree that the original poster was less rude.

<br>
After being informed that the second group was there to camp the same spawn, a jump is made to  &quot;Wow I haven't run across folk like this yet.&quot; and it is down hill from there.<br>
<br>
If I had to pick who got the camp based on the conversation I would pick the first group. But both sides made no effort to compromise.<br>
<br>
Fact is neither side was right and neither side was wrong. Though the second group, in my opinion, had every intention of bullying the first if possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dromel>Dromel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:57:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> &quot;You do realize that's what we are doing&quot; is a sarcastic rude and abrasive statement. Meant to raise a negative response from the person intended to hear it. Because for one I did not &quot;realize&quot; that you were camping him. And you knew I did not because you had NOT killed any of the place holders for him. You were camping the undead cook down the hall when we arrived. You moved from the cook camp down to the jester PH room after we passed you by. So if you want to get technical you didnt &quot;have&quot; the camp when we got there. You were camping an entirely different mob that has nothing to do with the jester. Consider youself lucky I even spoke to you. I wont make the same mistake twice belive me. <br>

Your guild may well deserve alternate representation. I'll spare the readers the word against word stuff regarding the physical events, but do want it known that our accounts are diferent. If a reader has a specific question, I'll be happy to respond. This is, after all, a public service announcement more than anything else. <br>
<br>
Winds of Destiny may turn out to be a fine and fair guild. I wish them the best of luck if that is their goal. I do think WoD, and all guilds for that matter, should attend to matters of public scrutiny.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=196.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=170.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=199.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
