<br>
I did not address what was &quot;reasonable&quot; in my last post because I acknowledged that &quot;reasonable&quot; is subjective and tried to approach this issue from another view point. If you would like an example of what I thnk is unreasonable here it is.<br>
<br>
- I am a new player to EQ.<br>
- I make a Dwarven paladin.<br>
- I fight evil creature and do several cool quests turning in these bird claws, bone chips and orc shoulder pads. All in all having a good time.<br>
<br>
- Soon enough I am in unrest, battleing undead as paladins were meant to do. I am quickly approaching my 20th season as the creatures in unrest present a wide level of challenges.<br>
<br>
- I kill a carrion ghoul and loot its heart. I am told that it is part of a quest for a holy sword called Ghoulbane, which I will need for my epic. Being new I don't know what an Epic is so it is gleefully explained to me. Then the person says, &quot;so ya, your epic. You went to FP and killed that level 9 guy for your first part didnt you?&quot;<br>
<br>
- Of course not. Not one NPC in butcherblock gives any clue to the paladin NPC in FP. How could I have known? How could I have planned for this? This hardly seems fair but I shrug it off and struggle on.<br>
<br>
- So I go to FP and try to hire a group in the level range appropriate for this NPC. I soon realize that no one can understand me because I speak dwarf and everyone else here speaks human. What a great oppourtunity to learn human! <br>
<br>
- I try to learn human, I am having trouble because I only speak Dwarf so trying to explain that I want to learn human isnt easy. after &lt;&lt;insert time between 15 min and 1 week, as posted on this thread&gt;&gt; and becoming a master of miming &quot;I want to learn human&quot; someone finally clues in and agrees to teach me human.<br>
<br>
- ZOINKS! Languages are broken. No one can learn a language past skill 5 till verant gets it fixed, that is when they finally acknowledgd languages were broken in the first place which they wouldn't do. Now I have to try and find a group of dwarves to come help me do this, which really limits me since I can only solicit help form one race now. I can entice them with a 20 minute boat ride where they can do, er..nothing! Whee!<br>
<br>
- Good News! Verant acknowledges languages are broken and fixes them. I try to learn human, after &lt;&lt;insert time between 15 min and 1 week, as posted on this thread&gt;&gt; someone finally clues in and agrees to teach me human. I thank brell that its not 1 point per hour &lt;like Verant has posted on the FV info section&gt; or I would be level 30 or higher by the time I could belt out a coherant message.<br>
<br>
- I auction and auction for someone to help me with this NPC. I am having trouble because auction only works in city zones which is mostly populated by folks level 5 and under &lt;if there is anyone even in the zone on this server&gt; so I decide to move out to west commons/Nro where there are folks hunting that are in the proper level range to help with this NPC.<br>
<br>
- Auction doesnt work here,  no such thing as /ooc and shout has a limited range so I run around to the different camps of humans trying to get some help. After &lt;&lt;insert time between 15min and 1 week, as posted on this thread&gt;&gt; I find someone to help me.<br>
<br>
- Unfortunately, they want my bronze BP that I got in unrest because they know its for my Epic and know they have me by the beard. (You didnt think I was going to say balls did you? I am a paladin after all).<br>
<br>
- Success! They have aquired the piece I need for my Epic! I happily hand over my bronze BP and thank Brell for blessing me with this item!<br>
<br>
Thats pretty much what I find unreasonable. Especially for an item that doesnt have any stats, real worth and isn't ever farmed on any server period.<br>

<br>
I have spent over a year and a half playing one character on a server and never was able to get J-boots.  There were many times that I spent nights trying to find the AC, but I never found him.  Does that mean that the quest is 'unreasonable' and should be changed to a more predictable spawn?  Is the AC Bugged?  No.  It is just difficult.<br>
<br>
So just in real life, you learn to work with the tools handed to you.  On FV, the TLC exists and the Devs have provided additional methods (ones that where not available on regular servers with the TLC).  <br>
<br>
Most people are not going to change their opinions about the TLC, and the debate will continue on and on.<br>
<br>
The topic of this thread is &quot;TLC BUG LIST&quot;, yet there have been no 'bugs' listed, only opinions.  <br>

<br>
I just spent a day doing the (or trying I should say) Shaman (Vah Shir) quest line. If I had done it here on Firiona Vie I would not be able to complete it alone. <br>
<br>
My shaman is now 6 and has not finished the part to make the container for Merchant. Why? Because you need brewing skill ( at 10 points I finally managed to make the 2 sweet water but they were not trivial), you need  pottery skill ( I have failed 8 times trying to make the pottery part so far, including twice at the firing part).<br>
<br>
I twinked my cat with leather armor and  a fine steel Mace also about 20 PP. which means I had what I needed to raise my brewing skill to 10 before I even tried to make sweet water. Which saved me a lot of Xakra bile for the second part.<br>
<br>
The dogged insistance by you and others that these LOW level CLASS and RACE specific quests are not affected in a nearly undoable way by TLC (notice I didnt say impossible, since they are doable, of course making love to an elephant is doable to, but I wouldnt want to try) is a red herring. <br>
<br>
I killed Xakra larvae in the pit (only hunted in the pit). I killed the beetles in the pit ( I paid for the hairless hopper hides by the way) I had to kill skeletons in the pit when they attacked me. And I killed (finally at 3 and above though tough at 3) Scorpions. I managed to find 12 Xakra Bile and 13 Scorpion blood (all no drop, so effected by TLC) You need both. plus water to try and make sweet water BY 6th level 90 percent or more of the non scorpions are light blue. Meaning effected by TLC, since Light blue at 5 and 6 give NO experience ( a requirement to get items effected by TLC).<br>
<br>
What is my point?  The MAJORITY of new players will NOT be able to do these quests because TLC will be involved at lvl 5 and above. Unless of course you think every newbie has access to 20 PP (never mind the armor and weapon they arent that important , though do effect survival). <br>
<br>
Now I agree if you wait untill someone posts all the ways to do the quest ahead of time AND you avoid all the skeletons AND you get lucky at brewing and pottery AND you get lucky with the rare drops AND you group with NO ONE  AND you put off the acyrlia quest till absolutely neccassary for the quest (it raises you to almost 2 and is required just to get the quests started) AND you wait for the ground spawn on the mud AND you put 10 points of your training in Brewing AND you put 10 Points (though even at 10 I fail every attempt ) in Pottery (a skill I might add you are NOT warned you need ) AND somehow you get the needed cash (without hunting any mobs but the quest mobs) to buy the water (needed for brewing and for pottery) and for the firing sheets (needed for pottery) you might succeed at getting the container made, but I havent found out what the next step is, nor what other potentially trivial mobs (at 6 mind you) I still have to kill for quest stuff.<br>
<br>
Dont come here and claim that TLC when it effects such low level, class and race specific quests fosters ANYTHING good. The Vah Shir quests are examples of WHY TLC needs to be tweeked, but it wont ever be cause it was abandoned. <br>
<br>
Where does a newbie Vah Shir get the money to buy ANYTHING from other newbie Vah Shir? Go hunt there and sell there and see how much cash you aquire while strictly sticking to quest mobs. AND what of bags? They arent cheap either, All the ones I bought cost 2 to 10 gold, money you need to save (if questing and not twinking) for the water and firing sheets (and forget armor till after 6)?  Cant do the bag quests because that will level you into a TLC problem to fast. Oh wait I know use the parially devoured cloth bags that drop in the pit, of course the only hold TINY stuff.  And did I mention the mud does not stack? SO you have 16 slots (counting bank) to accomplish all this with and NO armor and NO new spells except the two you started with (since each 1st level spell costs 1 plus gold and most 5th level spells cost 5 to 6 gold.<br>
<br>
But rant on how GOOD TLC is and that NO quest is every made impossible by the LOVED TLC. Bury your head in the sand an pretend that it fosters roleplay and enhances the low level quests by making them so hard to do nearly no one can accomplish them with out help. And INSIST loudly and constantly that no quest is impossible to do cause it is TECHNICALLY possible to accomplish it. <br>
<br>
Ignore all the posts about low level quests and dismiss all the posts with specifics on why quests dont work with out help. Dismiss all us &quot;whiners and complainers&quot; as mad power Gamers , bent on gaining levels fast and not questing (though every post IS about a quest). Yup I am a MAD POWER GAMER that MUST have thet SUPER UBER Vah Shir class item   (you know the one that is designed to be done at low level). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/5/02 1:11:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> Chip,<br>
<br>
Now you are just going back to the same old tired cries of saying that not everyone needs / deserves to get every item. What does that have to do with the issue we are discussing? You asked for an example and I think I gave you one.<br>
<br>
Your right, not everyone should be able to get every item in this game. Thats why Verant developed faction. Bane can explain how faction would prevent folks from doing quests and getting items. There are also Diety specific items, class specific items and race specific items. None of these have anything to do with the TLC arguements.<br>
<br>
Not everyone will get their epic. Thats a fact on ANY server. However, the oppourtunity to get an epic (or do any quest for that matter) IS presented to every player. If a player WANTS to do their epic (or any quest for that matter) they should be allowed to and not stymied by code that is not well thought out.<br>
<br>
In the dwarven paladin example I gave above (which I noticed you didn't respond too), I doubt there would be anyone who would consider that reasonable. If you can't acknowledge THAT then perhaps we will never be able to agree on this issue.<br>

BTW, since it seems like some don't know this, the AC has a static spawn spot in Ocean of Tears, on the island adjacent to the dock island, the one with the tower in the middle with the high elven woman in it. I also believe the TLC affects the rapers, as I just helped a friend get his boots, and in the igh 30s he was getting TLCd on the shadowmen. Of course, that might have been something other than the weapons, not sure.<br>
<br>
I just tried to remember the last time the TLC annoyed me personally. I think it was back in the 20s. And before that, of course. The lower levels. I personally got tired of it and leveled past the point where it's an annoyance at all. So yes, the TLC mainly is 'aimed' at the lower level people, apparently, and encourages people to level quickly, to reach the point where the things they want are on mobs that trivial, if ever, at VERY high levels. <br>
<br>
At least for me, the TLC induced leveling quickly, and I'm not *at all* sorry I did so. I regret that I missed a few quests, but I wasn't going to beat my head against a wall for the reewards from those quests when it was easier just to level up and acquire even better stuff. This detracts from the 'quest' in Everquest, but that's the way it is here.<br>

Twotribes,<br>
<br>
Perhaps you are just not a very good gamer if your not twinked or have lots of plats?<br>
<br>
I do not know many players that needed 20pp and a full set of leather armour at level 5 to attempt to complete their quests or survive hunting in the Level 1 newbie area (the Pit).<br>
<br>
1) I managed to perform my beastlord quests without the need to TWINK or spend more than possbily 2p at level 5.  <br>
<br>
2) I have seen a number of various other players do the same. (look at the ratio of players that HAVE completed these quests or are able to hunt in the pit without full sets of leathers).<br>
<br>
3) I had seen numerous hairless hopper hides drop and on merchants when I was hunting in the pit.  I still can find alteast one per day if I check the merchants periodically.<br>
<br>
4) I have seen both Xakra Bile and Scopion Blood on the merchants almost daily.  In fact I have actully seen Hopper claws, hopper hides, Xakra teeth, Hopper eggs and other 'quest' items all on merchants.<br>
<br>
5) I actually put training points into my 'tradeskill' to help with success rates (did this at level 5).  If you did not know, you can train up to skill 20.<br>
<br>
6)  I lost my cloak and had to repeat the first level Beastlord quest at level 17.  I was able to get the items I needed by checking merchants and bartering with Lower players in the pit.<br>
<br>
It might simply be that your basing your tactics on 'Items + Money&quot; might not be the best approach when dealing with the TLC (and thus would explain your unhappiness with it).  <br>
<br>
So, again, the TLC is not the problem.  The TLC is not 'bugged' or 'insanely difficult'.   The problem is the mind set of the player.  <br>

So, if your going to list TLC Bugs, list the bugs, not the opinions.  If you want to start a topic of 'quests made difficult by TLC' then that is another story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator<b>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/6/02 1:07:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> just a note... don't want to get in the middle of this argument<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Plat for newbies on Luclin:  All over the place in Shadeweavers.  Kill hoppers.  The higher level ones drop claws which can sell for as much as 3 plat.  Chitterlings are a bit tougher, and require a magic weapon (do your quests and you'll get one, or kill poachers for one) but they uncommonly drop 'glowing chitterling wing' which sells for over a plat.  Go into the first cavern of Paludal out of Shadeweavers and collect mushrooms.  They're ground spawn and sell for 2 gold plus to the vendors.  and they stack.  Kill hoppers for scales and either sell them or turn them in for armor.  Skeletal Hunters drop up to a plat (got a plat off one already).  All the lesser shades drop shadowsilk commonly, which you can use to make shadesilk armor.<br>
<br>
The newbie quests are hard.  No doubting that.  But you only need to do them if you want to run the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons.  You can run the other quests in Shadeweavers to make seriously NICE armor (better than any other newbie armor out there) and incredible newbie weapons.<br>
<br>
Luclin zones are about quests.  Don't want to do the newbie ones?  You don't have to.  There are still incredible items to be acquired via quests in Shadeweavers.  There are more quests to be had in Hollowshade which haven't even been found yet.<br>

So with that in mind I would like to challenge you directly.<br>
<br>
First, please let us know that if you think the paladin example I gave above is reasonable, or unreasonable of Verant to expect players to go through.<br>
<br>
Second, define the word &quot;bug&quot; for us, or &quot;broken&quot;. See, in the ASP company I work for, something can be bugged or broken if it is &quot;not working as intended&quot;. If that is your definition as well, then many of these examples are indeed broken because it would be absolute insanity for us to think verant intended to create situations like they have for some of these players.<br>
<br>
I would be happy to answer any challenges you would like to put before me with regards to TLC if you will answer mine.<br>
<br>
Edit: Here is a real world example<br>
<br>
Microsoft word 2000 had an issue where sometimes the page numbering would not be correct. Folks that use it alot will know what I am talking about. Well, its not impossible to get around this. You could number the pages manually and the feature didnt always fail, but by your defintion this wouldnt be broken or a bug. It sure is by mine.<br>

I haven't killed that chap in Freeport.<br>
<br>
Do I consider your Dwarven example a &quot;broken&quot; quest example? Good lord no! What you describe is perfectly feasible.<br>
<br>
A good guild (and, I'm looking for one, I'm not happy with my present one at all) will host language fairs (mine does, for that matter. If you haven't gotten to excellent in another language by level 20, your doing something wrong. I got to very good in Elvish in the Warrens simply by grouping with any elf I saw. <br>
<br>
But, thats just one example. What you describe is merely frustrating, its not broken. <br>
<br>
I do think that the TLC needs tweaking. Has it broken any quests? I haven't seen any examples given yet of a broken quest. <br>
<br>
I got a barnacle breastplate at level 11. To get that, you have to kill a diseased shark (blue at 11), then loot an item affected by the TLC. When the shark dies, it spawns around 4 tiny sharks, which also drop an item affected by the Trivial Loot code - and you have to be level 5 or below to get those items! Is this quest broken by the TLC? Course not. I just hired a level 4 (had to go to qeynos to get him) and had him kill the tiny sharks for me. <br>
<br>
I am going to do this quest again - even though the shark is now green to me. I'll simply have to hire a level 11, and a level 4. It only took me about 4 days to find a level four willing to do the job last time. Broke? No. Difficult? Yes. <br>
<br>
Your example with Word is spot on. Under normal circumstances, that page numbering is broke. Under the rules of FV - which are abundantly clear on their web site, it isn't, because you have a clear work around (manually numbering the pages.). Sure its more work, but thats the point of FV - to make the game more challenging, and thus more fun.<br>

Your post kind of lends strength to my arguement (in a twisted sort of way). This goes back to &quot;what is reasonable&quot;. To use your own words, is creating situations as &quot;frustrating&quot; as the paladin example acceptable? More importantly is it what Verant intended? <br>
<br>
I dont think it is because we can assume that what verant intended would have been based on server population and I think its safe to say  FV's server population did not meet Verant's expectations. A larger population would have supported more player interaction and an economy. The lack of the expected population is causing these &quot;frustrating&quot; situation to be more difficult than expected. This is why we are asking them to tweak TLC.<br>

<br>
Did this person bother to pay attention to the disclaimers about the FACT it isnt necassary to have items or money to do the quest, or that in FACT the reason the twinking was mentioned was because even WITH it I was unable to accomplish a LOW level Quest DESIGNED to be done at low level by EVERY ROLEPLAYING Vah Shir? NO, what this person did is begin attacking my play ability or style of play as a defense for why they dont or wont understand that a problem exsists.<br>
<br>
I have seen 2 people say they can and did complete these quests with out help , NOT a lot by my LIMITED standards. I HAVE seen a lot of examples given about IGNORING the quests till you can get better stuff or have money to try and pay for these items to do these quests. But then since I am such a POOR player I guess my standards are not important.<br>
<br>
Maybe if our esteemed EXPERT player would like to address how you BUY anything with no money? As I posted..... try hunting JUST the mobs you need for these quests and see how much money you make. OHH and dont hunt the beetles cause they will raise you to fast and make TLC be invoked. You can get the mud as ground spawn.<br>
<br>
With no bags (cause you NEED money to buy them, as was pointed out in my previous post) try keeping the stuff you need  (that doesnt stack) to accomplish these quests. Frustration DOES matter to me, and to a LOT of other people. When a low level quest, A QUEST designed to be done before 6th level, requires the amount of WORK AROUNDS as these Vah Shir quests do, then there is a PROBLEM.  Yup it IS just my opinion. BUT I dont think I am alone, nor do I think it is an unreasonable opinion to have.<br>
<br>
There is at least one person in this thread that would defend ANY thing related to TLC since it is technically possible to work around ANY problem with it.<br>
<br>
As I already stated, bury that head as deep as you can in the sand and chant NANANANANANA all you want. It doesnt change the fact (no matter how much you try to twist what is said here) that there are PROBLEMS with TLC which will only get worse as new content is added to the game. Dont help try to make the requests to tweek a poor system, just go on about your business of  defending the problems.<br>

No flames intended.<br>
<br>
1)  You don't need to buy quest items.  Murphy's law states that even if you had the money, the items wouldn't be up for sale.  Regardless, most if not all of them sell for 1cp and can be bought off vendors for 1 or 2 silver.  Verified personally.<br>
<br>
2)  Containers are free on luclin.  Wander around shadeweavers (careful of the mobs which will agro) and pick up refuse.  Turn in the refuse for a free bag.  Use the bag to store things you're collecting.<br>
<br>
next--<br>
<br>
I neither defend nor attack TLC.  I play on the server for the challenge, and for the camaraderie.  I don't want to see it changed, but that's just my opinion.<br>
<br>
I did think the last post was a bit over the top, however, and perhaps this entire thread should be moved to rants.  I don't have a problem listing features which we believe are bugged because of TLC, but I think that taking the arguments too far may make this a better topic for another (more rant-friendly) forum. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>

No, I do not think this is unreasonable.  I would consider the 'quillamane' cloak for the mage epic closer to unreasonable, but I don't expect that to change, nor do I consider 'Quillamane' to be bugged, or broken.  It's just a major pain to get.<br>

Firstly, I provide two very specific examples of 'bugs'.  Notice that they are not subject to 'opinion' of whether or not they work, the simply 'DO NOT WORK'.  So I basically define a bug as 'NOT WORKING'.    But lets use your definition of &quot;NOT WORKING AS INTENTED&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  As I said, it's not a bad thing if items become more rare on this server. In fact, I'd call it a good thing. Players on this server might have to adjust and accept that just because they want &lt;quest item in question&gt; does not mean that they will ever get it. I would love to see a server where the items that people think of as 'required' are sometimes just not obtainable. People will quickly discover that those items aren't as indispensable as they think they are. And people that have such items will be that much more unique. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The above is a quote from the SONY DEVELOPMENT BOARD from ABSOR.  Thus, in your above senerio, the TLC is working as expected.<br>
<br>
Ok, I have answered your two challenges.  Now please attempt to focus and answer my one simple challenge.<br>
<br>
Are there any examples of TLC Bugs (not working as intended by VI, not the player) that would warrent the Removal of the TLC??<br>
