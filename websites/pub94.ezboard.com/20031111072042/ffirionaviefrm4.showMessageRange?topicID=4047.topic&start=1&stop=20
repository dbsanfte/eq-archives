If they want to talk to use they can start talking if we are by the phone and want to talk to them we will pick it up. If we aren’t by the phone they had best leave a message cause they are never going to get us to pick it up unless we know who it is.<br>

I was harassed one day by a bill collector. I was harassed early in the morning (8 am) on a -Saturday- An hour or so later, they woke me up again, and 4 hours later they called me again.<br>
<br>
It was Providian or something. I do not have a card with them. I have one card. It is with my bank. <br>
<br>
These guys were calling for someone named Cox. That's right. Some guy Cox. *snicker* I told them each time, and had to actually threaten to sue and ask for the manager the last time because they kept calling me. Even after I told them that I didn't know the fellow, and that he must of had the phone number before I did, and that I'd only had the number for a year. It seems that they did not believe me or something. I wanted to cry by the end of the day, and I documented it. They still try to call sometimes, as if they don't really believe he doesn't use that same phone number. Its very very very tiresome. I get soo sick of these assholes calling me, asking for this jerk-off.<br>

Don't jump on me -- I stopped doing all of that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The below is offered in the event that it may be helpful.<br>
<br>
They have to ask if you're his spouse.  No option -- they have to.  The Federal Fair Debt Collections Practices Act constrains what bill collectors can say to whom.  One of the major prohibitions in the act is telling people why you are trying to reach the debtor, or even that the call is from a bill collector.  There is an exception for the debtor's spouse -- they CAN talk to the spouse (although they cannot ask the spouse to pay, unless it was a joint account).  If they don't know you're the spouse, even leaving the name of their company can get them in trouble.<br>
<br>
From the bill collector's standpoint, it's quite necessary to follow this rule.  The penalties for breaking it can be significant, and liability attaches not only to the company, but to the actual individual making the call.  For some schlub making US$ 20,000 per year, a $5,000 fine would mean bankruptcy.<br>
<br>
Now, we all realise it's odd, rude and contrary to the normal conventions of telephonic contact to call someone, then ask who THEY are.  But that's what the law requires in this case.<br>
<br>
Please note that this act does not apply to the original creditor (just to cut off replies that point out that companies like Providian will certainly call and tell whoever answers the phone that so-and-so owes them money).<br>
<br>
If you don't want them to call again, you can stop it.  Ask for their address.  Have your husband write them and say &quot;Never call me again, anywhere.&quot;  That stops them.  You can even stop mail contact with a cease and desist request (just mail them a letter saying &quot;Stop contacting us completely&quot;).  Know that this can be risky.  If the amount is large enough, they'll forward it to a lawyer for action.<br>
<br>
Heh, I don't know anything about you.  This could well be mistaken identity, or some crap related to a card your husband paid off 10 years ago, but somebody didn't update their records.  So PLEASE IGNORE ALL OF THIS if it's not applicable.  I'm trying to offer a bit of explanation, not offend you or imply anything negative <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Heck, I had an agency chasing me a few years ago, for a card I cancelled in 1989.<br>
<br>
I also don't mean to imply that bill collectors are all wonderful people who are simply following the law.  All industries have a mix of good folks, normal folks and complete rat-bastards.  Bill collection certainly collects a disproportionate share of the latter category.<br>

<br>
&quot;Good evening sir, may we have a few moments to tell you about super_shit_scam_8714231?It'savailabeinyourareanowandwe....&quot;<br>
<br>
Say &quot;uh huh&quot; a few times and then wait for the right moment.  Trust me, wasting 90-120 seconds is worth it.  When you think you've heard enough, break in and tell them &quot;Wow, that sounds great!  Can you hold on for just a sec?&quot;<br>
<br>
Put the phone down.  I usually take the this time to do laundry, go to the store, tidy up, etc.  Check back every so often until they hang up.<br>
<br>
Now I realize this is difficult if YOU need to use the phone, or you have others living with you, but personally for me, it works great.  Why do this?  It's been purposed that if a large porportion of us did this on a regular basis, we could drive up average call times to the point where it would be no longer be profitable to call people.  Think about it, and give it a try if you can. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=673738">Gariet</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, HalfBreed Assassin<br>

Hence the title of the thread.  <br>
<br>
As far as I'm aware we are current with all our bills, so it's not a huge deal and if it is legitimate I'm sure we'll figure out what the hell it is sooner or later.  We do have someone sending us letters about a 15 year old debt of my father-in-laws that was &quot;purchased&quot; by another company and &quot;we owe them $X and must pay them now or it will reflect on our credit history&quot;.... I don't bloody think so, .... shoooo!  Go away.  Maybe they got our phone number somehow?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I digress.  I just get hugely irritated by someone demanding to know who I am when they phoned me.  It's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>my</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> phone, in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>my</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> name, not my husband's (he is my husband, but at that point in the conversation I'd had enough so I said that I wasn't his spouse to make him go away... lol) so if they ring me up, they can damn well tell me who they are.  If they can't for whatever reason, they can tell me that!  They can excercise some manners.  Say, &quot;I'm sorry, unless you are Mr. X's spouse, I cannot divulge that information&quot;, they shouldn't just keep demanding to know who I am when I have told them that I it's none of their business. <br>
<br>
And lastly, they shouldn't pretend with this first name crap that they know him, as that's just insulting.  He didn't give them permission to call him by his first name and they certainly cannot assume to be a friend of his, so they should call him by his full name at least.  It's common courtesy.<br>
<br>

Or you can buy a device that does the same thing.  When the computer that called you hears this tone, it hangs up and deletes your number from its database since it thinks your phone is diconnected and a waste of resourses to call again.<br>
<br>
Pro: Download free.  Cons: If answering machine is set to 4 rings.  And you have to record the sound as the first thing on your outgoing message.<br>
<br>
Pro: Device works as soon as you pick up the phone.  Cons: You hear the sound.  Costs around 20 bucks.<br>
<br>
The only other factor is that this only works when a computer makes the call.  If it's a human, they will still try to talk after the short beep.<br>
<br>
I have the device and have eliminated roughly 90% of unwanted telemarketers calls. <br>

<br>
All the phone companies seemed to love trying to get us to switch long distance carriers.  When I took such a call, I would usually listen to their pitch and finally tell them that my roommate handled such matters and they should try calling back tomorrow sometime.  My roommate would do the exact same thing.  Some of the more determined telemarketers would last a month before giving up.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, I hate it when businesses try to send a fax to our main work line.  I know once in a while, it happens.  Someone near the fax machine on the sending end hears someone pick up the line and either they a)Stop the fax and call the number to verify their information or b)give up and let someone else do it.  That's understandable<br>
<br>
What drives me mad is when no one hears that the number they are faxing to isn't attached to a fax machine, and the fax machine tries 5-10 more times.  Every 30 seconds.  By the third time, I just put the call on hold and walk away.  If they're driving me crazy, I do everything in my power to drive up their costs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deldrach>Deldrach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/17/03 3:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4047.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.redshift.com/~archon20/snape.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bill Collectors... </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The dead air is the giveaway.. you KNOW it's a telemarketer when you pick up and there's no one there for 5 seconds.

<br>
    I know this is like a dead horse, but I had a bad experience yesterday and was curious how often this happens.<br>
<br>
<br>
    A bill collector calls my house looking for my husband. I explain to him that we are divorced and he has not lived here in almost 2 years. <br>
<br>
   He then proceeds to yell at me and tell me how that is not his problem. That he has a bill that is very much overddue and he wants his money.<br>
<br>
   I then ask for his fax number so I can fax him the court papers. And I offer to give him my ex husband's address and phone number. He again starts to yell at me. and this is not exact quote, but pretty darn close. &quot;Look, bitch, that is not my problem. This is the phone number I have on file and this is where I WILL get my money.&quot;<br>
<br>
  I told him. My ex does nto live here, he has not for a long time, do NOT call my house again or you will be reported. He then starts yelling profanities. I hang up.<br>
<br>
  He CALLS BACK! He tells me. &quot;Bitch, I will call your F*(&amp;^(% house every G*&amp; D&amp;^$ day if I F*&amp;%$^&amp; want to until I get my money.&quot;<br>
<br>
  I then hung up, called his Corporation, reported him. Called the phone company and reported and, called the BBB and reported him etc.<br>
<br>
   Now, I do not have alot of dealings with Debt Collectors. Is this the norm? <p>                <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/131/131877/folders/81483/576135lwind.psd.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
