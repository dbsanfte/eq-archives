The crowd just keeps getting rougher and rougher and the bouncers are too drunk to do more than glare at the rough crowd that comes in. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey watch that!&quot; Val said as she wiggled past a drunken Troll that had tried to fondle her as she passed with a full tray of drinks. The troll’s breath was awful and reeked of rotten meat. She nearly lost control of her tray but a tall human quickly balanced it for her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks Tarragon.&quot; she said. Tarragon was a Ranger of Karana and known to frequent Crow's when he was in town. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will take an ale as well, once you get a chance,” he said in a quiet voice. She handed out the drinks she was carrying to a table full of drunken Dwarves. At least they didn't try to touch her, but boy what lousy tippers. She turned around to get her next order only to find the troll behind her again making a crude comment, it sounded like &quot;Boobiesh&quot; but it was hard to tell since his mouth was crammed with rotting halfling. She once again tried to sway out of his way, but this time the troll tripped her. She fell to the ground with a crash and her tray rolled into one of the corners. <br>
<br>
She felt a huge weight descend upon her back. The troll had placed a foot on her back, the crowd was cheering. Suddenly the weight was removed, the Troll was on his back with the ranger holding a long sword at his throat. It was deadly quiet in the bar. &quot;Don't ever keep the waitress from getting me an ale troll!&quot; the ranger growled, sheathing his blade. &quot;Me take one too, sweetie&quot; the troll said getting up from the ground. Red faced she trotted over to the corner where her tray had rolled. A short Gnome handed the tray back to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;You know the troll is gonna take it out on you as soon as the ranger leaves.&quot; he whispered earnestly. <br>
<br>
&quot;I know...&quot; she replied quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me help you out. I am an apothecary by trade and I have a potion that will make even a troll pass out.&quot; He winked at her. &quot;Slip it into his drink and he will have to be carried out of here in about 5 minutes.&quot; <br>
<br>
Val knew that Crow himself had been known to dose unruly customers, could this gnome be the supplier? She took the small vial from the gnome and walked over to the bar. <br>
<br>
&quot;Two ales&quot; she said to the bartender. <br>
<br>
When the two foaming mugs arrived she had little difficulty adding the contents of the vial to one of them. She hoisted the tray back onto her shoulder and walked towards the Troll and the Ranger who were still glaring at each other. Before she could hand the &quot;special&quot; drink to the Troll he reached out and took the &quot;safe&quot; one. The ranger took the other. <br>
<br>
&quot;Drink with me to show no hard feelings!&quot; the troll roared at the Ranger. Before she could slap the ale out of the Ranger's hand the mugs were empty. Tarragon began to sweat almost immediately after pounding the ale; he looked around the room dazedly and began to sway unsteadily. Thinking quickly Val put an arm around the ranger and began to lead him upstairs to the room she rented from Crow. <br>
<br>
As they left she heard the troll shout, &quot;Save some for me Sweetie!&quot; to the general laughter of the bar occupants. <br>
<br>
By the time she got the Ranger upstairs he was unconscious and shaking uncontrollably. She rolled him onto his stomach and tried to get him to vomit up the vile brew he had drunk. She was so busy she did not notice the gnome until he was literally looking over her shoulder. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is bad...real bad.&quot; He muttered, &quot;Dosage was for a troll not a human.&quot; <br>
<br>
She turned on the Gnome, &quot;what did you give me, poison?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well yeah, nothing else is gonna put a troll on his back for a few hours.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a gurgle Tarragon the Ranger of Karana expired, killed by poison. Val turned back to the corpse with mounting horror.<br>
<br>
&quot;What am I going to do now? I will loose my job; the guards will hang me for murder! And it’s all your fault!&quot; She turned and smacked the Gnome across the face. The blow spun the small demi human completely around.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can help you!&quot; he gasped. &quot;You can hide in the sewers under Qeynos, Take this note and the Ranger's possessions, find a man named Sragg, give him the note, they will help hide you from the guards. I will take care of the body.&quot;<br>
<br>
She did as the gnome requested, never realizing that she had been recruited as a Shadow Knight until it was too late for her to back out.<br>
<br>
After spending many days hiding in the Qeynos Sewers Val grew weary of the damp. She had killed many rats and fire beetles. The dead Ranger's armor did not fit her very well but at least it protected her from the fangs of the large spiders, most of the time. The inhabitants of the hidden temple tolerated her but seemed to be waiting for something. As she carefully skinned yet another rat she heard footsteps approaching her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me an ale!&quot; commanded one of the many beggars that seemed to wander aimlessly around the sewers. <br>
<br>
&quot;Leave me be!&quot; she hissed guiltily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alms for the poor!&quot; The stinky beggar demanded stumbling closer.<br>
<br>
As the beggar drew closer she saw the fevered madness in his eyes, this one would take what it wanted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me what I want!&quot; the beggar demanded slapping her in the face with his soiled hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will get nothing and like it!&quot; Val roared surprising herself with the intensity of her feelings. She placed her hand on the beggar’s chest to push him away, into the sewer proper when something happened.<br>
<br>
There was a sudden rush of power that flooded through her body and into the beggar; she could smell the stink of burning flesh and the beggar twitched in horrible spasms as he flopped into the sewer lifelessly. Oddly she did not care about the dead beggar at all, other than the fact that she would be unable to loot his corpse, indeed she was more interested in the fact that the palm of her hand was black with something more than dirt. Surprised at the level of excitement she felt, she hurried back towards the hidden temple. <br>
<br>
As she approached the guards she held up her black hand and they stepped aside to let her pass by. In the past she had to wiggle past them. She approached Sragg with some trepidation, however. The Dour Shadow Knight barely tolerated her; the first time they had met he had taken the note, grunted and gestured to a sleeping mat. This time she held her black palm out towards him in a salute that felt somehow &quot;right&quot;. This time Sragg looked at her more carefully, &quot;She has been chosen by the god!&quot; he roared. Even the undead servants stopped their endless pacing to pause and look at her with their dead eyes. All was quiet for a moment then the cheering began. &quot;It is time for you to enter the pool.&quot; Sragg said. <br>
<br>
She walked over towards the huge pool of blood. The pool was nearly twenty feet across and she could not tell how deep, magic kept the blood from congealing. &quot;This blood comes to us from the arena above. It is the blood of fallen warriors, executed thieves, defrocked priests and raving mages. All their blood eventually comes to us, to be used by us, to strengthen us.&quot; Val removed the soiled armor that the ranger had worn and cast aside the notched weapons. She had never been naked before a crowd of people before but when she looked around she noticed that no one was looking at her. Everyone was looking away; they had all turned their backs. <br>
<br>
She stuck her foot into the pool it was warm; she slipped into it with scarcely a ripple. When she slid under the surface she thought she could hear the beating of a huge heart. The sides of the pool were slick and difficult to get a grip on but Sragg was there to lift her out of the pool, the blood streamed off her body in tiny red rivulets, leaving her skin a pale white color. When she was dry Sragg gave her a faded tunic and a short sword. &quot;We shall teach her how to fight, how to kill and how to die!&quot; He shouted, the others gathered around repeated the phrase as they turned towards her. &quot;I will also teach you how to be a lady.&quot; Sragg whispered as he led her to her new quarters.<br>
<br>
Valkiri 6th season Shadow knight<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What do you mean, you can’t read!” thundered Sragg, showing the first real emotion Val had seen the venerable Shadow Knight display. Earlier that day he had given her a pile of scrolls to read through, she had spent several hours looking at them, hoping that somehow she had been magically granted the ability, unfortunately it was not the case. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sragg bellowed down the hall, “Bring me the body of that damn wizard who was killed in the arena last week!” in a few minutes the decapitated body was presented to him and placed on a slab, “Get the chief priest and necromancer they’ve got some work to do. I want this stiff available to teach Val how to read within the hour!” He turned to Val, “what are you looking at?” he frowned, “he is dead, he left his body behind, a tool we can use.” <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A tall lanky human strode into the room, followed by a priest in armor; they immediately began to draw runes onto the corpse. “Everything dies, and when it dies it decays that is a cosmic truth. Even gods can be killed. It is a concept that is unpleasant to everyone on Norrath, everyone but us. For most people death is something to be avoided, to be fought, for us it is something to be embraced. For us death is the beginning, decay the path to new things. Followers of Innoruk worship a base emotion, devotees to Rallos Zek pursue fleeting glory we are directed to something that is permanent.” He looked back at the table and frowned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Time for combat training initiate!”  Sragg handed a tattered note to Val. “Travel through the Qeynos Hills and the Gnoll Fortress of Black Burrow, I want you in Everfrost Peaks by sundown. You will find Arnish MacLeish on the other side of the Black Burrow tunnel. Give him the note, he will instruct you on what to do next.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Valkiri was excited to be trusted with such an important mission, she quickly gathered her meager possessions, a rusted 2 handed sword and a set of leather armor made for her by the Millers.  Tucking a fire beetle eye into her belt pouch she left the temple area. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The journey through the hills surrounding the city was uneventful, but she kept her eyes peeled for Holly Windstalker, the ranger had tried to catch Val on several occasions when she was hunting wolves. Some warriors were busy with the gnolls at the entrance so she was able to slip into the gnoll fort undetected. She had nearly made it across the gap to the Everfrost Peaks tunnel when a scrawny Gnoll detected her.  She struck quickly with her blade and the gnoll collapsed to the ground with a growl.<br>
<br>
As she looted the corpse for valuables, (Hoping for some black burrow stout) two more scrawny gnolls attacked. These were much better fighters than the first and the fight was beginning to turn against her when a huge axe smashed into the side of one of the attacking gnolls, followed by a huge boot kicking into the groin of the other. In seconds the fight was over.<br>
<br>
“Thank you!” Valkiri said turning to her rescuer, a huge barbarian warrior.<br>
<br>
“Twas nothing small one.” The warrior said despoiling the dead gnolls of their gear. “You paladins really got to learn that a kick in the groin is just as good as a sword in the belly!”<br>
<br>
“I will… uh…try to keep that in mind…” Val stated, surprised that anyone would confuse her with one of the tight-laced warriors of Marr.<br>
<br>
“Names Draugos” The barbarian said handing her a round shield from one of the dead gnolls. “There be more gnolls in the tunnel to Everfrost, are ye headed that way?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, I seek Arnish MacLeish.”<br>
<br>
“I will keep the gnolls busy then till you can complete your business with him. He be campin at the base of the cave.”<br>
<br>
The journey through the tunnel was much easier with a companion, indeed Draugos made short work of the first two gnoll sentries. Finally, they reached the mouth of the cave. Far below she could make out the half naked form of Arnish.<br>
<br>
“There be two more of the buggers hidin along the entrance here, I will take care of em for you. Just run past em to Arnish.” Draugos Growled. The two of them lept from the tunnel entrance Draugos shouting his war cry, she barely had time to see the two gnolls converge on the warrior as she ran past the fight down to Arnish who was looking at her carefully as she ran down the long stone ramp.<br>
<br>
She handed her note to Arnish, panting slightly from the run down the hill; she could hear the barking of the gnolls and the clash of arms behind her. The barbarian read the note and turned on her with a loud bellow.<br>
<br>
“We don’t tolerate folk like you in our lands!” He swung a meaty fist knocking her backwards nearly a dozen feet. Stunned Val brought her sword on guard. Arnish was upon her like an avalanche, a flurry of punches and kicks struck her from every direction, and her best blows seemed to only slow the barbarian. Behind her she could still hear Draugos fighting the gnolls. <br>
<br>
“Tolerate This!” Val shouted as she summoned the black hand. Once again she felt the roar of energy in her blood and the flash of power as it struck her enemy. The power of the black hand knocked the barbarian back several feet. To her surprise the barbarian was still standing. He began to foam at the mouth and he attacked with renewed fury. Fortunately, his attack lacked cunning and despite some very hard blows Val finally cut the barbarian down. She recovered her note as Draugos came rushing down the path. <br>
<br>
“HellBitch!” he roared, “You killed me kinsman!” The warrior was charging down the icy slope towards her. His axe was still red with gnoll blood. <br>
<br>
Valkiri backed down into the snowy expanse of Everfrost Peaks and looked for a place to hide. She saw a few skeletons shuffling along a frozen trail. She ran towards them only to see them turn towards her and attack with an eerie cackle. She turned again and ran north with the skeletons at her heels and the warrior closing quickly. She could hear one of the skeletons rhyming as it chased her.<br>
<br>
“Smash her, Bash her, Crush her fine…Punch her Crunch her make her mine.” <br>
<br>
With a roar the enraged warrior rushed through the mob of rhyming skeletons. He swung his axe at her legs and Val barely leapt out of the way. She turned and brought her blade up on guard, prepared to sell her life at as high a price as she could. Having seen the warrior in action she knew it would be a brief fight. Valkiri braced herself for the killing blow, but it did not come. The skeletons, sensing another target had turned on the warrior leaving Val an opportunity to escape. She ran away from the fight still stunned at the rapid turn of events.<br>
<br>
The trip back to the sewers was uneventful. It was a very angry Valkiri who returned the note to Sragg. <br>
<br>
“Have any problems?” The Shadow Knight asked with a smile.<br>
<br>
“You sent me into a trap, you bastard!” Val roared, wondering if she could summon up the black hand yet again.<br>
<br>
“Not really, I sent you to get some combat practice, from looking at you I guess you got some.”<br>
<br>
“What did the note say?” She asked angrily.<br>
<br>
“Call it incentive to learn to read.” Sragg hissed, handing the note back to her. With his other hand he snapped his fingers and a zombie shambled into the room. “This is your new tutor Val.”<br>
<br>
Valkiri recognized the corpse as the one that the Priest and the Necromancer were working on when she left.<br>
<br>
Even with the tutor it would be weeks before she could translate the note. It read. “I am a follower of the Plague bringer and I am here to disease the well in Halas, try and stop me coward!”<br>
<br>
Valkiri 10th season Shadow Knight<br>
<br>
With stiff fingers Valkiri completed entering the last spell into her book. It had taken her days to understand the scrolls she had procured, worse still her zombie tutor had fallen prey to a swarm of giant rats some weeks ago and was unavailable for comment. Book learning had never been a part of her life before she entered the temple. It was one of the things that she had to be thankful for, that and her not having to go serve drinks to scum. During her studies she had learned of a city of evil humans. It was called Paineel. She resolved to travel there and improve her skills with the blade. Of late her sparring sessions with Sragg had become all too dangerous, and she felt that she need to practice elsewhere.<br>
<br>
The boat ride was uneventful and her arrival at Erudin was unnoticed by the guardsmen. She had heard of the arrogant attitudes of the Erudites but had not really believed it until she experienced it at first hand. Back home the merchants might sneer at her and make the sign of the evil eye behind her back, but here they simply refused to do business. She was wise enough to know not to cause an “incident” in town but she made sure to mark the location of the town well as a place to share the “blessings” of her deity before she left. ‘Lets see how high and mighty you are when you can’t get more than a few steps away from your outhouse; you bubble skulled freaks!’ she thought to herself as she left town.<br>
<br>
She gazed carefully at the guard skeletons at the entrance to Paineel, after careful consideration she stepped into the tunnel and saluted them. They did not attack her. Her footsteps echoed wildly as the walked down the tunnel, so much so that she turned around on several occasions to see if she was indeed being followed. Eventually she exited into what she assumed was the courtyard of Paineel; there were skeleton and human guardsmen who exuded an appropriately evil aura. She approached one of the human guards who glared at her threateningly. <br>
<br>
“Is this Paineel?”<br>
<br>
“It is, or as much of it as you are going to get to see.” The guard hissed. <br>
<br>
“What can I do to improve my standing with the guard?” Valkiri asked reaching into her nearly flat purse.<br>
<br>
“The only currency we accept from outlanders like yourself can be found over in the Warrens. Bring me the molars of the Kobolds who live in the tunnel and perhaps you can earn your way into our fair city.” At the last the guard pointed towards a tunnel to his right.<br>
<br>
Valkiri was tempted to ask why he was spending his day killing fire beetles when obviously the true danger to the city lay within the warrens, but she thought better of it. The musky stench of the kobolds immediately caused her nose to begin to run. The tunnels were full of the hairy beasts and the clamor of their howls down the narrow caverns made it seem that there were at least two hiding somewhere for every one that she did see.<br>
<br>
She carefully sought out and found a good place to prepare for battle. Sitting on the ground she began to meditate “OOM…OOM…OOM.” She heard the approach of booted feet and sneaked a quick peek away from her book. There was an elf standing there, dressed in the woodland garb of a ranger. <br>
<br>
“Hail and well met fair one, I am Eldakkar ranger of Tunare, perhaps we could slay some of these foul beasts together?” His voice was musical and his command of the human language perfect.<br>
<br>
“I would be glad to accompany you.” Valkiri said digging out a small hollow in the hard packed earth of the warrens. “Just give me a moment to prepare for battle.” She took a pair of bone chips out of her belt pouch and placed them in the hole. This was the first time she had attempted to summon the dead and was more than a little nervous about the outcome. Steeling herself, she cut her forearm with a dagger and let the blood drip into the small depression that contained the bone chips. Whispering the eldritch phrases through clenched teeth she slowly coerced a gibbering skeleton from the earth.<br>
<br>
She turned to Eldakkar with a smile of accomplishment on her face, only to find that his face now bore a look of fear and anger.<br>
<br>
“I shall not pervert the purity of the hunt by working with the likes of you!” Eldakkar said with disgust.<br>
<br>
“As you wish frail one.” Valkiri responded still stunned at her successful summoning. The elf quickly vanished around one of the corners. Some of the other adventurers in the area near the well also backed away, but a few Erudites looked at her with new respect. <br>
<br>
The next week passed quickly in the caverns of the Kobolds, Valkiri learned to steal the strength of her enemies and add it to herself, to afflict them with plague and when she was wounded to steal their very life force to feed hers. She found the Erudites that bothered to speak to her to be even more powerful spell casters than herself, but their warriors were broken more easily than a ceramic mug in the hands of a drunken Ogre. Most of the time she was alone, except for her summoned companion who proved to be as dedicated and loyal as any pet she had ever had.<br>
<br>
Eventually she had several bags full of the noxious molars of the Kobolds. She approached the guard with the smelly sack and he looked at her dubiously. <br>
<br>
“I have the teeth you seek!” she said, pouring the contents of the bag into the startled guards outstretched hands. It was a gruesome double handful of kobold fangs still flecked with congealed blood and bits of matted hair.<br>
<br>
The guard looked at them dubiously as he dropped them into a box by the gate. He looked around helplessly for something to wipe his hands off on, finally settling for the hem of a passing barbarians cloak. <br>
<br>
“Thank you for your service to the fair city of Paineel, enter and enjoy our hospitality.” The guard intoned formally.<br>
<br>
It was with great excitement that Valkiri entered the hidden city. The architecture was truly impressive and apparently well stocked. She approached a merchant eager to sell some of the bronze weapons she had acquired.<br>
<br>
“We don’t serve your kind!” the shopkeeper said with disdain. Valkiri barely restrained herself from slapping the merchant. She left the store and went into a bar. When she asked for a drink she received the same response. Her Northman Claidhmore was nearly out of its sheath when a glass of a dark colored red wine appeared on the bar in front of her. <br>
<br>
“Your talents are wasted here.” A quiet voice whispered in her ear. Valkiri turned to her left and saw her first Dark Elf. He was wearing a suit of very ornate armor that complimented his ebon skin. She took a sip of the wine, it was better than anything she had at Crows. “We could use someone with your special talents Valkiri.” <br>
<br>
“How do you know my name?”<br>
<br>
“I am called Trakken, and I am a humble Shadow Knight of Neriak.” His voice was soft like crushed velvet and as sweet as the blood red wine she was sipping. She knew that despite what he said there was never anything humble about any Dark Elf especially the Shadow Knights. Suddenly she was very glad that Sragg had spent nearly as many hours training her in court etiquette as combat training.<br>
<br>
“What can I do for you, that you cannot do for yourself?” She said combining her new courtly training with a smile that she had previously saved for rich and tipsy patrons of Crows.  <br>
<br>
“We Tier Dal need people to act as intermediaries, it is unhealthy for some of our servants to be seen to act directly on our behalf.”<br>
<br>
“Go on.”<br>
<br>
“Obviously none of our enemies would suspect that the young “paladin” from Qeynos was anything other than what she appeared to be.”<br>
<br>
“Tell me more.” She whispered into Trakken’s ear.<br>
<br>
“There are duties that only a human female, dedicated to evil might be able to perform.”<br>
<br>
“What must I do to serve?” Valkiri asked, watching lust and duty wage war with each other in Trakken’s eyes. After a moment duty won.<br>
<br>
“You must travel to Neriak, you will find some instructions waiting for you at the bank.”<br>
<br>
The next morning found Valkiri awaiting the arrival of the boat for Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Valkiri 10th season Shadow Knight<br>
<br>
The journey across the breadth of Antonica was one of the most difficult tasks Valkiri had ever faced. In every village she approached the inhabitants attempted to drive her off. Einhorst McMannus had nearly decapitated her with his halberd as she fled past the barbarian fishing village. Even the beasts of the Karanas were her enemies. And it was with a weary heart that Valkiri reached the dubious safety of Highpass Hold. She spent the night cowering in a ravine of rock hiding from the orc patrols that plagued the road east from Highpass Keep, being afraid to enter Kithcor at night. The following day things went more smoothly, the commons presented little danger and she reached the dark forest of Nektulos with little trouble.<br>
<br>
“What do you here in the lands of the Tier Dal!” Commanded a dark elven Enchantress. The guards on the bridge looked at Valkiri dubiously, awaiting a command from the female spell caster.<br>
<br>
Valkiri looked at the spellcaster carefully, quickly realizing that she faced a young pup made brave by the presence of the rest of her pack. <br>
<br>
When Valkiri made no answer and proceeded to cross the bridge, the youth stepped into her path. “I will know your business or I shall have your head!” the enchantress barked.<br>
<br>
Valkiri walked past the angry enchantress who began to chant a song of power.<br>
“Try…and Die” Valkiri hissed, the Northman Claidhmore was forged to be used by Barbarians, the blade was as long as her leg and as wide as her thigh. It had taken many months for her to learn to wield this massive cleaver and what it struck it sundered. <br>
<br>
“Guards, the human threatens me! Deal with her!” The enchantress growled with delight.<br>
<br>
The guards did nothing and when Val took a step towards the enchantress, she fled, yelping her indignation into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Sheathing her sword with a flourish, Val crossed the bridge.<br>
<br>
“By Rallos Zek! Never seen a no name pale face down a Tier Dal pup and the guards before.” A voice boomed.<br>
<br>
“The names Val…Valkiri.” She stammered as what she thought was a tree stepped into the path before her. It was an Ogre. This one was clad in black mail and it stood over nine feet tall. Her overlarge blade would look like a shortsword in its meaty fist.<br>
<br>
“You can call me Gorthaur.” The Ogre said, “At least you are wise enough to fear me.”<br>
<br>
“What brings you to the forest of Nektulos?” She asked eager to change the subject. <br>
<br>
“I have been hunting undead in the lost citadel of Befallen for the last week. I go next to Najena, but first I shall consume a lake of ale in the foreign quarter.”<br>
<br>
“If you don’t mind, I will accompany you at least as far as the first gate, I too have business in the city of the Tier Dal.”<br>
<br>
“Great!” the Ogre roared, “You can buy me some ale as a reward for saving your life!”<br>
<br>
Valkiri looked at the Ogre in confusion.<br>
<br>
“Well I haven’t killed you yet.” Gorthaur laughed, flashing his tusks. Valkiri had to trot to keep up with the long pace of the Ogre as they traveled towards Neriak. <br>
<br>
It was with a much flatter purse that Valkiri entered the bank in the Neriak Underground. She had found the Ogre to be good yet expensive company and the attitude of the Tier Dal towards her had improved while they had been drinking together. She had left Gorthaur face down in the Maiden’s fancy a bar that catered towards more earthly entertainment than she had thought to find in Neriak. She thought that several of the other patrons had wanted her to dance on the bar, but she did not yet know the language of the Tier Dal well enough to be sure. As it was she declined all offers and had broken the fingers of one over ambitious Dark Elf who had dared to touch her. One gurgling roar from Gorthaur had led the rest to leave her alone. The Ogre had foolishly tried to drink both the Dancers and Val under the table. While he had a deal of success with the dancers, including a surprisingly nimble female Ogress, Val had simply outlasted him.<br>
<br>
“How you drink more than Gor?” the Ogre had slurred at the end.<br>
<br>
“I have been drinking Blackburrow Stout since I was a child and working in bars like this for most of my life.” She patted the glassy eyed Ogre as he slumped under the table. Still it had been a near thing and it was with a wobbling step that she had made it to the bank.<br>
<br>
It took a few moments for the banker to understand that she wanted to check her account. She was not sure if the difficulty was one based on language, her inability to speak or even see clearly or the general snootiness of the Dark Elves. He had finally quickened his pace once she had threatened to vomit all over his counter. Aside from her usual loot, there was a note. Unfortunately the note was written in the precise angular letter of the Tier Dal language, at least she thought it was, the way her vision was blurring it could be goblin, orc, or common as well. Tucking the note into her pouch she stumbled from the bank in search of a place to sleep.<br>
<br>
She awoke with a start. The constant drone of crickets had abated suddenly, a sure warning of danger approaching. She was outdoors, clad only in her sleeping shift and there was a small figure on the ground next to her. Gingerly she turned over and found a dead halfling pinned to the ground by her Northman Claidhmore. She pulled her blade from the cooling corpse just as a small group of halflings approached her. <br>
<br>
“She killed Toffer!!” a particularly tall and lean halfling piped, “Kill her!”<br>
<br>
All remains of the monumental hangover that had been waiting in ambush for her to awaken were swept away in the wave of adrenaline that washed over Valkiri. Baring her teeth in a feral grimace she braced herself for the swarm of angry hairfeet that quickly surrounded her. The fight quickly went against her, with the halflings tumbling out of the way of her sword only to dart within her guard and pierce her with their knives. She took several deep wounds before she was able to trick one into her guard intentionally as he prepared to plunge his dagger into her stomach she summoned the Black Hand, as the little figure jolted in agony she decapitated him with her sword, using the backstroke to buy her a little distance. <br>
<br>
The halflings were attacking too quickly for her to concentrate enough to summon a skeletal warrior or to steal their life force. Instinctively she knew to turn her back on these enemies would mean her death and she backed up to a large tree and grimly decided to fight till the end. It would not be far away she thought, she was swinging her blade much more slowly now and it was getting very difficult to keep track of her opponents locations. She could not summon the Black Hand again.<br>
<br>
“Treat your betters with more respect human!” The thin halfling hissed, dropping her disguise to reveal the enchantress that had accosted her on the bridge. Behind her she saw another Tier Dal with his right hand in a splint. <br>
<br>
“Tell your feeble deity that it was Elclavada and Zeligar  that sent you to your doom.” She hissed casting an invisibility spell. The male simply stepped into the shadows and disappeared.<br>
<br>
“I thought they would never leave.” Whispered another voice. New energy surged into Valkiri’s body and suddenly she was not fighting alone.<br>
<br>
 A sickly green cloud of mist surrounded one of her attackers, it may have been the lingering effects of the Blackburrow stout, but it appeared that there were tiny skulls leering at her from within the cloud. One of her attackers let out a terrified shriek and ran for the safety of the forest. She turned to see a smartly dressed gnome in a deep red robe smack another attacker in the back of his head with a staff. Immediately the halfling began to choke and cough. The third and last turned to run but was quickly surrounded by a thick clinging darkness that slowed his flight to a crawl. Valkiri took his head before he traveled more than a dozen steps. She turned back to the choking one only to see the gnome standing over the withered husk with a satisfied expression on his face.<br>
<br>
“When Sragg told me you had not reported in for a while, he sent me looking for you.” The gnome explained. “My name is Maladominus.” It looks as if I arrived just in time.<br>
<br>
“I thank you.” Valkiri panted in her exhaustion, not caring at the moment that her sleeping shift had been hacked to rags.<br>
<br>
“Let me share some of the energy I stole from this one with you.” Maladominus said, making an arcane gesture. Suddenly new vitality flooded into her overtaxed system. “Too bad my cloak is too small for you.” The gnome smirked. “I think it would be better if your enemies thought you dead anyway, suddenly his eyes glittered with a chill light and Valkiri disappeared. “Being invisible is a little disorienting at first, don’t try to look at your feet and just walk normally and you will soon be fine, lets get your things and relocate to Freeport until we can figure out how to turn this event to our advantage.”<br>
<br>
“Do you read Dark Elven?” Valkiri asked as they headed towards Neriak. <br>
<br>
“Of course! No self respecting agent of evil can’t read it.” Maldominus turned to her and winked, his eyes still held that cold radiance. “I would be glad to teach you what I know, Sragg told me how woefully unprepared you are for your role, although I doubt animating a Tier Dal to teach you to read would go over too well around here.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, I don’t know about that, I can think of at least two potential candidates.” Val replied.<br>
<br>
“Do not think to take your vengeance directly, you will win no respect from the Tier Dal from a direct confrontation. It is the subtle knife in the dark that wins the admiration of these folk, let us retire to Freeport where you can learn and we can plan an appropriate response.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Valkiri 12th Season Shadow Knight<br>
<br>
After spending time in the cool depths of Neriak the Sewers of Freeport were a trial. Valkiri marveled at this change, indeed as she grew in power her ability to afford certain luxuries increased as did her lust for them, never again would she be content to hunt rats and bugs in the sewers of Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Maladominus had spent a great deal of time attempting to teach her to read the language of the Teir Dal. Each day she deciphered a little more of the note and Maladominus refused still to translate it for her, even though he now knew the contents well.<br>
<br>
“Damn these Teir Dal separable verbs!” Val hissed again, angered at being unable to grasp the meaning of the next to the last sentence. In her anger she would have slapped the gnome had she not known that to do so would have been a fatal mistake. This was the second great change that had come over her since the bath in the pool of blood under the arena. She now sought out conflict, where before it was something to be avoided at all costs and violence which had been something unthinkable to a tavern wench now was a part of her life that she looked forward to. “I need to get some exercise!” Valkiri growled strapping her Claidhmore to her back.<br>
<br>
“Don’t go into Neriak.” Mal ordered. “If you want to kill some Dark Elves I know a place you can go.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The look of total innocence on Val’s face was ruined by the growl in her voice as she replied, “I have no interest in Neriak at this time.” She smiled at Mal. “Tell me of this new place…”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The journey through East Commons was un-eventful. The lions had learned through hard experience that the nice smelling female with the huge sword was not good to eat. When she entered the West Commons, however, she found something new to her experience. Twinkling before her was a small glowing sphere about the size of her fist. Unsure if it was an artifact or a living object Val reached out with her lifetap ability. She was surprised when indeed she was able to steal energy from it. The ball of light rushed towards her with surprising speed and its glowing aura grew more bright. With a crackle of released energy a small bolt of energy leapt from the orb, striking her with considerable force in the leg.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Feel my Steel!” Valkiri howled, bringing the Claidhmore down to shatter the annoying orb. Instead of shattering like rotten crockery the sword failed to bite. She brought her blade back for another swing, taking two more energy bursts in the process. With a roar of anger Val brought the blade down in a brutal two handed swing. Her blow split the earth in front of her, burying her blade to half its length in the rocky loam of the West commons. The orb danced in front of her. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Foolish human, the Willowisp cannot be harmed by common blades.” A Dark elven Shadowknight laughed in the speech of the Teir Dal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Valkiri was amazed that she had understood what the warrior said. Suddenly glad that Mal had insisted on teaching her the more practical uses of the Teir Dal language, she hissed back at him, “your next you @#!$*%#!” She took another bolt to the leg. Abandoning her useless sword she stripped off her gauntlet and grabbed the orb. The power of the black hand washed over her and the light of the orb dimmed. Before it could shock her, she threw it, and as it landed Val began to draw the life force from it. It took a few more moments before the orb ceased to flutter about, yet it still glowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Be glad, that on this day your bravery outweighed your insolence, for I do not allow insults from my inferiors.” The dark elf returned her goblin forged gauntlet to her. “Get a blade that is worthy of you. The barbarians make fine steel weapons but their fighting style lacks the finesse you will need to be successful.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Where can I gain such a weapon,” Valkiri panted, still winded from the battle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Seek you, Kidzean Gix in the West commons, tell him, ‘otcin adarev utalk.’” If he finds you pleasing he shall point you towards one such weapon that may be found. But be sure that you have the strength to accomplish the task that he shall set before you, or you shall die.”<br>
<br>
Valkiri 14th season Sk<br>
<br>
<br>
Valkiri waited impatiently on the wooden bridge in East Karana, she had dodged giants, griffons, gnolls and a few other things that started with “G”. In her backpack, wrapped carefully in oilcloth lay a Polished Granite Tomohawk, the last of the possessions she had taken from the poisoned ranger Tarragon. It was a good weapon, but the damage it inflicted was becoming ineffective as was its unpredictable ability to project a damage shield. The moon was nearly overhead, midnight was the time requested for the meeting. The gnome had promised that he had a solution to her problem.<br>
<br>
Jonartik gibbered softly behind her, and she turned, drawing her new Drakkel forged Bastard sword in a blur of silvery motion. She had been on edge after learning that Elclavada and Zeligar her enemies were last seen in North Karana a place perilously close to her present position. Once again she considered the possibility that this was simply an ambush.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No need to cut Eltan in two there missy.” A gnome said, flickering into view as he dropped his invisibility spell. Her sword radiated a palpable cold and each word of the gnomes was punctuated by a puff of vapor. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He continued, apparently unconcerned by how close he had come to a sudden death. “I hope you brought your item, I have a ranger who is interested in your weapon.” The blade when it cut through flesh and bone temporarily froze the blood of its victims. Val liked it because it kept the mess to a minimum. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have it, let me see what you offer in exchange.” Val said quietly.<br>
<br>
With little fanfare Eltan reached into his pack and brought forth an ugly looking cleaver. The weapon was fashioned from the bottom jaw of a huge wolf. The fangs glistened in the dark with hidden power. The hilt of the weapon seemed to be some sort of bone. Her blade hissed with disappointment as was sheathed, flecks of frost rubbing off onto the guard of her scabbard.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Let me hold it.” Valkiri commanded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I would see your weapon first.” countered the gnome.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “As you wish.” She reached into her pack and handed him the Gnollish Axe. <br>
The cleaver was lighter and better balanced than she would have believed, but it was still a bit heavier than her old axe. With a practiced eye she examined the fangs. The largest of which jutted from the blade by at least three inches. It would punch through the thickest armor and with a little effort the smaller fangs would continue to rip into her enemies. Idly she looked over at the gnome and imagined punching the fang through the top of his bald head, then ripping his face off with her follow through.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I take it we have a deal?” Eltan asked, more than a little concerned by the hungry expression on the Shadowknights face.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We do.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Allow me to add a little something to the deal.” The gnome rattled off a few phrases in a language she did not understand. Her eyes seemed to tingle for a moment and her vision blurred.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t turn around. There are two Dark Elves approaching from the end of the bridge. I was told by a certain gnome that lives in Qeynos to get them here any way I could, I believe their names are Zeligar and Elclavada.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “One side Human!”  Elclavada barked in an imperious manner. “We have business with the gnome.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Pardon me,” a deeper voice hissed in Teir Dal, as a hand dipped expertly towards her coin pouch.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Valkiri’s grin was feral as she turned around, “I believe we have unfinished business to conclude first!” she hissed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “By the dangling groin sack of Innoruk!” snarled Elclavada as the Elder Wolf Jaw plowed into her shoulder carving a furrow through the bone. Blood jetted in all directions. Jonartik landed a powerful series of blows with his bony fists, disrupting her counter spell. Out of the corner of her eye Valkiri could see Zeligar attempting to creep past her, moving with the exaggerated care of one who thinks they are invisible. A quick buffet with her Shiny Brass Shield disrupted another spell from Elclavada.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turning quickly Val parried the backstab from Zeligar. “Miss me? I sure wont miss you!” She growled punching the fang into the surprised rogues chest, with a viscious twist she turned the blade in her hand catching the fangs in the bottom of his rib cage. A backhand swipe from her shield knocked the enchantress to the ground. <br>
<br>
A desperate flurry of blows from the rogue struck her in the chest and shoulder. Her breastplate stopped the first but her rusty spiked shoulder pads failed to stop the second. ‘These things have got to be cursed’ she thought turning back to the rogue. She jerked back suddenly and with a series of muffled pops the rogue’s rib cage was separated from his spine, unable to breathe Zeligar collapsed onto the ground.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Pardon me, I seem to have gotten my cleaver lodged in your rib cage.” She bent to remove it when a wave of powerful magics washed over her burning her skin and causing her to gasp in shock.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now you die witch!” the enchantress hissed. She tightened her spell and the pain intensified.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Valkiri let go of her weapon and reached into a beltpouch while staggering towards the enchantress, a pile of sundered bones revealed the sudden and terribly violent demise of her pet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Im gonna burn you down…” Elclavada hissed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The pumice stone felt cool in her hand and it flaked a bit as she vigorously rubbed it on her Netherbian Chitin. The burning quickly faded away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That it?” Valkiri Roared, throwing her shield at the enchantress disrupting yet another spell. The drakkel forged bastard sword squeeled with delight as it left its sheath only to find a new one in the chest of the rogue who had forced himself to his knees and was attempting to stab her in the back yet again. There was a musical crackle as the blood froze in the rogue’s chest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sound of hurried chanting answered her challenge. Elclavada’s form flickered out of focus and just as suddenly back into focus. Thinking she was invisible the enchantress began to back away, heading for the North Karana side of the bridge. A shroud of darkness suddenly surrounded her, slowing her escape, followed by a wave of disease. Abandoning her use of magic as unreasoning fear washed over her Elclavada lurched hideously towards the midpoint of the bridge. Mercilessly Valkiri drained the life force of the enchantress, healing her wounds and leaving a desiccated husk behind on the apex of the bridge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You fought well after the fashion of your kind.” Valkiri said quietly as she kneeled before the dying rogue. Hatred radiated from his eyes like the heat from the earth of lavastorm.<br>
<br>
Loyal to your god to the end eh?” she said. All the rogue could manage was a grunt of agreement.<br>
<br>
“That’s good, too bad you are going to be seeing mine.” With a gentle caress on the rogue’s handsome features she released the black hand….<br>
<br>
Valkiri 18th Season Shadowknight<br>
<br>
The note said, ‘Get out of Antonica Now!’ it was signed by Maladominus. Perhaps she had spent too much time despoiling her enemies on the bridge in the Karanas. Paineel was not an option; she would rather die than go back to that arrogant city. The continent of Faydwer held promise but with no base of operations and most importantly no featherbeds of appropriate size it would be too uncomfortable. That left Kunark, the jungle continent.<br>
<br>
The journey through the commons was one that filled her with fear. There were dark elves everywhere, and an attack could come from any direction. Even though the majority of the League of Darkness of which she was a member was made up of Teir Dal they would be of little protection against others of their kind, of course she had the comfort of knowing that her death would be avenged. She was glad when the journey to the ship proved to be uneventful.<br>
<br>
Her arrival at the Overthere Outpost went unheralded. When she checked the bank, there were no new messages waiting for her. Still, there were a lot of Teir Dal wandering the outpost, the guards when they were humanoid were always Teir Dal and she knew it would be all to easy for a “mistake” to be made regarding her allegiance. <br>
<br>
Val hastily purchased supplies from the uncaring clockwork merchants and headed towards the Lake of Ill omen where she had heard other swords for hire could be found in the vicinity of the windmill. A coughing growl disturbed her thoughts as she trotted through the outskirts of the Overthere area. She turned to see a huge sabertoothed cat staring hungrily at her. Valkiri barely had time to draw her blade before the beast closed on her in a blur of fangs and claws. It quickly became apparent that she was overmatched; even the Black Hand that had saved her so many times before was unable to bite effectively through the beast’s thick hide. <br>
<br>
Chanting desperately she shadow stepped, only to find that the cat had somehow sensed her appearance and was even now closing on her. Desperate for more speed Val threw her backpack to the ground and was amazed when the cat stopped for a moment to sniff it. It was not delayed long, however, and as it closed Val tossed her belt pouch to the ground and continued to run.<br>
<br>
The process continued for some time until at last naked and terrified she saw the gates of the outpost. With great relief she watched one of the huge clay golems smash the saber tooth into the ground. It took the tired Shadow Knight some time to collect her wits as well as her equipment as she journeyed back towards the Lake. At last, swearing vengeance upon all Saber-toothed cats Valkiri entered the gorge that would take her to the Frontier Mountains. There she learned another lesson in humility as she was forced to hide and cower like a fourth season paladin traveling through Nektulos Forest. Fortunately, she met no other travelers and upon entering the Lake of Ill Omen area her fear had turned to a boiling rage. <br>
<br>
“We are here to assissssst you during your ssssstay here.” An Iksar said in broken human. “I am Opious and this is my broodmate Keemodo.” Each gave the appropriate secret sign identifying them as members of the League. <br>
<br>
“Lord Zanis sent us word that you would be in the area.” Opious chittered. <br>
<br>
Valkiri looked at these young Iksar males, she could tell their gender by their thicker tails and the lack of a head crest. Both were very quick and graceful in their movements with Opious appearing to be the more physically gifted, while an aura of magical power flickered around the quiet Keemodo.<br>
<br>
“For a race without lips you speak the language of the Humans quite well.” Valkiri said.<br>
<br>
“You would be surprised at what one can accomplish with a nimble tongue.” Opious replied, flicking his out nearly a handspan.<br>
<br>
“My blade thirsts for Sabertooth blood, where can they be found?” The shadow knight asked eager to change the subject.<br>
<br>
“Me show!” Keemodo said eagerly, racing off towards a structure that looked oddly like a windmill. Val found the flatfooted running gait of the Iksar enchanting, their whole body swayed back and forth as they ran, with the tail acting as a counter balance. They stopped only once when Keemodo veered suddenly off course to stop in front of a female Iksar. Slapping his tail repeatedly into the ground to get her attention, he produced an oddly phallic looking fruit from his backpack and presented it formally to the female.<br>
<br>
“Vein worm… that Keemodo, always making time for the ladiessss.” Opious sighed. The female carefully inspected the worm and finding it still alive, popped it into her mouth. The lack of lips was once again something Valkiri sorely missed as pieces of the live worm dribbled out of the female’s mouth and stuck on her face. With a quick snap of his tongue Keemodo snatched a rather large glistening piece on the top of the female’s snout. With a startled hiss the female scuttled off into the darkness. “One of these days he is gonna get his tongue bitten off doing that.” Opious hissed as they resumed their run towards the windmill. <br>
<br>
These cats were slightly smaller than the one Valkiri had faced in the Overthere, but they fought well. Opious’ hands were a blur as they pounded into the cat’s brutish skull repeatedly. The spells of Keemodo were even more effective in weakening the sabertooth and the shaman showed no fear in attacking with his spear as well. Indeed, the cats fought well but Opious, Keemodo and Valkiri fought better, her Drakkel forged Bastard sword bit deeper than it ever had before, bringing gasps of surprise from the two lizard men, Valkiri worked hard to hide her own astonishment. And the Iksar treated her with a new level of respect. ‘That last training session must have really paid off,’ she thought to herself as she shuffled off to make a well-deserved camp at the base of the windmill.<br>
<br>
Valkiri 20th season Shadow Knight<br>
<br>
“A Charbone skeleton has stumbled upon our camp!” Opious hissed angrily as he turned to fight, his hands a deadly blur of Ulak and hammer. <br>
<br>
Valkiri sat up blearily her dreams of silk sheets and roast beef shattered. ‘At least my flayed skin cap makes a good pillow.’ She thought to herself, the cap was always warm like living skin; it was a wonderful gift from Antoin. She directed Jabober to attack the Charbone as she kicked Spartax in the side, she could not tell if Keemodo was awake or not, she did not have enough experience with the lidless eyes of the Iksar to judge when they were sleeping or awake.<br>
<br>
“This is for disturbing my sleep!” Val roared unleashing a thunderous blow upon the right leg of the Charbone. Jabober giggled next to her, she was unsure weather he was laughing because of her anger or because the dead did not need sleep. The Charbone turned on her with a flurry of blows the first two she parried but an unexpected tail strike caught her along the right side of her chest parting the flannel fabric and the skin underneath. <br>
<br>
With a crash most of the Charbones ribs on the right side were cut away by a double-handed blow by Spartax, the Northman Claidhmore performing better in his hands than it ever did while she wielded it. She chanted quickly stealing energy from the skeleton to repair some of her wound, wishing that the spell would have the same effect on her much-abused sleeping shift. The last thing she needed was for Spartax to get distracted during the fight. She heard the quick chanting of their newest companion behind her, Slaadya the Dark Elf cleric of Innoruk, a bolt of energy lanced out of the darkness to strike the head of the Charbone, blowing off the lower jaw and spinning the head completely around. The spell seemed to drain more of the energy out of the skeleton and it was fighting much more jerkily than before.<br>
<br>
Val risked a quick glance behind her. The cleric was wearing a “sleeping suit” that left very little to the imagination; a diaphanous fabric made from spider webs barely covered those areas that were not exposed to the night. Val had to admit the Teir Dal’s clothing was handling the rigors of travel better than hers, but she thought the fancy outfit was not fitting of a professional fighter like herself.<br>
<br>
Her thoughts were interrupted by a bony kick to the stomach. Val absorbed as much of the blow as she could by rolling with the impact but it still hurt tremendously. Spartax was fighting clad only in his loincloth and the expression he wore on his face underscored his dislike for fighting without his armor. A second double-handed blow from him turned the Charbone away from her. With a growl of anger she swung her Drakkel forged Bastard sword at the creature’s spine. Vertebrae shattered suddenly and the Charbone collapsed at her feet.<br>
<br>
As she snuggled back into her bedroll, she debated the option of getting a suit of flayed skin. It would be warm and she could wear it while she slept. Valkiri had heard of other armor called Darkforge that fitted a Shadow Knight like a second skin, indeed Shintou was rumored to never remove his. The acquisition of such armor was supposed to be a quest worthy of someone of her experience. She resolved that on the morrow she would begin the quest for Darkforge.<br>
<br>
Spartax was not difficult to convince to return to Antonica and Slaadya had pressing business in the Ocean of Tears so the three of them resolved to head back to the Overthere outpost and leave Kunark when the ship came. It was a difficult parting for Opious and Keemodo their hunting partners for three seasons. The Iksar were unwilling to leave their homeland and it was with a heavy heart that the trio made the hazardous journey back to the Overthere. <br>
<br>
Upon arrival at the outpost, Valkiri checked her mail at the bank and found that there was a package waiting for her. The note said ‘A present for you from your friend…M’. The box was about twelve inches square and sealed with a simple clasp. With a quick tug the box was opened revealing an oilskin bag. She reached in and felt a pelt of some kind and the smell told her that some sort of animal hide was within. With gentle pull she removed the bag.<br>
<br>
It took her a moment to recognize the severed head, it was small and circled with a fringe of white hair, a gnomish head. The face was imprinted with a look of intense pain. The head belonged to Eltan, the gnomish agent of Maladominus she had met on the bridge in the Karanas many months ago. <br>
<br>
“Fan mail?”  Slaadya asked laconically behind her.<br>
<br>
“No, this is one of  Mal’s agents.”<br>
<br>
Suddenly the head in her hand began to twitch spasmodically, drooling half congealed blood the dead eyes and the mouth opened. With a shuddering groan the head began to speak.<br>
<br>
“Know this Valkiri, you are not the only one who chooses who lives and dies, for you have been marked for death by Najena for the murder of her agents. Soon we shall be sending your head to your sponsor Maladominus as a message and a warning not to meddle in our affairs.” The message finished, the severed head began to chant a spell.<br>
<br>
“By, Innoruk’s hateful gaze! Smash the head now, it’s casting a gate spell!!!” Slaadya hissed grabbing Valkiri’s arm as Spartax seized the head in both of his gauntleted hands.<br>
<br>
Reality rippled.<br>
<br>
With a clatter Valkiri, Spartax and Slaadya fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
“My name is Indigosky and this is my sister Azuresky.” a musical Teir Dal voice murmured.<br>
<br>
“There are two Dark Elves to the right,” Slaadya chittered, using the tongue of the Iksar.<br>
<br>
While Valkiri could hear the voice the speaker was too far back in the darkness to be reached by the feeble light of her greater light stone. Her Drakkel forged bastard sword glistened with a cold light. Behind her she heard the hiss of Northman Steel as Spartax drew his two hander.<br>
<br>
“I see you brought friends, you two can leave now or you can die.” Indigosky said matter of factly. “We have some friends of our own.”<br>
<br>
In the darkness Vlakiri heard the peculiar scraping sound of stone grinding against stone.<br>
<br>
“They got two skeleton pets, one is larger than the other, that makes a Shadow Knight and a necromancer. There are also two cone shaped creatures moving to block us from the rear.” Slaadya reported again in the tongue of the Iksar.<br>
<br>
“Tentacle Terrors.” Spartax said flatly. “Good thing they didn’t get you here alone.”<br>
<br>
“The League of Shadows does not abandon its own, especially at the request of an exile from Neriak, you would do well to take service elsewhere or face your doom now.” Slaadya intoned, twitching her shield into a better position.<br>
<br>
“Face me in single combat, Indigosky I would settle this grievance honorably,” Valkiri said stalking forward.<br>
<br>
“No honor, no quarter for a murderer such as you!” shouted Indigosky gesturing her pet forward to the attack, the necromancer began to chant furiously as the Tentacle terrors skittered across the floor their huge maws gaping, full of jagged teeth.<br>
<br>
It was the blast of energy that saved Valkiri, one moment she was standing 50 feet away from the sisters, the next she was sailing through the air, over the advancing skeletons and crashing into the necromancer. Her bastard sword sheared through the caster’s torso with a force beyond that wielded by any mortal warrior, powered as it was by the eldritch energies of the Tentacle terror. Her stroke was un resistible, but it struck the unmovable wall behind the Necromancer and with the sound of Ice breaking the Drakkel Forged Bastard sword shattered into fragments. The sudden blast of cold numbed Valkiri’s arm to the elbow and froze the sundered necromancer like a statue.<br>
 <br>
“Sister!!!” Indigosky screamed in rage. Her hand pulsed with power as it rushed towards Valkiri, the palm turning black and an aura of deadly power radiated from it. Desperately Valkiri held up her other hand, the one that still clutched the head of Eltan the severed head exploded in a shower of bone fragments as the power of the Black Hand flowed into it with a hissing crackle.<br>
<br>
Behind her Valkiri could hear the larger pet of the necromancer clattering to the ground, the energies that bound it to its master dissipated. A shuddering pulse of energy released by Slaadya struck the second pet destroying it utterly before one of the tentacle terrors wrapped her in its grasp and began to drain the life from her. Spartax finished a spell with a stataco growl and the second terror fled the room surrounded by a palpable aura of fear. He turned immediately and began to hack away at the tentacles holding the weakening Slaadya.<br>
<br>
Unable to properly clutch her cleaver or adjust her shield due to the searing pain in one hand and the unnatural numbness in the other Valkiri backed up desperately trying to gain space and time to recover as Indigosky drew a black bladed two hander. An aura of power surrounded the blade and when it struck her she felt her strength drain into the blade. It was a Dark Reaver one of the most feared weapons available to the Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
She summoned her own Black Hand and lunging forward released it into her enemies forearm, the release of energy seemed to remove the pain in her hands and she was able to grip her weapons with more confidence. Still a few more blows from the Dark Reaver would finish her. <br>
<br>
Indigosky began to chant a new spell and as she began to draw mystical energy to herself, Valkiri struck the Teir Dal with her shiny brass shield, the wave of energy dissipated. Her cleaver struck twice at the enemy shadowknight but the fine steel plate that Indigosky wore halted the blows. Her shield strike did knock the Teir Dal back a few paces however and gave Val time to cast a spell of her own.<br>
<br>
The dark blade circled around again cutting deeply into her shield and driving her arm down, the edge moaned hungrily in her ear as it drove against her ringmail gambeson. The blow did not reach the flesh of her shoulder. Valkiri countered with a series of short chops that succeeded in punching through Indigosky’s breastplate. The Teir Dal counterblow drove deeply into her right side and she felt her strength once again diminish, but a blue nimbus of light suddenly surrounded her and Indigosky was caught in the vampiric embrace that surrounded Valkiri.<br>
<br>
“You ward yourself well,” Indigosky snarled, “but you will still fall before my blade.” <br>
<br>
Another blow from the black blade ripped her shield from her arm, numbing it completely. Valkiri’s desperate counter hooked the edge of her sickle like blade behind the knee of the Teir Dal, a quick jerk brought the smaller Dark elf within her guard and Val lunged forward to slam her shoulder into Indigosky’s abdomen. The move backfired, too weak to truly impact her opponent, Valkiri only succeeded in falling to her hands and knees before her slightly stunned enemy.<br>
<br>
“And so it ends.” Indigosky whispered, bringing the blade back for a decapitating blow. The two handed sword hissed through the air as it descended, Valkiri was too tired to even brace herself for the blow.<br>
<br>
It never landed.<br>
<br>
With a ringing crash, Northman Claidhmore and Dark Reaver met, inches above her unprotected neck. The battle turned to one between the Teir Dal and the human Shadow Knight, Spartax Ironskye of Freeport. Despite the ferocity of Spartax’s fighting style it quickly became apparent that he would be overmatched by the greater experience of Indigosky.<br>
<br>
“By the power of Innoruk, be Healed!!” Slaadya roared. As energy and health flooded into her, Valkiri debated weather this was the loudest noise she had ever heard  the Dark Elven Cleric utter. The healer continued her chanting quickly drawing a symbol on Valkiri’s helmet. <br>
<br>
“That is all I can do for now,” Slaadya groaned wearily, her armor was crumpled by the force of the tentacles that had gripped her, and her eyes were glazed with weariness.<br>
<br>
Newly invigored, Valkiri turned her attention back to the fight. What had started out as an exchange of blows between the Human and the Teir Dal had degenerated to a one sided fight as Indigosky swung her blade with greater strength and Spartax struggled to interpose his much heavier blade between himself and the strength stealer. In a moment it would be over.<br>
<br>
A wave of darkness suddenly surrounded Indigosky and some of her stolen strength was drained away.<br>
<br>
“You have been chosen by Valkiri Blackhand, stand ready to greet you maker!” Valkiri yelled as she charged the Teir Dal. Spartax slumped exhausted to the ground.<br>
<br>
Sragg had always insisted that Valkiri learn to fight like a lady, these admonitions were discarded in her desperation. She grabbed the Teir Dal by her hair ripping out a handful by the root, the move brought Indigosky around in a hurry, and left Val inside the guard of her opponent. A quick elbow strike impacted the throat of her foe and she heard Indidosky’s breath wheeze in response. Suddenly unable to breathe, the Teir Dal flipped up the visor on her helmet just in time to catch the point of Valkiri’s cleaver between the eyes.<br>
<br>
“Join your sister!” Valkiri hissed as her enemy fell before her.<br>
<br>
Valkiri Blackhand 26th Season Shadow Knight of the League of Shadows.<br>
<br>
“You have caused me a great deal of trouble of late.” Lord Gray, guild leader of the League of Shadows said quietly. Valkiri stood at attention in his office having been summoned into his presence a few days after the battle in Najena. The office was appropriately Spartan with a utilitarian desk and a small altar to Innoruk, a silk curtain was half drawn along the back wall, revealing an opulent bed large enough for at least three occupants.<br>
<br>
“In what way have I displeased you?” The Shadow Knight said, staring straight ahead.<br>
<br>
“It appears to me that an altercation on the bridge in Nektulos Forest and a second incident in the Maiden’s Fancy has resulted in the deaths of two Teir Dal, well liked in Neriak.” Gray paused, waiting for fear to coax some sort of response from Valkiri. She stood as still as a statue looking straight ahead. ‘This one may be harder to crack than I first suspected.’ Gray thought as he stroked his beard. <br>
<br>
“It has also come to my attention that you have killed two more Teir Dal and despoiled them of their gear.” He looked pointedly at the new two-handed sword that was sheathed across Valkiri’s back. <br>
<br>
In a dark edged blur the blade was unsheathed and placed on the desk. ‘By Innoruk! The girl is almost as quick on the draw as Shintou.’ Gray hid his considerable surprise behind a grim smile. The rumor was confirmed, it was indeed a Dark Reaver. <br>
“If you require it of me, it is yours to dispose of.” Valkiri said flatly.<br>
<br>
“Certain parties here in Neriak have approached me, asking that I remove our protection from you. I will have no blood feuds or independent agendas poisoning our plans. You are a wild card, I had my doubts that a follower of Bertox would make a useful tool for us.” Once again Gray cast his bait into the ocean of calm that surrounded Valkiri, this time he got a response.<br>
<br>
“Keep my deity out of this discussion.” Valkiri said with surprising venom. She wondered why Gray was toying with her.<br>
<br>
“You certainly choose the most unusual of enemies.” Gray said, walking around the desk to stand behind the Shadow Knight as he spoke. She did not turn with him but remained standing looking straight ahead. <br>
<br>
Leaning in close, Gray hissed in Valkiri’s ear, “It has even been suggested by certain parties that I kill you and send your head to them in order to make a proper atonement.” He picked up the Dark Reaver from the desk as he passed it. It literally hummed with suppressed power.<br>
<br>
“You have the power to take my life.” The Shadow Knight responded quietly. She dropped to her knees and calmly coiled her long white ponytail into a bun on top of her head, pinning it with a bone fragment. “If you doubt your skill with my blade, I am sure Shintou could take my head in a single stroke.” She added helpfully.<br>
<br>
‘Damn these death worshipers, they were impossible to intimidate, their death or someone else’s, it did not matter as long as they served their god.’ A proper worshiper of Innoruk would be shouting how they slew their enemies, how wonderful it was to have someone in their life that they hated so much they would actively plot their demise. A follower of Rallos Zek would be challenging him, willing to die in battle and an adherent of Cazic would be relishing the aura of terror that radiated from Gray like heat from the sun. <br>
<br>
He looked at Valkiri kneeling in front of him. ‘With her helmet off she actually looks somewhat presentable, I wonder what other glories lie under her armour.’<br>
<br>
“You know, I think we could work something out.” He said, gently caressing the bare back of Valkiri’s neck. His experienced fingers detected a slight shudder, but if it was from the fear of decapitation or of suppressed pleasure he could not tell. <br>
<br>
“I am afraid I would enjoy the act far more than you would.” Valkiri said with a dazed look in her eye. Again he could not tell if it was passion or being so close to death, probably the combination.<br>
<br>
“You flatter me.” Gray said, examining the kneeling figure more closely, there were definitely attributes here that made the Teir Dal look like half starved children.<br>
“You misunderstand, I am an agent of Death, Disease and Decay, after a tryst with me you would be fit for no one else but myself, I think you would find that arrangement too…limiting.”<br>
<br>
Gray wondered if his god would grant healing in this case, he was sure he had the power, but to petition for it might be more trouble than the pleasure was worth.<br>
<br>
“Your willingness to submit yourself for our benefit proves you are worthy of our protection.” He slid the sword back into its sheath.<br>
<br>
“Are you talking as the head of the guild or as a man.” Valkiri asked quietly.<br>
<br>
“Unfortunately as the head of the guild. We bow to no one’s will. That castoff from Neriak has been told that to continue to attack one of our own will result in the destruction of her organization as well as herself.” He walked back around towards the front of the desk.<br>
<br>
Was that disappointment on her face? If so was it over his rejection of her as a bedmate or his not taking her head.<br>
<br>
“Still, you have inconvenienced us, and it is time you prove your value to the guild. You will lay siege to the pyramids outside of Cazic Thule. Those creatures slew two powerful Shadow Knights who knew the secret of making Dark Forge Armour. You will recover this armor from those lizards. There you will kill Crusaders until you have slaked your lust for killing, take as many guild members as you can get. I will be watching and judge by the bounty you bring me the level of your atonement.”<br>
<br>
A week later, Gray watched in amazement as the entire guild descended upon the pyramids like a hurricane. Spectres, Justicars, Zealots and Crusaders were caught up in the red rain that surrounded Valkiri and destroyed. The Teir Dal fought with passion, and the Iksaur with frightening efficiency, but Valkiri loved to kill. He could see it in her eyes as the light went out of those of her opponents. He caught glimpses of it when her body was struck by her enemies. He got confirmation of it when Antoin brought him her corpse.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” Gray asked Antoin.<br>
<br>
“A bouncer caught her unawares as she tried to make her way to you, she wished to show you the treasure we had taken from the Crusaders. I asked if she needed help but she said that she would show you her value personally. She was too tired from battle and overloaded, it took three of us to simply drag her body the rest of the way.”<br>
<br>
Gray rolled the body onto its back with a gentle nudge. She was even more beautiful in death than in life. Her eyes were fixed straight ahead as they had been in his office, except this time the spark was gone, but her skin bore a noticeable flush and the grin on her face was one that he had seen only a few times before and that was only after a truly memorable romp in the bed chamber. <br>
<br>
He hated the look of pleasure and contentment that was on the fallen Shadow Knights face. He hated the way she had mocked him in his office. He hated the fact that one of his own had died in such a stupid way. His hate pounded in his blood and roared in his ears. He heard his god whisper to him…bring her back…let her know that hate is more powerful than death.<br>
<br>
With a touch of his hand, life once again stirred in the stricken body of the Shadow Knight. With great satisfaction he watched the expression of ecstasy fade from her blood spattered face.<br>
<br>
“Bastard!” She said getting up. <br>
<br>
Valkiri  Blackhand 30th Season Shadowknight<br>
<br>
“What do you mean you are going home?” Spartax said. He had never heard the female Shadow Knight mention her family.<br>
<br>
“Its something I have to do, after…well after Gray brought me back.” She sighed.<br>
<br>
“Want me to go with you?”<br>
<br>
“No, its something that is long overdue and I must do it alone. Gray’s action is forcing me to rethink my role as an agent of Entropy. He brought me back…and I am not sure if that was a good thing or not.” Valkiri adjusted the Dark Reaver on her back as she stood up to go. “I will meet you in South Karana when my business is concluded.”<br>
<br>
As he watched Val leave the inn in the West Commons where they had first met many seasons ago, Spartax realized that he had never seen the Blackhand so agitatated.<br>
<br>
The journey back to Qeynos was uneventful. The orcs of Highpass made an effort to bar her passage, but they were no more a challenge to her than the orc pawns of the commons. She left their sundered corpses untouched behind her. The trip through the Karanas was simply tedious. Still it gave her a lot of time to think about what had happened. <br>
<br>
She was dead, killed by one of those stupid Ogre bouncers in the Feerot. She had felt the broadsword punch through her breastplate, and heard the stopping of her own heart as blood ceased to thunder in her ears. That Bastard Gray had not even let her corpse rot a bit before he brought her back, without consideration of her wants! He jerked her back from her contemplation of the Void. That thief of love, drowner of passion, killer of peace, betrayer of kin, she ceased in her run in sudden shock. Did those epithets apply to Gray or to herself…<br>
<br>
Qeynos had not changed in her absence, but she had. The guards looked at her with the same level of discomfort, but now there was a strong undercurrent of respect. She found herself wondering how difficult it would be for her to kill one. Without noticing it her feet led her to Crow’s Bar. As usual all conversation stopped as the patrons sized up the new arrival. The length of the silence was a mark of how dangerous a patron was. The quiet granted to her lasted most of the way to the bar.<br>
<br>
As she approached Crow, she realized that his shrewd eyes had only taken in her equipment, he did not look her in the eye until she addressed him directly.<br>
<br>
“I will have your best room, Crow, be sure it’s the one without the secret door.” It had been something she had wanted to say to Crow since she had started to work there.<br>
<br>
“Nothing but my best room would suit a Lady like yourself…” Val watched recognition dawn in the eyes of the barkeep.<br>
<br>
“I do not wish to be disturbed during my stay…” She dropped some extra platinum into his hand.<br>
<br>
“Of course, we would be glad to serve a young paladin such as yourself in her room, the crowd here is much too coarse for the likes of you.” Crow said pocketing the platinum while motioning to one of the barmaids.<br>
<br>
“This is Bethany, she will see to all your needs during your stay.”<br>
<br>
“Hey, don’t take away our favorite play toy!” Shouted a rough looking barbarian warrior. He grabbed Bethany around the neck with one huge hand and jerked her back onto his lap.<br>
<br>
“Do not inconvenience me further, its not good for your continued health.” The Blackhand said quietly. She locked eyes with the Barbarian and saw rage slowly fade into fear.<br>
<br>
“That’s Ikdun the warrior, he and his band have sworn to rescue little Joseph Sayer from Lord Elgnub in Black Burrow.” Bethany whispered with a mixture of awe and loathing to Valkiri as she left the barbarian’s table.<br>
<br>
“Since when do barbarians care about anyone not of their kin?”<br>
<br>
“Joseph’s father has sworn to give a powerful weapon to the man who returns his son unharmed.” Bethany said, adjusting her blouse and skirt to more respectable levels.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, things have changed, if a common gnoll can kidnap children from Qeyneos Hills.” Valkiri had always known that life was dangerous out on the frontier between the city proper and the Karanas, and the threat of being snatched by the gnolls of blackburrow had been a threat her mother had used to keep her in bed as a child, but still she had never heard of any child actually being snatched.<br>
<br>
The room was as she remembered it. Large, with a huge featherbed and a tub of beaten copper.<br>
<br>
“I will have a bath first, be sure the water is hot.”<br>
<br>
“Would you prefer a boy to help you with the bath?” Bethany asked nervously.<br>
<br>
“No, I am interested in getting clean, not entertained, you will be fine.”<br>
<br>
It took a few moments for Bethany to return with the bricks, she held them in fire tongs and they radiated blistering heat. When she dropped them into the tub a geyser of steam erupted filling the room. Valkiri took her time entering the bath.<br>
<br>
Bethany’s hands were skilled and the grime from the road was quickly sloughed off. “My Lady, how did you survive this blow?” the barmaid asked, gently touching the puckered scar between her shoulderblades, a matching one lay partially hidden between her breasts.<br>
<br>
“I didn’t.” the Shadow Knight said quietly. Seeing the panic rising in Bethany’s eyes, Valkiri added, “A priest brought me back.” <br>
<br>
“Truly the life of a paladin of Marr is a dangerous one.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed it is.” Valkiri reponeded, thinking of the young paladin she had slain on the shores of the Lake of Ill Omen. The rest of the bath was silent, only marked by the sluicing of soap and water and the humming of Bethany as she braided Valkiri’s hair.<br>
<br>
 When the bath was done, Valkiri requested that Bethany bring her meal and some blackburrow stout. <br>
<br>
“I can bring you the meal, but the stout is contraband and not sold here at Crows.” The serving maid said with a practiced air. Platinum briefly flashed through the air between the two women. “But I am sure you will find the house brew to your liking.” Bethany finished with a slight bow.<br>
<br>
Her meal was late getting to her. When it arrived, Bethany was limping slightly. <br>
“I am sorry mistress, there was some trouble in the Kitchen.” Bethany huffed.<br>
<br>
“The problem in the kitchen wear a kilt and answer to the name Ikdun?” Val asked quietly, recalling similar excuses she had made in the past. <br>
<br>
“No maam.” Bethany lied artlessly.<br>
<br>
“Let me give you a piece of advice, in a place like this a knee to the groin will do you better than a knife to the guts.” Valkiri demonstrated a particularly vicious move, learned from a friendly yet inebriated female monk long years ago. “Don’t ever start anything that will result in bladework while you are in the bar, the bouncers might be fat lardassed slobs but they will keep you from getting killed.” Reaching into her pack she brought out a fine steel dagger, a weapon she had pried from the cold fingers of a lizard man outside of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
“This is for trouble that starts outside of the bar, do you understand?” Val handed the girl the weapon. She could tell that Bethany understood her meaning, and the shadowknight thought back on the night that a drunken patron had followed her home, intent on something more than another glass of stout.<br>
After dinner, Valkiri summoned Jabober and put him on guard, no one ever snuck op on Jabober she thought sleepily as she crawled into bed.<br>
<br>
She awoke with a start, Jabober was cackling wildly as he pummeled someone in the room. In the morning light she could see that it was a terrified Bethany, breakfast pastries were scattered on the floor.<br>
<br>
“Back off Jabober!” Valkiri ordered, rushing to the girl’s side.<br>
<br>
She was in shock, with a gesture Jabober was dismissed and the girl bundled into the bed.<br>
<br>
“You……your……evil!” Bethany mumbled.<br>
<br>
“I am a Shadow Knight of the League of Shadows, I am what I am.” Valkiri countered.<br>
<br>
“Are you the one who killed Tarragon the ranger?” The barmaid asked breathily.<br>
<br>
Valkiri paused for a moment, “I am but it is more complicated than you know.”<br>
<br>
“Are you going to kill me now?” Bethany asked, Val saw her clutching the dagger defensively.<br>
<br>
“Do I need to?”<br>
<br>
“No milady, I will keep your secret.” Bethany said firmly.<br>
<br>
“See that you do, and if you are going to use the knife on someone, use an underhand blow not overhand, its faster.” With that Valkiri left Crows Inn and headed for the Sewers.<br>
<br>
Valkiri was standing naked on the edge of the fountain of blood that was the heart of the temple in Qeynos. She could hear the sound of battle and the roar of the crowd above her, from what she could gather Ikdun was testing the abilities of his rescue team in the arena above. Sragg was standing next to the high priest of Bertox.<br>
<br>
“It has been a while since you reported in.” Sragg growled.<br>
<br>
“I know.”<br>
<br>
“You bear the taint of Innoruk about you.” The priest said turning to face her for the first time. He was afflicted with leprosy, a mark of high favor in the church of entropy. At some time in the past his ears, nose and lips had crumbled to dust. Valkiri knew from looking at him that only the favor of Bertox kept this one alive. Cataracts covered both of his eyes turning them a milky white.<br>
<br>
“I can read your thoughts,” the priest rasped, his tongue withered and dry like an old gnoll scalp. “It is not the favor of Bertox that keeps me here but his fury.” A wracking cough caused more tiny flakes of skin to flutter to the ground. “A long time ago, I used my healing powers on an enemy of the church, I saved the life of a paladin of Marr. The rot came upon me soon afterwards, I reveled in it, thinking it was the blessing of Bertox.” Another cough and a cascade of flakes fell to the ground along with some hair. “This disease won’t kill me, nor can any weapon or spell wielded by mortals, I cannot die, cannot enter the realm of Bertox ever.”<br>
<br>
The priest idly scratched a particularly large buboe on his neck, it split open with a sour pop and pus oozed down his neck and into his vestments already stiffened with caked serum. Valkiri had never seen a more beautiful sight. “I serve him still, in the hope that some day he shall relent in his fury and let me join him.” The priest wheezed the last bit of his tale out ending with a dry rattle.<br>
<br>
“You have evaded the judgement of Bertox.” Sragg said formally. He held a dagger made from some sort of red metal in his right hand. “Will you be excommunicated or shall you face his judgement now?”<br>
<br>
“I will be judged!” Val shouted.<br>
<br>
The touch of the blade on her throat was cold and unforgiving, just the way she liked it. With a sharp grunt, Sragg cut Valkiri’s throat and kicked her into the pool. Once again the female Shadow Knight felt her senses expand. Her blood surrounded her like a cocoon as she thrashed feebly. It took only a moment for her body to strike the bottom of the pool. As consciousness left her images began to flash before her dying eyes. Spartax killing a young Kodiak in the West Commons. Herself harm touching a gnoll-reaver in the Karanas. Opious and Keemodo fighting a sabertooth. Gray standing over her in the Feerot.<br>
<br>
Her perspective shifted, now she could see the priest idly watching the pool and Sragg putting the dagger away. She could hear the cheers as Ikdun led his band of warriors out of the arena and towards Blackburrow. Then she died.<br>
<br>
“The god has taken her.” Sragg said.<br>
<br>
“But will he keep her or return her to us?” Moisture ran freely from the crust rimmed eyes of the priest, tears or clear pus, Sragg could not tell.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the body in the pool twitched spasmodically. Blood flowed into the cut, filling Valkiri’s mouth, throat and lungs. New energy flowed into the body, the red slash in her throat fused shut, while old scars faded away. The surface of the pool bubbled furiously and steam rose from its surface in pink clouds. <br>
<br>
Sragg was startled when a dead white hand with black fingernails gripped the side of the pool. The priest, however, moved with a surety that belied his sightless eyes and with a strength that contradicted his emaciated frame he lifted Valkiri from the pool.<br>
<br>
Both men stood in shock at the vision of beauty that stood before them. Runnells of blood still cascaded lovingly from her bone white hair. The skin held the dead white of a corpse save around the lips and nipples which were the vibrant purple of a fresh bruise, while finger and toe nails were the deep black of an old one. Both men gasped with delight when her eyes snapped open revealing blood red eyes.<br>
<br>
“I have been judged, and found worthy!” Valkiri shouted raising her fists into the air. Energy coursed through her veins, and she could sense the life energy that pulsed in those around her, a flickering nimbus around the priest and a steady glow around the Sragg.<br>
<br>
The priest looked at the pool and realized with horror that the level had dropped by nearly a quarter. The strength of many had gone into this one. It would be months before the pool would return to its former level.<br>
<br>
Sragg was watching Valkiri with a mixture of jealousy, reverence and unbridled lust. As she spoke he thought her incisors looked longer than they had been. He would have the loremasters research the changes that he had seen.<br>
<br>
“You have been forgiven for your healing of the paladin of Marr, but not for your failure to bring the blessing of Bertox to the city of Qeynos.” Valkiri thundered with a voice not her own. “Accomplish this task and you shall be given your long delayed reward.”  <br>
<br>
With that Valkiri collapsed onto the floor.<br>
<br>
“Give her what ever she want to eat when she recovers.” The priest said with a speculative glance at Valkiri’s slack jaw.<br>
<br>
It took only an hour for the knight of entropy to regain her strength from her ordeal. Of course the three neophytes whose life energies she had ripped away would never recover.<br>
<br>
“I have business in Blackburrow.” The shadow knight stated as she strode purposefully out of the temple area.<br>
<br>
‘It does not seem as dark here as it once was’, Valkiri thought idly to herself as she entered the depths of the gnoll fortress, leaving her greater lightstone in its belt pouch. The cavern complex was full of gnolls that cowered in fear at her approach. She paid them little heed. Occasionally she would hear the sound of battle as Ikdun’s group fought their way deeper into the complex, and the corpses of the scrawny gnolls they left behind marked their progress. <br>
<br>
She caught up to them in a large circular room with a pit in its center. Shouts of triumph had been replaced by screams of terror as the party was overwhelmed by a wave of elite gnoll bodyguards and chieftains. She spotted the white fur of a Splitpaw refugee in the mix. She watched calmly as the rest of Ikdun’s band were killed around him. She smiled when Ikdun’s desperate eyes locked onto hers.<br>
<br>
“Help me…” He panted.<br>
<br>
“Of course.” Valkiri responded sweetly as she sucked the life force out of him.<br>
<br>
The stunned gnolls dropped the corpse, impaling it on one of the spikes set in the room. The gnolls in the room circled her growling in their frustration of a kill denied, but none dared to look her in the eye. Jabober cackled mockingly at her side.<br>
<br>
“Who Dares to come between me and my prey!” A powerful voice boomed from around the corner and what she at first thought was an echo of Jabober’s reedy laugh turned out to be the chortle from another skeletal minion. This one stalked in front of the largest gnoll she had ever seen in Blackburrow, its fur bore the same bone white color of her hair and its blood red eyes matched hers.<br>
<br>
“Give me the child now, for your days as the herald of Bertox are at an end.” Valkiri roared back. “Your efforts to keep this powerful blade from the hands of the light bringers has been a miserable failure, yield or die.”<br>
<br>
“Kill the human!” Lord Elgnub commanded imperiously. Only his summoned pet answered the command, the gnolls slinking away into the darkness. <br>
<br>
Valkiri sent Jabober after the gnoll’s undead servant and the crack of bone on bone rattled through the air. Both Elgnub’s and her hands pulsed with dark energies and the two traded harmtouch for harmtouch. Elgnub got the worse of it. The fight was fierce but brief and soon Valkiri stood over the withered husk of the gnoll leader as Jabober destroyed Elgnub’s servant.<br>
<br>
“Are you going to be taking me home?” A small voice asked.<br>
<br>
“Yes, you will be home soon.” Valkiri said as she led the boy out of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
The joy in the father’s eyes at the return of his son was enough to make her ill. But she pretended it was injuries of the fight that made her sick. <br>
<br>
“Give to me the blade you promised to Ikdun.” Valkiri hissed.<br>
<br>
“Of course, this blade has been wielded by many noble warriors all of my bloodline…” Sayer prattled on, as he handed her a longsword. One thing stuck in her mind, he mentioned that the blade was not complete and that it could be made more powerful. She made note of his comments as she placed the blade in her pack. Only by imagining the house on fire and its occupants slaughtered by gnolls enabled Valkiri to endure the hugs and kisses from the grateful parents, and it was with a shudder of revulsion that Valkiri left the Sayer household. <br>
<br>
As she walked towards Qeynos she thought to herself, ‘Fool, your son was destined to wield this blade and drive the gnollish servants of Bertox to ruin. Now the blade is in my hands and its ability to resist disease will be denied those heroes that oppose our will. So it is that your weakness deprives the forces of good of a mighty weapon.’<br>
<br>
Valkiri 32nd season Shadow Knight<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Gray was dreaming. The silk sheets caressed his body gently as he slept. In his dream he saw Valkiri naked standing before a fountain of blood. He grinned in his sleep, rumor of her beauty confirmed. His gaze lingered on the scar between her full breasts, he would have to take care of that mark soon. The tempo of his snores increased as he drifted deeper into the dream. <br>
<br>
Once he returned someone to life, he had a connection to them, the energy that he had channeled restoring their life linked them together long after the obvious effects of the spell dissipated. It was a little known ability that had been used to good effect by many powerful clerics to ensure their position of authority.<br>
<br>
“Ah, she is on her knees now, that’s nice…” his dream self thought. A tall powerfully built figure momentarially blocked his view. ‘That’s not nice,’ he thought to himself, still it took only a moment to change his perspective in the dream.<br>
<br>
He now had a wonderful view of Valkiri’s face caught in one of the most erotic grimaces of lust and pain that he had ever seen. His sleeping form thrashed wildly. His viewpoint moved back a bit, revealing a gaping slash in her throat. The shock nearly woke him up, but he found that he was no longer in control of the dream, if a dream it was.<br>
<br>
The tall figure kicked her corpse into the pool where it sank out of sight. He felt the link that bound Valkiri to him begin to dissapate, he quickly scanned the room, looking for information that could be used to recover the body and identify the killers. He focused on an older looking man wearing ornate robes. Quick as thought he was staring into the sightless eyes of the priest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The god has taken her.” The large figure said behind his dream self. He watched the emaciated and decayed face scrunch up, it took a moment for him to realize that it would be a smile if the face had been intact.<br>
<br>
“But will he keep her or return her to us?” The priest murmured. Moisture ran freely from the crust rimmed eyes of the priest, tears or clear pus, Gray could not tell.<br>
<br>
Suddenly those milk white, disease encrusted eyes seemed to lock onto his dream self. Behind him he could hear the pool bubbling furiously and a pink mist began to fill the air.<br>
<br>
‘Know this, mortal!’ a voice thundered in his ears. ‘You are high in our favor for the role you have played in defeating the cause of good. Do not overstep your bounds, this one belongs to Me!’ Gray’s sleeping body began to spasm and cough in the bed. The priest of Innoruk realized that his body was unable to breathe, yet he was unable to get back to it. If his body died while he was away from it, he would be lost, cursed to wander as a ghost. He summoned his formidable will to free himself before his body died. Suddenly the barrier that held him to the temple broke, and he sped away as quickly as he could, stealing a last glimpse of Valkiri as she exited the pool. ‘This is not the same woman!’ He thought to himself.<br>
<br>
Runnells of blood still cascaded lovingly from her bone white hair. Her hair had been light blond. The skin held the dead white of a corpse save around the lips and nipples which were the vibrant purple of a fresh bruise, while finger and toe nails were the deep black of an old one. He recalled healthy peach color. He had seen something similar in Mistmoore or was it on Luclin. Gray had trouble concentrating as his body began to shut down. <br>
<br>
He quickly poured his consciousness back into his quaking body. Sitting up he began to cough up blood, the sheets were soaked in it and he feebly flopped out of bed onto the floor, the movement enabled him to take in a huge shuddering breath, which he promptly lost as he began to Vomit copious amounts of blood onto the floor. His body was racked by pain. Below him he could hear his servants rushing about in a panic. <br>
<br>
‘Tonight was a good night to sleep alone,’ he thought idly as he concentrated on a healing spell.<br>
<br>
“Have someone clean up this mess immediately!” Gray ordered in a voice like stone, as his servants rushed into the room, fear on their faces. “And have the maid servants prepare my bath.” He knew his servants would do as ordered and keep the events of this evening to themselves. ‘I think, after the bath, some time in the library.’ He thought to himself as he stalked down the hall.<br>
<br>
“Your services are requested once again.” Gray ordered Valkiri. ‘She has indeed changed,’ Gray thought to himself. The body may have changed somewhat, (he wondered if the scar was still between her breasts) but the flicker of excitement still gleamed in her eyes. She was crouched on her knees in front of him as she had been earlier when he had threatened to take her head, and again when her throat had been cut and cast into the pool.<br>
<br>
“Who do you want me to kill?’ Valkiri said breathily. The flicker of excitement replaced by a steady glow of energy.<br>
<br>
“You will do something more difficult than simple killing…you are to lead a third of our forces during our attack on the Tower of Frozen Shadow, you must keep them alive until we reach the wedding.” Gray watched carefully for a reaction.<br>
<br>
“I cannot accept this honor. The last time I was given an order to protect a member of the league I failed miserably.” Valkiri said flatly. She remembered well that battle, placed in Sarhea’s bodyguard, a brutal fight, a flash of light and it was over, her ward dead. It did not matter that a paladin and a ranger had fallen to her during the battle, she had failed in her primary duty.<br>
<br>
“We all failed in that battle.” Gray said quietly, he too carried scars from that fight. “We underestimated the hatred the other Iksar have for Gore, we shall not make that mistake again.”<br>
<br>
“I will lead if the others will follow, your word shall be my law.” Valkiri said firmly.<br>
<br>
“Be at the tower then in one week, I shall have your team selected then.”<br>
<br>
“As you wish my lord.” Valkiri stood fluidly and strode to the door. She looked back to see Gray busy at his large mahogany desk. <br>
<br>
As soon as he heard her footsteps descending the stairs, Gray took a musty old scroll out of the desk. It was in the Old Erudian script from before the civil war, but it looked to be a translation from Teir Dal. In it certain lost rites were described, one of which detailed a ritual that involved immersion in blood. Several places had been named in the crumbling document, Qeynos, A Tower of Shadow and one other place. The last word was lost, that part of the scroll decayed beyond repair.<br>
<br>
He knew that the reaction the pool in Quenyos had was beyond the expectations of the Priest of Bertox. It would be a good chance to test the growing skills of League and if the opportunity came to have Valkiri bathe in yet another pool of blood, this time the experiment would be one of his own. He chucked grimly to himself. <br>
<br>
A week later Valkiri was standing in snow that rose to her knees. The metal armor seemed to soak up the cold and transfer it directly to her bones. The pain was delicious. Gray was shouting out names and League members moved quickly to obey his will.<br>
<br>
“Valkiri, you will lead, Spartax, Maladominus, Didi, Slaadya and Xzorsha!”<br>
<br>
She watched as her team gathered quickly and efficiently. Spartax and Slaadya were old companions, Didi she knew from several bouts in the arena, she had died well. Xzorsha was an unknown but her eyes burned with resentment at being ordered to follow a mere human. At least her hate shall keep her warm enough to fight. Maladominus was…well Maladominus, he would be fine as long as his alternate personality didn’t flare up. Valkiri dismissed an image of the leather clad Maladominus charging down a hallway with an oversized dagger between his teeth. <br>
<br>
“Your task will be to keep Sarhea alive!” Gray ordered. He enjoyed the look of shock that flitted across Valkiri’s features. “If any additional creatures attack her group while they are fighting, it shall be your task to handle the problem.”<br>
<br>
Val offered Gray a stiff armed salute by way of acceptance.<br>
<br>
“I will do my best.” The female Shadow Knight said to Sarhea who was busy arranging her group.<br>
<br>
“See that you do!” The female warrior laughed.<br>
<br>
If anyone had been watching the approach of the League from the tower, they would have seen a wave of darkness flow over the snowdrifts towards the entrance. The constructs placed in charge of defending the perimeter proved to be little challenge. With a flicker of energy the League invaded the first floor.<br>
<br>
Pandemonium reigned inside, Shadowbone Skeletons and Gnollish guardians attacked in waves and died like flies. The battle was confusing, it was difficult to lead her forces against the correct target, still her forces did well. Maladominus’ spells blasted the Skeletons into dust, while Spartax, Didi and Xzorsha made short work of any Gnoll foolish enough to attempt to flank Sarhea’s group. Slaadya was able to enter the fray and quell her bloodlust, her capacity as a healer unneeded since the enemies of the League died so quickly.<br>
<br>
Eventually they came to a huge library, ghosts still reading the moldy old tomes. Bloodbringer charged out repeatedly and returned with the spirits stalking her. The fighting was quick and brutal. Magic swirled around the combatants like a poisonous tide. A single misstep and one would be in over their head and drowned.<br>
<br>
It took only a moment, Valkiri was holding her group in reserve as yet another undead librarian descended on Sarhea’s group. It was important that they strike as a unified whole, since they were not as powerful as the group they were protecting. A short howl of rage was the only warning received as Xzorsha was slain by a vengeful spirit. A ghost had attacked on the left flank, rising up from under the floor ripping the life force from the young Teir Dal. Before it could retreat Didi and Spartax both released their black hands. As it writhed in pain Slaadya stunned it with a spell, giving Maladominus time to draw out its remaining energies.<br>
<br>
As her team rushed over to the left flank, Valkiri looked around wildly. The ghosts were becoming cunning, Xzorsha’s death attested to it. A flicker to her right was all the warning she needed. Her Crystallized blade rang as she drew it from the sheath and her shiny brass shield gleamed in the torchlight. Three Students were closing on her position. Her team had been decoyed. Cursing herself for a fool inwardly, while bellowing orders outwardly, Valkiri charged into their midst, hoping to buy enough time for Sarhea’s group to counterattack.<br>
<br>
The human Shadowknight’s blade bit deep into the ethereal flesh of the first student. She could see the surprise in its ghostly eyes as its energy dissipated. A blow from her shield knocked the second one back, but the third reached her, his hand passing through her breastplate, skin and ribcage. A cold hand gripped her heart, she felt the delicious languor of death spreading throughout her body. Her sword fell with jagged clatter to the ground as she brought her hand up and caressed the side of the students face.<br>
<br>
The power of the black hand drove the ghost back. Her team as well as Sarhea’s was shoring up the flank, but they would not get to her in time. Back in Qeynos the high priest of Bertox had impressed upon her the importance of not being raised by priests who were not followers of the plague bearer. Valkiri carefully, and with some dissapointment, gathered the fatal damage that lingered within her chest and forced it to the surface of her body. A roaring in her ears, much like the one she got from releasing the Black Hand was the only obvious indication that she was casting a powerful spell.<br>
<br>
The Teir Dal dancers of the Maiden’s Fancy had often referred to experiencing the “little death” with some of their more talented customers. A similar wave of extasy washed over Valkiri as her heart stopped and she crumpled to the ground with a groan. This time her spirit remained caged in her body. The ghosts paused in their attack and circled her body curiously. The ghost on her right was caught up in a barrage of eldritch energy so intense the stone melted underneath it. The second one was unable to cast a fresh spell as Opious, Maladominus, Slaadya, Sarhea, Spartax, and Antoin fell upon it in a storm of whrling blades. In a moment all that remained was its homework that fluttered to the ground.<br>
<br>
Dissapointment flashed momentarially in Gray’s eyes when Valkiri stood up and dusted herself off. Still he had Xzorsha to work on and he set to the task of restoring her with a will.<br>
<br>
Valkiri watched him closely as the spell was cast and energy flashed back into the fallen Teir Dal’s body. This triggered a memory, or was it a dream she was not sure, but an image of Gray standing in the temple of Bertox in Qeynos popped into her head.<br>
<br>
The League continued their assault on the tower, animated suits of Armor, and undead household staff were dragged to their death by Juonar. Didi squeeled with delight as he brought her victim after victim. <br>
<br>
After a particularly long fight, Spartax suddenly bellowed. “I grow in Power! I feel the Blessings of Innoruk!”<br>
<br>
A few battles later Didi echoed his cry.<br>
<br>
It did not take long for the denizens of the tower of frozen shadow to cease to resist the League and Juonar led them through yet another portal where the danger increased yet again.<br>
<br>
Ghostly voices began to be heard, their presence seemed to agitate Shintou immensely, he collapsed to the ground trembling. A strong voice spoke of honor, loyalty and betrayal. Challenges were made and accepted and on this day the fate of the League was set in a new direction. <br>
<br>
Invisible enemies attacked from every direction and all three groups were hard pressed to control the situation. Shintou attacked furiously, drowning out the tormenting voice with the shrieks of the fallen. In a particularly confused battle, Valkiri lost track of Maladominus, she knew he was meditating behind her his spellcraft having made the difference in more than one battle. They were fighting in a very enclosed space with the casters behind them safely tucked away in an alcove. Suddenly she heard a shout behind her.<br>
<br>
“Arrrrggggg!” Maladominus bellowed.<br>
<br>
Dreading the return of the pirate persona that had dogged the little necromancer since his accident in the Rathe Mountains, Valkiri turned, hoping to bash some quick sense into him with her shield, before he ran off to find some booty. She found a huge pulsating mass of goo greedily absorbing the body of the gnome. What she had thought was the return of the pirate personality had in fact been a death scream.<br>
<br>
“Die!” the female Shadow Knight yelled, energy rippling the length of her blade as it slashed into the sticky mass. The cascade of physical and mystical energy that descended on the goo was truly impressive as the entire League force directed its wrath towards the assassin, it simply boiled away into an orange vapor, leaving the slightly singed corpse of the gnome behind, curled up in a ball.<br>
<br>
“He is mine,” Slaadya hissed at one of the other League healers who had begun the rituals of restoration. <br>
<br>
For the first time Valkiri detected something other than altruism in the eyes of the healers, and she wondered if these clerics got something in return from their gods for restoring the dead. Until her second bath in the bloodpool in Qeynos, she had often felt that Gray had been watching her, but she had put the thought off to simple confusion over his motives for bringing her back from the embrace of the void.<br>
<br>
“Thank you Slaadya.” Maladominus said, as he stood back up, his eyes still had the flicker of eldritch energies, a remainder of the spell that had restored him. Valkiri turned her gaze to Slaadya whose eyes seemed, for a moment, to flicker similarly, but it could have been from the magics of the battle raging around them. Before she had time to think on it more, she had to summon her team for the final assault on the wedding itself.<br>
<br>
It appeared that someone had taken offense at the marriage and slain the guests, who still stood in an appearance of readiness. Their ornate clothing and decorations had long since moldered away to rags. Once again Juonar distracted the inhabitants of the tower and led them to their doom, the battle picked up, first the ushers, then the guests and finally the wedding party themselves. Once again the mysterious voice murmured in their collective ears, telling a tale of anger and betrayal, Mayong Mistmoore’s reach was indeed long to stretch across the sea from Faydwer to the frozen wastes of Velious. The wedding was over, of course it had been over for centuries but now the energy that bound the guests to their aborted ritual had been dissolved by the power of the League.<br>
<br>
As the League carefully entered the chapel where the wedding was taking place Valkiri noticed Gray watching her carefully. As she walked down the isle, sword bared and shield braced for battle, she thought herself the most unlikely of brides. There would be no groom waiting for her at the end of the isle. As she passed the last set of pews she saw a shimmer of red behind the altar. Her careful walk became a stumbling run. There, behind the altar to some nameless god lay a pool. It was a pool of blood. The similarities between the one in Qeynos and here were unmistakable. Many League members had unceremoniously plunged into the pool to celebrate their victory. To her left Squishems and Snappy frolicked, happily splashing Juonar who was watching Cellestia do a very bad froglock imitation.<br>
<br>
Grays eyes did not betray his ire at his experiment being thwarted by his followers. They had more than earned their victory. <br>
<br>
“Its time to return to Antonica! We have done well, let this display of our power serve as a warning to those who lack the wit to fear us!” Gray shouted. A soft chuckle seemed to fill the air in the chapel, but it could have been a noise from the blood pool as the League exited it, causing the liquid to slosh about wildly. The League left the tower in the same order they had entered it. Main assault force, Sarhea’s battle group and finally Valkiri’s bodyguard. As the last of Sarhea’s group left the tower, Valkiri approached the pool. Once again the surface was placid, unmarred by waves, and looking down Valkiri saw a reflection in the water. It was herself and yet not quite the woman who stood before the pool. She kneeled down at the side and tentatively began to reach down towards the surface, the reflection in the pool smiled back and also reached towards her. The shadowknight’s fingertip broke the surface of the pool and energy coursed into her body. A feral grunt passed her lips as she felt power flow into her body. A vision of impaled corpses and dancing figures began to swim before her, she had never been to this place but knew it by sight, Kelethin.<br>
<br>
“They are coming back!” Slaadya screeched, raising her hammer.<br>
<br>
“Time to go!” Spartax barked, grabbing Valkiri and dragging her away from the pool forcibly. Energy burned his hands, much like his Vampiric Embrace spell did to his enemies during battle. He ignored the pain and dragged the semi conscious human from the pool. The group pounded down the hall towards the gateway, behind them a wave of restored wedding guests howled for their blood.<br>
<br>
“Arg, what did the missy do at the pool!” Maladominus asked in the throaty brogue of his pirate persona.<br>
<br>
“I know not, but only a fool would stick around to find out.” Xzorsha hissed, pelting past the shorter legged gnome and leaping through the gate.<br>
<br>
“Aye, that be the truth of it.” Mal growled as he threw himself through the portal. <br>
<br>
“Push her through!” Spartax ordered, turning to exchange a quick flurry of blows with the Ushers.<br>
<br>
Didi and Slaayda groaned with effort as they unceremoniously shoved the human female out the gate.<br>
<br>
“Why do I always end up dragging some stupid human out of a nightmare.” Slaadya grunted.<br>
<br>
“Well, I think it has something to do with the fact that she has all the loot.” Didi chortled as Valkiri vanished.<br>
<br>
The three of them jumped through the gate together barely escaping the talons of the undead. They milled around the portal for a bit then returned to their own positions, waiting expectantly for a wedding that would never happen.<br>
<br>
A tall female Dark Elf shimmered into view. “Dammit, Gray was right!” Celestia hissed as she entered the gate, eager to be gone from the tower and its pulsating pool of blood.<br>
<br>
Valkiri 33rd Season Shadow knight<br>
<br>
“They never realized the true reason for the raid my love.” Valdria murmured in Gray’s ear as he hunched over his desk.<br>
<br>
Gray grunted non-committally and continued to carefully scribe notes on an elf hide scroll.<br>
<br>
“Break up a wedding that was stopped centuries ago, how laughable.” A truly enticing giggle ended the sentence as Valdria moved around to the front of the desk. She had dressed to impress this night, a spiderfur robe artfully tied looked ready to slide off her muscular body at the slightest twitch of the shoulder. Underneath was a harness of some sort, made from soft yet durable spider silk, Gray caught all too brief glimpses of it as the tried to work.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure I have translated this correctly?” Gray said pointing once again to an ancient scroll.<br>
<br>
“Hmm…let me see…” Valdria leaned over the front of the desk, the robe loosing yet more of its already precarious purchase on the Teir Dal’s shapely shoulders.<br>
<br>
A slight trembling of the quill that Gray held was the only indication of agitation that he betrayed. Valdria was more than a passing fancy, her capacity for love only being exceeded by her ability to kill. He knew that behind the quite attractive robe and harness lay a supple…an intellect that rivaled his own for capacity to plan and scheme, what had started out as an effort to keep your friends close and your rivals closer had developed into something more…permanent.<br>
<br>
“You got it right.” She said with quiet certainty. She leaned back, twitching the robe closed, with an evil grin. <br>
<br>
“Was this the only scroll the only one there?” Gray asked, attempting to hide his curiosity at the svelt contraption that clung to Valdria, hidden carefully under the robe. <br>
<br>
“Do you question my competence?” Valdria said testily. “Per your instructions, I snuck away from the raiding party, and as Bloodbringer cleared the isles of ghostly students, teachers and librarians, I searched the stacks for the information you requested.”<br>
<br>
“No one saw you?” Gray said distractedly as he ruffled the quill along the back of Valdria’s neck. The feather raising delicate goosebumps.<br>
<br>
“Please, not even Kyri could be as stealthy as I, especially when I cast invisibility on myself.” The grin on her face, revealed the half-serious nature of her response.<br>
<br>
“You didn’t take anything else from the stacks, did you?” Gray moved the feather to Valdria’s ear, causing it to twitch maddeningly.<br>
<br>
“Well maybe a little something, next to the scroll you wanted, Concerning Heralds, Avatars and the end of the Age, I found a rather impressively illustrated tome. Valdria sauntered over to a small end table. “Ah yes, here it is, The Art of Love and Death. An original copy by Silvershade Shadowbliss. I hear she was quite the skilled courtesan and assassin when she walked the earth.” <br>
<br>
She smiled like a cat preparing to spring upon a confused mouse. “You know it took me a while to figure out why both were together.”<br>
<br>
The feather was definitely shaking visibly now. Gray began to sweat profusely and an odd fixed grin was on his bearded face. “The illustrated version?” he said with a slight squeak in his voice.<br>
<br>
“Indeed,” she said, carefully opening the book to a gorgeously illustrated page, it depicted a very comely Teir Dal female in some sort of a harness that gave her 8 legs. She was suspended in a web where an equally comely male Teir dal was ensnared, the picture left very little to the imagination.<br>
<br>
“Well I suppose I could take a break from work for a little while…” Gray said hastily.<br>
<br>
‘He has suffered enough behind that desk, now he can go to work somewhere else,’ Valdria thought to herself. The mechanical arms had been laboriously assembled by Maladominus and keeping him in the dark about their actual purpose had been an effort in and of itself. With a quiet whir the four extra arms drew the robe off her body, it slithered to the floor with barely a ripple.<br>
<br>
“Why were they together?” Gray said, in the midst of a clatter of armor as it fell to the floor in a cascade of steel.<br>
<br>
A metal claw flicked out to gently assist him with the last piece of steel.<br>
<br>
“Both books had the same owner, they were on loan.” Valdria said walking behind him and gently caressing Gray’s back with all of her hands, Teir Dal and Spider claw.<br>
<br>
“Who was the original owner?” Gray said the strain in his voice readily apparent.<br>
<br>
“Who else,” She whispered in his ear. “Mayong Mistmoore.”<br>
<br>
Gray’s brain tried to focus on this last piece of information, but he was  too far gone, it would have to wait till later…much later…<br>
<br>
The following is a copy of a letter found in the archives of the Temple of Bertoxulous in Qeynos. It was apparently written by Valkiri Blackhand, Scourge of Qeynos, and Herald of Bertoxulous (may her name be praised). Chroniclers of the Plague god place this letter about a decade before her assault on the planes and a few months after the attributes that marked her as the true herald of the plague god began to manifest themselves. <br>
<br>
My Lord Sragg, <br>
<br>
I am writing to you to report on events in Mistmoore Castle. Last week the League assaulted the fortress, such was our might that Thrads, a servant of the vampire lord, begged us to stop the slaughter, our leaders all too readily agreed. As it turns out Valdria is related in some way, either by blood or flesh, (possibly both) with Mayong. There is also a child that carries vampirism loose in the world, only the self sacrifice of Shintou enabled this creature to come into the world, something I believe would be worth studying. As the climax to a long day of battle, Lord Gray and Valdria were wed, with each drinking deeply of the others blood. It was a beautiful ceremony. I have noticed some subtle changes in the appearance of the League leader. It would appear that Innoruk still grants him magics so I doubt the degree of his enslavement.<br>
<br>
Ps. I require assistance, I am having difficulty in procuring the correct toxins to keep my flesh and blood poisonous to all creatures. Maladominus has been busy on some hair brained project involving mechanical spiderlings and been unable to share his contacts with me on Velious.<br>
<br>
Valkiri<br>
<br>
The following letter is a companion to the first and is also from the temple library.<br>
<br>
Valkiri,<br>
<br>
We hear from you so infrequently, you really should visit more often. We are working on a new plague that has a 60 percent mortality rate and causes hair loss in the survivors.<br>
<br>
As you know, our high priest has been researching diligently concerning the physical transformation which took place in our temple. He urges me to have you come home where you can be examined more closely. He is aware of your second immersion in the bloodpool in the tower of frozen shadow. <br>
<br>
It is recommended that you continue your association with the League of Shadows, but remain outside the reach of Mayong. He is not a god, and not worthy of the worship that is given to him by those he binds to his will. A small group of Bertoxolous followers see Mistmoore as an abomination, an affront to the will of the god. I must assure you this is not the case, one would be hard put to find a better agent of decay, disease and death in Norrath. Weather he be a willing or unwilling agent of the god is at this point unknown and we seek to find out all we can concerning his activities. We do know that Tserrina received a great deal of indirect aid in her initial research from the church, who sought to supplant the influence of Innoruk and replace it with that of Bertoxolous. That effort was in many ways a tremendous failure, but the fact remains that there are now two powers contesting for the souls of the Teir Dal. <br>
<br>
We shall search for this child, our own studies in the field of Vampirism have met with mixed results. While your current condition may resemble a primary stage carrier of the disease, (and a tremendous blessing that would be) this is not the case. Vampirism and Lycanthropy are two of the mightiest magical diseases currently at work on Norrath and are undoubtedly signs of the god’s power, the latter is spreading particularly well in Highpass, while the former seems rooted in Faydwer and oddly enough on the Moon, we are still researching this latest information, it could be that there are separate strains of the disease. I urge you to keep your eyes open for a particular document, ‘Concerning Heralds, Avatars and the end of the Age’ the high priest believes that some clue to your current condition will be found therein. <br>
<br>
Your efforts to continue preparing your body to be a vessel of disease and poison are to be applauded. Be assured any being, living or dead which feats upon your corpse will be discussing theology directly with the god within a week. I am including some additional herbs and toxins along with this letter, although I suspect that your recent immersions have altered your body sufficiently that you no longer require external stimuli to keep your toxicity level up.<br>
<br>
Sragg,<br>
<br>
It is ironic that nearly twenty years to the day this letter was written, Valkiri slew Sragg and assumed leadership of the Temple of Bertoxolous. Very little information concerning the League of Shadows is available in the temple records, due to the systematic purges (May her name be praised) that took place following the fall of Sragg.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Someone is killing our new recruits!” Sragg thundered, slamming an armored fist onto the stone table before him. Sparks flew from the impact. <br>
<br>
“There are always more, it is the way of entropy that even the mightiest are brought into the embrace of death, in time some of their best shall serve us, even now a certain high ranking Paladin is our tool, the blood to be shed restoring a fallen empire will only be exceeded by the rivers of blood that shall flow when this New Combine Empire crumbles into dust.” The comments came from a young priest of the plague bringer, scarcely fifteen seasons passed in the god’s service, yet he presumed to lecture his betters.<br>
<br>
“Do not babble about things you know nothing about.” Sragg said, backhanding the young priest with his gauntleted fist. There was a wet pop as the priests jaw shattered.<br>
<br>
“No healing for this one, lest you share his punishment.” Wheezed the high priest of the god, taken aback by the total lack of discipline within his side of the church. “Next time you will keep your mouth closed and your mind open.” The elder said to the younger. Blood, teeth and bone fragments poured from the younger man’s shattered face, when he healed a deformed jaw and scarred face would mark him forever, such was the blessing of the god.<br>
<br>
“Something must be done, the forces of Paineel swell and the gnomes of Akanon take pleasure in their revels, new strength making the mines of malfunction an enviable example of rot and decay.” Sragg said, idly wiping his gauntlet on his tabard.<br>
<br>
“It is as you said, here we are actively opposed by many, Surefall, Qeynos and Hallas are all hostile to our efforts. Our only allies are the dimwitted gnolls.” The priest muttered.<br>
<br>
“I have sent for her.” Sragg sighed.<br>
<br>
“I pray she find some worthy of her time.”<br>
<br>
Valkiri stood motionless near the gate to Qeynos. Around her young recruits to all the professions available in this part of the world engaged in a riot. It could not be called battle, the flailing of limbs, the ineffectual kicks and fizzling spells, it was chaos in its purest form, bodies of slain monsters and would be heroes littered the ground.<br>
<br>
One young priest in particular caught her eye. His eyes were jaundiced and he licked his cracked lips feverishly as he lay upon the ground. The festering bite on his shoulder told the tale of a rabid wolf, and the slashes in his back attested to a near escape from the wrath of Holly Windstalker.<br>
<br>
“Look its that fool, Maygrot!” A young paladin laughed, pointing to the stricken priest.<br>
<br>
“You mean Maygrot the Maggot!.” a priestess of Marr said, forgetting for the moment the teachings of her god. Both were radiant examples of the followers of that particular diety. Clean limbed, shining haired and fair of face, how Valkiri longed to mar their beauty, but the guards were close, and while she could possibly slay one, more than that would be a gamble.<br>
<br>
“He got what he deserved, a slow death by rabies.” A Ranger of the same season hissed, “Killing the spawn of Mammoth the Bear,” <br>
<br>
“I relish this disease that has visited me.” Maygrot hissed with a voice made scratchy with dried foam. “The bear was nearly dead from the disease before I got to him, I nearly had to shove my arm down his throat to get bit.”<br>
<br>
“You will pay for that!” the young ranger barked. Slapping the acolyte in the face.<br>
As the hand swept towards him Maygrot opened his mouth wide and with a throaty growl he bit down on the ranger’s hand. A look of intense delight shone in the fevered eyes of Maygrot even as the burning hatred in the ranger’s drained away, to be replaced by horror.<br>
<br>
“Scum!” the paladin howled, as he kicked Maygrot off the horrified ranger. “Be glad that you are dying, and not worthy of my blade!” The tarnished long sword quivered with its wielders anger.<br>
<br>
“Hurry, its not too late we can get you to the temple!” the priestess babbled, dragging the ranger away from the gate.<br>
<br>
“You have done well.” Valkiri said quietly, leaving her hidden position near the gate. She lifted the dying priest in her arms and kissed his bloodied mouth hungrily. The taste of blood, puss and dried spit filled her mouth like the stench of a rotting corpse filled a tomb.<br>
<br>
One of the gate guards leaned over and vomited copiously onto the ground near his post. The other looked studiously in the other direction.<br>
<br>
“Bertox thanks you for your donation.” The female shadow knight said as she swept through the gate past the gagging guard. It was little effort to carry the emaciated acolyte to Crows, where her usual room awaited her. <br>
<br>
Bethany the barmaid had nearly fainted in fright when she had returned to the bar. Valkiri could tell by the surprise that flashed across her face that the barmaid had done everything she could to forget that awful morning when she discovered that it was not a paladin of Marr that she served but a Knight of the plague bringer.<br>
<br>
“Are you here to escort me to the god?” Maygrot asked deliriously as she placed him on the bed. Despite his diseased state, Valkiri could tell that an entirely different kind of fire now burned in the acolyte. <br>
<br>
“That kind of activity would kill you,” the shadow knight said throatily. “You are not yet worthy to see the god.” She thought it odd that many months later she would echo the words Sragg gave her as she left Qeynos following her second immersion into the blood pool.<br>
<br>
Chanting a quick spell, she shared some of her considerable energy, stolen from hundreds of living (and not a few dead) beings. The merest dip in her strength served to fully restore Maygrot to health, or what passed for it amongst the followers of the plague god.<br>
<br>
A short rap on the door signaled the arrival of Bethany and the sumptuous feast Valkiri had ordered. The dagger on the barmaid’s hip had seen some use, and for that Valkiri was glad.<br>
<br>
“Shall I prepare another bath?” Bethany asked tentatively.<br>
<br>
“Just bring the water, I shall handle the rest.”<br>
<br>
With a relieved sigh, Bethany backed out of the room. Behind her she could hear the acolyte wolfing down the food, he was taking bites out of everything at once, being too eager to try everything. The result was inevitable, and Valkiri had the pot ready for the cascade of bile and half digested food that spewed forth from the young priest.<br>
<br>
“Gluttony is not one of our vices, eat moderately, regain your strength, there is much I would learn from you.”<br>
<br>
“What would you know?” Maygrot said between much smaller bites, interspersed with sips of black burrow stout.<br>
<br>
“Where are your brothers and sisters, I found you alone of all the new recruits.”<br>
<br>
“Something is killing us, on the way to the temple, the route through the arena is cut off to us, most of the new recruits are too weak to survive the journey through the secret passage to make it back to the temple.” Maygrot punctuated the last with a satisfied burp.<br>
<br>
Another rap on the door, and Valkiri bade Bethany enter to remove the dinner trays, but instead of a barmaid, a gnome in black robes entered.<br>
<br>
“Maladominus!” Valkiri blurted in her happiness.<br>
<br>
The gnome entered the room with a stately waddle and after tentatively swirling the water around with his fingers, clambered into the copper tub. The ornate black robes discarded in a pile by the door.<br>
<br>
“I hate wading through that darn sewer!” the gnome necromancer said with considerable venom. The tub was made to fit Barbarians and it took a lot of work to fill. Maladominus bobbed contentedly, occasionally spluttering as bathwater got into his nose. “Care to join me?” he asked wiggling his ears at Valkiri.<br>
<br>
“Not at this time,” the shadow knight said with a smile. The gnome had stripped off and hopped into the tub so swiftly she had no chance to see his “tinkers hammer.”<br>
<br>
“Your loss.” The necromancer said with some disappointment, slapping some water towards her.<br>
<br>
“What brings you to Qeynos, other than my bath?” <br>
<br>
“I heard from my sources that there was trouble afoot in Qeynos.” He picked up the long handled brush and held it out to Valkiri, a wicked grin on his face.<br>
<br>
“You got that right, this is the only one I was able to save.” She pointedly declined to take Mal up on his offer to scrub his back. <br>
<br>
“I have four more back in my house. When I heard you were in town, I decided to look for you. None of mine have any idea what is going on.” <br>
<br>
As he finished speaking Bethany entered the room. She took the offered brush from the grinning gnome without comment and began to scrub furiously. Foam and gnome swirled wildly around the oversized tub, and the gnomes wild cackles of glee were sometimes interrupted suddenly as he was sucked under the surface of the water, but he always bobbed back to the surface with a giggle. Eventually a very bedraggled gnome hopped out of the tub and into a robe held carefully in front of Valkiri by Bethany.<br>
<br>
“Be sure to leave her a little something extra for her good service!” Maladominus said loudly as a slightly flushed Bethany left the room. As soon as she was out of earshot the necromancer was all business. <br>
<br>
“What do you know young one?” he asked the acolyte with a voice like cracking ice.<br>
<br>
Stepping in for Maygrot who was still in shock at the gnomes sudden change in attitude, Valkir answered. “Someone, or something has been ambushing the new recruits as they travel through the arena.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think it would be the Iron Warriors,” Maladominus said, unceremoniously kicking the acolyte out of the bed and onto the floor. He snuggled deep into the covers and began to pick through the food, flicking choice morsels into his mouth. <br>
<br>
“I am thinking we might be able to find out.” Valkiri said with a nod towards Maygrot.<br>
<br>
“You are going to use me for bait?” the acolyte said excitedly.<br>
<br>
“Exactly…”<br>
<br>
Valkiri may have eclipsed Maladominus in power but she knew she would never surpass the gnome in ruthless cunning; after all he had taken an unwitting barmaid at Crow’s and molded events to turn her into the herald of Bertoxulous. <br>
<br>
“How do you know the recruits are dying in the arena?” the necromancer asked pointedly.<br>
<br>
“I don’t for sure, I have never gone that way, I like the run through the sewers…” Maygrot said shyly.<br>
<br>
“Why don’t you escort Maygrot back to your house Mal and we can stake out the arena tomorrow morning?” Valkiri said wearily as she gulped down the dregs of her Blackburrow Stout.<br>
<br>
Maladominus looked at her suspiciously, “Got company coming over?”<br>
<br>
“No, I keep having dreams of Kelethin, I haven’t slept well in a month or two.<br>
<br>
“I can see how having dreams about those tree elves would be disturbing.” He replied with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
“The dreams are actually quite pleasant, the forest is burning and dead elves, High, Wood and Teir Dal litter the forest floor like multicolored leaves.”<br>
<br>
“Anyone you know in the dream?” Maygrot asked quietly.<br>
<br>
“Shintou, or someone who resembles him, sometimes it’s a male Teir Dal, sometimes a male Wood elf, they always have his face.<br>
<br>
“Just what the League needs, another female pining after that cranky Teir Dal.” Maladominus said, collecting his things and nudging Maygrot towards the door.<br>
<br>
“You know I only have eyes for you, Pooky!” Valkiri said swatting the gnome on the bottom as he scuttled through the door. “I will meet you tomorrow at your shop.”<br>
<br>
The following morning found an invisible Valkiri standing near the merchants where she could see the entrance to the arena. From where she was standing the top of Maladominus’ bald head was barely visible. He had positioned himself inside the guild house of the Steel Warriors on the stone balcony that overlooked the arena. His pet Jobaner rested in one of the corners of the arena looking like one of many piles of bone that littered the floor of the arena. The two League members had arrived before dawn and the gnome had laboriously scried the area looking for hidden and invisible foes, before crossing into the guild house and completing his search there. He had found nothing.<br>
<br>
Valkiri scanned the area with the eyes of the dead, seeing nothing of note, other than a few rogues picking the pockets of the local constabulary and one bard bursting, invisible, out of a window a few steps ahead of an angry and visibly confused husband. In the distance she could hear the clock tower ring the time, ten bells, time for Maygrot to make his run to the arena.<br>
<br>
After a moment of nervousness since they did not have anyone they trusted to guard the acolyte from Maladominus’ shop, she saw Maygrot approaching. He was not alone. Twenty paces behind the young priest stalked the Ranger from the day before; at his side was the young paladin. <br>
<br>
‘It can’t be these puppies…’ Val thought to herself.<br>
<br>
“Where are you going?” hissed the ranger as they caught up to the acolyte of Bertox.<br>
<br>
“Home.”<br>
<br>
“The only place that’s fit for the likes of you is the sewers, plague bringer!” growled the paladin.<br>
<br>
“Leave me alone.” The priest said as he turned to enter the arena. He walked quickly towards the ramp that led to the cages where they kept the beasts for the gladiatorial combats.<br>
<br>
The two light bringers stopped and watched the acolyte enter the arena.<br>
<br>
“He is mine.” The ranger said, quickly fitting an arrow to the bow as he darted through the shadows.<br>
<br>
Valkiri clung to his back like the tattered cloak the ranger wore. She would never attempt such a feat with an experienced ranger, but this pup was too busy lining up a shot on the acolytes back with his hunting bow to pay attention to anything else.<br>
<br>
“Acolyte! Prepare to meet your god!” the ranger howled drawing the arrow to his cheek.<br>
<br>
Maygrot spun around, a look of triumph on his face as Jobaner rose from the bloodstained earth and rushed towards the ranger.<br>
<br>
“Hold your shaft, so called Ranger, where is the honor of the hunt?” Jobaner intoned with a voice that sounded suspiciously like Maladominus shouting into a funnel.<br>
<br>
“In Marr’s name! A talking Skeleton!” the paladin blurted from the entrance to the arena.<br>
<br>
“I was once a mighty ranger myself, but I allowed the lust for the hunt to overwhelm my better judgment.” The skeleton intoned mournfully. “You efforts are better suited towards the gnolls of Blackburrow and the Icy Orcs of Everfrost, do not make the mistake I made!” It’s warning delivered from beyond the grave the skeleton collapsed in upon itself.<br>
<br>
“Come on Mosak.” The paladin said from the edge of the arena.<br>
<br>
“Be glad this day that your life has been spared!” The ranger hissed with considerable venom. He removed the arrow from the string and snapped it in half. Casting the shattered arrow at Maygrot he hissed, “I give your pitiful life back to you, make better choices with this gift.” The two left the arena without looking back. Valkiri lingered at the entrance to the arena for a moment or two watching as they walked into the city proper. As she prepared to return to her post a voice thundered from inside the arena.<br>
<br>
“It will take more than some street theatre to save your miserable life acolyte!” The air rippled in the arena. A tall barbarian shaman stood blocking the exit. “You shall now face the judgment of the tribunal!”<br>
<br>
A series of harsh guttural syllables flowed like an avalanche from the lips of the shaman. There was a bright flash of light and Maygrot was struck blind. Jobaner rose from his place of rest and charged the shaman. Half way across the blood stained floor a huge wolf appeared and closed on the skeleton with a howl of rage.<br>
<br>
“He must have slipped in while we were watching the others!” Jobaner shouted, now there was no mistaking the voice of the gnome necromancer. Valkiri quickly scanned the area looking for more attackers as Maladominus rushed out of the warrior’s guild and down the ramp.<br>
<br>
“Mal, Look Out!” Valkiri shouted as a second barbarian appeared behind the gnome.<br>
<br>
“Taste some of your own bitter brew!” roared the second barbarian, plunging a serrated dagger deep into the necromancers back, even as the gnome tucked and rolled down the ramp to get away from his attacker.<br>
<br>
Valkiri charged into the arena proper and placed herself between Maygrot and the shaman. The wolf was making short work of Maladominus’ skeleton, that fight would not last much longer. Valkiri smiled grimly as the shaman approached the stumbling acolyte completely unaware that she was there. Both the gnome and the barbarian rouge had hidden themselves one using skill the other magic, both were visible to Valkiri with her eyes of the dead. <br>
<br>
“You scream like a woman!” Growled the shaman as he approached the blind acolyte.<br>
<br>
“So do you!” Valkiri hissed as she plunged the Soulfiend lance into his side. The spear shaft shuddered as it greedily began to suck the life out of the shaman and give it to her. A short grunt of pain was the only response the Barbarian gave as he pulled himself off the tip of the spear and slammed the shadow knight back with a meaty fist.<br>
<br>
Both began to cast spells, Valkiri was marginally quicker and her darkness spell enveloped the shaman, that would be the last swift action she would make for the rest of the battle, magic surrounded her making movement slow and painful. Both combatants backed away from each other and began to trade debilitating spells, the shaman acted out of a desire to stay away from the Soulfiend and Valkiri had to protect Maygrot from the wolf which had finally put an end to Maladominus’ skeleton. <br>
<br>
“Duck!” Valkiri ordered the acolyte who immediately fell to the hard packed ground. His movement was barely in time to avoid the lunge of the wolf, which found itself impaled on Valkiri’s lance. A quick glance revealed the rogue and Maladominus in a deadly game of cat and mouse, with the gnome shadow stepping and casting a disease or poison spell and trying to escape before the rogue caught up to him, both were too intent on the other to interfere in Valkiri’s fight.<br>
<br>
A crushing blow from a gigantic two-handed hammer knocked the Soul fiend out of her hand. Screaming a powerful war chant the shaman followed up with a backhand that knocked her sprawling. Desperate the shadow knight reached out, up, under the armored kilt of the shaman. Her darkforge gauntlet crushed what she found there with all the strength and desperation that she could summon.<br>
<br>
This time the shaman did scream like a woman.  <br>
<br>
The edges of the completed Gnollslayer gleamed with a cold fire as she drew it from its sheath. It would be over in a moment; she could already see the spray of blood as the shaman’s head came of in a single perfect sweep of the blade. As she advanced on the stricken shaman a tremendous weight landed on her back and slavering jaws locked on her foot, pulling her off balance and away from the shaman who was beginning to cast healing spells in a high squeaky voice. The wolf was dragging her away from him, soon the injuries inflicted would be healed, desperate Valkiri reached out with the Black Hand.<br>
<br>
Energy streamed from her into the wolf, for a moment it looked like it would survive, but suddenly the energy that bound it to Antonica dissipated, and it was gone. Valkiri stood up and began to close the distance to the shaman in a crawling run, the slow spell still dragging her down. She did not make it in time, the bloodstained earth of the arena made a deep umber from the amount of blood shed on its soil, rose up and held her tight.<br>
<br>
“You fight like no knight I have ever known.” Wheezed the shaman admiringly. “Know this, Hraban of Halas takes your life and that of the plague priest as weregild for those of my kinsmen slain by your folk. The Tribunal has decreed a blood feud between your folk and mine and I am their instrument of justice.”<br>
<br>
Behind the shaman, Maygrot recovered his vision. He leapt onto the shaman’s hammer arm and clung like ice on steel.  The Barbarian laughed wildly as he shattered the acolytes grip with a quick slap, Maygrot collapsed to the ground senseless.<br>
“By the bond of this blade I summon you to do my bidding!” Valkiri shouted <br>
holding the Gnollslayer over her head. <br>
<br>
The shaman hobbled forward hefting his hammer a look of murderous fury on his face. “Now you shall pay for the deaths of me kin, your name is not unknown to me, I thank the Tribunal for this chance to bring you to face their judgment.”<br>
<br>
A huge wolf rippled into being beside the rooted Shadow Knight, it leapt onto Hraban a whirlwind of fang and claw. In a flash the wolf was within the shaman’s guard, the hammer ineffective at such close quarters. For a moment the strength of the Barbarian wolf of the north contested against his namesake as they grappled on the dusty floor of the arena, but it was only for a moment.<br>
<br>
“Die Bitch!” a voice growled behind her in Barbarian.<br>
<br>
It was the rogue, rooted to the spot Valkiri could not turn to face his blow, a single blow would kill her, so close had the battle been. He wolf remained unaware of this new threat and remained where it was, worrying at the corpse of the fallen Shaman.<br>
<br>
“Ah there you are, been looking for ya.” Maladominus appeared, completing a fear spell with a flourish.<br>
<br>
As the terrified barbarian ran into her field of view she set the wolf on him, it took only a moment for the beast to pull him down.<br>
<br>
“Call him off!” Maladominus commanded, scuttling over to the mangled rogue, slapping the wolf on his bloodied muzzle. <br>
<br>
As the wolf backed off, Maladominus kicked the barbarian in the head. <br>
<br>
“Now that I got your attention, I have a message for you to take back to Halas, you will leave those recently called to Bertox alone, or we shall begin to prey on your young in earnest. The full might of the League of Shadows will descend upon your hovel of a town and put it to the torch if you do not obey. Once our young are strong enough to hunt further afield you can kill those you can catch but do not think that we leave our youngest unguarded and without support.” In that moment the wave of feral energy that radiated from the angry gnome surpassed that of the wolf at his side and it slunk away with its tail between its legs.<br>
<br>
“I will carry your message home.” Whined the barbarian as he crept out of the arena.<br>
<br>
Mal waddled over to the velium two handed hammer and after an aborted attempt to sling it over his shoulder he summoned Maygrot.<br>
<br>
“Here you go kid, be sure to have it blessed at the temple before you use it.” The last was said with a grunt as he dropped the massive weapon into the acolyte’s hands.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think you will have any more problems here, but be sure to let Sragg know all that happened.” Valkiri said quietly as Maygrot trotted towards the basement of the arena and the secret passages that would lead him to the temple.<br>
<br>
After a moment Maladominus gasped, “Is he gone?” Pain wracking his face into a terrible grimace.<br>
<br>
“He better be, the only thing that is holding me up is this root spell.” Valkiri wheezed.<br>
<br>
“Good puppy…” Maladominus whispered as he climbed wearily onto the back of the wolf.<br>
<br>
It took a stack of bandages and the judicious application of a pumice stone to get the Shadow Knight moving but there was Blackburrow stout and a bath waiting for her at Crows…<br>
<br>
Valkiri Blackhand 37th season Shadow Knight of the League of Shadows.<br>
<br>
“We need to leave town.” Maladominus said quietly. He was laying on his stomach, exposing the four inch scar that marked the entry point of the rogue’s dagger. Pus bubbled from around its puckered edges each time the gnome took a halting breath. <br>
<br>
Valkiri slowly ran her finger along the bubbling crust, collecting a half congealed green and red-flecked globule. Her tongue snaked out and delicately lifted the glistening mass into her mouth. Residual poison burned her mouth like strong whiskey, she swallowed with relish.<br>
<br>
“Why are you always the lucky one, I want to be the one poisoned next time!” She said petulantly.<br>
<br>
“Sure, you say that now.” Mal said hoarsely. <br>
<br>
“You are right of course, I think Velious would be a good place to hide out, Spartax, Opious and Keemodo have been hunting there lately.” Valkiri said sucking on her finger. “I don’t think the barbarians would think to look for us in a frozen wasteland.”<br>
<br>
“Who will watch my shop?” Maladominus said mournfully as his gaze darted from one jar of questionable contents to another. His guise as an apothecary had been his first and most successful cover. <br>
<br>
“I can, if it is only for a little while.” A quiet voice said.<br>
<br>
Both Valkiri and Maladominus turned to look at the speaker. A tall human female in a purple robe stood in the shadows, one of the few new recruits to the temple that the gnome had been able to save from the blood feud of the barbarians. <br>
<br>
“I won’t be gone that long.” Maladominus said hopefully, “It wont be long before some one else angers these barbarians and they go after someone else.”<br>
<br>
A throaty chuckle warped into a barking laugh caused the gnome necromancer to turn back towards the shadow knight. It was the first time he had ever seen Valkiri display any humor other than her usual gallows wit. The herald of Bertoxulous wore a ghastly smile that showed entirely too many teeth, it was like watching the crocodiles of the Oasis of Mar grin at a wounded 10th season paladin.<br>
<br>
“I take it you have an idea?” the gnome said testily.<br>
<br>
“Its perfect!” Valkiri said holding up the broken arrow that the ranger Mosak had thrown at Maygrot in disgust. “We just need to get a few more items.” She looked pointedly at Philia the robed human female. “How would you like to get some revenge on Holly Windstalker?”<br>
<br>
“She has been a thorn in my side since I first chose this path!” the young Necromancer hissed. “If you will work against her count me in.”<br>
<br>
The next morning dawned bright and clear in Qeynos hills. Holly Windstalker was on her usual patrol protecting the wolves and the bears of the area from harm. She loved her job, since it allowed her to kill poachers on sight, none could survive her devastating combination of magic and steel and few were quick enough to escape to the safety of Black Burrow or Qeynos when she began to chase them. <br>
<br>
As she stalked along the western borders of the hills she heard a familiar laugh. It was the sound that those damnable skeletons made when they were the summoned tools of the Necromancers. She followed the sound behind a large hill, there she saw a horrifying sight. Dead bears and wolves littered the area, their corpses left to rot beneath the hot sun. Standing in the middle of this carnage was a young human female bloody to the elbows and obviously in league with the Millers.<br>
<br>
“You will pay for your crimes!” Shouted the ranger as she charged into the remote valley with a feral grin on her face, this young one would stand no chance against her.<br>
<br>
“I think not.” A voice said as darkness surrounded her.<br>
<br>
“Your feeble spell cannot stop me Necromancer!” The ranger growled, drawing both of her blades and turning to face her second opponent. Further back in the ravine a second figure stood in the shadows, this was the one that had dared to attack her. She charged towards this new enemy, surprised at how slowly she moved, the darkness snaring her as well as one of her own spells. It would not matter this new enemy was trapped, it would have to run past her to escape the valley. As she got closer her blood began to burn. It was extraordinarily painful.<br>
<br>
At last she could see her enemy plainly, a tall human female holding a great-spear in black plate armor looked at her with an eager expression. Her twin long swords flashed in the sun as she closed on the Shadowknight. Before she got close enough to strike the great-spear plunged into her side, the blade drank deep, sucking greedily at her life force. The ranger knew in an instant she would find no victory here.  Gritting her teeth she leapt backwards, drawing the eager spear point out of her body with a wet sucking sound.<br>
<br>
Behind her she could hear the skeleton of the Necromancer approaching with a cackle. Twin blades made a statacco beat as they sundered the skeleton, but it had delayed her too long. Again the spear struck her, this time in the leg and yet more energy was stolen away. Holly shouted weakly for help as she hobbled towards the top of the hill, but the animals she had fought to save paid her cries no heed, and the guards of Qeynos were too far away to hear. <br>
<br>
“She is yours…” The Shadow Knight said commandingly.<br>
<br>
Spells gripped her again, stealing her strength, courage and life force. Holly crested the top of the hill with a gasp of agony, she could see far away the path that led to Surefall Glade, her home. She would never see it again…<br>
<br>
“Take her boots, her swords and her beltpouch.” Valkiri ordered as Philia approached her kill.<br>
<br>
Attracted by the scent of fresh blood a pack of wolves were now circling the two followers of the plague god. The Alpha male advanced growling until it caught the scent of Valkiri. As she approached it rolled onto its back and exposed its belly making its total submission readily apparent to the rest of the pack. The pack waited patiently while Philia looted the corpse of the fallen ranger. <br>
<br>
“Stupid nature lovers, the beasts of the earth don’t care about their efforts, they only care about full bellies.” Valkiri muttered as the pair stalked off the hill. Behind them the wolves circled the fresh kill for a moment before beginning to feast.<br>
<br>
The journey through Black Burrow was exhilarating for Philia, the gnolls refused to approach or even look at them it was as if they knew better. There was a moment of excitement as a huge gnoll commander drove a swarm of inexperienced adventurers before him as a wolf drove sheep. It stopped and glowered at Valkiri for a moment. The shadow knight drew a wicked looking long sword and held it over her head. The blade literally whined in its eagerness to drink gnoll blood. The commander fled back into the depths of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
When they entered everfrost Valkiri stopped and drew the dead ranger’s boots onto her own feet. Windstalker’s sword felt good in her grip as the two agents of evil strolled leisurely towards the bottom of the ramp that led to the cave mouth. There at the bottom stood a barbarian guard, Arnish Mc Leish. It was a short fight. When it was over bloody bootprints stood out in stark relief in the snow.<br>
<br>
“What now?” Philia asked.<br>
<br>
“Now comes the hard part.” Valkiri said sourly as she began casting spells to protect her in the upcoming battle.<br>
<br>
The two waited in a frozen glacial rift, invisible, for what seemed like hours, as oblivious barbarians wandered to and fro across the tundra.<br>
<br>
“Here it comes.” Growled Valkiri as a young barbarian ran breathlessly up to Bandl Mc Marrin.<br>
<br>
“Arnish is Dead!” He panted.<br>
<br>
“Who dares to slay one of the wolves of the north?” Commanded Bandl, hefting a fine steel two-handed sword. “Show me where!”<br>
<br>
The two barbarians ran past them towards the entrance to Black Burrow. <br>
<br>
“Don’t get too close, these barbarians are cunning.” Valkiri admonished as they approached the ramp. <br>
<br>
“Kill the young one!” the herald of Bertoxolous thundered as she charged Bandl.<br>
<br>
Bandl was an experienced warrior and he fought like his namesake. No quarter was asked and none given. Blood painted the snow with broad strokes but in the end Valkiri stood victorious over the dead guard. Philia had a much easier time with her target.<br>
<br>
“Drag that one to the cave mouth, where the gnolls can get to him.” Valkiri panted, pointing to Philia’s victim. The fight had been frighteningly close and she had not dared to cast any spells that would leave a lasting impression on her prey. Calmly she plunged the blade into Bandl’s chest, pushing hard so that it stuck into the frozen ground beneath him. A casual flick of her hand deposited the shattered arrow from the Surefall Ranger, next to Arnish.   Next she took the beltpouch and dropped it next to Bandl.<br>
<br>
Relations between the barbarians of Halas and the rangers of Surefall Glade had always been tenuous at best. Their mutual hatred of the Bloodsabers had for a long time held them together in an uneasy truce, the barbarians resenting their inability to hunt in the Qeynos Hills area and the Rangers anger at the slaughter of young polar bear cubs kept them from being anything more than the coolest of allies. It did not, in the end, take much to set them against each other. In the ocean of blood that was spilt afterwards all traces of the handiwork of Philia, Valkiri and Maladominus was washed away. It was Philia who made the death of Holly Windstalker possible, Valkiri who slew the guards of Halas and Maladominus who forged the note which stated simply, “the beasts of everfrost  have suffered long enough at the hands of the barbarians, they cannot protect themselves, it falls to you Holly to teach them the error of their ways.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As the two trotted back towards Qeynos Valkiri's blood burned with excitement and the stolen life force of Bandl. The plan had worked out even better than she had hoped, already the war horns of Halas were calling the clans to war. There were no loose ends.<br>
<br>
It had been easy to coerce the young gnoll guards at the cave entrance to the Black Burrow to devour the corpse of the young barbarain who had brought the fateful news to Bandl. They had in turn been slain by Philia, there were no other witnesses.<br>
<br>
She looked behind her at the young necromancer studiously avoiding the footprints Valkiri was leaving behind, the boots of Holly Windstalker were a suprisingly good fit and comfortable, but they did not offer the protection of her Darkforge boots, once they were in depths of Black Burrow she could change back, the tracks of the vengeful ranger dissappearing in the myriad foot, claw and boot prints that littered the area.<br>
<br>
What had started as an effort to divert the attention of the barbarians away from the bloodsabers had turned into something more. As they approached the cave exit to Qeynos hills Valkiri signalled a stop and in a little cave removed the boots of the Windstalker, placing them in her backpack and replaced them with her proper boots.<br>
<br>
&quot;They are coming!&quot; Philia hissed excitedly from the mouth of the small grotto.<br>
<br>
Both followers of the plague god cloaked themselves in invisibility as a party of young, angry barbarians charged into the upper levels of the gnoll stronghold.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Ivan of Halas!&quot; Mosak the ranger said desperately as the band of barbarians rushed towards him. He was fighting a gnoll commander and getting the worst of it.<br>
<br>
The gnoll turned to face the new threat, resigned to its fate, already it was beginning its death howl when the barbarians descended on the embattled pair like an avalanche. Mosak screamed piteously as the barbarians cut him down and continued towards Qeynos Hills and ultimately Surefall Glade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Valkiri! Help me!&quot; Philia shouted, the stunned commander had survived the onslaught and seen the young necromancer as her spell dropped.<br>
<br>
The Shadow Knight turned to watch the fight. It would not take long at all for the gnoll to kill the necromancer. One more loose end would be taken care of. What they had accomplished this day was certainally worth the life of an inexperienced necromancer.<br>
<br>
Philia was fighting grimly and with a skill born of desperation, there was hardly a pause in the constant chanting of magicks and the striking of her staff. Valkiri thought back to her first mission for Sragg, one that had brought her into contact with Arnish McLeish and the Barbarian Warrior Draugos, the taste of that betrayal was still sweet, still he had sent her to die.<br>
<br>
In fact she still had the note he had given her, it was the first thing she had learned to read, she still took it out of her spell book from time to time to reminisce on how far she had come since her days as a simple bar maid.<br>
<br>
Philia's face now wore the same look of dogged determination in the face of hopelessness that the commander had worn upon the arrival of the barbarians. She was preparing to die.<br>
<br>
The young necromancer locked gazes with the older Shadowknight and understanding registered there. Most would have threatened revenge, or begged for aid, or simply have given up. Philia fought on. Slowly the tide turned but in the end it came down to a single blow. The staff struck just a fraction more quickly than the jagged claw of the commander.<br>
<br>
Philia slumped exhausted onto the corpse of the fallen commander, too weak to even loot it. &quot;You are going to have to do the dirty work yourself!&quot; she growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think not.&quot; Valkiri said grimly as three gnolls converged on the nearly dead necromancer.<br>
<br>
Too exhausted to even mutter a cantrip Philia prepared to die.<br>
<br>
The blade that struck the gnolls was so sharp it appeared that they tore themselves open to keep it from touching their flesh. The damage dealt was totally out of proportion to the strength of the blows, a simple caress from the blade was enough to sever a limb, a thrust struck like a bolt of lighting. It was over nearly as quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have passed the test.&quot; Valkiri said with as much emotion as a judge passing sentence. &quot;Welcome to the service of the plaugue bringer.&quot; A quick gesture and energy flowed from the Shadow Knight to the Necromancer, restoring her strength and vitality.<br>
<br>
&quot;How?&quot; Philia asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes...Someday it will be necessary for you to lay down your life, to embrace death to further the greater glory of the plague lord. You understood that, and that knowledge saved you in turn.&quot;<br>
<br>
As they strode out into the Qeynos hills area Valkiri said &quot;Return to Qeynos and grow in strength, I hope to call upon you again soon.&quot; Then almost as an afterthought she handed a worn note to the young necromancer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats this?&quot; The necromancer asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;A memento from my first test...&quot; Valkiri said as she walked off towards the Karanas.<br>
<br>
Philia could not make much sense of the note when she got back to the temple. It read. 'I am a follower of the Plague bringer and I am here to disease the well in Halas, try and stop me coward!'<br>
<br>
When she asked Sragg about the note, for she saw it was written in his hand, he only laughed at her.<br>
<br>
Valkiri Shadowknight of Bertox<br>
