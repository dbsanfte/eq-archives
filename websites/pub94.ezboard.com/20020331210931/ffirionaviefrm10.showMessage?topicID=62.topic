The corrupted trees of Nektullos in front of him mocked him, their shifting souls that should have been vibrant with life and energy a mere mass of tortured spirits crying out for release while simultaneously reaching out for the souls of passerbys to feed the emptiness within them.  Alighting by the battlefield and almost falling, Viraan watched the souls depart from the bodies of the fight he had not been able to join.  The soft whirr behind him told him that his mindless conjuration had followed him as usual, though he could not tell on his own due to the magical construct not showing itself to his peculiar vision.<br>
Viraan glided through the corpses, completely unmindful of the black skinned dark spawn he tread upon, as they were not worth his notice until he came upon the sight he knew he would find though tried to deny to himself that he would see.  Amidst the still graceful forms of his dark kindred was a taller, more robust form betraying the lineaments of humanity, yet still delicate and slim that had been his human friend.  He had not paid heed to her words and left scouting, thinking his vision superior to her skills in the forest of the defiled.  By the time he had heard the engagement, he had been too late to aid her.  She had had the spirit to overcome great pain and superior numbers, and even as her death knell sounded as Viraan watched from the slope above, she unleashed a final kick that eliminated the last of her opponents.<br>
A half score of the orc loving killers had passed under her fist, an incredible accomplishment.  Yet as Viraan surveyed the scene, he had to admit their lives had not been equal to her own.  He had only met the vibrant young woman weeks before, and while he had not understood her silent language of gestures and expression and she had not understood the overwhelming grace of the mother tongue they had got along famously.  Though even his respect of her had not overcome his own stubbornness in wanting to eradicate the tier'dal.  She had never found cause to hate them, even admired their orderly society, an attitude that Viraan had deplored.<br>
As he watched her soul flee from her body, Viraan prayed to mother Tunare to let her rise again, to be given another chance to see the correct path as he himself had been given several times when he had let his own pride get in the way of Tunare's vision and been destroyed by his enemies.  Yet it was a hollow prayer, and a hollow hope.  Qilae had always been a stubborn girl, as firm in her nonbelief of the gods and their influence of her fate as she was firm in her belief in her sisters and her friends.  The gods would not grant her another chance if she did not even believe in them.<br>
It all seemed so senseless to Viraan, and a burning anger began to grow within him, a fire so deep it obliterated almost all rational thought.  He had to destroy the beasts who had taken her from the world.  They would all die, one by one until the soul of this one bright star was avenged as the nation of the dark elves lie in ruins.<br>
With cold, calculating patience, he set himself in a shadowed niche as he readied all of his tools of mind control and domination to his command.  No more would the defiled pawns of Innoruuk destroy that which he loved.  Never again.  Viraan did not even bother to cloak his form with the form of the dark elven he usually assumed when stalking his pray in the diseased forest.  He simply stalked forward with his animation in silent tow, seeking to obliterate all that stood before him.<br>
<br>
He claimed well over a score of victims well before the sun that only he could see through the treetops set over the western horizon.  Never had he had an ill heart, yet his growing fury, undiminished and unsated by his victories still burned and demanded more tier'dal blood before he would huddle down into nightmare haunted sleep.  <br>
Viraan regarded his latest victim with great contempt.  The foolish dark elf was unarmed and unarmored.  He lacked the calluses and muscles that defined the dark knights of Neriak, and also did not have the secretive swagger that marked the dark spellcasters.  Quickly sliding his vision into the spectrum of magic instead of soul, Viraan verified that this incredibly foolish one had no magical defenses or items of any sort.  With a scowl of contempt, Viraan dropped a veil of magical quickness over his construct, then over himself that seemed to make the world slow to a crawl as he sped his way through it.  Quickly using the pattern that had yet to fail him in his grim crusade of genocide, he unleashed a choking hold on the doomed soon to be corpse, then followed it with the wolf bite that drained away his opponent's will to resist his will as his animation charged in.<br>
The dark elf did nothing.  Simply watched until the animation charged in, seemingly unprovoked.  The dark watcher merely looked at the soulless spell device and it exploded in a large cloud of multifaceted sparks that Viraan could see dimly with his magic linked vision.  A bit nonplussed, but still not alarmed, Viraan reached out with his magic in attempt to dominate and stun his opponent.  Yet his irritation turned to horror as he felt his own spells turn against him and he crashed down helplessly onto the fungi-infested worm grass, huddling at the feet of his victor.  He waited for the final blow to come, for his soul to depart and return to the place he had bound it to, but it did not come.  As the mesmerization wore off, he felt himself compelled to raise to his knees and look up at the orc spawn kisser.  There was definite amusement in those red eyes, and if Viraan could have drawn back, he would have shrunk away in horror at the dancing flames that glimmered eerily in the vision of this creature.<br>
It simply stared at him, a mocking grin not fading even slightly as it looked down upon him.  Without warning, it raised a hand and Viraan was engulfed in flames.<br>
He could hear his scream resound in his ears, and noticed that the flames seemed to be created of soul energy, not magic or heat, and that though they burned physically, the pain to his eternal being was far worse.  Even with his non-existent physical vision he could see his pale skin start to crisp from it's pure moonlight hue to grey, and then to dead black in the heat of the fire.  He prayed to Tunare for death, yet at the same time he desired retribution of his tormentor, and the flames from the inside met the flames from the outside and merged.<br>
After floating in the void of his rage for eternity, Viraan found himself laid out on the ground and rose to his feet to meet the fiery gaze of his tormentor... to find he could see.  His soul sight no longer registered, and he looked around in astonishment.  Yet something was amiss.  In this inky forest he should not have been able to note even the slightest detail even with his highly developed elven infravision... Yet he could see extrordinarily well, almost as if everything were bathed in the brightest moonlight.  He raised his hand up to his eyes to clear them, then stared horrified at his black skin.  His skin had been burned by the flames so he had thought.  Yet his skin was not the black of char and coal, but the black of the dark elves, the corruption of Innoruuk.<br>
&quot;You spawn of Hate, what have you,&quot; Viraan began to shout.<br>
&quot;What have you done to yourself you mean,&quot; the dark elf broke in calmly in highly accented tier'dal that Viraan found with horror he understood perfectly.  &quot;And do not bother to associate me with that weakling.  I serve a much greater master, and the fires of your hatred and destruction has found much favor with my master's tenets.&quot;<br>
&quot;The fires of my...&quot; Viraan now understood the implications of what this evidently non-elven fiend had done to himself... or rather what his rage had allowed it to do to him.  &quot;What interest does the Burning Prince have in me, then?  I would rather destroy myself than let him control me.  I serve the Mother always.  She would not allow one of her children to be used so.&quot;  Yet for some odd reason this sounded hollow in Viraan's ears.<br>
&quot;You are very full of yourself to think that my master would take a direct interest in you.  He merely instructed me to find those that would serve his needs the best and recruit them.  And even you are only a pawn to me.  Merely another foolish person who has let their desire to destroy taint their soul.  Go forth now, my Shadowed Sky, the fallen of the pure.  Let the Prince guide you and you will understand everything.&quot;  With those final words the creature simply vanished in a conjuration of flames.<br>
Viraan stood there numbed for countless moments, his own arguments seeming more and more hollow to him as he tried to argue himself back to sanity.  Yet the compelling urge that had recreated him whispered to him in the back of his mind.  There were more things to destroy, to recreate.  He would not serve Soluseek Ro, but for those that had slighted him in his life, none would escape the purification of flames.  And unknowingly he turned down the road to Neriak, plans drifting in his mind, the hidden thoughts suppressed by goodly and orderly society surfacing and taking a place equal with his high morals as his mind simply had no reason to keep them from being considered any longer.<br>
<br>
There is no good.  There is no evil.  There is only the purification that comes from surrendering to chaos.  Let the ice freeze that weak thing you call a soul.  Let the lightning destroy the frozen organ.  Then seek purification in the flames.  Then and only then will you know the truth.  -  Shadowskye Vir'Luneswallow <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=62.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=62.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=62.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=62.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=62.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
