<br>
Part 1.<br>
What do you expect when you fight the Hopeless Battle?<br>
<br>
<br>
The Arena is where it always leaves. The Trueness of what really goes on, beyond hatefilled words and worthless religious batter, what really defines a person is his weapon, and what he can do with it. Soul and Sword.<br>
<br>
When the words stop flying.. this, the Arena, is where one it supposed to put up, or be tossed to the wayside with the rest of the Trash.<br>
<br>
It was rape. Pure and simple, for their is no other word for it. The Members of Fire and Fury laughed as their power stood abounded. Ogarth wasn't even there. He didn't have to be.<br>
To live and die a thousand times is an experence that would bring even the most faithful doubting their gods, or even the most hardened warrior doubting the ability to handle his own blade.<br>
<br>
Blast after blasted raped him of his pride. Slash after slash ravished him of his purpose. Death after death stole away his sprit. They laughed and cheered after every one. This was no contest for them. He lived for longer then many of these people. Some in the croud he saw began younger then him, but throught the help of the power that combining all classes, creeds, and races brings to a guild, they grew much much stronger then he could ever see himself being. Even if he had Innoruuk's curse, one blast from their hands again raped him of his very being. <br>
<br>
The Nightmare is often worse then the reality, and in the blur he saw them all. All that ever turned their back to go to it, all that ever was born within it, and those that corrupted and turned people to it. Neutrality was a stronger curse upon the land then the Paladins of light could ever be.<br>
<br>
After the many hours he spent during the rape, it was over. beaten, burned, and defeated completly and totally, he saw how truly high that mountain was. He could never even begin to climb. That day something did die inside of him, more or less something taken. <br>
<br>
No longer was he able to continue on. No matter how much he preached, no matter how long he faught, they would not listen. Always those that could make a true difference would leave to join them. The point became lost within the dispear and realization of what is true.<br>
<br>
He was just another Halfbreed playing ShadowKnight.<br>
<br>
The fights from there do not matter really. Defeated by Xaenria, but his sprit had already been raped away by the Fury. He saw the power of the Neutrals first hand, and their was nothing he could do about it.<br>
<br>
So he let it die, right there, guild banner and all! He threw all that made him that falsity, that fake Legend Knight known only as 'Shintou Shinai' ~ The Insane Slaughter of Elves. All that remained was a small child. Eyes wide to the world, alone, and afraid.<br>
<br>
Kestrel pleaded to no avail. Her words fell upon the ears of a man no longer the master of hate, but dominated and chained by its force. The struggle to control and use hate to ones advtange had crushed and destroyed what was there.<br>
<br>
Faentriel and Mudwart met the same resistance. Even Despa wondered why.<br>
<br>
Apep had been expecting it however. He had been taking the members of the league that wanted power lately, at the cost of their souls and survatude to his Castle Storm, and the Barbarians as well as Vah Shir which keep that house Neutralic.<br>
<br>
He didn't get another Soul in Kenshin. He turned him down before he could open his mouth. With a simple statement, uncharaistically calm and consience.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot join you, that I cannot. I have no reason to, that I don't. You know that that you do.&quot;<br>
<br>
He ended that claim. Shockening enought, the old Mage expected it and simply nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even now, you're still too damned stubborn.&quot;<br>
<br>
And then, the days began to pass. Times he felt what died within him trying to revive.. he had throught that he could sit in the Plane of Tranquility and live in a state of constant meditation. But sometimes, old habits are hard to forget. He had to occupy his mind.<br>
He had to occupy his blade. He did it in the way he would always. Sate himself by doing simple tasks, the one currently to gain total and complete Alliance with the Overthere Outpost, in the blood of Sarnak Bezerkers. This was enought to occupy himself as he lived throught the mizery that was his life.<br>
<br>
And the days passed.. till their was Kaileena.<br>
She appeared before him finally, forcing him to meet her in Neriak.<br>
<br>
The heart of the girl had been shattered. Number 4, if you are counting. He never truly did realize his mastery of breaking the hearts of lovers, now did he. Her words, rushed and edged with the fires of hate. Had he still been Shintou, maybe he would of been impressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't let you give up! You didn't let me ever give up, so I won't allow you to!&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I love you! Can't you see that! How can you leave me!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;All of my teachings were lies, Kaileena. Forget them as you forget me, and maybe you will come into strenght.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! You will not give up! I swear to Innoruuk I'll kill you if you do!&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Love me or die! You cannot run out on me! What kind of a man are you! Love me or feel the sting of my shattered heart!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That is when Shintou turned his back and started walking away. He knew Kaileena would come with a hard direct stab to his spine. He taught her the move. It was easy to see it comming, and it was even eaiser to shadowstep away from it. After that the battle went quickly. He slain his own student there in cold blood, almost without the same mercy or remorse that Shintou gave his opponets, but without the same Malious Cruelty or the True Joy that was taken in the Slaughter.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you return, you will maybe then learn to forget me, and your worthless love.&quot; Were the words he spoke over her shaking body as he walked away, leaving her behind as he had left so much before.<br>
<br>
And their was more.<br>
Within the Faydark is where he ended up. The League of Shadows against the League of Honor. But that was not the reason he came. He came to search for someone, someone he knew that would have something for him, answers to a new search now, one he figured out during the various battles with the Sarnaks.<br>
<br>
The war was just a bit of Enterainment, so he figured. Untill Quinrooss. The Human Cleric brought him into the battle. He saw throught his shadows and demanded a fight.<br>
<br>
Damn that Priest. I'll become Shintou just for you.<br>
<br>
But Shintou was already ravished, wounded, raped, and destroyed. He had no chance in a battle, even against a Cleric. Defeated by one that was at his own Season.<br>
<br>
Another sign, that darkness.. that HE was comming to an end.<br>
<br>
Their was Kulligen, full with hate. The Entire League, shouting in one unaminous voice.<br>
&quot;HalfBreed go Home! Wait, you are home! Worthless HalfBreed! You will die!&quot; the shouts of their dead souls to him.<br>
It was the first time that he felt himself being called that. He earned it, after all.<br>
<br>
Kullgen went after Kenshin with her fists, trying to strike him down with just those and her spells. It was working too, For Kenshin didn't use his spells, he was much higher in level then she. This was just a fight, he only had one message.<br>
He knew Innoruuk was working, and working quickly. <br>
He caught her fists, right after she unleashed a Harm Touch to him, one leaving him barley holding on to life.<br>
<br>
And he spoke to her, one final time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kaileena will rise again. When she does, teach her to be the Knight that I never was. Also, teach her to be the Tier'dal Woman you are. This is my final request of you!&quot; He said as the relfex kicked in.<br>
<br>
Old habits die hard. And a Harm Touch is always met with a Harm Touch. The Malious Hand of Lanys stuck Kulligen in the chest. Her eyes rolled back. For the night.. she was out.<br>
<br>
Shintou baded Ayemi to finish it, the Priest could do in two blasts.<br>
And she nodded, doing as he wished. Upon this death, he saw a flash.<br>
<br>
The Father was watching. His grin was wide. That was when he knew that he was right. Innoruuk is in control, he shall always be. Halfbreed or not, throught his mother Kenshin was still bound.<br>
To the Father, to the Mother. Innoruuk watched his bastard son well.<br>
When he woke, their was Shaveil to talk to. But after that was finished, Shaveil only nodded.<br>
<br>
Still a friend, the two shook hands. After that, Shintou was gone. Deep within the Faydark, he saught out the one with his answers.<br>
<br>
He knew Innoruuk would always be in control. But he also knew he could never fight again, with the memories of that night.<br>
<br>
One night at the arena. The one that finally raped and destroyed his life. When the true power of the Neutralic Machine was hammered down on him.<br>
Just like in the plane of Justice.<br>
He was found ...lacking.<br>
<br>
He did find what he searched for, finding the bouncy Druid.<br>
In his eyes, she was the cloest thing..<br>
<br>
..To the Avatar of Tunare. She welcomed him with a smile and a nod. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come, sit with me. Ask me anything. I will grant you peace. Seperate yourself from the world, and begin to find yourself within my forest.&quot;<br>
<br>
She didn't say it, that Druid did not. She did give him advice, various things to help him, for like Tunare, this Druid loved all things. The one that said that was Tunare, for he heard her voice intertwined with that Druid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Find yourself, not one shrouded by masks or hidden away by emotions of self pity. Who is Kenshin, it was so long when your parents were killed and Yoto.. no when You created Shintou to hide from the loss of your loved ones that you truly do not even know yourself.&quot; Said Tunare.<br>
<br>
The Druid rambled on, and did silly things, like headstands and danced and.. did what druids do.<br>
<br>
And when she didn't speak, he continued to meditate in the Faydark.<br>
<br>
Tunares voice spoke in his ears. The voice did not outrightfully say it, for it forced him to do nothing. It just said find yourself, over and over.<br>
<br>
Who am I?<br>

Part 2.<br>
The Search for Kenshin.<br>
<br>
The Overthere, small rolling hills, a deep chasum.. and sarnacks.. with whips. What else is there? Oh, a huge Outpost Built with the combined efforts of The Dead, Mayong Mistimoore, Vernil Sathir, and the Dark Relfection.  In this place, the evilist of evils.. is where we find out little guy, Kenshin Kintanka.<br>
<br>
He knelt down, opening up a jar which he retrieved from the bank just down the way. That jar contained a pretty vengeful sprit, a sprit of a man who watched his entire family get slaughtered before him. This sprit who had to watch the destiny which was to befall him befall another, added with the complete fustration of this soul. Yotoden formed before him, even with his sword, Fujikuro.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did you place my father, Yotoden.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You summoned me for this? Are you not ready to form the souledge with my sprit?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Their's been a change of plans that their has. I won't be going after the Innoruuk's Curse anymore I do not think. I'm not your puppet Shintou Shinai anymore, that I am not. I've broken your insanity, Yotoden, that I have.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You fool! Do you know how long it took me to train you? And you go ahead and undo all of that!?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll never be strong enought to do anything unless I face up to what has been keeping me weak. Their is something in my heart, something unsolved. Shintou Shinai, that was just a mask to keep myself from this thing. I no longer wear masks, you see. I want the truth, now where is my father!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As if I'll ever tell you. I can see it in your eyes, you've become the worthless halfbreed child. Maybe I should start calling you Kenshin from now on, boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You forget.&quot; Kenshin spoke, clasping his hands together then pulling them apart, a field of mana energy forming inbetween them, sparkling green. &quot;I am still a ShadowKnight, that I am. Innoruuk hasn't stripped me of my ability to use spells yet. I can still destroy your soul, and without it you would not exist, that you would not. Tell me what I want to know, and you will be free.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why go after your parents, Kenshin. I can tell you everything you wish to know right here, I watched you grow before I took you to Lavastorm and taught you the ways of Insanity. Here, I will be---&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut your mouth! I think you've told me enought lies about myself, that you have!&quot; Kenshin said harshly, the field of energy forming into a ball, and beginning to spin. &quot;You have one more chance. Tell me where you slain my father or I will destroy you, that I will.&quot;<br>
<br>
And the fear finally faded shown in the eyes of Yotoden. He knew the boy was serious.. he did beat him in combat back then.. and now he held dominion over his soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are a fool for giving up the power. Had you gotten the Innoruuk's Curse, you would of been Invinable. Your Father was slain outside of the spiers, right after he took your mother in the Faydark. I didn't allow him to live long after he served his purpose. I told the Guards there what he did, so they did not give him a proper elven Burial. Whilest they do not know that the Tier'dal had a child to him, they did know that he was cruel. He was tossed on the side, the hill there and allowed to rott. Your Mother, after she was slain by the Guards was tossed in the place where all Dishonored Tier'dal go. By her letting you survive, halfbreed, the City of Neriak deemed her worthless and dishonored. You see, back then, even the halfbreeds were slaughtered by the City. Now of course, they allow all who wish to enter enter by killing some halflings or getting that guy Drunk down in the Libarary. If you were born some many years eariler, you might of had a chance. Your Step-Father was tossed aside just like your mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Step Fathe.. I guess I will have to find out now won't I? That I will. Thank you, old sprit of the dead. Yotoden, you are free to go that you are.&quot; And with that, Kenshin shattered the jar which held the sprit of Yotoden in place for so many years, turning his mana energy upon it instead of Yotoden himself. The sprit faded away to the spectral realm, a smile upon his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Yotoden said as it faded away into the light.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
The Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
Kenshin stood before the spiers, taking 20 or paces away from them before putting his hands together and falling to his knees.<br>
<br>
It would be easy to pick out the Soul which belonged to his Elven Father and force it to come.. but that Druid from before told him that maybe he should simply ask nicely for them to come. Those that wish to come will. So he asked, but yet he did not recieve. A Soft plea to speak with the man who birthed him fell upon deaf ears. Maybe he was running from what he did as well. This is the time when force was applied. He summoned the sprit much like he would summon an undead minion, forcing the Ranger to come up and face him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You. There you are.&quot; Kenshin spoke, standing to face his father. &quot; I am ---&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Their is no damned need to speak your name, I know what you are. You are what I created. Innoruuk torments my soul by making me watch you as you kill and slaughter my kind, those that were my legimimate children! How can you be so cruel, Shintou!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You may know what I am, but you do not know who I am apparently. That is not my name, my name is Kenshin that it is. I have saught you out to understand.. why? Why did you not just kill my mother? Why did you do this to me? You may torment as I used to slaughter your breathern without mercy, but I suffered daily by what you did! Are you followers of Tunare not peaceful and kind? You destroyed my life, that you did. Because of you, I cannot truly be Shintou Shinai, that I cannot. I am damned because of you, dammed because of your blood that I share! So tell me why!?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Heh.. hah..&quot; Shintou the Ranger broke into a laughter. His laugh echoing throughtout the forest as an undead houl. &quot;I did it because I knew how best to ensure that she'd never bother me again. You were supposed to become soft and shame them both, a Tier'dal follower of Tunare. Back then, that would of been ironic, however common it now is. That damned Yotoden interfeared with my seed and drove you insane, I see that now. Kenshin now is it? I enjoyed it, too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You sir are more evil and vile then Shintou Shinai could of ever been, that you are. And I do not feel generous enought to allow your sprit to survive, that I do not. No wonder that you were the source of his darkness.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you'll destroy my soul like a Paladin on a Crusade. Not very Shintou Shinaiish of you, now is it boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You forgot, that is not my name that it is NOT!&quot; he shouted as he casted the same spell, one that strikes at the very ki of the undead, blasting him with the dismiss undead spell, it slowly, painfully destroying the sprit of Kenshin's Father.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your sprit will die, that it will. You shall no longer exist, that you shall not. Curse you for what you have done to me. Those women who loved me could never recieve that love in return because of how you cursed me. I could never understand them, so I had to let them go, that I did. You damned me to a life of weakness, that you did. Always battling hate and unable to fully allow it to power me like Havvok or Kullgen or Tallonar or any other knight could. You robbed me of that, and thats what brings me here to destroy your soul, that it does. You brought this on yourself, that you did.&quot; <br>
<br>
He said as he watched the final trindils of the Rangers sprit fade from Norrath. That was settled. He confronted what he throught to be the source of his Hatred and destroyed it with one simple blast.<br>
<br>
So he figured.<br>
<br>
Kenshin took one final bow, before leaving that in the past, finally. He felt one of the chains leave him it seemed, broken and left in the past. Two acually. One for each.<br>

Part 3.<br>
What you miss you can never truly forget.<br>
<br>
The Nektulos forest, unlike the forest of the Faydark is filled with the wispers of the undead. Their soft howls fill this forest with a frightening aura that seems to caress the trees and run along the ground. In this place, their seems to be an espically strong amount of undead.. this resting place of the dishonored and disrespected. The Tier'dal who were not strong enought to be Tier'dal back in those days were dumped here to beforgotten, as wastes..<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you are here Mother. Come, please. I would like to see you with my own eyes, instead of hearing from you by stories laced with lies, that I do. Come before me, every child should at least get to see their mother. This is not like the last times, when I forced your soul from the realm of sprit, but this time I ask you. I wish to speak to you, that I do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kenshin sat on his knees, wearing only his shade silk robe he prayed and waited.. and soon enought a pair of sprits did come before him.. one female, one male. The Females sprit seemed to glow in a faint purple light, the color of her eyes. Her hair was short, only comming up to the back of her neck at best. She still wore her armor, and wielded her sword, the 'Dark Reaver'. Back then, it was a seemingly strong weapon, now of course .. we know better. <br>
<br>
The Male who held her free hand held a staff. His robes were dark red in color, as were the color of his eyes. He glanced over to Isabella with a questioning look. As if to say..<br>
&quot;Should we even be here? Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Raziel. Look at him. Kenshin's all grown up. You can't tell me you weren't curious to see how he would grow.&quot; The female spoke, nodding to the Male who simply just turned his gase upon the boy.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Isabella, you've been watching him ever since you died. I always catch you watching him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah? Well I caught you too, Raz.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thats ENOUGHT!&quot; Kenshin shouted to the sprits, his hands already blue with the undead killing spell. &quot;I called you here to talk to me, not talk amonst yourselves! .. First of all.. Who is he? I .. Oh no you must be..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Raziel. I'm the love of your Mother there. It would do you well to remember who took care of your little ass, don't you think Kenshin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you are her, Isabella my mother. I'll ask you the same thing I asked him, but differently. Why didn't you kill the Ranger! You were a Knight, yet you couldn't beat A simple Ranger!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You couldn't beat a simple Cleric, Kenshin. Lets not forget. Does it matter?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you let me live, you must of known that I'd do nothing but lead you to destruction! Look at me now, is this what you wanted? A Weak child torn between two dieties?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Love, Kenshin. Love. I loved you from the first minute you came into the world. I couldn't kill my own child, whatever he came from. You were mine, not his. You do not remember what happened in the forest as you grew, don't you. I know why you are here. Now that you are done playing something that you are not, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shintou</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, take me and Raziel's hand. I'll show you what you are.&quot; She spoke, softly extending a hand.. as did Raziel. Kenshin let his energy dispierse, watching the two of them extend their spectral hands to him. .. After careful consideration.. and a slight bit of hesitation.. he took them up upon it, he took their hands.<br>
<br>
Then the world seemed to flash by him. Millions upon millions of specs of light passed by all, images, memories, scenes and people.<br>
<br>
&quot;That Yotoden guy did a good job locking up what resided within your heart, kid. Do you remember being just a light hearted child, playing and playing with anything and everything? Raziel hated it, of course. Every day he'd consider just burning you into a corspe and ending your life. He did not like you much, that your stepfather didn't.. but I kept him back. For I loved you. Your play was that of a boy exploring the world. But their was more then that. As much time as you spent out in the woods, Raziel has you figured for a Ranger when you grew older. But I knew better, Kenshin. The father is always watching, and he has a plan for us all.&quot; <br>
<br>
She said as scenes of a young boy, strands of blonde and wihte intermixed within his mat of hair, and his eyes still of dark green pools. The young boy ran about, here and there playing and toying with everything. From the rocks on the ground to the bugs on the trees, to even the Black Wolves that would chase him, trying to end his young life. He just laughed and smiled at all of it, as it was just a fun game to him. Not a malious bond in his body. Not a single drop of hate in this pure spritited child.<br>
<br>
&quot;But.. why did Innoruuk allow me to become a ShadowKnight.. from what you are showing me, I'm nothing but a druid with blue skin, that I am!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But their was also these things.&quot; Raziel stepped foward as more scenes flashed.. flashing to the boy trying to take at his mothers sword. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ivy wasn't the only reason I did not slay you, Kenshin. I hated you, for you were the reason we lived out in the forest in shame, and not in the glory of the City. But, look at you trying to .. &quot;<br>
<br>
And with his words, the scene showed the kid Kenshin trying to wield a sword that was much larger then he was. He'd just stumble and fall, stagger and drop. Once, he almost got it, holding the sword at an downward angle and controling his balance.. just to swing and fall to the ground with in a heap.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'd always do this everytime Ivy left you alone. You even talked about it, to yourself. Always with the 'I want to be a fighter.' 'I want to be the strongest.' and such.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Even still, Paladins may enjoy fighting, and the Lightbringers, they are stronger then anyone else in the world, and that they will always be, that they shall.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raziel had only one word for that. <br>
<br>
&quot;Does it make you angry that they are?&quot;<br>
<br>
The look on Kenshin's face was that of a man snapped to reality.<br>
<br>
&quot;You followed and studied on Lanys T'Vyl, did you not Kenshin? This here, all of this is just another part of your past. Do you think Tier'dal come out of the womb with a sword and a hand full of hate? Even we aren't that blessed. Shintou, you refer to it as a mask. An alter ego. It was created out of your hate. Do you remember watching us die?<br>
<br>
No, you do not.. You were Shintou long before Yotoden even touched you.&quot; Raziel said as he began to show scenes of a more.. brutal fashion.<br>
<br>
Isabella hated these scenes, the ones which showed them lying there, lifeless before a crying child. A Crying Kenshin. The Rivers of blood extended right to his knees, his mother, his father for all he knew. Slain by those two guards.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is where he saved you, that Yotoden feller. He killed those two, but you watched us die. Don't doubt yourself so much, kid. You wanted to fight, heck its all you talked about. Don't lose yourself in the insanity and rage of it all so much however, your trueness resides in finding that boy, and finding also Shintou. Maybe meeting somewhere in the middle? Thats where you'll probably find Kenshin. Shintou is just as much apart of you as that boy is. He is as much as your past as what I've shown you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But we cannot show you who you are. You have to find that for yourself, my son&quot; Isabella continued. &quot;Remember the Father is always watching. Heh, you were so much like Raziel. Love is for the weak? Innoruuk still blesses Tier'dal, even if they do love. Look at all of our followers that do. You were too.. too far. You wore Shintou like a mask to protect your feelings, instead of .. taking his soul into your own, where it should be. Kenshin, this child, new, nieve' and innocent is apart of you.. but so is the fighting, the hate, and the slaughter.<br>
<br>
Well.. where they all fit in your life.. thats what you have to find out for yourself, yes? ..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I.. .. I have alot of Meditation to do that I ..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Not Meditation. Thinking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;..Thinking.. Then.. that is what I shall do. That I shall&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goodbye, Kenshin. Visit anytime, like the Father, we'll always be watching you.&quot; Isabella spoke her goodbyes as a flash of light engulfed the area..<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Kenshin awoke, laying on the ground of the forest. He wasn't in the dishonored gravesite anymore.. but he was laying simply out in the middle of Nektulos. <br>
<br>
..The tools were in his hands.. now he just had to find the way to place them all together. <br>
<br>
..&quot;Whatever happens, happens.. I still fear if I do find myself.. will I like what I find.. what if I find out I'm no different then the elves that join guilds like &quot;Peacekeepers Alliance?&quot; .. No. I cannot worry about that.. whatever happens, happens. If I .. really don't settle this..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can never fight again at all.. that I cannot.&quot;<br>
<br>
So he sat there.. and began to put the pieces together..<br>
What would he find? What would he create? ...Who knows..<br>
<br>
Fin.. that it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kullgendphlith>Kullgen dPhlith</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~subacca/spin.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NOT A MAN</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/7/03 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=876.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~subacca/come_here.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halfbreed for a reason.

<br>
Part 4.<br>
Soul and Sword..<br>
<br>
The Nektulos forest was uncharistically cool that night when Kenshin set himself down to meditate, taking his Katana and sending it into the earth before him. The days events was full of travel and exploration, not of the world but of his feelings. Pushing himself to odd situations produces the feelings that would guide him to what he was, truly. <br>
<br>
Their was always that druid girl, she let him run in the Forest of Kelethin with her, playing with the fay drakes and faries about. Such a tranquil existance brought peace and happyness. Contemptment, for in this world he didn't have to worry about swords or battles. No more slaughter and death, and no more futile fight against those who held power over all, those who took the stance of Neutrality and accepted all races, creeds, and religions to gain ultimate power.<br>
<br>
This peaceful feeling was somewhat of a release .. but as he continued to fly about, playing with the fay and watching the druid's magics to bring the forest alive.. the more he felt .. ackward. The happyness of the forest made him uneasy, and the bouncyness of that druid espically did not let him be at ease. He tried his best to pretend that he was not bothered by anything of this sort, but it did dawn on him as he slept that night, the Druid making a camp for them deep within the Faydark.<br>
<br>
&quot;I forced myself to ..endure this?&quot; his mind rang clearly as the realization settled in. Whatever the cause.. the days and nights he spent in the Faydark ended bringing him peace, but began to take something from him. Something that he did not want to lose at all.<br>
<br>
He had experenced as much as much as the Faydark as he wanted to. That night he was seen turning the page in the Book of Knowledge, that which would wisp him away to the Plane of the same name. It was then when he saw the armor clad fighters, going off to various places to fight and adventure when he realized what that forest and Tunare herself tried to take from him.<br>
<br>
He walked throught that plane, heading for the Nexus. He had another experence to encounter. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;..Its him. Shintou? What are you doing here of all places?&quot; Zharra said, seeing him come down the hall in the Plane of Knowledge. Mudwart simply nodded his troll head as Faentriel scowled at him, as expected. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've come to go to the Dragon Crypt with you all if you would have me, that I am. That is, if you do not mind me comming that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure weez have yoos Shinny! Come on!&quot; Mudwart cheered as Kenshin walked past him.<br>
<br>
&quot;The name is Kenshin, that it is.&quot; Kenshin corrected the Troll.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trash.&quot; muddered Faentriel, still glaring at the object of her hate. It was just then when a Female Bard, halfelven of the Court of Crosswinds appeared before Mudwart, hugged him tightly, then ran off swiftly. Mudwart simply smiled to the attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trash you speak of me, that you do, however, your very husband is allowed to hug with Bards, that he is.&quot; Kenshin replied. Faentriel still scowed as they were teleported off.. on the trek to the Dragon Crypt.<br>
<br>
And so it began, all gathered within that old Crypt and the fighting began. Undead Dragons, Ratmen, small swarming bugs, snakes and all the like attacked them without mercy. Kenshin had his blade ready, it was as if he was awaiting this moment ever since he threw off the shell of Shintou. Fighting and slaughtering along side his comerads, his blade hot with the blood of his opponets. Many beings of the Nercopolis died that day due to their fighting, and this is where Kenshin found himself at home. Yes, it was hard for him to first draw his blade and fight, but once he drew it, the rest came Naturally. The Cut, the slash, the kill, even the Hate all returned. It was comforting, almost to be back in the state of combat, sword, hate, and comerads beside him. This is what came naturally to him, the fighting. The forest was comforting for a time, but after a while he became uneasy with it. Their was no uneasyness in this battle however, just fighting and fighting. <br>
<br>
But he did not find what truly shocked him untill after that battle was done. The finish of that assult led him back to his place in the Overthere.. well, on the way there..<br>
<br>
Until he ran into one little Paladin that Shintou had crossed in the past. A Elf named Korhil. The Hated Rival.<br>
<br>
The elf cared not about his problem. His 'Soul Searching'. The Paladin stood before the one, no matter his personality defects, that killed his child. This drove the Paladin deep within his vengeful hate and forced him to lash out against Kenshin.<br>
<br>
Kenshin acted as if he just wanted to fight for the challenge of battle, but he could feel those words being forced over his tounge, repressing what he wished to say.<br>
<br>
Unforutunity for Korhil, Shintou had been training while he fell in death, and fell behind. Kenshin, using these skills masterfully out danced the paladin in the fight, bringing him down with some effort, yes, but not with his full potiental. Watching the paladin cry out in pain from every slash was a .. dare I say it?<br>
A Joy for him. He felt the edge of his sword cut throught bone and flesh and it was a feeling that brought him to the realization.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the end for you, that it is.&quot; Kenshin spoke as Korhil struggled to stand up on his feet, cut and battered from the battle, he knew he was in a kill or be killed situation.<br>
<br>
Had this been a fight purly to test skill, Kenshin would of just left him there. He had already bested him.<br>
<br>
But thats not Kenshin's way.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will die now, that you shall. Malious.. Hand!&quot; Kenshin shouted, his fist glowing in a rageful green light. It burned brighter then ever before, even Shintou's Malious Hand of Lanys T'Vyl was no match. This is because the trueness of his sprit was in that hand, in that punch that tore open Korhil's chest...<br>
<br>
And in the release of energy that blew the elven body apart from the inside out, leaving only streams of blood to run down the helm of Kenshin. That battle began him down the right track to see..<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
So here he is now, Meditating... his eyes slowly opening as the meditation comes to a close.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Shintou, and he is me. That he is. .. Our sprits aren't seperated.. but they are intertwined.. I believe. Either. . really not able to exist with..<br>
<br>
Without the other.&quot;<br>
Fin.<br>

Just wait Roose, we'll both see how this plays out in the end. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And yes, he is an extremely talented writer, but don't let him know that, he might get an ego, or deny it.)) <p><center>

Part 5 -Final- (Somewhat Disturbing Images of Suffering, you've been warned. Not for the easily offended.)<br>
The armor we all wear to protect what we care deeply about.<br>
<br>
..The memories returned throught meditation. Unlocking the secrets of what was within him, slowly they began to flood his mind. Remembering his parents, remembering being a child again.. and remembering what Shintou had protected him from. The Darkerside of his childhood.. the side that his parents didn't show him the other day.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&quot;Raziel!~ Stop it thats enought!' Isabella cried out, tackling her husband to the earth. She had stumbled upon one of the many times Raziel had gotten to be alone with the halfbreed discrase he had to endure as his own 'stepson'. The boy of 4 was tied to a crusifix, that is to take two sticks in the form of a cross, then tie a person to the newly formed Cross renduring them helpless to any attack your cruel mind can think of. In this instance, young Kenshin was the target of his stepfathers cruelity.. his wrath brought on by being unable to have a pure son of his own.<br>
<br>
For after the Incident, Isabella never wished to copoulate ever again, the scars rung too deeply to ever engage in that act ever again. Raziel brought it all upon that child, whenever Isabella left them alone long enought, he took to his act, using his ice based spells to blast the helpless child, usign weak ones not to kill him, but to make the boy suffer throught the cold bite of his spells. The icy hate of Innoruuk was too much for little Kenshin to bear. The Child could not take such beatings, day in and day out.<br>
<br>
But Shintou could.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
The mind is an amazing organ, something so complex that hardly anyone truly understands all of its marvels. Even the one marvel of why it splits to protect itself from the extreme trauma that would only lead a person down a life of depression and dispear. Forming an entirely new ego out of the first, leaving nothing but sufferage and depression in the viod. Concieved by pain of ones own father. Birthed throught the observation of ones own parents death. Shaped throught the training of a man gone mad. These are the things that formed the ego known to the world only as Shintou Shinai. The man that could master hate, yet that couldn't handle defeat and failure.<br>
<br>
These things forced Shintou to fall into that void between egos, that viod of depression and self hatred. He was so unlike the ego that first created him.. Kenshin. The boy that survived only because the love of his mother. Kenshin began to see himself as he really was.. and because of that he truly understood Shintou as well. He took the pain and the memories from him and hid them deeply within that third ego of depression. Like a Protective shell saving him.. but thats not what Kenshin wanted.<br>
<br>
Finally he felt the pain of loss for himself. The resentment for what he was, why it caused his own father to strike at him out of hate. Why he had to watch his own family die because of what he was.<br>
<br>
These things rushed over him, finally unprotected from them by Shintou, he felt true hatred for himself. It was as if he was becomming that ego himself.. but then.<br>
<br>
He remembered. He refocused himself on the true problem, on how to deal with that void.. why was it still there?<br>
Had he not found out who he was.. and why it was such? All should be well.. right?.. No..<br>
<br>
Then he remembered. The crimes of Shintou.<br>
Not against life.. Kenshin knew he enjoyed killing those bastards who probably forsaked him just as his father did and those Guards that killed his parents before his young eyes as much as Shintou did. But their was one thing that he couldn't forgive himself for.<br>
The crimes against love. Those women foolish to fall in love with Shintou only were met with his words, and his unliving heart of stone. &quot;Love is for the weak.&quot; His words of sufferage to them.<br>
And with his own words he tormented and shattered the latest victum of this string of torment.<br>
<br>
The time for Meditation was over. He rose up, Kenshin did.. bearing the soul of Shintou as his armor and sword, that he did. Already he decided that it would be best to co-exist with his alter, letting their souls merge as one being, that being the only way that he could escape the viod of depression. Together they would make up for the short commings each had, together they would find strenght that they neither could find alone.<br>
<br>
And together, for their first task.. they would have to find her. Their was much to make up for.<br>
