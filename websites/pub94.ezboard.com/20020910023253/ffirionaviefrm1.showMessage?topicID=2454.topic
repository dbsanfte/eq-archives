<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
 Lots of words not in the dictionary would be &quot;proper&quot; in a Medieval setting (which EQ is not, no matter who tries to say so... for those insisting that, they -really- need to look at art and artifacts of the actual Medieval era).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Speaking of the artifacts, what is going on with the Siva decorations along the walls of the Eastern Karana gorge.  When I was but a young lad, I insisted that that was Karana &quot;herself&quot; as a not-so-subtle nod to the restorer-destroyer role of Siva in Hindu mythos.  Turns out, Karana is a doddering old man according the amazingly uninspiring artwork in my handy and up-to-date Guide to Kunark.<br>
<br>
Whoops.  <br>
<br>
Since then, I've had to adjust my view of Karana to fit in more with the other gods... specifically Tunare.  If Tunare is the Mother of All, and Karana's blessing bring life to Norrath, putting two and two together makes Karana the likely consort of Tunare.  Therefore, when it rains, Karana is doing his part to fertilize his lover (not wife, lover)<br>
<br>
But Karana is also the Storm, wiping clean the slate of ALL creations, good and bad.  It doesn't add up to much in the end, as it'll all come full circle over and over and over.<br>
<br>
(Making the mental picture of a Faydark rainstorm more... graphic... in many ways)<br>
<br>
So, make yourself and others as comfortable as you can, make their short time here a pleasant as possible.  After all, there is no need for any concept of salvation or an everlasting Self... *NOTHING* can stand in the face of the Storm.<br>
<br>
Karana is the Duality<br>
Karana is the Tao<br>
Karana is Destruction<br>
Karana is Rebirth<br>
<br>
Pass through the Eye of the Storm to Know these things.<br>
<br>
(Yes, I watched far too many Kung Fu movies as a child.  My Kung-Fu DVD collection is a wonder to behold.<br>
<br>
Has anybody put together a comprehensive, Silmarillion-esque guide to the history and dieties of Norrath/the Combine?  I know there used to be the War of the Gods post stickied, but I can't seem to find it any more.  Alas.)<br>

They are NOT Karana.<br>
<br>
You will find them up in Luclin outside the entry to the City of Shadows. They used to be on Norrath long ago.<br>
<br>
However, there was once a great war in the Rathe Mountain Passes between the gods when Rallos Zek tried to invade the plane of earth for the second time after his childer the ogres, were pushed back.<br>
<br>
All of the gods battled that day. Apart of that was a deep rivaly that goes between Solusek Ro the lord of flame and Luclin the godess of shadows. You'll notice there is &quot;Solusek's Eye&quot; and there is the &quot;Maiden's Eye&quot; up upon Luclin. Also note that you lose faction with Solusek Ro for killing in the Maiden's Eye. The Maiden's Eye was not always upon Luclin, why do you think there are so many ruins lying about? What was once on Luclin was once upon Norrath, hence the writings on the wall in the Eastern Karana Plains, nestled upon the wall within the chasm. <br>
<br>
One of those images on the left side leaving High Pass Hold, is Luclin herself, the maiden of shadow.<br>
<br>
From what I had managed to discover about EQ lore and the war, Solusek Ro despises Luclin partialy because she guards the prison of Rallos Zek and she also carries the book of Solusek Ro which is one of the three artifacts of the fourth hero of Trakanon's prophecy whi is ultimately to slay the Sleeper during a grand conjunction of the planes and heavens. (which in turn makes the opening storyline for EQ2).<br>
<br>
Solusek Ro felt it was cruel that Rallos Zek was made to watch the cursing of his children, and his response was to bend the dragonspine mountains which in turn brought the beating sun down upon what was then Tunaria, hence creating the desert of Ro, with the Oasis of Marr at its epicenter. For if the children of Rallos Zek were not going to be permitted to dwell upon Tunaria, then neither would any other.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I have my old Compendium (Codex of War) still backed up on my hard drive that details off this, including the beta documents that were guide handouts, along with all the screen captures that I took of important places. If anyone would ever like it, let me know. It is 17 meg's total (unzipped), and I will be more then happy to pass it along to anyone who wishes of it.<br>
<br>
You were correct, Karana is indeed takes the form of an elderly human male <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 469<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 5:02:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2454.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That isn't Karana...</span><hr size=1> Oh, on one more note...those designs showing the images of the children of Vex Thal and the Maiden of Shadows herself were not always there either. At one point in time, as you ran down the wall there was only one such image which stood by a tower on the right side.<br>
<br>
That image was the face of what appeared to be an elder man, which is also on the bridge in the Northern Karana plains. That image is none other then that of Tsaph Katta, former Combine Emporer and also a vampire who still walks the dreary halls of Katta Castellum. <br>
<br>
I am sure that it is not Karana by the way, as if you look at the barges that leave Faydwere for Kunark you will see the same face upon them as they head for the Maiden's Voyage. Also you can find that &quot;Elderly Visage&quot; up in Shadowhaven in the mages library (name escapes me at the moment). Also anyone ever notice how large that ship is? It is big enough easily for large humanoids to move through (I.E. Ogres and Trolls). Also notice the eagle/hawk insignia's in Kelethin and Felwithe, which also appear at the Temple of Life in Qeynos, and also seem very similiar to the Combine Insignia, no mistake there. <br>
<br>
If you remember the book that comes with Luclin it speaks of the Trolls and Ogres being there, and also the ogres were originally native to Faydwere but driven from the continent to Tunaria by Dagnor Butcherblock, the first King of Kaladim who once held the Butcherblock Hammer. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil<br>Look out! ...Rar! </span><br>  Posts: 438<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 5:16:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2454.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/CyrusVI/fullsize/keliskpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That isn't Karana...</span><hr size=1> That same face is also found on several ruins in Everfrost, Bane.

I do not recall seeing a face of Tsaph Katta (the old man) anywhere in Halas. I do recall seeing a &quot;shadowed woman&quot;'s face or &quot;young child&quot;s face on one of the wrecked temple like structures in everfrost. That could in fact be Quellious as humans left halas after the last act of Divine Intervention by the hand of Mithaniel Marr. Quellious was one of the deities involved in the Combine Empire.<br>
<br>
Unrest was once a Temple to Quellious which also acted as an embassy to the Kedge before the betrayal of Phinigel Atropos, which ended with the Kedge being transformed into a state of undeath, and Dagnor's Cauldron being &quot;sealed&quot; to the sea.<br>
<br>
You will also note that the face that is in EverFrost looks different from the face on in the chasm. It was interesting that you mentioned it to be Quellious. Until now, I always wondered who it was. Quellious however makes perfect sense as do those temple like structures and monuments that float about. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaeona.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caeona</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.midsouth.rr.com/yamahaman/lostboy/ff8gifs/Ellone.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 8:30:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2454.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That isn't Karana...</span><hr size=1> A very enlightening discussion indeed...thanks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=soulous>Soulous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 9:23:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2454.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That isn't Karana...</span><hr size=1> I just simple thought that Karana was helping spread the gifts from The Father, what better way to move disease and death but by water and wind..... <p>Soulous Plaguebearer

I have absolutly no idea why this is so. They all know, Karana, Bringer of Storms, or whatever, but most get the actual gender wrong. Makes the whole RP a bit more difficult when I have to go &quot;Um dude/ette, Karana is a guy. Tunare is the female.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nono, I'm sure Karana is a female.&quot;<br>
&quot;Look buddy, I'm the Cleric of Karana, trust me on this.&quot;<br>
<br>
And also, what up with both druids AND clerics? Seems a bit redundent to me...<br>

<br>
Did you ever see the anime X?  I should study to see if there's any eastern philosophy like presented in that movie...but in it, there were two sides, the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth.  The Dragons of Heaven wanted to work with humankind and protect them, teaching them to preserve the earth in order to ensure the future.  The Dragons of Earth wanted no deal with humanity, and seeked to wipe the earth clean of its presence so that it could heal.  Both sides sought the best interest of the earth, but both sides had different ways of getting to that goal.<br>
<br>
This is how I see the Unkempt Preservers.  I plan on doing more studying on them later...I don't think they ever got the guy to work that is supposed to come along and let you join, but I don't know.  I see them like the Forestals in the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant books...more interested in the protection of their lands than silly notions of good or evil, right or wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugnosisgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GnosisGnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/31/02 2:06:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2454.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gods of Norrath - Karana Question</span><hr size=1> I would just like to point out to all the nancyboy Karana worshippers out there:<br>

Not too much so.  They tend to serve two different functions in society, really.  Clerics will (usually) be found in more urbane, &quot;developed&quot; societies, where the immediate connection to the land is more removed from the general populace.  In essence, the clerics serve the faithful to a particular codified doctrine.<br>
<br>
Druids will serve groups with a more immediate, direct link to the land.  Reliance is more on tradition and lore than on sacred texts in this case, ritual is used to directly invoke the diety instead of prayer being used to ask for intervention.<br>
<br>
The power of the druid lies in the direct tie to nature (in essence, a zen state of recognition of the interconnectivity of all living things).  The druid uses ritual to channel the power of the diety that is infused in the natural world THROUGH himself.<br>
<br>
The cleric uses prayer and scared texts to open a channel of communication between the individual and the divine.  It's a more personal, but less intimate arrangement, if that makes sense.  Hence, the stereotype that clerics are uptight and stodgy (ahem, High Elves) and druids are more wild and charged with a sexual energy (WOO HOO!  Wood Elves!)<br>
<br>
Look at Qeynos.  The clerics and paladins serve the city folk.  But, as you go further out into the Plains of Karana, you start to see more and more of the druids' influence.<br>
<br>
If you can see a person getting dressed up in some ornate chain to listen to a sermon, they are likely serviced by a cleric.  If you see them cavorting naked in the rain with a deer skull on their head, hopped up on psychodelic mushrooms, likely they hang with the druids.<br>
<br>
Just my hasty generalization.  Now where's my deer skull and mushrooms?<br>
