<br>
It was a tone those of the temple knew well. &quot;When she is icy, or raging,&quot; the novices would whisper &quot;You have a chance. When she becomes calm, and her voice is reasonable ...then pray to Thule for all you are worth... &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How nice of you to come and see me. Do have a seat?&quot;<br>
<br>
She watched, as the young shadowknight continued to stand before her. Her nostrils flared a little, seeking the telltale scent of fear. <br>
<br>
&quot;This came for me High Priestess.  I brought it to you right away&quot;  He handed her the letter.<br>
<br>
Littany scanned the contents once, then slowing re-read it again. She looked up at D'Ron Karr, and a faint smile grew in the edges of her eyes. It was not, to be honest, a very nice smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, the bard persists.  Meledi is not one to admit that she is helpless in a situation, she has this obsessive, urgent need to take action.  How....quaint. She seeks to see Tanare once more.  This is amusing.&quot; Littany's voice took on a certain edge.  &quot;Given that I can hardly get anyone within the temple to tolerate being in the room with that ranger long enough to maintain a proper guard. I have never had so many priests have urgent need to take leave, so many novices with sudden illnesses, so many priestesses walking around with strained looks on their faces.  I have even prayed to Lord Cazic to ask it the sacrifice is suitable, to send a sign... and nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; By all means D'Ron Karr, arrange to have Meledi come to visit our humble temple - to be with Tanare.  Let her think you do this without my knowledge out of the ..&quot; a faint scorn creeps into her voice &quot; goodness of your heart or softness of you head, I care not which.&quot;<br>
<br>
Littany waved a hand in dismissal, and as D'Ron Karr left the room he heard a small laugh from the High Priestess. The very air seemed to grow darker and chill at the sound.<br>

into the Paineel city yard, judged her distance <br>
away from the skeleton guards, Heridion and<br>
Mebuknar, of whom she was very afraid, and<br>
snuck back to the entrance to the Warrens. <br>
Heridion himself (or itself?) had struck her<br>
quite a blow the other day, which left her trembling.<br>
<br>
&quot;I, Aurwena Kondratieva, promise to try and save<br>
Tanare, whatever the cost may be,&quot; she whispered<br>
to the silence of the meditative pool. Her Camouflage,<br>
given to her by the other Human Ranger, had worn<br>
off, and she was plotting her next move. However,<br>
Zek had not given her a sign of what that was to<br>
be. Neither had Veeshan or Zeboxurok, for that matter.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a vision flashed before her eyes: A lovely<br>
Erudite woman, kneeling before an altar in prayer<br>
or meditation, suddenly raised her head and sniffed<br>
the air. Aurwena suspected that what the lady was<br>
smelling was fear--Aurwena's own fear. The young<br>
Ranger swallowed hard. Did the Erudite know she<br>
was in Paineel? Would she send the skeletons to<br>
kill her on sight? Aurwena tried to hide, but to no<br>
avail. She would have to either enter the Warrens<br>
or the city, and neither option seemed agreeable.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/17/03 10:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> To Meledi Weaver<br>

Dear Meledi<br>
<br>
I am sorry to hear that your talks with High Priestess Littany D'Thule did not work out.   It is unfortunate that this has to be, had the temple not burned down along with the city there would have been no need for the dedication of a new temple.   <br>
<br>
I am indeed fond of Tanare, as I belive you suspect,  and have grown to like her even more as time passes by.  <br>
She is being housed comfortably, given appropriate food and drink, and is well guarded.  No harm will come to her, at least until the Cereamony of Moondark.<br>
<br>
For now, she waits happily for her new ceramonial robe to be trailored for her, and also with her own sewing.<br>
I have brought her some sewing supplies and she has begun to actually attain some skill in the art of tailoring herself.<br>
<br>
I have thought long and hard upon your request.  It does not seem to be an unreasonable one.<br>
Tanare, I am sure would be most happy to see you, and to show you her new skills as well.  She remains unaware of her situation, though I have tried to explain it to her.  For now, we simply try to keep her happy. <br>
  <br>
I will make the necessary arrangements that will allow me to safely escort you to her, but we will have to do so within a tight timeframe.   You will need to come alone and unarmed.  <br>
I will be waiting for you at the Pillar of Knowledge that is just outside the tunnel leading to Paineel, tomarrow at four PM, Paineel time.  That is slightly before I assume my guard duty, and my own presence in the area will not be suspected.   You will just need to follow me and remain invisable.<br>
<br>
Yours also, <br>
D'Ron Karr<br>

<br>
 Tanare was rather happy to hear that she had a letter when the servant arrived in the room where she was still waiting for a fitting for her new dress. The servant for some reason refused to stay long , in fact he came in, tossed the note on the table and left saying nothing more than &quot;This is for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
  She was of course,completely unaware of the idea that the servants' fear to be exposed to her babbling for any extended period of time was indirectly the exact sort of fear Littany had hopes that Tanare herself would be feeling during her stay. Tanare however just thought there were lots of them around and they had to take turns because they all wanted to see just how cute she really was.<br>
<br>
   Openning the note Tanare sat down amidst the pelts, some of which actually had straight seams in them as her sewing had improved though her alcohol had run out and she feared for her sewing results without it. Smiling she realized it was from D'ron Karr <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>i knew evil dronky didn't kill him</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought as she sat to read.<br>
<br>
   A few hours later, after many breaks from boredom as she tried to make her way through the lengthy letter- the same boredom of book reading which kept her from passing the druidic initiation testing when she was old enough to choose a profession- to her mother's dismay at the time though Tanare was not aware of that, she sat back and considered what she had read.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hmm it sounds like Dronky and evil Dronky were like fighting and stuff. First he sounds like the nice dronky but then he sounds like the bad one, and he like even says his name a lot when he's writing like he's not really him or something.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Tanare thought, the very effort threatening to overwhelm her brain. Then suddenly &quot;understanding&quot; dawned on her.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh I get it now.... there's only one dronky...BUT he like got hit in the head or something so he keeps forgetting if he's a pally guy or a shadowy knight guy so that's why he keeps writing his own name down so he can like remember who he is, unless he can't and thinks that he's someone else. Just like cousin Eddy who fell off the treehouse and thought he was a dwarf until someone else the orcy guy hit him in the head again...but then he throught he was an orc so he ran home with them and they like killed him... Poor Eddy.<br>
<br>
   Oh wait i was talking about Dronky, so since he got hit in the head- must have been one of those bad doggies, he keeps changing from pally guy to shadowy guy. I'll have to like help him and stuff. I STILL say they should just like write Cazicy god guy a letter asking for him to let them do that big word thingy to the temple. Maybe Lord Thule will know his address when he comes to the party, i wonder if Cazicy knows that Lord Thule has the same last name as him? But wait that Littany person has that same name too, maybe she's like his daughter or something. I don't know why Evil Dronky thinks i have to like die and stuff, that's silly. Oh i guess i should write back to Dronky, maybe pally Dronky will be awake when he gets it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   Coming to the table she took out a piece of paper and began to concentrate as she prepared to write her letter, as usual the tip of her tongue peeking out of the corner of her mouth as she wrote.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Dear Dronky<br>
<br>
   &quot;I knew evil Dronky didn't kill you like he said he would cause he said i wouldn't like see you again, but then you said you'd be at the moondarky party thingy. Anyways, I figured out that like there isn't two of you and stuff but i think you might need to see a healy person. Cause you like got hit in the head and stuff so now you think you're a pally guy and a shadowy guy, even though the shadowy guy person doesn't like the pally guy part so he says like mean stuff and ...stuff which being a pally guy you wouldn't do.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh for all the facty pointy things you said i like read them and realized that shadowy guy is like wrong and stuff. I saw shadowy you like tell the skele guy to like go away and it like exploded and stuff, just like evil you said pally guys do. And of course we went into the temple place of that cazic guy- why he keeps his temple in a dress shop i don;t know but that must be why he's like a gody guy and stuff. You figured since you had a mighty and tough ranger with you that we could like destroy the evil temple place  cause there WAS 2 of us and all, until we found out about the dress shop here.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I guess that temple stuff is like boring and all so that's why Littany person went into dress making cause she was bored and all and the Honory peopls probably made fun of her dresses before so she don't like them now so that's why she was making fun of my badge thingy the other day when we saw her. And you like wanted me to give her dresses a chance cause you felt bad for her like a pally guy does so you put the chain thingy on me so i wouldn't get bored and leave the shop before i got to try on the dress and all.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Then she's having a big party for her father Lord Thuley, see i didn't realize they were related til you wrote their names down so now i know why she wants to make sure the party is like perfect and stuff so she don't get her father mad. I guess he must be related to Cazicy guy even though most gody guys don't have kids...well Tunare did but Firiona doesn't like me cause she's jealous that i'm much cuter than she is, and i think she liked her mother's old name better before she changed it because she thought i was so cute.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Anyways, just cause i'll be cuter than all the other peoples there with my new dress is no reason for them to want to kill me even if they are jealous and stuff at how cute i am and stuff. Big foreheady peoples don't like getting dirty and if we like fought and stuff they'd have blood and stuff all over the place and mess up their dresses and suits and everything. Of course i'd win cause i AM a mighty and tough ranger and stuff.<br>
<br>
   &quot;But i don't know if you can be my date for the moondarky party though, mother doesn't like me going on dates and stuff with people she hasn't met first. Unless you want to go visit her and all. Just make sure you don't think you're shadowy Dronky though cause she'll like get mad and stuff. Last time she got mad was right before father died and she found him swimming with that snobby elf girl. I mean just because they left their clothes on the shore so they wouldn;t get wet while they were swimming wasn't any reason for mother to get mad i don't think. <br>
<br>
   &quot;Anyways she like fired a spell as the elfy girl did a magic poofy spell and then we heard that Crushy Emperor's castle like got blown apart by some big lightening bolt thingy and rocks and doors and towers went flying everywhere and smooshed some evil orcys too. Everyone said mother did it...father didn't come back home for a week for some reason but he brought lots of presents for us all when he did!<br>
<br>
   &quot;So anyways, try to go see a healy person so you can stop thinking your like shadowy guy and stuff. Maybe you should like try banging your head against a stone wall or something. I think someone told me that works sometimes.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Ok have to go back to my sewing so i can have a whole outfit finished for you when you like come by for the party. See you then byebye!<br>
<br>
    Tanare<br>
<br>
P.S.- don't worry i'm still cute as ever!&quot;<br>
<br>
  Smiling proudly at the end of her letter, not noticing the sweat on her forehead and the effort the letter writing took, she sealed it and wrote &quot;To Dronky&quot; on the outside and yelled for someone to come into the room. Realizing she wouldn't stop as the spell casters of Paineel began to mutter to themselves, the same servant hesitantly returned to the room.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes what are you yelling about?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh goodie you're like here and stuff. Anyways i have this letter i have to send to Dronky but i can't go without losing my place in line so could you like find the bardy peoples and give them the letter to them so they could like send it to him?&quot; she asked smiling brightly at the underling holding out the letter.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Um, yes of course.&quot; the servant replied taking the note and proceeding to turn around quickly and leave the room as Tanare's thanks echoed behind him.<br>
<br>
   Breathing a sigh of relief at his escape, the servant turned to head to where the bard held court before stopping and deciding <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps the High Priestess might be interested in this</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Nodding to himself- hoping that perhaps if this act pleased her he'd be taken off the elf's guard rotation until after the moondark was over, the servant made his way to Littany's office chambers, knowing better than interrupt her in her private shrine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/03 9:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1>  Dronkarr walks into the tunnels to the Warrens looking for the young lady he saw earlier, woundering where she is.<br>

 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Sir, I see you are a very well-armored fighter. A friend of mine is in serious danger, and I need to try and enter Paineel so I can rescue her. What occupation is yours?'<br>
<br>
 You say, 'That of a fighter, how may I help you?   You say you want  to enter  Paineel?'<br>
 Aurwena's skin turns hard as wood.<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Yes, and I appreciate your help, sir. The guards of this city scowl at me, so I will need a brave one like yourself to help me sneak past them.'<br>

 You say, 'So I take it you have not killed enough of the Kobolds to win their favor....'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Do you, perhaps, have a potion of Invisibility or two that we can drink, and both sneak past the guards? No, I have not, though I have killed many.'<br>
 Aurwena begins to cast a spell.<br>
 Aurwena's skin turns hard as wood.<br>
 You say, 'No, I do not, but I know one who does....'<br>
 You say, 'but why the rush?'<br>
 You say, 'Who is this one you are worried about?'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Who is it? I am in a great hurry because my instincts, given to me by the Mixed Triad, have told me this fellow Ranger, named Tanare, is slated to die very soon.'<br>
 Chomp, chomp, chomp...  Aurwena takes a bite from a Vegetables.<br>

 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'The wind whispered it to me. I live in exile, in Qeynos, and when I was there, I heard the call of the wild speak her name. I am sure of it--Zek, Zeboxurok, and Veeshan have never led me astray yet!'<br>

 You say, 'Well, I can lead you back up through these tunnels, but you will have to wait for me to get someone to lead you the rest of the way.'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'I will do that, milord.'<br>
 You say, 'And I might be able to find someone who knows where she is while there, follow me.'<br>

&lt;They make their way over to the pathway bordering the Hole that leads to the Paineel elevator.&gt;   <br>
 You say, 'Wait here, I will be back as soon as possable, just have patience'<br>

With that, D'Ron walked over to the elevator, keying it, intending to report to, and enlist Littany's aid.<br>

Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'No, milord.'<br>
 Dronkarr sits down at the table.<br>
 You say, 'Well come over here and rest a minute'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Paineel is indeed a fine city, milord. I enjoy its austerity.'<br>
 You say, 'Ah, my apologies for the meager fair, but I am all out of my other food items, I will remedy that later.'<br>
<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Thank you.'<br>
 Chomp, chomp, chomp...  Aurwena takes a bite from a Ration.<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  Aurwena takes a drink from a Water Flask.<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'I have not seen the one for whom I am looking yet. Where is the prisoner, Tanare?'<br>
 You say, 'You look tired, I am supprised you have taken on this task of yours to rescue Tanare, especially at your age.'<br>
  You say, 'I do know where she is, but I figured that you could use a bit of a rest first'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'I know, but the urgency of the need for rescue struck me. Everyone was talking about her impending doom, and I considered it my duty to try and save this poor lady. Thank you for considering my welfare, sir..I was quite tired '<br>
 You say, 'Well, we will rest here for a bit before I bring you over to where she is'<br>

 Chomp, chomp, chomp...  Aurwena takes a bite from a Roots.<br>
 Dronkarr eyes Aurwena critically.<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Mmm, a Roots chaser! Dessert comes well after Rations.'<br>

 Aurwena raises an eyebrow.<br>
 You say, 'I never thought of roots as a dessert.'<br>
  You say, 'More like a vegetable...'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Sir, have you won the favor of the Heretics here? You must have, because in order to show me where Tanare is, you must get past the Heretics. These Roots were slightly sweet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  '<br>
 You say, 'Ah, I see.'<br>
 Dronkarr continues to apprase Aurwena...Thinks to himself  *Now how do I get her weapons away from her without causing her physical harm....ah...perhaps...no, she is impatient...<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'After you take me to Tanare, will you show me the way back to the Warrens? The bloodlust for vengeance rises in me, and I want to slay the ones who slew me before.'<br>
<br>
 You say, 'So you want to kill more Kobolds?'<br>
 Aurwena nods at Dronkarr.<br>
 You say, 'Humm, I could do that I suppose.'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'They are vile, primitive beasts, and their molars are very valuable. They also carry bronze weapons, which I love to sell to merchants for substantial pay.'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr smiles at Aurwena  <br>
 You say, 'How are you feeling now?'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Refreshed, and ready to slaughter those Kobold fiends.'<br>
 You say, 'Well, yes, we can go slaughter the kobolds after we see Tanare.'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Ah, yes! I almost forgot my mission! Righteous anger can cloud one's thinking sometimes, eh?'<br>

 Dronkarr moves over to the table and lays his mace down on it.<br>
 You say, 'If we are to even see Tanare we must not arouse suspicion'<br>
 You say, 'And you must look like my prisoner.'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'I see '<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'What must I do to assume the disguise?'<br>
 You say, 'Find a spot in here to hide your weapons '<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'All right.'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Done.'<br>
 You say, 'Now let me see...&lt;rumages in a nearby chest&gt;'<br>
 You say, '&lt;pulls out a pair of shackles that are obviously too large  and eyes them critically&gt;'<br>
 It begins to rain.<br>
 You say, 'Oh well, these will have to do for now...just make sure they do not fall off'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'I'll make sure, my lord.'<br>
 You say, 'Your hands behind your back please'<br>
 Aurwena places her hands behind her back.<br>
 Dronkarr slips the manicles on, and locks them.<br>
 Targeted (Player): Aurwena<br>
 '&lt;but they actually fit rather well.&gt;'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Is the coast clear, sir?'<br>
 '&lt;Unseen he has put a smaller sized pair on.&gt;'<br>
 You say, 'Yes, follow me please....'<br>
 Aurwena says, in Elvish, 'Aye, sir.'<br>
 Dronkarr walks down the hallway turning his head slightly so he can see her.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------<br>
 <br>
<br>
 You say, 'They arrive in the basement cell area and D'Ron stops at the Guard Captain's desk.'<br>
 You say, '&quot;I have a new prisoner sir, she needs to be assigned a cell we can put her in.'<br>
 You say, 'One near or next to Tanare's'<br>
<br>
 The Guard Captain nodds and stands up, pulling out a large key ring, and proceeds to lead them down the row of cells, two other guards fall in behind them'<br>
 The Captain opens the cell door and stands there, waiting<br>
 Aurwena looks around, confused. Tanare? Where are you? I don't see you in here.'<br>
<br>
 D'Ron slips to the side out of the way of the door.  The two guards behind Aurwena wait to see if she walks in..'<br>
 You say, 'These are your new quarters My Lady.'<br>
 You say, '((notice the 'weapon' he has in hand now)'<br>
 Aurwena is looking at your equipment...<br>
 You say, 'The Captain, D'Ron and the two guards all look at Aurwena.'<br>
<br>
 Aurwena steps into the cell.<br>
 Aurwena says, 'Gosh, it's dark in here, even with my good night vision. Thank you, my lord, for your kind hospitality, and...?! &lt;her heart skips&gt; A Sarnak War Braid? That weapon is quite weak, sir.'<br>
<br>
 You say, 'Ah, yes, that it is.  And fortunately I do not have to use it.'<br>
The guard captain closes the door with a resounding clank, and there is the sound of a lock bolt sliding into place from the otherside of the door.'<br>
<br>
 You say, 'I will see if Tanare is awake so that the two of you can talk...but I am afraid you will not be able to see her.'<br>
<br>
 Aurwena nods at Dronkarr.<br>
 Aurwena thanks Dronkarr heartily.<br>
<br>
D'Ron looks into Tanare's cell, then returns to the barred window in Aurwena's cell.<br>
<br>
'I am sorry My Lady, but she is asleep.  You will have to wait until later to talk with her.   And I must be going, I have some chores to do....I hope your stay here will be pleasent.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that he turned and started to walk back the way he had come.<br>

Only a small suspicion of moisture in the corner, and Tanare at least had a bed and table.  The shackles on the wall were unfortunately not very rusty, and had a serious look about them.<br>
<br>
She had known that it would be a trap, and come unarmed fully expecting it. D'Ron Karr had met her outside Paineel.  Again, it was a shock to think that a shadowknight could look so much like a Paladin. But then and again, appearances could be deceptive. Well she knew this. D'Ron Karr had seemed only slightly surprised as she had changed - perhaps he thought that it was a spell or enchantment.<br>
<br>
It was the first time in over a year that she had taken off her mask and revealed her true heritage to any. Gray knew, it was partly this that had allowed their friendship. And of course her half sister Kyrial had always known the truth, although their human mother would never speak of the details. But the skin of a Teir Dal was accepted in Paineel, and so for a short while she had show the only legacy her father had left her... <br>
<br>
D'Ron Karr then in his strangely gracious way escorted her inside.  The click of the bolt behind her however was the tell tale, he still served the Priestess of Thule. <br>
<br>
She knew the League would have thought this act of hers rash, and stopped her if they had realized her intent. But, she had to do something - and sometimes desperate plans could work.<br>
<br>
She put her mask back on, realizing however that she would alarm Tanare if she did not look as always. The child was sleeping, her face innocent ... her lips moving only slightly as she talked inside her dreams. A doll cuddled in the crook of her arm, and a few half sewn pelt were strewn around.<br>
<br>
It was time to wake her now.. she leaned over, and gently shook the ranger. <p><img border=0 src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/meledi-sig.jpg" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/03 5:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> The cell next to Tanare's was chilly and damp, and<br>
Aurwena's heart beat wildly with fear as she realized<br>
what had happened. The Paladin had tricked her. <br>
<br>
He, D'ron Karr, had imprisoned her in a cell next<br>
to Tanare's, shackles and all, instead of letting her<br>
rescue the poor young Ranger she had come to save.<br>
Now Aurwena was a prisoner herself, and she was<br>
afraid. She had never been so uncertain, nor so<br>
ashamed of herself. But she had thought D'ron Karr good!<br>
<br>
The young Wood Elf slipped into an uneasy doze,<br>
hearing the voice of one of the Triad, Veeshan, roar<br>
at her with the impatience of a rabid kobold:<br>
<br>
&quot;You've forgotten my motto already, my dear! Look out<br>
for number one! Even though you don't even have your<br>
Camouflage spell yet, you stole off to Paineel and <br>
attempted to rescue this Ranger you don't even know?<br>
I should think that such foolhardy actions were beyond<br>
your wise mind, but now I know otherwise, Kondratieva!<br>
<br>
Here's the deal: Tanare, this muddle-headed Wood Elf<br>
that's even more naive and stupid than you've been (FAR<br>
more naive and stupid, in my opinion!), is to be sacrificed.<br>
She is to be killed in the name of Cazic-Thule to dedicate<br>
the Temple of Terror to him. Tanare will die soon, unless<br>
this Meledi Weaver, a very sentient Bard, rescues her.<br>
<br>
Do not attempt to rescue Tanare anymore. Get out if you<br>
can! You are pardoned for your rash actions this time, <br>
but Zek and I desire more foresight and patience from<br>
our warriors. Zeboxurok is alarmed at what you've done,<br>
also. See how you've dismayed your new Triad, dear!&quot; <br>
<br>
In her dreams, Aurwena wept, trembling with fear and shame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen,&quot; said Veeshan. &quot;You have one more Cloudy Potion<br>
left, that that false Paladin has given to you in order to hide<br>
you from the Heretics of Paineel and the guards. Use it to<br>
your advantage! Escape! Run! Hide, or who knows what <br>
the High Priestess Littany will do with you after Tanare's<br>
dead! That dupe has no future, but you do. Now, flee, my <br>
Kondratieva, before Moondark comes! I'm with you, child!&quot; <br>
<br>
Aurwena awoke with a start, rattling her tight iron chains. <br>
Could she escape, or even reach her last Cloudy Potion?<br>

<br>
What did Littany mean about Meledi not being missed in the League of Honour?  Had something befallen his Guildmistress as she was attending to her regular duties in the League of Antonican Bards that she had gone out to do this morning?<br>
<br>
Questions buzzed in his mind though his, at that time, erudite face smiled at the Priestess of Fear.  Having devoted so much time to cleansing the planes of Nightmare, Hate, Torment, Decay, and Disease, had he lost sight of the battles needed fighting back home?  These questions needed answers and the Phantasmist knew exactly where to begin.<br>
<br>
Heading to the guildmaster of the Antonican Bards in New Tanaan, Oligith adopted the form of a Lord of Kelethin in all his finery and using an enchantment to improve the guildmaster's feelings towards him, requested to discover where Meledi had been sent that morning.  And to please bring the results found to the enchanter known as Oligith Fandarel in hall above Darian's Bar in Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
Knowing that would take some time, Oligith next proceeded to Shadowhaven and the Halls of the League of Honour above Darian's Bar to check on the comings and goings of the members of the League.  Memebers were supposed to note when they arrived and went in a book made available for this purpose, but just as the enchanter himself had been lax in doing so, so had the other Legionairres.<br>
<br>
Frustrated after searching for a while for clues in the guildhall, a knock on the door gained the enchanter's attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir?&quot;  a young druid stood at the door to the League Halls wearing a light tunic and sporting a rusty scimatar.  The enchanter sighed and waved the young wood elf in as he plopped down at a table.  Looking down, Oligith noticed he still appeared as a Lord of Kelethin.  With a thought, he dismissed the illusion and said, &quot;What can I do for you young one?&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid, startled but determined, reached into a sack at his waist and retrieved a paper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, I seek to deliver this note to an Oligith Fandarel of the League of Honour on behalf of the League of Antonican Bards.&quot;<br>
<br>
Realizing that this was a new adventurer attempting to earn some monies by serving the bards just as he himself had done all those years ago, the Koada'Dal enchanter grinned and handed over ten platinum for the note to the astonishment of the druid.<br>
<br>
Reading the note, Oligith scowled.  The note read,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>To: Oligith Fandarel<br>

Re:  Meledi Weaver<br>
<br>
I have been instructed to inform you that Meledi Weaver was not on duty for the League of Antonican Bards this morning and has requested a leave of absense in her duties for an undetermined period of time.<br>
<br>

<br>
Oligith dismissed the young druid who had already departed with a wave of his hand as he scowled.  He was out of leads...almost.  Littany had taunted him today that Meledi was missing, well then, the first place to look would be where this priestess of Cazic Thule lives.<br>
<br>
Leaving a note where the other Officers of the League of Honour would see it stating where he was going and why, Oligith swept out of the guildhall quickly.<br>

At first she had thought it was one of the servants or perhaps Dronkarr who was awaking her. Sleep fading from her eyes she realized it was Meledi standing before her. Looking around quickly she first thought that perhaps the long wait for her dress was just a dream and that she was in her rooms at the League Inn. However a quick look around proved otherwise.<br>
<br>
  Smiling up at the mistrel Tanare said, &quot;Hiyas Meledy singy person are you here for a new dress too? Cause if you are you can't like cut in line or nothing cause i've been waiting a long time and stuff for mine so i'm first. Why Dronky even bought me some pelty things in case i got bored and wanted to make my own and stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Then she paused before looking around as if trying to see if anyone else could hear her before adding, &quot;You should be careful though, i think one of the bad kobold doggies hit Dronky in the head too hard cause sometimes he thinks he's a shadowy knight- and that DOESN'T mean he's a pally guy that only works at night either. He like tries to be mean and stuff when that happens.&quot; Tanare added nodding at this important clarification she remembered from her earlier talk.<br>
<br>
   Remembering something else she added &quot;So like does this mean the party thingy is going to happen soon? Cause i know you were like invited and stuff so if the guesty peoples are starting to show up it must be soon then right? Did Willy or Sergy say they were coming too? Or Zippy? I hope i get my dress in time cause like these clothes sort of need to be like...washed and stuff and would look icky if i had to go to the party wearing THIS! I mean Lord Thuley might think that Cazic will be mad or something if i don't wear something cute, cause then he might not write the letter i told him he should so he can get the new temply place built cause killing peoples would be like way messy and stuff.&quot;<br>

<br>
Traveling quickly using the pillars of knowledge, the enchanter arrived at the entrance to Paineel realizing that he didn't have a key to the entrance.  Pondering for a moment, he turned and proceeded to the guards that he remembered seeing near the entrance to the lair of the kobolds of the region.<br>
<br>
The skeletons stood impassively as the now-erudite approached.  Oligith decided to ask Guard Heridion for a key and cast a spell causing Heridion to regard him amiably.  The guard handed over the key without a second thought.<br>
<br>
Cloaking himself in invisibility as he still didn't know the whereabouts of Littany nor her minions, the enchanter entered the Heratic city of Paineel.  Oligith passed by several inhabitants who, to his suprise, had the appearance of just waking instead of heading off to sleep for the day.  Slightly annoyed, the enchanter continued on through the dark passages of Paineel until he found what he was looking for.<br>
<br>
An old dark elf sat alone in a corner.  Dropping the invisibility with a thought, Oligith cast a quick spell on the man and sat down next to him.  Jerith, the old dark elf, glanced at Oligith and smiled, revealing slightly pointed teeth. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes?  What can Jerith do for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I need some information, my good friend Jerith.  I seek the whereabouts of a priestess of Cazic Thule known as Littany or perhaps simply where she has taken up residence recently.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh I know of this High Priestess Littany.  She holds high favor with Lord Thule and will be sanctifying the new temple of our Lord during the ceremony of Moondark,&quot; the old dark elf beemed with anticpation.  &quot;Rumor has it that she has a fine lightbringer for the sacrifice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meledi!  Startled but not daring to show it, Oligith hid his feelings with a cough before forcing a seemingingly delighted smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;That is good news.  Now where might I find the residence of Littany?&quot;<br>
<br>
Under the thrall of the charm, Jerith didn't think it odd that a supposed resident of Paineel would ask such a question, and responded happy to be able to help his best friend, &quot;You'll likely find her in the Tabernacle of Terror.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oligith thanked the old man and glanced around.  Seeing no one near, he broke the charm he had on Jerith who immediately realized what had just happened and lept at the enchanter in fury.  Batting feebly against the powerful runes protecting Oligith, he couldn't prevent the enchanter from casting the sleep spell.  With one more incantation on the old dark elf, Oligith knew Jerith wouldn't remember ever meeting him.<br>
<br>
Renewing the cloak of invisibility, Oligith crept quickly to the Tabernacle of Terror.  Following a servant into the building, the enchanter was very careful to make certain that his presence would not be known to any who might see through his invisibility.  Intent on finding where Meledi might be imprisoned...it had to be Meledi! ....Oligith hunted for another opportunity to find information.  Eventually, he found one.<br>
<br>
A single erudite man was walking down the hallway.  Invisible, Oligith followed him closely all the way into a small room at the end of the hall.  After the man locked the door behind him, Oligith looked around and noticed the room was a lavoritory.  Before he could unfasten his belt, Oligith began casting his spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh pardon me,&quot; the man was startled, &quot;I didn't see you in here.  I'll just...&quot;<br>
<br>
Oligith cut him off, &quot; Oh no.  It is I who should apologize.  I forgot to lock the door behind me, but I have finished.  If you'll excuse me....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dzan Amo,&quot; Dzan helpfully provided in the pause.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Dzan Amo.  I am most embaressed.  I must have been rushing too fast because it was my turn to bring lunch to the intended sacrifice of the Moondark, and I am late to retrieve it.  What is worse, I don't even know where to take the food after I obtain it!&quot;  Oligith put on the air of being highly distressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all right.  I had to bring her some animal pelts not too long ago and know exactly where to find her.  If you'll just give me a moment, I'll be glad to lead you there,&quot; Dzan said helpfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!  I could never live down the shame of having to be led to her room.  If you could just give me some good directions...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dzan Amo was very helpful and gave very good directions before Oligith put him to sleep in the Lavoritory and wiped his memory of the entire episode.<br>
<br>
Traveling quickly and invisible, the enchanter found the door and listened... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Sage Koada'dal Phantasmist of the 64th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oligith>Oligith</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/untitled.gif" BORDER=0> at: 11/20/03 1:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/21/03 7:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> D'Ron Karr sat in a darkened corner of the temple, meditating, and deep in prayer. <br>
He had already given prayerful aknowledgement to Cazic Thule, but now concentrated upon the god that he served.<br>
Purging his mind of unneeded thoughts and desires, he began to pull upon the forces of shadow to aid him in his tasks.  <br>
His eyes glowed underneath closed lids,  his muscles bulged and his presence carried a strong flavor of menace which grew as he meditated.  He then opened his eyes and pulled out his spell book, memorizing the spells that he would use and stood up, casting his servent, and then casting upon himself.  <br>
He remorized a couple of more spells then set off to start upon his next tasks, his aura reeking of grimness and the scent of death.  A stray thought flickered in his mind and he almost laughed.  <br>
*Like it is a real challange to terrorize and threaten teenagers....well maybe Tanare, but..certainly he didn't last very long again Baron Drayco the other day.   Littany and her pride over practically, well that was a cleric of Thule for you, no fear....when perhaps there should have been.*<br>
<br>
He nodded to the guard to open the cell, and then stepped in along with two other guards, the guard with the key locking it behind him.   The two guards approached Aurwena and unlocked her manicles, then stood to either side of her.<br>
D'Ron wearing his black armor and the whip on his side, then spoke.<br>
&quot;You will divest yourself of all armor and any weapons still concealed upon yourself.  You may still wear your underpadding for decency's sake. <br>
If you fail to do this, the armor will be forceably  removed off of you and you will be punished.  He let his aura of menace expand upon her as he rested his hand upon the Sarnak War Braid, then unlimbered it and cracked it's tip against the side of the wall next to her face, making her jump a bit.<br>
He watched and smiled grimly as she began to do so, and noted that there was some slight trembling in her movements.  When the task was finished, the manicles were once again locked together, but this time infront of her, and with a chain attached to one of the walls that still allowed her some movement.   The guards then collected up the armor and with the cell door opening once again, headed out with it.<br>
<br>
D'Ron stepped out into the hallway, the door being closed and locked again behind him, and he noted that still yet another new face was peering into the cell that contained Meledi and Tanare.  At this point he paused and addressed the newcomer.<br>
&quot;What ever your chore is Sir, you need to wait, as they have requested their privacy.  And I need to see them again first.  I suggest you wait up by the guard captain, or take a break and return in aproximately  thirty minutes.&quot;<br>
<br>
With anoyance D'Ron noticed that the man did not wear the robes of either the priests or their Acolytes, but Littany was rather short on volunteers, so perhaps others from the city were offering to take turns in tending to Tanare.  He turned and then walked up the hall to go quickly change his armor and make a trip to the local bakery. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melediweaver>melediweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dirges, a specialty</span><br>  Posts: 463<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/21/03 8:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=56>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> &quot;Hello Tanare, and no, I am not here for a dress or a party.

The sight of Meledi disturbed her more than she cared to admit. <br>
<br>
But there was a certain satisfaction in the housing of this particular guest, in particular watching as the ranger began to babble in her incoherent way.  Watching Meledi wince.<br>
<br>
&quot;We serve the same master, you and I bard,&quot; she whispered. &quot;And the world may not see it, but we are very alike. You seek the power to change events, and people, to bend them to your way. I also seek to teach to help others change, that they may know the God and find salvation. Fear is the teacher, and those who do not learn and grow are truly cursed.  Strange that they call me &quot;evil&quot; yet you are viewed as &quot;good&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Fear is the source of power.  Soon, Meledi, you and I will talk of Fear. We will talk of the mysterious ways of our Lord, of Thule. But first, I will let you enjoy the company of Tanare a while longer. I will let you understand how kind it will be to release this trivial soul to rebirth and a better form, another chance. &quot;<br>
<br>
She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her, and almost bumped into an unfamiliar form in the hallway. Her eyes narrowed, realizing this one was not of her Temple. Two words, and a spell of rooting, and another of fear shimmered like a wave of heat inside the corridor.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who are you pray tell&quot; she asked the stranger.<br>

D'Ron returned shorty as he had said he would, to find Tanare still in conversation with her Meledi, a few guards remarking on the curiousity of a strange visitor who had felt the need to enter their halls invisable, apparently forgetting to take it off once entering the city. <br>
   After asking Tanare to follow him, adding that her guardian could keep her place for her, he informed her that they were to go hunting, and that she needed to put her armor back on for the occasion.   It was to give her a break from waiting, andno, as long as he was there, she didn't really need to be attached to the wall.<br>
After he had left, the other guards entered and  carefully &quot;assisted' Meledi with the removal of her armor and musical instrumentation.<br>

[Fri Nov 21 20:41:24 2003] You have entered an Arena (PvP) area.<br>
<br>
Tanare looks at Dronkarr curiously to see which one of him is here today, thinks its too bad he has the helmet on so she can't see the initial head wound.<br>
<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, '&lt;points to the sleeping meledi&gt; shhh she's like sleeping and stuff cause she;s tired from running here, i was like telling her about everything that happened since i got here then i looked over and she was asleep and stuff &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
You say, 'Greetings My Ladies...&lt;glances over at Meledi&gt;'<br>

<br>
Dronkarr lifts an eyebrow.<br>
You say, 'Well, I was given permission by Littany to visit, and even take you out hunting again'<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Killing more bad doggies?'<br>
Tanare is excited about the idea.<br>
Tanare tells you, in Elvish, 'Ok'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Ooh look what I made while you were gone &lt;proudly points to the pile of Patchwork Pants she has in the corner&gt;'<br>
You say, 'Ah, very good, you are getting better at it.'<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Though I kept messing up when I was using the drinky stuff like you told me, do you think it made me too smart or something?'<br>
You say, 'And I notice you are out of drink also, we shall have to remedy that.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Humm, perhaps you need to space the drinks out a bit.'<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Well the walls are still leaking so its not that bad'<br>

You say, 'They really are more for helping your stamina that anything else'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Is that why Littany and her father want a new temple place cause this one leaks all the time?'<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Well mighty and tough rangers don't need any help in that cause we ARE mighty and tough you know &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
You say, 'No actually, because her own temple to her father burned down'<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'but you werent born that way, and if you do not exercise, you get weak'<br>
You say, 'Speaking of exercise....'<br>
Dronkarr takes a key out and proceeds to unlock Tanare's manicles.<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Ooh.. does he know about it? I bet someone knocked one of the torches over didn't they? my second cousin did that once and burnt the whole tree down before it got put out...i never saw him again though after everyone yelled at him and stuff...'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Ummm, yes , I guess that might be what caused it.<br>
Tanare smiles proudly at her clever deduction.<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Um won't I lose my place in line though?'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Anyways, since your guardian...Meledi, is here, she can hold your place in line for you until you get back.'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh ok...she's not going to cut is she? she said she wasn;t here for dresses but maybe she was being sneaky....'<br>
Tanare looks worried at the prospect of losing her place in line after so long.<br>
You say, 'No, now why would your own guardian want to take something from you? '<br>
<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Cuase the dress is REAL cute...of course they haven't even come for a fitting yet...then they might come when i;'m gone and make it in Meledy's size not mine and it'll be like too big and everything!'<br>
You say, 'And besides, she is sleeping right now...and do you wish to get out of shape or remain a mighty and strong ranger?'<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, 'Come out, and lets get you back in your armor. We woulnt be gone all that long....'<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Hey! i AM mighty and tough cause once you like become a ranger it happens magic like<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh...alright'<br>
Tanare looks back at meledy to make sure she's not pretending to sleep.<br>
You say, 'Shall we go?'<br>
Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Okays'<br>
You have entered an Arena (PvP) area.<br>

<br>
Iva Tersala says 'Welcome to my shop, Dronkarr. You would probably find a Muffin handy.'<br>
Tanare begins to cast a spell.<br>
Tanare's skin sprouts thistles.<br>
You give 1 gold to Iva Tersala.<br>
Iva Tersala tells you, 'That'll be 7 copper per Muffin.'<br>
Tanare's fist bursts into flame.<br>
Iva Tersala tells you, 'That'll be 1 silver 7 copper per Bottle of Kalish.'<br>
Tanare begins to cast a spell.<br>
Gorng Alusnein says 'Welcome to my shop, Dronkarr. You would probably find a Mixxy's Delicacies Vol 1 handy.'<br>
Tanare's skin turns hard as stone.<br>
Tanare's eyes gleam and then go dark.<br>
Tanare begins to cast a spell.<br>
<br>
Taralani Rahnta says 'Welcome to my shop, Dronkarr. You would probably find a Grapes handy.'<br>

You have entered Toxxulia Forest. <br>
<br>
You say, 'We take the portal to Freeport, then go through the EC tunnel....'<br>
<br>
The two make their way into the Nothern Desert of Ro, stoping momentarily at the wayfarer's camp before continuing on, leaving the greener areas to trudge out into the sand. <br>
As a gust of hot, dry desert wind swirls the sand around them, Tanare takes offense, swatting at it and trying to smooth her hair back. She begins to comment on it, and only pauses for breath when they finally find the hatch to the underground lair and enter in, the coolness affording a temporary releaf.<br>

<br>
Startled that the shadowknight had discovered him and having discovered the news that he had come to find, the seemingly erudite servant dropped his invisibility spell and bowed, evidently cowed, to the knight.  Waiting till the knight rounded the corner and was out of earshot, Oligith hastily pulled a quill and parchment out of his pack and penned a fast note.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Meledi and Tanare,<br>
The League of Honour shall know of your location shortly, and we will bring all of our allies down upon Paineel if necessary to free you from this captivity.  Never fear.<br>
<br>
Oligith</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Wishing he could do something to comfort the captive in the adjacent cell, but not wishing to do anything to alert the guards further, Oligith proceeded down the hallway out of their sight.  After rounding the corner, he concentrated and cast two quick spells making both of the guards very passive and unaware of the happenings around them.<br>
<br>
The enchanter sped to the door where Meledi and Tanare could be heard speaking....Tanare rather loudly still...and slipped the note under it.  Knocking once, Oligith began the incantations to open a portal to New Tanaan where his essence was bound.  He stepped through breathing a prayer to Karana that the two would be safe till his return. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Sage Koada'dal Phantasmist of the 64th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 339<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/24/03 9:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> Aurwena, clad only in her underpadding in her damp,<br>
chilly cell, was wondering what D'ron Karr planned<br>
to do with her. She was still ashamed of herself<br>
for ever thinking that the young man would help<br>
her, and yet the young Wood Elf felt that she<br>
was not really to blame. Most fighters at least<br>
had SOME sense of honor if they were not Dark<br>
Elves, Ogres, Trolls, or Iksar. Alas, her assumption <br>
had cost her dearly...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a tiny slit in the cell door opened,<br>
letting in light. &quot;Milady?&quot; said Jobarnik, one<br>
of Paineel's skeletal servants. &quot;Your breakfast<br>
is here. I shall slide it through this slot to you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Aurwena picked up the bread, cheese, and water<br>
as best she could with her shackles on and began<br>
to eat. &quot;How much longer will I stay alive?&quot; she <br>
wondered. &quot;Is Tanare still to be sacrificed to Cazic-<br>
Thule at the Ceremony of the Moondark, or will it<br>
be I who suffers this terrible fate?&quot; She shivered. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have to wait for that Dron' Karr to tell me, or l<br>
someone from the Temple proper. By Zeboxurok,<br>
I sure hope Meledi, that Bard, has some plan<br>
to rescue Tanare! If not, we may both be utterly<br>
doomed!&quot; The young girl finished her meal and sighed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=61&stop=76>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1193.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1193.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
