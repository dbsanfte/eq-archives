On a sidenote, why does Jason Taylor get automatically labeled by society as a black man?  His mother is white while his father is black.  So he is just as much white as he is black.  <br>
<br>
Is he forced to choose &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Other&quot; whenever he fills out a form that requires you to identify your race?  Do people of mixed heritage get to choose how they identify themself?  In other words, could he declare that he is white, not black?  <br>
<br>
He is married to a white girl.  Their kids will be 3/4 white 1/4 black.  Will they also be labeled by society as black?<br>
<br>
Interracial marriage was taboo for the longest time but is now becoming more and more accepted.  Seems like the stereotypes for people of mixed heritage gonna be around a little bit longer.<br>

If you try to benefit from it and don't actually believe it someone might try and convict you of fraud or the like (ie: if you know you're not black and never identified yourself as such but you heard about a great scholarship)..., but if you look like Jackie Chan and think you're actually african-american because you heard that somewhere up your family tree there was a black person you can check yourself off as black... and vice versa, etc.<br>
<br>
There was an old law, primarily in southern states, called the &quot;one drop&quot; rule.  It basically said any person with even one drop of negro blood was a negro.<br>
<br>
Those laws do not apply anymore, but a great many people still judge people based on it.  And thus they'll call Tiger Woods black (even though he's of caucasian, asian, and african heritage).  Tiger Woods doesn't consider himself black (he jokes that he's Caublanasian), but they don't really care <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In fact, to that point, there is a great amount of pressure in this country to define yourself as one race, the minority race in particular.  Tiger woods got a lot of flack from people when he made that Caublanasian comment... people actually somehow took personal offense at that.  Don't ask me how, or why, they just did.<br>
<br>
I'm of African &amp; Caucasian ancestry (and possibly some native american somewhere way up the family tree).  When people ask what race I am, I usually say half-black (enough people assume that the other half is white that I don't need to mention it).  By all outward appearances I look middle-eastern, I'd probably make a good spy if I actually knew some Arabic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My sister's done a lot of research on our family tree, and up my dad's side (the black side), there's a white slave-owner in there, so there's actually a lot of variation in shades on his side (some of his cousins you wouldn't doubt that they were white even though they consider themselves black, and others are very dark).<br>
<br>
So I guess, in summary I'd say, you can define yourself any way you wish.  Society, however, may define you another way, especially if they have something to gain by doing so (ie people can write better headlines about a black golfer than they can about a Caublanasian golfer, etc).<br>

Further to Kebkin's first post, it still strikes me as strange that forms and applications often ask you to identify your race... especially when a disclaimer on the form tells you that such information will not be a factor in determining the outcome of an application, only used to provide statistical data and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ensure equal opportunities</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. If they were truly equal opportunities, surely the race would be of no relevance? And the excuse that companies need to recruit equally amongst the races in order to represent each of them equally always struck me as a big bunch of bollocks: that's blatant discrimination and they're admitting to it.<br>
<br>
And if they're <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pretending to be a completely colour-blind world, why the hell are they segregating the races into discrete categories anyway? Simply by the act of providing  7 or 8 checkboxes - caucasian, black, asian, hispanic, etc. - they're reinforcing the discrimination. They're suggesting that people's ancestry is likely to be predominantly of one race, thereby implying that people rarely wish to marry outside their own racial boundaries... implying that, deep down, we don't actually consider all races equal: we'd prefer to &quot;stick to familiar territory&quot;. Particularly in America, if people really do profess to being entirely colour-blind and providing equal opportunities, they need to do away with that kind of &quot;checkbox categorisation&quot; of the races - even if you are able to claim any race without 'proof'. If they view all members of the population as equals, a homogenous mass, then they should be able to safely assume that people will have entirely mixed ancestry, a bloodline far too complicated even to explain under the obligatory <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Other&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> checkbox.<br>

<br>
I'm pretty sure those aren't intended to be there as a weighting factor in determinging who gets hired or not.  They're there for auditing purposes.<br>
<br>
At the end of the year a company can look at the bigger picture of who applied, and who was hired / not hired from a race point of view, to ensure there aren't any large discrepancies.<br>
<br>
Let's say they note that their Los Angeles Branch and NY branch both had 400 white applicants, and 100 black ones.  The Los Angeles branch hired 90 white applicants, and 30 black ones.  The new york branch hired 90 black applicants and 0 white ones.   While it's true that it may just be coincidence and all 90 of those black applicants were the best qualified, it's also possible they have an HR person in that office who is hiring on the basis of race.<br>
<br>
They need that race information to check for that kind of stuff, and they need it on the applications rather than your new_hire paperwork because that way they can check for those kinds of discrepancies from the very beginning of the process (where people are hired or not hired).<br>
<br>
So while it can seem that they ask the question with intentions of discriminating, it's actually there for the purpose of ensuring that they're not discriminating.<br>
<br>
Will some people use that information against you when they're not supposed to consider it as part of the hiring process?  Definately.  Even just having an ethnic name counts against you in job applications.  Studies have been done where the exact same job application was submitted to various companies, one copy with a &quot;white&quot; sounding name, and one copy with an ethnic sounding name.  The &quot;white&quot; applicants received a much higher number of requests for a job interview.<br>
<br>
But without that checkbox there's no way for a company to tell if someone in HR is doing that kind of stuff.<br>

But there's a second factor - often the company just doesn't self-audit, but the government audits as well whenever there's been a charge of misconduct or just randomly when the company is involved in government contracts at all.<br>
<br>
I worked in the HR office of a large corporation that was audited by the government for biased hiring practices.  The government looked through thousands and thousands of applications, searching for &quot;bias&quot;, and out of thousands and thousands of applications pulled out a few hundred minority applicants that they said should have been hired.<br>
<br>
The company, the HR department and I were all baffled - most of those applications had not been filled out properly, often missing entire work histories, or missing a signed consent for drug testing.  Some had notes in them years old from the front desk guard indicating that the applicant had needed someone else to fill out the application because he/she couldn't speak or read any English.  Many of those people could not have performed the job.  (Mind you, it was common practice to pass over anyone who had large gaps in work experience, or absolutely no work experience, regardless of race.  The company was told that it was &quot;discriminatory&quot; to expect people applying for a factory job to be able to read and fully comprehend the application.)<br>
<br>
Sorry, I'm getting off track here.  While I found that audit to be personally repellent (and because of my position, I worked with every single one of those applications, I read them all and analyzed the data in them to prepare for the government-ordered search for those people to offer them jobs, years later, or financial recompense) overall it's necessary for the government to make sure that the companies with which it does business are hiring fairly according to the law.<br>

Sadly I couldn't think of any particular examples of such forms that I've had to fill out, but one memory I do have of a similar, interesting situation was this:<br>
<br>
The mother of a friend of mine worked for Social Services (in England). One day she mentioned the vague details of her day at work to me and  my friend, saying how they could really use applications from another couple of Indian people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(from India, rather than Native Americans)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in order to round out the numbers for a ... I forget the exact details, but it was a benefits discussion group, or something similar. I queried this, out of interest, wondering if it was because they needed representatives to offer the views of different parts of society. Her answer was that it was actually less for the representative views and more because they needed to fill a certain 'quota' from each race in order to satisfy internal regulations -- equal opportunities, they couldn't be seen to be discriminating, etc.<br>

I remarked that it seemed strange to be earmarking the spots for a people of a particular race if they weren't allowed to discriminate: surely if it were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>truly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> equal opportunity they would not ask for the applicant's race on the application form, the selection for the committee/group/<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>whatever it was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would be performed entirely on a &quot;pulling names out of the hat&quot; basis. In this particular case, the response was that it was not the policy of Social Services to appear colour-blind: the group members were to be treated <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>as equals</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>equally</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- a subtle but important difference:<br>
<br>
* <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>As equals</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: no individual (or their opinion) was to be treated as superior or inferior to another.<br>
<br>
* Not treated <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>equally</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: because Social Services had to acknowledge and recognise the cultural and social differences amongst the races.<br>
<br>
Though I could understand the difference and how it was important for a government agency to appear non-discriminatory and unbiased, it took me a while to figure out why the reasoning - though seemingly sound and fair - just didn't sit well with me.<br>
<br>
Finally it dawned on me: I still wasn't convinced that making sure a group of 10 people contained at least two Indians, at least one black person, and at least one asian, was not promoting the social and cultural divisions. Simply identifying a person by their heritage, skin colour, or culture was seeking to highlight the fact that people were different: it was not allowing for crossover between the races. It was still promoting the idea that we live in a black and white world, where grey is not an option. Still promoting the idea that people would rather marry within their own social, cultural and racial boundaries; implying a distrust, dislike or, at the very least, an notion of inequality between the races. That's what bugged me, and still does. If people are ever to consider themselves equals, if we're ever to overcome racial hatred, the very first step needs to be for &quot;racial checkboxes&quot; to disappear.<br>
<br>
<br>
If someone asked me what race I claim, I would love to be able to claim human and to hell with the rest of the categories. Species is enough for me.<br>

I have always found the hispanic checkbox to be the funniest of all.<br>
<br>
Let's take this scenario:<br>
<br>
You're &quot;black&quot;. Your father's black, your mother's black, you follow your roots to being purely African. No mixing, no interracial relationships. Fully black and proud. However, your ancestors were taken as slaves from Namibia to Cuba. Unmixed, yet living in Cuba for over a century. You are classified, by Americans, as hispanic.<br>
<br>
You're &quot;white&quot;. Your father's white, your mother's white, you follow your roots to being purely European. No mixing, no interracial relationships. Fully white and proud. However, your ancestors were slaveowners from Spain living in Argentina. Unmixed, yet living in Argentina for over a century. You are classified, by Americans, as hispanic.<br>
<br>
Now, for the life of me I cannot fathom WHY 2 distinct people are classified in the same race, ONLY based on their language. Their culture isn't even the same, as much as you are led to believe on television, it isn't. Period. &quot;Hispanic&quot;, in ever sense of the word, is someone who's culture is derived from Spain. This does NOT classify one's race, and neither does &quot;Latin&quot; or &quot;Latino&quot;, which I find even worse. Look up who the Latin people were and tell me how you can call an un-mixed Aztec descendant from Mexico Latin. Back in my academy I was always taught that races were classified by their cranial structures and other physical characteristics, and ethnic groups broken down from races even further categorized by culture. How an African and a European can be subclassed together is beyond me, they're two different people from two different cultures.<br>
<br>
Hell, I take offense to being called &quot;white&quot;.  That's not me. I don't like hispanic either, that isn't a race. Want to give me a race? Give me Iberian. Or, even broader, give me Mediterranean, along with the other sea-borderers like the Italians. Non-American Italians would punch you in the face if you call them &quot;white&quot;, by the way. My Italian buddy was filling out forms when he was coming to school in America with me, he gets to the race portion and tells me, &quot;what should I put? I'm Euro with olive skin and my language comes from the same as yours... should I just shade them all?&quot;<br>
