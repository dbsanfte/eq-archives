Japan.<br><br>The Smithsonian tried , and was booed and hissed at, to display a 50 anniversary of the end of WWII, that made the claim that the dropping of those bombs was NOT neccassary and was in fact an act of revenge.<br><br>Before I start, in order to JUDGE whether an act was made for one reason or another, one must look at WHAT information was available at the TIME of the descision. It doesnt matter what information becomes available AFTER the fact.<br><br>Facts that are not disputable by Revisionist History.<br><br>1.  On Saipan, the first Island in Pacific war that had a sizable Japanese civilian population, as the Japanese Army was losing and it became clear the Island would fall to American forces, hundreds of Japanese Civilians committed suicide rather than be &quot;captured&quot; by the American forces. Families jumped from cliffs to their death even as captured Japanese prisoners and American Linguists attempted to convince them otherwise. women and children committed suicide to avoid capture.<br><br>2. On Okinawa, the First civilian populated island of Japan (yes I know okinawians disagree about that status), thousands of civilians commited suicide rather than surrender to American forces. Again even though Linguists and captured prisoners tried to convince them otherwise.<br><br>Facts I doubt were skewed by Revisionist History <br><br>1. The Japanese Army had a tradition of NOT surrendering. This lead to FEW prisoners before the major island assaults in the Pacific.<br><br>2. The Japanese Government was attempting to mobilize every male able to, to defend the Main Islands of Japan.<br><br>President Truman was FACED with the above Facts. He also was informed by his Military advisors that the projected causalties to the Invading Forces would top 100,000 killed and closer to 1 million when wounded where included. These causalties were projected if the Japanese refused to surrender and fought for all the Islands of Japan.<br><br>The stubborn refusal of the Japanese High Command to Surrender and its continued resistance, INCLUDING the use of Suicide bomb laden planes, spoke of a real possibility of such losses being incurred. Also the plans needed to invade the Main islands would take till early 1946 to be drawn and staffed and prepared. Another Year of War.<br><br>Faced with the knowledge of civilian suicides in staggering numbers and a refusal of the Japanese to admit defeat, some advisors told President Truman it was a possibility that the Japanese people would basicly be committing Geonicide if invaded. At the very least the information indicated that MILLIONS of Japanese would die when the Main Islands were invaded. And there was no attempt by the Japanese Government to surrender. In fact the Military was exalting its troops to fight harder and for the civilian population to aid it.<br><br>All Targets selected for possible use of the Atomic bombs WERE military in nature. While all were Based in Civilain centers (cities) EACH was for the most part an Army Headquarters with assigned troops and training facilities to raise, equip and send into combat troops. Most if not all had been spared fire bombing partly because of the potential to demostrate the effectiveness of an atomic bomb on the Leadership of Japan.<br><br>This is what President Truman was faced with (in part) when he had to decide whether to drop those bombs. The targets were Military in nature and not designated civilain.<br><br>It is a FACT that the dropping of the second bomb was followed shortly by the Japanese surrender. No invasion was needed and thousands of Allied troops were saved. Based on the previous incidents of the actions of the Japanese in the Pacific it is arguable that MILLIONS of Japanese were saved.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utarunwarspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarun Warspirit</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.circleoftheancient.com/tarunlogo.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/29/01 3:02:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.circleoftheancient.com/tarunlogo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ending World War II</span><hr size=1> It was too bad that weapons of mass destruction like the A-Bomb had to be used to get a government to surrender in order to end a war that had allready cost so many nations the lives of thier loved ones, but it had to be done.

Unless we can effectively hamstring the World access of these groups.<br><br>So long as Nations support, train, finance and encourage Terrorism this remains a REAL threat.<br><br>We are fortunate that none have been used before now, the collapse of the Soviet Union has placed the possibility of weapons of this sort in one form or another being accessed by Terrorists. The Government in Russia and the countries formed by the demise of the Soviet Union that have these weapons (Ukriane for one) have a poor history of paying and supporting their military and security forces.<br><br>I seriously DOUBT that if the current network had one and the means to get it into a major city they would even think twice about using it.<br><br>MAD, Mutally Assured Destruction only works when you have a clearly defined target to assure destruction against. Missile defense needs to be (IMO) developed and deployed world wide. Though this wont stop the use of a nuclear bomb due to manpack sized ones, it will prevent a rogue Nation from threatening anyone.<br><br>The people that are waging the terrorist war against us DO NOT care about human life. It is simple, if you dont submit to the will of this organization , they feel you do not deserve to live. <br><br>The only country that has a functioning anti missile defense is Russia. According to the treaty each of us were allowed to deploy one such system around one target. Of course at the time of the agreement the Soviets had the only WORKING system, ours showed promise but was scuttled and abandoned due to the treaty (in the 70's). No working system was made by the Reagan era research, though some promising technology has come from it. And that research continues.<br><br>I find it hard to understand a mind set that THINKS dismantling a weapons system or military structure will encourage the SAME in the bigots, racists and petty despots that dream of global power.

Defending against a fanatic wiiling to die for his cause, that makes this scarier than the Cuban Missle Crisis. At least during the Cold War people who followed world events were aware of increases in tensions. A &quot;lone bomber&quot; could set off a nuke anytime, anywhere. If you live in Cincinnati or St Paul I don't think you are any safer than in New York or DC.

I am sure that there are horrible things that are happening to innocents in Afganistan. The problem is, in order to achive a military goal, it will happen. So, we have a choice, do not attack and allow the terrorists success and eventual victory, or take action and accept the civilian casualties as a very unfortunate, but necessary inevitability.<br><br>I think we are wimps for pandering to some of these Arab countries (who were almost pleased at the results of the Sept. 11 attacks) because of MONEY and OIL.<br><br>And I certainly suggest the government is more timid than the American people. Polls show overwhelming support for doing what is needed to end the threat, including inflicting (incidental) civilian casualties. Yet, I believe we are not doing what is needed. Only time will tell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/29/01 10:43:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ending World War II</span><hr size=1> Funny thing about your post Wallace...<br>We didn't even vote Bush into office *shrug*<br><br>The use of the atomic bomb in WW II was not and cannot be justified, ever.

Arkitip? So it is your contention that the potential death of over 100000 Allied troops and the possible injure to a million more AND the potential death of Millions of Japanese was preferable to destroying two cities and their population?<br><br>Or do you think that Japan would have just quit with no invasion?<br><br>Rather than read history by prejuidice professors and scholors that can and do revise it as they see fit, read the military history that is logged as reported during the war. As for rivisionist history... Are you aware that Japan teaches it citizens that they didnt start the conflict? That they didnt invade China or Korea. It is all just a big misunderstanding, they just happened to have to fight in those places.<br><br>As for the power and scope of those warheads.... more damage and more people were killed in the firebombing of German cities and Tokyo. The difference is it took more effort to accomplish those bombings.<br><br>The fact is that if the war had gone on those cities and the people in them would have been firebombed because they were considered valid military targets. They had been held out of the bombing because the military wanted to demonstrate the power of the bomb to the Government of Japan.<br><br>And as to our will as a society, I tend to agree, we seem to lack the needed will to do the things that MUST be done to prevent terrorist attacks in the future that will be more costly than the ones to date.  I watch in disgust as our own News services lament about the innocents lost in the bombing rather than the need to destroy the Taliban Government and the Terrorist organization it WILLING chose to protect.<br><br>I do however disagree with the contention that our leaders are more aggressive than the society as a whole... The mob would have us attacking in force in several places and the Government has rejected that.<br><br>How Our President chooses to handle Saudia Arabia will (IMO) determine whether we have any chance of actually fighting this war effectively in the short term. Long term , in war, things change based on events that unfold. Saudia Arabia has chosen to pretend that NONE of their citizens were or are terrorists in any organization bent on bringing the USA down.  The Saudi Government has repeated the line that they see NO evidence to suspect ANY saudi citizen is or was involved in this network. They refuse to do anything about money flow within their country to the organization and refuse to take any action against possible supporters of the organization. In effect they are trying to SAY they support action against terrorism WHILE actively doing nothing to combat it and actively thwarting the effort to fight it. AND they have already stated that no action must ever be taken against the terrorist organizations fighting Isreal.<br><br>As for the contention that the Isrealies are putting the boot to Palastenians.... again check history.... The Jews in Palastine actively sought to INCLUDE the arabs in the land in the formation of a Government. the Neigboring Arab STATES threatened and warned all Arabs in Palastine to Flee before the invasion to crush the state of Isreal. The Arab countries refused since 1948 to allow the so called Palestinians to become citizens of ANY arab State, with the purpose and Goal of creating a mob of people bent on the hatred and destruction of Isreal.<br><br>Isreal REACTS to attacks, they have not recently begun any action EXCEPT in response to attacks from the Palastinians. The Government of Arafat actively seeks out, arrests, tries and puts to death any palestian that is found to have warned Isreal of any pending Terrorist attack. They do NOTHING to discourage such attacks and in some cases the police and security forces arm, train and support the Terrorists.<br><br>The difference between us and the terrorists is that we dont PURPOSEFULLY target non military targets, and we didnt start this conflict we are simply responding (finally) to a threat against our society and our way of life. Another BIG difference is that when it is all over and we have won we wont go around rounding up all the people that disagree with us and murder them.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/30/01 2:31:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ending World War II</span><hr size=1> In an effort to keep this thread from degrading into emotional flames rather than a discussion of the pro's and con's of history, I appeal to all to consider the following:<br><br>first)  At the time, and given the options currently available, and considering the method in which the US was drawn into the war (Pearl Harbor), I think that Truman believed that the bomb was the best method to end the war.<br><br>second)  We were at war with an implacable foe, and by contemporary value judgements it was better that the Japanese die than Americans.<br><br>third)  No one had ever used a nuclear weapon for that use before, and so the long-term effects could not be judged.<br><br>fourth)  Dropping the bomb, while drastic, had the desired effect (to end the war).<br><br>fifth)  We live in the 21st Century, not the 1940's.

But making reasonable assumptions based on what HAD happened previously in the war it is/was possible to estimate what most likely COULD happen. Using these assumptions, based on previous events, a number could be reasonably made as to potential lose of life.<br><br>For the revisionist crowd, the assumptions that were made are attacked on several levels. One is that after the war Documents were found that could lead some people to believe that there was a small faction in the War time Japanese Governement that was considering a surrender under the unconditional terms demanded by the Allies. And some argue that since the Emperor did FORCE the military to accept terms after the apparent destructive potential of the second Bomb (and the belief more were to follow) that he would also have forced a surrender when an invasion was successfully ashore on one of the Main Islands.<br><br>President Truman had none of these facts before him when he had to deside the use of these devices. At the time they were considered nothing more than MASSIVE bombs. If anyone understand the consequences of the use ot them, it is not evident that the President was told of them.  What he did understand was that after almost 4 years of United States Involvement in the War that every Battle was MORE costly then the last. Okinawa was a bloodbath compared to Guadalcanal (the first offensive in the Pacific) and even though the Japanese Navy was shot and we could establish Air Suprememcy anywhere with our Navy Carriers, we had not been able to prevent the Kamikaze from damaging and sinking ships in the Okinawa campaign. <br><br>He had reliable reports of an enemy unwilling to surrender or admit defeat. An enemy who's population seemed more than willing to die rather than surrender. And he  had no intention of coming to any terms other than complete surrender with this enemy.<br><br>An important thing to Note is that Truman was President during the Darkest days of the Korean war &quot;police action&quot;. He was the President that watched as the Chinese poured over the Border and pushed back the UN force. Yet he NEVER even considered the use of Nuclear weapons. The Chinese had none to retaliate with and the Soviet Union had no means to deliver what they had against the United States.  I would have to say he had learned the lesson of these weapons well.<br><br>As bad as everyone thinks of Nuclear weapons and the potential of a Nuclear war... I STRONGLY believe that they prevented war in Europe and a 3rd World War. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwallaceoffv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WallaceofFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/30/01 1:12:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ending World War II</span><hr size=1> And as for arktip's comment about Bush not being elected in office.

In this forum we are treating the subject with logic and debate, and I think that this process helps to both solidify our arguments and beliefs.<br><br>If we attack the values of the individual rather than the logic behind those values, we lose without even having begun.  Values cannot be argued--they are as solid and concrete.  The foundation beneath those values can be questioned, however, and the process serves to remove weak values and reinforce the strong.<br><br>Finally, the process of debate requires that all involved parties agree that each participant has something valid to say.  I may not agree with Arkitip, however I enjoy the process of debating the foundations of our values as an excercise.<br><br>And, let us not forget that values are societal rather than universal.  A Canadian-born individual will have values starkly different than an American-born individual, and vice/versa.  It is not true that in all societies it is wrong to kill.  It is not true that in all societies it is wrong to lie or to steal.  And it is through the understanding of the values of other societies that we get closer to understanding the underpinnings of our own. <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>Wood Elven Scout of Tunare<BR><B>1st Fist of Light</B>, emeritus<BR><BR><I>"Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief" -- E.
