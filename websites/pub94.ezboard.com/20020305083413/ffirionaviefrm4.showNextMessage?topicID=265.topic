This is going to be a running issue if something isn't done about it now.  So, in the interest of peace on this board, let me form a sort of loose general policy on this stuff right now.<br><br>If you want to boast, either on your own or someone else's behalf, about the big thing you just killed and the great loot you scored, take it to the soapbox.  Why?  Because it is going to attract fire.  A lot of people feel it doesn't belong on this board at all.  And to a large extent, as a moderator and as an individual (I'll be clear on that point) I find myself in agreement with that viewpoint.<br><br>There is certainly nothing wrong with the end game, or with aspiring to great accomplishments.  More power to those who are persuing such things.  But this board isn't the place to bring news of such accomplishments.  Enjoy it in private, and with your friends, the same way everyone else enjoys their accomplishments (whatever they may be) in Norrath.<br><br>I'm moving this to the Soapbox rather than locking it entirely because I don't want to be an ogre (appologies to real ogres) about this right off the bat.  I am fairly certain I'm acting in the best interests and according to the general wishes of the board community here, but I won't know for sure unless this issue is left open for discussion.  So here it is; discuss it.  Perhaps if someone asked her Jaxy might be persuaded to put up a board for these sorts of accomplishments.  But I really don't think the majority of the people would frequent it.  Because I think the majority of the people who come here have their primary interest in other matters.<br><br>Hope this is taken well, and in the spirit in which it was intended.  And congradulations, Coinfist, on a successful raid, and on all the phat lewt.  Yes, I said phat lewt.  After all, that is what you are boasting about, isn't it?<br><br>Valquiss <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uanklesdirtyfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ankles Dirtyfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mudslingin' Admin</span><br>  Posts: 465<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/26/02 6:59:28 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Resolution Members</span><hr size=1> Good job guys :)<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> k thx ankles for letting us know Lodi was up. here, have the map piece! gratz!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><font face="arial" size="-1" color="black"><b>Ankles Dirtyfoot</font><font face="arial" size="-1"> &lt;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/starspunguild">Starspun</a>&gt;<br></b><i>Black-soled, bow-slingin' hippie</i><br>Misbehaving for 38 summers<br>Hopelessly devoted to Fayd Dirtyfoot</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujadia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jadia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Jadia Cookiecutter<br>Distributor of fine cookies</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/26/02 7:07:30 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://jadia.freeservers.com/images/jadiakazoo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Resolution Members</span><hr size=1> BAH! <br>and again i say BAH!<br><br>/rant ON<br>you people that post such silly nonsense just drive me mad.<br>why can't you just /congratulate someone on doing something they thought was worthy of notice?

I'm quite the opposite, just another lame newbie as far as the server is concered....<br><br>But I'm gonna have to go with Jadia here.... my congrats to Resolution. I don't know any of you in Resolution, nor do I know how you play the game. Nor do I really care. But when people or guilds on this server start reaching milestones.... it took a lot of effort to get there. And that should be something that the ENTIRE Firiona Vie server should be proud of because it gives our entire server some bragging rights in the eyes of the rest of the EQ world. At the very least I'm going to give recognition for that. <br><br>But judging from Shintou's remark... I think they are being singled out BECAUSE they are perceived as one of the powergamer guilds.... so that means we should snub them with a double standard and refuse them a sincere congratulation?? <br><br>Sorry... I dont believe in double standards. Unless some person or guild deserves to be on my shitlist (and at the moment there is nothing on my list) -- then I will give everyone on this server the benefit of the doubt regardless of what their style of play is.... be they hard core role player or relaxed casual RPer, or relaxed casual newbie gamer, or even a powergaming uber guild (as long as it's an uber guild that has manners and class and respects the RPers). <br><br>I do like what Val suggested... maybe in the future, some kind of area reserved for congrats/kudos and achievements for all guilds and members of this server. That way, all the WOOT this and WOOT that and WOOT WE KILLED TUNARE types of threads will be shoved specifically on that area of the forum. If people want to read those threads and congratulate them, they will. If people like Shintou dont want to see such congratulatory threads, then simply stay away from it. Given the current situation, I agree with Val that moving it over here was the next best thing. <br><br>This entire forum should belong to the entire FV community... and that means all kinds. We have all kinds, not just the hard core role players. As much as some people wish the powergamers would just die and disappear from the server.... sorry, I don't see that ever happening.  <br><br>People, learn to get along... or at least be civil to one another. Otherwise, I see a huge huge polarization going to happen months later down the line. It will tear our server apart and divide us into opposing camps....everyone knows it's already a small server, small in numbers. I doubt we can afford that. <br><br>this necromancer midget will step down from the podium now... <br><br>/smirk<br>/pickpockets Jadia's legendary cookies and runs off <br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A> at: 1/26/02 8:28:16 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=281.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=281.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=281.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=281.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=281.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
