He felt a slight twinge of sadness wash over him as he remembered the day he'd opend the shop, and the many patrons he'd served throughout the years. He blew out the lantern and closed the small wooden door for the last time. He strolled home particularly slow this day, taking in every last detail of Felwithe into his mind. He knew this would be his last walk home from the city he'd been born and raised in his whole life. He would truely miss this beautiful place. <br>
<br>
  As he passed the outter gates, he stopped to talk with Guard Crystalwind for a few moments. <br>
<br>
'Hail, Arikonias' said Guard Crystalwind<br>
<br>
'Hail, Guard Crystalwind' replied Arik. <br>
<br>
'So tomorrow's the big day, for ye?' the guard inquired. 'I hear it's a whole new world over there on the mainland, be sure to take caution and steer clear of those bloody Teir'dal. I've heard tell that the Western Freeport Militia has some kind of underground agreement with them, so you'd do well to avoid them as well'.<br>
<br>
  Arik had trouble with dishonesty and tho he was only holding back partial truth, he felt like such a dissapointment to his bloodline this day. He thanked Guard Crystalwind for his words of concern and bid him farewell. He took slow steps along the path to his cottage, where his wife and young daughter awaited him. He knew this was indeed, his last walk home.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
   Katrinity sat on the front porch of her families cottage, with tears in her eyes. She was still quite young, only of 6 seasons old. She didn't quite know what was happening, only that her family was moving to a far away city to start a new life. She was going to miss her friend, Nenuvin terribly, and her school as well. She'd spent all of her short life playing in the Faydark with the other Elven youth, and only knew this way of life. She loved her schoolmates and had grown quite fond of her guildmaster at the Academy of Arcane Science in Felwithe as well, but Nenuvin was her best friend in the whole world and the thought of moving far away from him made her heart ache. <br>
<br>
 'Why the long face, princess?' she heard her fathers voice say to her. He'd snuck up on her, and it startled her out of her deep saddening thoughts. <br>
<br>
'Daddy i don't want to move' she burst into tears as she hugged her father. <br>
<br>
Arik didn't want to leave the Faydark anymore than his little girl did, but he knew that life had a greater plan for him and his family, for the Goddess Tunare had not only blessed he and his wife with one child, but now another was going to be blessed to them. He put on his noble brave face for his daughter.<br>
<br>
'Now see here, Katie,' he said to his daughter, 'You are indeed a very lucky little one! How many little girls do you know that will get the chance to see more of the world at your age? It's going to be great, just wait and see!'  There are all kinds of wonderful things in the City of Freeport. Its a very exciting place, the land of oppertunity!'. <br>
<br>
His words comforted and intrigued the child. She seemd satisfied with them. He carried her into the cottage where Rose was finishing up dinner. The smell of fresh baked bread and hot wild onion soup filled the room. His wife looked worried and tired. She'd obviously been quite busy all day packing up the families belongings for tomorrow's move. Crates were stacked up in the corner, filled  with all that wouldn't be used before the next day. <br>
<br>
 Arik, Rose and Katrinity all sat down to their last supper in their home. Then Rose washed up the supper dishes, and together they tucked the little one into her bed for her last sleep in the only room she'd known her entire life. They sat together, out on their porch, sipping Elven wine and holding hands. Not many words were spoken, they both knew that this was the last time they'd sit like this, as they had so many many times. <br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  The rain was light but persistant in the Faydark. Arik loaded up the crates of his families belongings onto the wagon Rose's father had brought over. Rose and her mother were inside, making sure all was accounted for and reminiscing. Katrinity sat on the porch with her friend, Nenuvin.<br>
<br>
'Rosie' , Arik called to his wife. 'Rosie its time to go'.<br>
<br>
Rose came out of the cottage with her mother and Arik scooped Katrinity into his arms and set her in the front of the horse drawn wagon. Katrinity waved to her friend as tears flowed down her cheeks. Arik helped Rose and her mother up into the wagon as well. He and Rose's father sat up front, stearing the horses. Rose began to sob as their cottage dissapeared into the distance, and her mother comforted her. <br>
<br>
 The dock where they would meet their ship was in the Butcher Block moutains, a good 4 hour ride from the Faydark.The mountains were rugged, with various creatures scampering about. The greatest danger they faced here was that posed by the goblins - vile creatures that took pleasure in attacking wayward travelers if they strayed too far off of the path.  Few words were spoken as they made their way to the docks. The rain seemed to follow them, to hover over them somehow. Katrinity had fallen asleep holding her favorite elven doll. Rose watched her daughter as she slept and hoped her dreams were pleasant ones.<br>
<br>
 As they approached the shipyard they could hear the dwarven portmaster call out.  There were many people here as this was the only Faydwarian port where ships came and went to and from Freeport and also to the new land of Kunark. There were a good number of outlanders here as well. Humans, Half Elves, Halflings, Erudites and Barbarians alike came to the continent of Faydwar in search of its finest and most exlusive things : Dwarven smithed goods, Elven wine, tinkered items from the secretive Gnomes. <br>
<br>
 Arik and Rose's father loaded their belongings onto the lower deck of the ship as Rose, Katrinity and Rose's mother all stood together at the docks in a tear-filled embrace. Rose had not always seen eye to eye with her mother but they were still very close. When the shipmaster called the 'All Aboard' the tears became an outpour of heartache and grief between the two. Katrinity hugged her grandparents tightly, and Arik promised theyd write often. Arik carried his daughter and his wife followed, wiping her tears as they continued to flow. They stood on the upper deck of the Storm Breaker and waved good-bye to their family, and the land they'd called home for all of their lives as the ship departed for the land of Antonica. <br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
   After being on board the ship for 2 days and 2 nights, it felt good to be on land again, even if it was a strange land. The city of Freeport was a very busy one. Many new people and things to see. Rose held Katrinity's hand tightly so as not to lose her in the crowds of people. Arik made arrangements to get their crates taken to their new home - which was on the Northern part of town. <br>
  <br>
  The city itself  was alive with activity. Auctions could be heard in the distance from street merchants peddling their ware's. Taverns and Saloons seemed to be located on every street in this part of town. The fishmarket, located near the docks was quite a popular place it seemed. Everything seemed to be set at a much faster pace than they were used to. After a few hours the family came to their new home. It was a small, quaint little house, nestled in the heart of Northern Freeport. Blue on the outside. two stories tall. Upon entering you were in the main room, the 'living quarters' It had a lovely cedar bench, much like the one in their cottage back home, but slightly bigger. It also had a fireplace.  Off of the living quarters there were 3 doors. One lead to  a rather huge kitchen and dinning area, another to a set of  stairs that lead up to a set of 3 bedrooms, and the third door opend to a small one roomed shop, where Arik would make weapons for a living. Katrinity seemed contented enough with her new room, tho she'd miss falling asleep to the Elven singing at night. Rose was in awe of such a beautiful home, she wished her mother could see it.  <br>
<br>
 The North part of town didnt seem as bustled, it was a well kept part of town, and had the least amount of crime. Near their home was a series of food shops, tailoring shops and also a bank. Once all their belongings had been unpacked they went to market to get food and supplies. <br>
<br>
 The next day was time to begin living their new lives here, in Freeport. They took Katrinity to the Arcane Science Acadamy of Western Freeport. It was alot bigger and more developed than that of the one in Felwithe. Katrinity was the only Elven child to be enrolled here, but she didn't seem to mind. Instead of one guild master she had several. Also instead of having seperate classes for Enchanterism, the Academy had Magicians and Wizards in some of the same classes as well. It would take some adjusting, but diversity could be a good thing, as her daddy had told her. <br>
<br>
 Rose decided to place an advertisment in the local Freeport newsletter to do some tailoring work from her home. She didn't have many patrons but enough to keep her busy a few days a week. She spent the rest of her time baking which was her favorite hobby, and preparing for the newcomming baby. <br>
<br>
   Arik learned how to forge combine weapons. He'd also heard of a new kind of weapon, that could only be made from 'velium', which had to be shipped from the unexplored regions of Velious. He still had a good supply of currency saved up from the closing of his shop back in Felwithe, and he decided to take a chance. He used a good portion of his savings to order a shipment of this velium, and began to forge some velium weapons. To his surprise they sold very quickly, and with his profit he invested in yet 2 more shipments of velium. He repeated this process, and soon he was well known for his finely crafted velium weapons. His business didn't take long to flourish. <br>
<br>
  Three months after they'd moved to Freeport, Rose gave birth to a baby boy. They named him Arikonias Starbane the second. His big sister adored him, and gave him the nickname Aillaen. It wasn't too long before the whole family called him Aillaen. The Starbanes adjusted rather well to haste of Freeport life. Katrinity was doing exceptionally well in school and had even made a new friend, a little Wood Elven girl who lived only 3 houses down from them, named Lilamdarye. Kat and Lil played together every day when school was over with. Arik's business was still doing great and Aillaen was growing faster every day. Rose was content with her part time tailoring and her full time motherly duties. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
  As a few years passed, the family slowly found new traditions. Each Saturday morning, theyd get up at dawn, Rose would bake fresh honey rolls with sweet butter. They'd have breakfast and all go together to the Eastern Commonlands, an hour's ride from Northern Freeport.<br>
<br>
 Eastern Commonlands were world wide famous for the auctions that took place there. Many items from the new world could be found there for sale. It was quite helpful for Arik's business as well. He could auction some of his finer works there for a good sum of platinum. <br>
<br>
 The land itself was partially forest and the other half desert. One of its most common dangers was the occasional undead or the poisonous snakes that scurried about, but the most dangerous of all were Griffon's, Flying creatures that seemed to have a body similiar to that  of a lion, with a bird like beak, and razor sharp claws. These beasts were feared by almost everyone.  <br>
 <br>
 Katrinity was now 10 seasons old, and her little brother was 6 behind her. Katie, as her father called her, had a good sense of business having been around her father much of her life. She made some of her own money by using her gift of enchanterism to enchant metals such as Brellium, and Velium for her father to make weapons with. She would also make vials of mana for her mothers tailoring needs, and in turn, she was given some of her own money for clothes, jewelry or whatever she wanted to buy. <br>
<br>
 One day, while on one of their outtings to the commons, the destiny of this family changed once more. Arik, Rose, Katrinity and Aillaen were in the Eastern Commonlands when they heard a horrid blood-curtling scream. Arik's instincts had him grabbing his sword.<br>
<br>
'Rose' he spoke in a low tone of voice, 'take the children to the tunnel and stay there until I return'.<br>
<br>
  Rose did as he asked without hesitation. Arik, followed the direction of the screams and couldn't help but think back to the night he'd heard Rose screaming for help. He'd saved her from certain death as she was held captive by three Orcs. His mind snapped back to the current as he drew near the northern edge of the commonlands, near the dreaded Nektulos Forest boundary line. His senses were on alert and he knew he had to keep his wits about him. As he drew closer to the screams, he saw a large griffon hovering above the trees, he drew his sword and slayed the beast. <br>
<br>
  Cries of a weakend woman came from the nearby bushes. He put his blade away and walked to the bush, startled by what he saw. Laying there, bloodied and obviously near death, was a Teir'dal woman. She was gasping for air between sobs and trying to speak to him in a language he could not understand. Her weakend arms  motioned for the brush a few feet from her. Arik, unable to comprehend what she was trying to tell him, went to the brush, where he found an infant Teir'dal girl. She was swaddled in a heavy leather wrap - obiously the woman had been motioning for the baby. <br>
<br>
 He carried the infant to the woman, who kissed her on her forehead and spoke yet more words he could'nt understand. She then handed the child back to Arik as she faded into death. Shocked, unsure of what to do next and confused, Arik looked down at the infant. Teir'dal or not, he couldn't just leave this helpless creature out here to die. His heart was too big for such an act. He carried the child back to the tunnel where his wife and children awaited him.He only knew three things.  He knew that fate had made him the one to find her. He knew it wouldn't be easy. He knew they'd raise this child as their own.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=757539" target="top">Korynna Shadowhawk</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->-Proud Mommy to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=773913">Julyete</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
