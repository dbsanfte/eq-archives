With a snap consciousness returns, but only barely. There is pain, tremendous pain.  Darkness again.<br>
<br>
The worst of it was that he now remembered every detail. The wounds had been healed, and the camp ground had been cleaned. Limbs, blood, sinew and bone had all been removed and now only the memories brought pain. It was betrayal, pure and simple.<br>
<br>
Around the fire sat a warrior, a cleric and an enchanter. The warrior looked old; certainly not in his body which was obviously in its prime, but in his face. Strong muscles, broad shoulders, legs like an ox belied the evidence that his face portrayed. Here was a man who was near to the end. Lines drew together to form webs of despair. His face, obviously stern and hard at the best of time, was beyond haggard almost to resolution. He did not, or could not speak. The cleric was a halfling lady of that indescribable ageless look that all mature halfings are blessed with. She too said nothing, but she was obviously concerned about the warrior. She flitted about like the bees of Misty thicket. Poking here, checking there. She cast every spell and blessing that she had, all to no avail. The enchanter was unknown. With their repertoire of illusions one never knew who or what they were. The only thing that gave him away was the double sworded guardian that followed his every movement. He paced the camp his gnome form moving seemingly faster because of his proximity to the ground. <br>
<br>
A full day passed with no change. These adventurers were used to the rigors of camp and had disciplined themselves against physical and mental hardship. They could stay in a camp for an almost endless period of time patiently waiting for their prey. It was, in fact, a way of life for them. Somehow this was different. They did not wait for a prey, they waited for nothing; there was no air of anticipation, only resignation. <br>
<br>
“Friends”, the warrior began very slowly as if the words were stuck in his throat, “we have seen many things together. We have seen the realms of Norrath in almost every possible way. We have met friends and companions, sung tunes of battle, celebrated victory and tasted defeat. This betrayal, however, is the most vile bite I have ever tried to swallow.  It saps my will to continue. We expect deceit from our enemies it is all they know. When our companions turn on us, however, what are we to do. Why bother any more? The forked tongue of a friend hits harder than the worst blow of an enemy. They stalk in our midst and with their soft songs of temptation, promises of wealth untold, stories of adventure. Little do they know that once they succumb to the invitation they are used as fodder for the dreams of the few. They betray their friends for promises that turn to dust. Once I pitied them, waited for them to return home. Now, however, I have ceased to have patience with those who fall into the lair. To leave us in battle for our lives without even warning us of the departure is not excusable. I have seen many friends come and go. Some have passed in this realm, some have moved to other clans. I can respect their decision. I cannot, and will not, respect those that leave us in the middle of a battle and sneak off, thinking that we were doomed to death and they might seek safety elsewhere. Well, we did not die and we shall not perish. They will live to regret this day one and all”<br>
<br>
Here the warrior paused. Slowly he pronounced his curse “I Borm, Warlord of Rallos Zek, Baron of Halas proclaim to all who will bear witness: From this day forward the members of the clan &lt;Shaded Quintessence&gt; are my sworn enemies.  May their blades be cursed, may they fizzle in every casting, may their resists be cut off and THEIR enemies be strong. I will not speak to them, I will reject all assistance from them and I will never go to their aid. The day that I do is the day that I lay down arms and retire. I strike their names from my memory and spit at their shades.” He picked up his Defiance, appropriately named for his curse sealing,  and slashed his palms. His rubbed the blood on his face and chest and ground his hands together violently. “Cedylia” he growled, “do not heal these wounds. I want my scars to bear witness to my oath.”<br>
<br>
He stormed off into the night and none dared follow him.<br>
