The curious nature of this was that, while he held only one desire of his own, he found that he yet had free will. &quot;Perhaps Ilharess Poyson was unable to master two pets at the same time&quot;, he pondered - not for the first time. He still would come at her call, when it was desired, but when he desired to do something else, he was free to perform it as he willed.<br>
<br>
Today, he desired to perform another act.<br>
<br>
He found his way to Freeport, city of the humans. The large bustling town of commerce was where he was sure to find his answers. He desired to find those who knew who he was in the before time. On occasion, there were those who recognized him in his new form (he blamed this on the nametag on the outside of his armor) but for the most part he never cared to spend the time with them. He remembered not the before time, and those who did remember him had a disturbing tendency to be appalled by his new form. Not that he cared. The solitude of the Plane of Disease, slaying the living creatures within, served him fine. <br>
<br>
The problem he felt was that many had contacted him via carrier pigeon ((ooc: I call tells carrier pigeons)) and he was inadequately prepared to answer some of the questions which had been placed before him. He also found it ironic that even in his new state, the carrier pigeons were yet able to find him. He ended up with a second desire - to know who he was. To know who you were is good in helping to know who you are. <br>
<br>
On this day, he passed through the eastern part of the commonlands. A few foolish creatures - humans dressed in red and silver, with a shield emblazened on their tunic, dared to stand before him. Amusingly to Larraque, they typically ran in fear after a few seconds, before falling over in death. Larraque had learned how to emit an unholy aura, to choke and bind those who would stand before him. <br>
<br>
Upon approaching freeport's westernmost gate, he found the way closed to him. A portcullis had been dropped, and the guards behind the gate kept a healthy distance, bows readily trained on him. Larraque called to them &quot;I have questions! Questions that must be answered! Is there any within that know the name Larraque Meleagrance? Is there any who know who I am?&quot;<br>
<br>
The answer came, &quot;By order of the freeport militia! Depart creature, or die!&quot;<br>
<br>
Larraque thought it curious, as he was already dead. What would happen, should he die a second time? Larraque had little interest in finding out.<br>
<br>
Larraque had little fear of these humans - he had dispatched those who had come before them. But he knew that the number of them, and their range weapons, would be dangerous. He did not press the issue. Instead, he found his way to the north along the cliff face, where he kept a vigil. Any who wandered by, he would ask if they knew who he was. Most were fearful of him - the chill aura he gave off terrified them - they would flee before they would answer his question. He felt he could probably chase and destroy them, but he did not feel that they were worth the thought. The occasional rat, bat or orc who was foolish enough to wander too close were uncaringly gutted, their life blood seeping into the dirt below. <br>
<br>
Pondering the earlier events of the day, Larraque reminised upon being told by Poyson after serving her breakfast that the answers he saught could be very painful. He did not believe this would be possible - he soon realized that he was mostly incapable of emotion. How could a memory cause pain? <br>
<br>
Interfering on his revelry, strangers approached... however, these strangers appeared to know him. Unsure if these strangers, not dressed in the typical garb of the freeport militia, were here to kill him, he watched them and called for them to identify themselves.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=larraquemeleagrance>Larraque Meleagrance</A> at: 7/23/03 9:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=idanya>Idanya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/03 2:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1062.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span><hr size=1> *the young teir'dal lass approched him, the look of recognition lighting her eyes mixed with that of intense saddness*<br>

<br>
&quot;Ilharess, I dare apologize, but I do not know you. I am afraid that I do not remember much. Things have changed, and I do not remember much at all about who I am. I know my name, and I remember bits and pieces of my past, but not enough I'm afraid. Many times I receive letters from people, the pigeons still find me. And yet, I cannot adequately answer them. And most of these people knew very little of Larraque Meleagrance.<br>
<br>
I felt that I would come to freeport. The number of people who travel through here would help me find who I was. In knowing who I was, I may be able to find out who I am. <br>
<br>
And I would desire it if you would tell me about Larraque Meleagrance, if you do know me. And if not, take me to a sage who would.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blue bard begins: &quot;Well, I am...&quot; and is abruptly cut off.<br>
<br>
&quot;I CARE NOT who you are. I only desire to know of Larraque Meleagrance. If that is NOT your name, do not discuss yourself with me.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=idanya>Idanya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/29/03 4:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1062.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span><hr size=1> *Her emerald eyes flash with a hint of anger as she steps forward.

However, since ye care naut and wish to speak to a sage instead, may I direct ye to Skyshrine, as ye once worshiped the Wurm Queen Veeshan.  Ye also once told me that ye wished it to be yer home.  Though I also know that in greif and rage ye ravaged the temple.....t'is most likely how ye came to be as ye are now.  Gods do tend to become rather *gestures a moment trying to find a suitable word* testy when their followers go ravageing their temples.<br>

<br>
So, ye can chose to either go to Skyshrin and seek yer answers there, or ye coudlst stop being so bloody moody and have a nice chat with yer ex-lover.  <br>

Indeed. You are the third person who has made such a claim. It seems Larraque lead a very.... charmed life. Both of the previous ones knew little about Larraque, however. Perhaps your information will be more.... forthcoming, Ilharess. Skyshrine is a long ways away, in any case, and you are here. <br>
<br>
So Larraque once worshipped the wurm queen. This I do not know, but it may explain the vision of falling into the ocean. Indeed. This only poses more questions....<br>
<br>
Well, why don't you have a seat? This may take a while, and I will not let you leave until you have adequately answered my questions. Oh, don't look so concerned. I do not desire to kill, or even to touch you. Physical interests have long since passed me by. <br>
<br>
I'm afraid I did not prepare for the comforts of others, but there was a nice wagon that came from the west and was attacked by orcs about a hundred meters away. The orcs helped themselves to most of the goods inside, but the wagon is still there. Walk with me, you can have a seat there.&quot;<br>

She should have known that there would be others, as she had left him.  Still learning this fact stung a little just the same. <br>
<br>
She noted his expression of anger, but said nothing. <br>

She took a seat upon the wagon, makeing herself as comfotable as possible.*<br>

&quot;Ilharess Poyson....the same seems familar but I fear I can nay place it.&quot;<br>

&quot;Ah, xas.....she is the &quot;Very good friend&quot; of Senger Dalion.  I remember seeing her once in forests outside of Neriak.  T'was when I first met Senger Dalion.  He helped my family against an attack from the Lust for Blood, but he claimed to have only fought them because they had insulted Jalil Poyson.

<br>
Larraque asks a few more questions, mostly referring to the time Idanya and Larraque shared together, Larraque looking very impassive throughout the whole discussion, and eventually Idanya mentions something about a book.<br>
<br>
Curious about the book, Idanya mentions it is a journal. (I do not know if Idanya would have kept the journal or not - if she does have it, Larraque would request it at this time, if she does not have it, Larraque would ask where it is)<br>
<br>
It's impossible to tell if Larraque has noted the inquisitive look on the elf's face- hard to tell if he chooses to ignore it as he starts reading his journal of his former life curiously. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=idanya>Idanya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/03 6:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1062.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span><hr size=1> (( she would have had it, but not on her.
