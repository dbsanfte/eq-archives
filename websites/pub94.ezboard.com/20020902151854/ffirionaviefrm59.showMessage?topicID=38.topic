There were more deaths than I would have liked, and it took longer than I'd like (I got TL'd out just before 5 central, meaning a 5 hour raid).  Next time I'll probably bring a 6th group just to kill him even quicker, unless I have all 30 toons 51-52.<br><br>The beast convienantly spawned litteraly while Celesta and I were checking to see if he was up (not on track when we zoned in, hit track again and there he was!).  Unfortunately, no epic pieces dropped.  Loot: Drums (Meledi), Crook (Wikkin), Crook (Celesta), Mithril Arms (Ninichka), Torque (Larney), JP quest crystal (Puvdar), Polished Mask (Mariuss), Tishans Orb (Eldarr), Blight (Endalmir).<br><br>Will probably go after him again on Labor Day, assuming there is no other raid conflicts.<br><br>Findra<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Edit:  Just check, and Naggy is not yet up.  Still planning on throwing the raid.  We will take out the giants even if naggy is not up (good practice).  Hopefully he spawns in the next 12 hours.<br><br>Edit:  Just did a quick tally of the signups, and we still have no Enchanter nor Druid.  A 51 druid would be very nice for Circle of Winter, and a couple enchanters would be great for clarity/haste/tash.  A few more wizards would be good too.  As usual, there are tons of tanks signed up.   Still don't know if he is going to be up - gonna check either late tonight or tomorrow sometime.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     Edit:  Just checked the sony website, and discovered there is no longer a patch this week, so Naggy might not be up.  As always, we only raid if he is up. (Killed 8/18 at about 7:30 pm central)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>I'm calling an open raid to take down Lord Nagafen on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Sunday August 25th at Noon central</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (10 am pacific, 1 pm eastern, 6 pm GMT - I think).<br><br>Ideally we will have 5 balanced groups (see bottom of post) composed of toons level 46-52. I realize this isn't very likely to happen, and I'll state these exceptions up front:<br><br>Clerics as low as 44 (preferably with Celestial Healing)<br>Bards as low as 44<br>1 cleric above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br>1 enchanter above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br>1 shaman above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br>1 magician above 52 for summoning items &amp; debuff attempt<br>1 druid above 52 for buffing &amp; debuff attempt<br><br>Toons over 52 will not be able to fight the dragon, but can help kill giants in addition to buffing, etc.  If we really want to get ambitious, any 53+ people can try to land one debuff on Vox.<br><br>If sign-ups or class balancing demand it I am willing to increase this to 6 groups.<br><br><br>Everyone coming on the raid should have unbuffed (meaning no buffs, no summoned items, no disciplines) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       fire and magic resist at least 60</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, preferably 100+.  I recommend Netherbian Chitin (plate chest - 10 FR), emerald jewelry, Earrings of Fire Reflection (5 FR - gypsies in Lava), Fireclaw cloak (10 FR).  Remember - resists are MUCH more important than AC.  Also bear in mind the summoned gear we will likely have - blankets (shoulder or back - 15 fire/magic), defenders (secondary or back - 5 cold/magic), mystical dagger (held,range or ammo? - 5 magic).  It would suck to go through a bunch of effort to obtain something that you will replace with summoned gear.  I've heard there are other mage summoned fire/magic resist items, but I'm not sure what.  Perhaps a high level mage can post the options... (hint, hint)<br><br>We will be gathering at the Lavastorm Druid ring.  If you are a druid signing up please be prepared to port people 30-60 minutes before the start time - thanks in advance.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Don't be late!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I will be putting groups together at noon sharp.  Sign-ups get priority, but expect to have final groups announced at about 12:10, and us entering SolB at about 12:15.  Possibly earlier if everyone who signs up gets there on time.<br><br>I will be suppling peridot for buffs.  If you want a TL out at the end, make sure your destination doesn't require a TL stone, or have one to give to the wizzy.<br><br>I highly recommend everyone take measures to reduce lag - nothing sucks worse than going LD right as everyone charges the dragon (possibly the highest lag moment of the raid).<br><br>There will be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       NO GATING</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> during the raid.  If anyone gates out of SolB at any time, for any reason they are booted from the raid.  Don't even have the spell memorized.  If you fall in the lava, get massive aggro, whatever - you die.  You will get rez'd (almost guaranteed 90% or better), and the raid will continue.  If you gate out, you WILL train the raid when you come back.  That is why I do not allow gating.<br><br>********** Chat Channels ********** <br><br>Please use the following chat channels:<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       NAGRAID</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - raid wide chat<br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       NAGLISTEN</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - important announcements only. This is where I talk, MA posts messages, snarers announce when snares land, etc. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       NO CHAT HERE.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       NAGLEAD</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - all group leaders (first toon listed for each group) and raid leaders will communicate here. Please use chain of command whenever possible (toons -&gt; group leaders -&gt; raid leaders)<br><br><br>********** Giants ********** <br><br>Giants will be killed in groups that are essentially the dragon groups, except the melee groups will have a cleric instead of a bard - all depends on the class composition of those who sign up.  Everyone be patient, as pulling the giants from Naggy's lair is not easy and may take a while.  Killing them is easy, getting them away from Naggy is hard.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Go to www.eqatlas.com and familiarize yourself with the layout.  MEMORIZE THE MAP.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Our path will be (from the entrance to SolB from LS, using the eqatlas map for reference): [9] Block Crusher Trap, [12] Nox Corridor, [13] Stone Spider Room, Prep for giant killing, [15] Entrance to Fire Giant Castle (kill 2 giants), move up to the area next to the lava and pull giants.  When fighting giants here (loc -1180, -220) all MELEES NEED TO PUSH THE GIANTS INTO THE CORNER OF THE WALL (BEHIND THE CANDELABRA).  If the giants get into the lava it is very, very bad.  When the throne room [16] is cleared of giants, we will move up to it.  All but the last few giant will be pulled to the throne room or the little room just before the drawbridge.  We will then cross the drawbridge [18] and pull the remaining giants to the hallway before Naggy's antechamber.  When all the giants are killed we move up to the antechamber for buffing.<br><br>MA = ???<br>SA = ???<br>Puller = ???<br>Backup puller = ???<br>Loot mistress = Findra<br>Traffic control = ???<br><br><br>********** Buffing ********** <br><br>Remember, buffing is the longest most boring part of raids.  It is also the trickiest and most important.  Please be patient, pay attention and execute your duties in this phase quickly - whether it is casting a single junk buff, singing a mana song or moving and camping at the right time.  Things will get done much faster if we all do this.<br><br>Buffing will be done in Naggy's antechamber.<br><br>Buffing will done in groups.  Each group will step up to the buffing area (the center of the antechamber) and get the following buffs, in order:<br><br>#01 caster        1 junk buff (e.g. resist cold)        <br>#02 caster        1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)        <br>#03 caster        1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease)        <br>#04 shaman        stamina        <br>#05 shaman        Harnessing of spirit        <br>#06 cleric        shield of words         <br>#07 cleric        Heroic Bond        <br>#08 cleric        symbol of naltron (reagent: peridot)<br>#09 enchanter     rune IV / V (reagent: peridot)<br>#10 enchanter     group resist magic         <br>#11 druid         circle of winter<br>#12 enchanter     haste / clarity         <br>#13 open          Chloro, Damage Shield, or open for Celestial Healing, etc.<br>#14-15 open       for bard resist songs        <br><br>Buffers will announce when they start and finish each buff (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       buffers should make hotkeys</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->).  When the 'final' groups are posted a caster will be assigned to each buff, so check back before the raid.<br><br>Fully buffed groups will camp out to the FV chatroom immediately upon getting 11 buffs (12 for casters - clarity).  Haste will be reapplied just before the charge.  Relog every 20 minutes to refresh summoned items.<br><br>After all the melee groups and nuker groups have camped the buffers will med to full and buff themselves.  When the buffers are back up to 80 mana from these final buffs everyone from the chatroom will be told to reenter the game.<br><br><br>********** Dragon ********** <br><br>General notes: <br>1) Everyone should have hotkeys setup to announce significant actions.  Group leaders should announce when their group has engaged, casters should announce attempts to debuff, etc.<br><br>2) To land spells you need to be within Naggy's melee/AoE range.  Best place is right by his butt.  This is why EVERYONE needs good resists, full buffs, etc.<br><br>3) Healing.  If we have dragon groups setup with no clerics in the melee groups, each group will have an assigned cleric (or two).  When tanks need a heal they should 1) send a tell to their designated cleric (have a hotkey for this), 2) turn off attack and 3) back away from Naggy &amp; towards their cleric once they no longer have aggro.  Clerics should have hotkeys to target all of their designated tanks, as well as an /rtarget hotkey.  If we get 3-4 clerics each tank group will have a cleric and this will be easier.<br><br>4) Pushing.  20 tanks beating on Naggy will push him around.  It is imperative that Naggy NOT get pushed into the lava.  Naggy gets healed by being in the lava.  If Naggy starts to get close to the lava MOVE YOUSELF so that you don't make it worse.  If necessary, melees should stop attacking and back away to get Naggy back into the center of his room.  Same goes for pushing Naggy into walls.<br><br><br>When all groups have reformed the MA group will enter Naggy's chamber and engage.  Tanks remember to activate disciplines.  Bard's priorties are 1) Elemental Rhythms, 2) Guardian Rhythms - have your best drum out.  Haven't figured out what would be the best 3rd song to twist (if possible), but it needs to be low aggro.  Also, bards should NOT be attacking Naggy. 1) puts you up the aggro list, 2) minimal damage output when you have a drum going, 3) Ripostes will kill you quick.  We need the bards alive to keep our resists up.<br><br>As soon as the MA group has engaged Naggy and has him positioned in the middle of his lair all remaining melee groups will enter and position themselves behind Naggy.  MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT PUSHING NAGGY TOWARDS THE LAVA NOR INTO A WALL.  The casters can move up from the antechamber to the landing at the north end of the bridge (I will have a hotkey to announce such).<br><br>At 60-70 debuffing will be attempted. Shaman/magician will attempt Malosi, shaman will attempt slow, one enchanter can attempt tash, bards can twist in a debuff (magic or cold resist).  This is where 53+ toons can attempt a debuff and get kicked out (or DOT/nuke/group heal, whatever one spell you can add before you get booted).<br><br>At 50 nukers charge, get under Naggy and blast away.  Melee's with nukes go at it as well.  Remember that fire based spells have essentially zero chance of sticking (correct me if I'm wrong).<br><br>If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Naggy targeted) for 300+ damage.<br><br>Hopefully enough of us live to take him down.<br><br><br>********* LOOT ********* <br><br>- Loot will be called by group leaders in channel NAGLISTEN and given to me (Findra).  Only group leaders should be looting.  Everything will be rolled on at the end only.  A person can only win 1 item but can give it back if they win a second item (first item will be rerolled). Roll will be done on a 0-1000 random.  <br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        - Need before greed - don't roll unless you are going to use the item.  If no one is going to use the item ALL will roll.<br> - ONLY the classes list below get to roll for each item.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If you have a problem with this, post your reasons and I may change something, but whatever is post when the raid starts is final.<br><br>Bladestopper  +25 AC +15 Sta +50 HP (Ra Sm C P Sk B Ro Wr) <br>Blight, Hammer of the Scourge  Dmg 23, Dly 47. +9 Sta +9 Wis +9 Int +10 vsDis (Sm)<br>Brown Chitin Protector  +12 AC +9 Sta +9 Agi +9 Dex (D)<br>Cloak of Flames  +10 AC +9 Agi +9 Dex +15 vsFire +50 HP (war/rog/mnk/pal/rng/sk/bst/brd)<br>Crown of King Tranix  +13 AC +15 Cha +20 vsMg (brd/enc/mnk/bst) <br>Gauntlets of Fiery Might  +10 AC +7 Str +7 Sta +7 Dex +7 vsPos +7 vsDis (Ra P Sk B Mk Ro Wr) <br>Gold Plated Koshigatana  Dmg 9, Dly 25.
