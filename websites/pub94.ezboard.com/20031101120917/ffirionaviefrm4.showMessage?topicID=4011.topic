<br>
So about a month ago, one of the multi-line phones in the multi-line phone systems at my business finally died.  Okay, I'll be perfectly honest, the buttons were sticking and when one of the line buttons got stuck in the &quot;open line&quot; position (which puts the phone on speakerphone) I unplugged it and then assassinated it a la the photocopier scene in &quot;Office Space&quot;.<br>
<br>
Being that I was absolutely disgusted with the phone system I had, I opted to acquire a new phone system rather than just replace the one particular phone.  Long story short, my telephone carrier suggested that I go with a Siemens multi-line system, that among other things has up to 8 cordless handsets that can be added to the system - which is a good feature in the case of my business with myself and my staff having to run around constantly.<br>
<br>
Anyhew, I await the delivery of my new phone system, much like a child on Christmas Eve.  When the phones show up, I go about setting up the system, when I find that at one particular station, the phone won't work (no dial tone).<br>
<br>
In the box for the phone is a card with very huge red letters and numbers supplying a telephone number for the Siemens Customer Care center.  I dial the number and I am very happy that after only 10 minutes of holding, I finally get to talk to a human being.  In the intial 30 seconds of dealing with the customer care representative, it felt as though I was dealing with a trained expert in the areas of &quot;customer care&quot; and &quot;telephones&quot;.<br>
<br>
I explain the situation to the representative and after delving into his vast repetoire of telephone system problem solving skills, the representative's suggestion is to unplug the power cord and phone jack cords from the phone, let it sit for 10 minutes, plug it back in, try it again, and if that doesn't work to call the Siemens Customer Care (SCC for short) center again.<br>
<br>
So, I try his suggestion and LO AND BEHOLD THE PHONE STILL DOESN'T WORK.  I call the SCC, wait on hold about 12 minutes, get a human being, quote my case number, and the guy begins to tell me to perform the same &quot;procedure&quot; that the last representative asked me to perform.  I explain that I've already tried that and the phone still won't work.  The representative then says that it appears I have a defective unit and that they will issue a replacement unit.  I wanted to argue with him and ask if there was something else I could try, however the representative again stated that it &quot;appeared&quot; that the unit I had was defective and that a replacement unit should be issued.  I said okay thanks.<br>
<br>
Over the next couple of days I was so busy that I just left the issue with that particular phone alone, however when I had time a RADICAL thought occured to me:  I would try to use the &quot;defective&quot; phone unit at a different station.  I plugged it in and it worked!  I then had a telephone technician come in and change the wiring at the station that wasn't compatible with the Siemens phone.<br>
<br>
Once I was sure that the &quot;defective&quot; unit worked at the desired station, I called Siemens, waited on hold for about 15 minutes, quoted 2 case numbers when prompted, and then explained the situation and that I did not require a replacement unit for my &quot;defective&quot; unit.  The representative stated that the replacement unit had been shipped, however that &quot;prepaid waybill&quot; (used to return the defective unit) would be included in the shipping carton, and that I could just send back the replacement unit, free of charge.<br>
<br>
About a week and a half later the replacement unit shows up.  I open the shipping carton and do not find a &quot;prepaid waybill&quot;.  I immediately call the SCC, wait on hold about 8 minutes, quote 3 case number and explain that I have received a replacement unit for a defective unit that works and that I would like to return the replacement unit to Siemens, however there is no prepaid waybill with which to return the unit.<br>
<br>
The representative's response:  &quot;How do you know the original unit isn't defective.&quot;<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;Because it works.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Then why was a replacement unit issued.&quot;<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;Because the representative I dealt with during case number blah-blah felt the original unit was defective, issue a replacement unit, and then I learned the trouble was with the phone line, not the unit itself, asked for the replacement unit not to be issue, however it already was and the representative from case number blah-blah-blah stated that a prepaid waybill would be in the shipping carton so that I could just send back the replacement unit.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;How do you know that the line wasn't working?&quot;<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;Because a Telus technician stated that that particular line was not compatible with this Siemens phone.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Who is Telus?&quot;  <br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;Telus is our telephone carrier here in British Columbia.&quot; (not that the rep should know exactly who Telus is, however that he questioned who they are is kind of silly)<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Oh, you're in Canada.  (which he should have known initially since every representative at the SCC immediately asks for you name, which brings up your profile, including address)  Well sir, if the unit was to be returned, a prepaid waybill would have been included.&quot;<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;But the phone is prefectly new and I don't need another one.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Don't worry sir you won't be billed.&quot;<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;But I want to return the phone.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;All product returns must be processed through (begins to give me another phone number before I cut him off)<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;I'm not requesting a monetary refund as I'm not returning the other phones.  I just want to send back this replacement phone that I don't need.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Sir, if the phone was to be returned a prepaid waybill would have been included.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point I realize I am stuck in a customer service idiot-loop and request to talk to a supervisor.  The SCC rep asks for my phone number (which is on my profile with them), gives me a case number and says that a supervisor will contact me.<br>
<br>
A few days roll by and no one calls me.  I think about it a bit and say &quot;Fuck it&quot; as I've wasted enough time dealing with them.  If they eventually ask me for the phone, I'll send it and if they bill me I'll bitch at them.<br>
<br>
Then, just this morning, a suspiciously familiar courier package shows up:  another Siemens phone system!<br>
<br>
I immediately call the SCC, wait on hold for 18 minutes and 27 seconds (the Siemens phones have a nice display that tells you how long you're on a particular call), provide my name, four case numbers and then explain that I've received a replacement unit phone that I don't need and would like to return it, however that I won't pay for the shipping. <br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Please use the prepaid waybill that would have come in the box.&quot;<br>
<br>
My response:  &quot;There is no prepaid waybill.&quot;<br>
<br>
The representative:  &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br>
<br>
My response after completely checking everything:  &quot;Yes I'm very sure.&quot;  I then explain the previous situation, the lack of a prepaid waybill, the fact that I still have ANOTHER uneeded replacement phone and that I'd like to return them.<br>
<br>
At this point the representative says &quot;OH...you're in Canada.  Please wait a moment as I need to put you on hold sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I wait a few minutes and the representative (who is very friendly) comes back:  &quot;Sir, I apologize for all of this inconvenience, but you have not been supplied prepaid waybills because you are in Canada.  We have no way of compensating you for the return of those units, so, and I didn't tell you this, if you don't hear from us in a month or so, enjoy your new phones.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was dumbstruck.  I asked him AGAIN if there was a way I could return the phones and be compensated, and the SCC rep just chuckled and said &quot;I wouldn't worry about it sir.  We're sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;  He then proceeded to quote me yet another case number and wished me a good day.  I stopped him and asked if I could send the units via mail and he asked me not to as the mail was not recommended for these units.  He then again wished me a good day.<br>
<br>
As a business owner, I was mortified that fuckups of this calibre (each of these phone units retails for just under $800) could occur in a company, particularly when the employees of the company know about it and just let them occur.<br>
<br>
So on a sarcastic note, if you live in Canada and you need a whole bunch of nice phones for free, I'd recommend Siemens.  <br>

<br>
...these are the same quality of people that are engaging in other phone related service activites...<br>
<br>
...like... oh... you know... alarm monitoring companies and such.<br>
<br>
I worked at this one company which shall go nameless.  A guy lived in a county where you were required to have an alarm permit for the fire department to respond to a fire alarm at your house (vs you being there and calling 9-1-1).<br>
<br>
He wasn't home, and his fire alarm went off.  The monitoring guy called the fire dept, it went something like this...<br>
<br>
[Guy] Hi... um... we have a house that has a fire alarm going off.<br>
<br>
[Fire Dept] Can I have the permit number?<br>
<br>
[Guy] A what?<br>
<br>
[Fire dept] A permit number is required for us to respond to a fire alarm.  Does the homeowner have a permit.<br>
<br>
[Guy] Ummmm.... no, I don't think so.<br>
<br>
[Fire dept] I'm sorry sir, than we can't respond.<br>
<br>
[Guy] Oh... okay.  /hangs up.<br>
<br>
That's all the action he took.  Didn't try to contact the home owner or any of the emergency contacts or anything.  Just moved on to his next call.<br>
<br>
Kicker is... the homeowner <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>had a permit</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!  It was right there on the account screen, the moron operator guy just didn't read it.<br>
<br>
Lucky for the homeowner it was just some food burning in the kitchen that set off the alarm.  He called us out of curiosity why his fire alarm went off but no one responded is why we were even aware of it.<br>

Actually, my brother works for the Siemens telecommunications branch.  Of course he writes software for the automatic routers for suburbs rather then making phones.  <br>
