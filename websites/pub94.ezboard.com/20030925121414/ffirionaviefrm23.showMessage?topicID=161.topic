<br>
Two knights.<br>
<br>
I came upon two knights this eve,<br>
both men of steel and might.<br>
Although they stood on diffrent sides, <br>
they fought a common fight.<br>
<br>
One was tall, of human ilk,<br>
his armor shone so bright.<br>
The other was a darker breed,<br>
his arms were void of light.<br>
<br>
I came upon the human first,<br>
his bright sword stained with blood.<br>
At his feet lay men-at-arms, <br>
their life turn dust to mud.<br>
<br>
When the last man fell, the knight did rest, <br>
and I questioned him with Why?<br>
Because, he told me with out pause, <br>
My god doth say they die.<br>
<br>
They stand against the light, he claimed<br>
Thier leader is most vile.<br>
I came here for his head, you see<br>
this was my choosen trial.<br>
<br>
Light casts shadow to the side,<br>
where I go it flees.<br>
With my sword, my sheild, my arms, my faith<br>
I will force it to it's knees.<br>
<br>
All who stand against my god,<br>
will suffer the same end.<br>
For it is I that am his will and fist, <br>
and you are all my flock to tend.<br>
<br>
But what of me, I asked the man<br>
I have no god but rhyme.<br>
That choice is folly he spat at me,<br>
you will change your course in time.<br>
<br>
I left the man and his armor bright, <br>
for shores so far away.<br>
That is where I met the second knight,<br>
at the passing of the day.<br>
<br>
This knight was dark as shadow,<br>
his skin the deepest blue.<br>
I found him as he battled guards,<br>
with his sword he ran them through.<br>
<br>
Countless fell beneth his blade,<br>
none had an easy end.<br>
I paused before I spoke with him, <br>
not wishing to offend.<br>
<br>
The knight spoke to me first at last,<br>
his voice was edged with hate.<br>
Speak now or you will join the rest,<br>
you shall not make it to the gate.<br>
<br>
To him I asked the same,<br>
as I asked the knight of light.<br>
Why is it that you kill these men,<br>
what possesses you to fight?<br>
<br>
My god has said it must be so,<br>
he orders that I kill.<br>
And kill I will from dusk till dawn, <br>
until He has his fill.<br>
<br>
The men were weak and I am strong, <br>
They deserved to die in pain.<br>
The light will never triumph,<br>
their struggle is in vain.<br>
<br>
We of the shadow are everywhere,<br>
we stand against their light.<br>
With every shadow they strike down,<br>
we win another fight.<br>
<br>
Hatred, fear and war we bring,<br>
our purpose is most pure.<br>
We will snuff out every light you see,<br>
of that you can be sure.<br>
<br>
With this the knight did smile at me, <br>
his teeth in moonlight shine.<br>
I thought it best to leave him there,<br>
and present the tale in rhyme.<br>
<br>
Two very diffrent knights I met,<br>
both devouted to their fight.<br>
But I can not help but wonder,<br>
are either of them right?<br>
<br>
One claims to fight for honor,<br>
to serve his god of light.<br>
But to those poor souls he slaughtered,<br>
is he little more then blight?<br>
<br>
The other is of darkness,<br>
and shadows are his pride.<br>
Although his actions are most foul,<br>
at least he does not hide.<br>
<br>
Which knight is more the villian?<br>
Which deserves renown?<br>
I say it matters little,<br>
to those they have struck down.<br>
 <br>
I hope the knights are present,<br>
here with us for their tale.<br>
As its purpose was to show them,<br>
they balance the same scale.<br>

<br>
but how are we stand against those who would do us harm.<br>
Are we supposed to cast away the great sword from our arm.<br>
I think that both these knights you speak of both were good and true.<br>
It matters not the God they worship, or of thier skins hue<br>
<br>
What matters then is why the killing proceeds in such a fashion.<br>
We cannot let the gods decide and kill for thier own passion.<br>
However we must set our course and do what we feel's right.<br>
For only then will we have found the path to righteous might.<br>
<br>
And when the path to righteous might is found and is secure.<br>
We'll find were marching on the path that leads to heavens door.<br>
And once we are at heavens door this world we shall not miss.<br>
For we shall live in tunares grace in heavens eternal bliss<br>
<br>
So back again to these two knight which one is right and wrong?<br>
The answer dear is both and niether, cant tell from just a song.<br>
Instead you must look into the depths of the beating heart.<br>
And inside see what motivates and makes them both apart<br>
<br>

It is no more powerful then any other tool.  Just like... a hammer.  A hammer can build, or it can tear down.  The hammer dun nay make the choice.  We do.<br>
<br>
At least... I do.<br>
<br>
It doesn't grant power, or respect, or esteem... The way you use it does that.  For you, maybe it is.. uhm... needed to be who you are.  Forgive me I do not mean to offend...<br>
<br>
I can be who I am without a piece of steel.<br>
<br>
What I do though... traveling and exploring... bringing messages... I need it though.  Like my backpack.  Or my Lute... I need those too.<br>
<br>
Just like a tent the protects you from the rain or snow, the sword helps protect me from people who think owning it gives them some sort of power.  Some right to impose their will on others...<br>

&quot;It is the outside that judges their actions and labels them as good or evil, based off of their own ideals and beliefs.  What is the salvation and light for one is no more than the suffering darkness for another.&quot;<br>

A bare shift on her feet reminded her of her own blade slung across it.<br>
