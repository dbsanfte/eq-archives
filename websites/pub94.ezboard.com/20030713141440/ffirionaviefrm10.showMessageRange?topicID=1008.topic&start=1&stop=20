For starters, she was a member of dubious standing in Qeynos's League of Antonican Bards, which was indeed very strange, since she was a Bard, but she also worshipped Veeshan. Not one in a hundred of her fellow minstrels had given their lives to the Dragons.  Then again, not one in a hundred of Zatdatine's fellow minstrels had betrayed their guild! <br>
<br>
Zatdatine thought about this as she sat in Fish's Ale sipping a Honey Mead in the moist heat of a summer night. Trumpy Irontoe, Fish's resident Dwarf, leered.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I had to make a choice,&quot; she said, &quot;and my choice was to align myself with the Ring of Scale--the Dragons. Otherwise, if I would have completed quests for the League of Antonican Bards and aligned myself with them, my standing in the Ring of Scale would have <br>
been lowered instead of increased!  Why, Veeshan?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Look who's here!&quot; called out Trumpy, whose breath smelled like too many Short Beers.  &quot;The bastard child!&quot; <br>
<br>
Zatdatine's head whirled around, her neck as taut as a Ranger's bowstring.  &quot;What was that?!&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;The bastard child!&quot; grinned Trumpy.  &quot;She's half-Human,<br>
half-Elf!  She can't tell whether she's one or the other!&quot; <br>
<br>
Zatdatine quickly jumped off her barstool, knocking it over with a wooden clatter, and placed her magical dagger, a Dragoon Dirk, to the rude Dwarf's neck.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll have you know,&quot; she hissed, &quot;that my mother and<br>
father were married before they had me, and as for knowing whether I'm Human or Elf, I am both, so shove<br>
off, you dirty old Dwarf!&quot;  Her turquoise eyes blazed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Sheez!&quot; cried Trumpy, his eyes wide with fear and awe, rubbing his neck.  &quot;Can't you take a joke, Zat-dat-een?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's Zat-a-tine,&quot; the platinum-haired Bard replied.  &quot;The D is silent.  Now, leave me in peace, or I shall have to call upon the might of the Dragon Queen to strike you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're interested in dragons, eh, girl?&quot; asked Trumpy slyly. &quot;Go into the catacombs and tell S'ragg Bloodheart hello for me!&quot; He took another gluttonous swig of his ale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you trying to get me killed?&quot; Zatdatine was furious. <br>
&quot;You know I can't go into the catacombs, and especially to where S'ragg Bloodheart lives, without worshipping Bertoxxulous!  I worship Veeshan, who is neutral, and<br>
I'm on a quest to find out as much information as I can about the Mother of all Wurms.  S'ragg won't help me!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If you wanna know a dragon personally,&quot; grumbled Trumpy, &quot;then go get eaten!  Night, night!&quot;  He belched.<br>
<br>
Zatdatine exited the tavern into the summer's heat, not knowing what to do next.  &quot;Should I go now?&quot; she asked herself.  &quot;Should I leave Qeynos?  Where should I start on my dream, this ultimate Dragon Quest of mine?&quot;   <br>

Zatdatine seemed approximately the same season as Kreeden. <br>
<br>
Kreeden arrived in Qeynos earlier in the night, and carefully made his way into the Fish's Ale, picking an isolated area to make himself comfortable.  Zatdatine's commotion stirred Kreeden from his resting state, which was a half squating half standing position against the wall.<br>
<br>
Her arguments with the short-excuse-for-a-bartender reminded Kreeden of his own struggles for equality, in a world where his brethern, and the art he practices is so frowned upon.<br>
<br>
Why Kreeden did what he did next still baffles him, a momentary flaw of character, lack of appetite, a mental lapse, he still is not sure.  As Zatdatine went out the door, Kreeden's reptilian eyes flashed at everyone in the room from beneath the heavy shrouded veil and robes he enclosed himself in.  As Kreeden in one fluid motion stood and took a step forward, Trumpy eyed him and excalimed, &quot; 'Ey!  There be a lizzy among us! &quot;.  Kreeden ran quickly out the door, and gathered shadows around him to hide himself.  Zatdatine was walking ahead, and stopped when she heard Trumpy's far to loud and intrusive voice.  Kreeden, concealed, crept up to Zatdatine, and whispered close to her ear,<br>
<br>
&quot;I am with you.  Let us go on your quessst.  Be aware I am not accccepted here, and though in every way different, our overall ssstruggle is very much the sssame.  Lead, I will follow.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/16/03 2:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Starting the Journey</span><hr size=1> Zatdatine appraised the shrouded figure. Iksar, no doubt.<br>
His reptilian eyes were hidden now, and only the dark robe surrounding his scales was all she could see. <br>
Well. Iksar were not frequent visitors to the city of Qeynos, as Antonius Bayle was opposed to all things <br>
evil--and all creatures evil.  Zatdatine supposed, through the shadows, that Kreeden was a Necromancer. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, she noticed Guard Beren, one of the good Guards of Qeynos, untainted by corruption, glance <br>
their way.  &quot;Keep walking,&quot; she whispered, &quot;as if you<br>
haven't noticed anything.  We'll head for the nearest<br>
exit to North Qeynos, and then toward the city gates!&quot; <br>
<br>
Kreeden nodded, and the two figures crept their way through the darkened city streets.  Noticing that the guards were very suspicious of the shrouded figure, Zatdatine drummed a chorus of Selo's Accelerando to<br>
speed their way through the city and past the gate. <br>
<br>
&quot;There!&quot; she whispered when the two were safely in<br>
the outer regions of Qeynos Hills, past the eyesight<br>
of the watchful kill-stealer Guard Nash.  &quot;That was<br>
easy!  Not too difficult for you, I suppose?&quot; she asked<br>
the Iksar, who was panting a little from the great rush of <br>
speed that her percussion song had provided.   <br>
<br>
Zatdatine sat down.  &quot;No one can see us here,&quot; she<br>
told the figure, &quot;at least not any guards.  Near the <br>
gnoll-caves of Blackburrow, there is a wooden shelter where we can camp.  I'm rather tired; how about you?&quot;  <br>
Her eyes were kind, even though Kreeden was of a <br>
race of creatures that she was supposed to slaughter. <br>
<br>
She led Kreeden to the shelter of which she spoke, <br>
a meager wooden box-like room with only a campfire<br>
by it.  Within, she told the shrouded Iksar her story. <br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Zatdatine, and I'm a Bard.  I also serve<br>
Veeshan, known as the Wyrmqueen, because in all my<br>
days of experience, I've never known or heard of a life<br>
form more powerful than the Dragons.  Maybe save thee!&quot;<br>
She laughedsoftly, and continued.  &quot;I love the wurms!&quot;   <br>
<br>
&quot;I've lived all my life here in Qeynos, and all my life, I've known prejudice because I'm not completely Human or<br>
completely Elven.  Pure-bloods are Norrath's standard<br>
population, whether they be Ogre or Human or Troll!  I<br>
am one of the only creatures that be of mixed race.  <br>
Humans regard me as weak because of my Elven blood, and Elves regard me as tainted because they regard THEIR blood as not only pure, but superior to Man's.&quot; <br>
<br>
She watched as the figure nodded, the hood of his shroud bobbing up and down.  &quot;What is your name and<br>
history, O Iksar?&quot;  She glanced around for gnolls. None. <br>

The iskar were a race not known for conversation with other races other than battlecries.  However, somewhere deep down in his scaly skin, Kreeden felt a connection with the chipper half-elf.<br>
<br>
Kreeden removed his shroud, his distinctly figured reptilian face exposed and his eyes flickering a flux of dark green and pale red's.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am from Cabilis, as are all others of my race.  However, Kunark soon began to bore me.  The lore there was not interesting to me as it is my own lore.  I'm sure you feel much the same way about your home city, wherever you may have came from.  I grew dissatisified with life on Kunark, and I gathered some books of lore of Antionican cities, and the cities of Faydwer, and even the mystical isle of Odus.  These interested me very much, the candle in my room was lit well into the night, as I hovered over these pieces of literature, fanciful stories of mighty dwarves, cities in trees, strongholds of orcs and gnolls.  All so unreal to me.  One night I was reading of a brave barbarian warrior, in search of a mystical polar bear in the icy tundra of permafrost, when I fell asleep.&quot;  Kreeden paused and gathered his thoughts as Zatdatine looked on and slowly nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;My master discovered me there, late for class, face buried in a book titled &quot;History of Halas Vol. XIV.&quot;  Of course, this did not fare well.  Usually crimes such as this were to be punsihed by death, however my father holds high position in the regiment of Cabilis, so it was decided for me to be exiled.  I was sent out of the city, into the backyard I once called home, now called hell.  I made my way to Firiona Vie, very carefully, as that settlement would not tolerate my appearence by any standards.  I cloaked myself in shadows as I approached the city, and I made my way to the docks as a ship came into view, luckily I attracted no attention and made it safely to the ship.  There I found an empty storage area and I drifted to sleep.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Kreeden looked rather pensive for a moment, then managed a frown and said, with a hint of regret, &quot;I fear this story has rambled on to long.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine's brows narrowed, &quot;What do you mean?  Can't you tell of how you came to Fish's Ale?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden quickly said, &quot;I'm a necromancer, yet I shun from pure hate.  Hate is an uncontrollable part of everyone that should not be provoked.  If you must know I was discovered by a ship-hand whom clubbed me with an empty barrel.  I killed him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine moved back a bit, processing what she just heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I killed him, it was self defence.  I am no murderer.  There was no land in sight, as I peeked from around the corner of where I'd just slaughtered a man.  from behind me I heard mumblings, I turned and upon a tier above me there was a militia of three of four wizards, seemed to be humans but I couldn't tell, my eyes were not well-adjusted to the light yet and the sun was directly behind them.  They were gathering mana and directing it at me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine leaned a little closer, with mounting interest.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am no powerful necromancer.  I have had only basic instruction and knew I was no match for this team of wizards.  I grabbed my dagger and with a quick slice was able to cut a taunt rope behind me, bringing a sail down between me and the wizards, just as their mana reached full capacity.  I dove into the water, being an excellent swimmer, swam a solid fifty or so yards from the ship before surfacing.  The ship was quickly falling apart, the sails on fire and falling, I watched the ship shrink into the distance, and then realized that I was in the middle of nowhere, with only a waterlogged map to guide me.  I floated helplessly for a while, turning over different options in my head, deciding that gating back to Cabilis was not a good option and that swimming in any direction continiously will only get me exhausted.  I had learned in my studies that there is a current in the seas around Antonica, a circular one.  Thusly, I swam in the direction the ship had dissappeared.  I came across some driftwood, climbed onto it, and rested.  I stayed on the wood for at least 6 sunrises.  Often I swam, pushing my make-shift raft, only to get my skin wet so the sun may dry it out again.  Eventually, I came across Qeyons.  I climbed ashore, and rested.  The rest you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine nodded thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;I get long winded at times, I apologize&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No proble-&quot;  Zatdatine stopped midsentance &quot;- What's that sound?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden and Zatdatine stopped and turned their attention towards the one door of the wooden hut. Hurried footsteps, many feet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/17/03 11:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You'd better STOP--HEY!

whomever the footsteps might belong to. They both<br>
listened, hearing a conversation not meant for any<br>
ears--save the good guards of Qeynos and the <br>
servants of Tunare and Karana in Surefall Glade! <br>
<br>
&quot;Good rangers,&quot; they heard a deep voice rumble, <br>
presumably a guard's (maybe Guard Bixby?), &quot;it<br>
seems to us that there is a Necromancer, an Iksar,<br>
running wild about these lands, and we need your<br>
help to track him--or her!--down and slaughter him!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Holly Windstalker, a level 33<br>
Human Ranger, a Protector of the Pine.  &quot;I'll certainly<br>
do as much as I can, and if I find this lizard, I'll slice<br>
him to ribbons!  Natural selection at work, I always say,<br>
especially for an Iksar!  Servant of Thule!  Bah!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll also set myself to the task,&quot; said the Half-Elven<br>
Apprentice of Saxuus, who so far had taken to running<br>
along the Qeynos Hills path with nary a how-do-ye-do.<br>
&quot;It is my duty to keep the path along Qeynos Hills safe,<br>
and if I run across this vile Iksar, I'll kill him, too!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; said Guard Bixby as Guard Nash nodded also.<br>
&quot;The lizard seems to be travelling with a girl, a Half-<br>
Elven Bard with hair the color of platinum, and if you<br>
see her, bring her in for questioning.  Consorting with<br>
an Iksar is punishable by death under Qeynos law!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Will do,&quot; said the Apprentice of Saxuus, speeding away.<br>
<br>
Zatdatine's blood temperature rose about 50 degrees. <br>
&quot;They're looking to kill!&quot; she whispered fearfully, &quot;and<br>
I suggest we risk attack by the gnolls and go through<br>
Blackburrow into the wilds of Everfrost.  There, we <br>
can at least escape for some time, and then when<br>
the danger is past, we can go back through the<br>
gnoll-caves and head for the Western Plains of Karana.<br>

off!&quot;  The Bard waited anxiously to hear Kreeden's reply. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreeden>Kreeden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.badassbuddy.com/images/buddies/badassbuddy_com-hydros.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/17/03 5:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Into Blackburrow</span><hr size=1> Kreeden only sighed, a rather lax reaction to just hearing his own death sentance told a few mere feet away.  Being hunted for no reason at all is what he expected, coming to a land where the lizards are not welcome for some reason.  Kreeden nodded at Zatdatine's propsal that they head to Blackburrow.<br>
<br>
Waiting a few moments, Zatdatine poked her head from the shelter to make sure the coast is clear.  Kreeden gathered shadows about him and followed Zatdatine, running towards a cave-like opening, dubiously carved into the shape of a gnoll, or so Kreeden guessed, from the illustrations of books he'd read.  Kreeden had never seen a gnoll, not that he had a burning desire to, but the thought crossed his mind as he blindly followed a young, yet brave, bard into the lair of them.  However, from around the corner of the opening lept a gnoll with a very large, rusted over scythe.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Gnoll!&quot;  Kreeden said in an urgent whisper, loud enough for Zatdatine to hear, yet hushed from ears that may be nearby.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not here!  Take it inside!  Can't let people see you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden was positive the gnoll couldn't see him however he feared for his comrade's safety.  Yes, care isn't something expected from his kind, however without Zatdatine he is lost in an unknown land whever everyone wants to kill him.  No, Kreeden liked his allies at the moment.  Kreeden followed Zatdatine inside the cave, into a narrow rather worn hallway.  safely around the corner, she waited for the gnoll to come around the corner.  Very quickly, she drew her Dragoon Dirk and placed it squarely in the right side of the gnoll.  He was hurt, but not dead, as he reared back and took a mighty swipe at Zatdatine's head.  He stopped, almost connecting with Zatdatine's head, and was surrounded by green transparent bubbles, they dispersed from his body and floated to the now revealed black hooded figure standing behind Zatdatine.  The gnoll staggered wildly, stunned not only at the lizard he was facing and the blakc magics that had just been evoked on him.  Zatdatine placed a firm finishing blow with her dirk in the collarbone of the gnoll.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I heard they were alot tougher in the books..&quot;  Kreeden said, managing a twisted grin visible beneath his veil.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, they are, that was a runt my friend.&quot;Zatdatine said grimly.<br>
<br>
The grin faded somewhat as Kreeden mentally prepareed himself for gnolls taller then him and very burly looking.  <br>
<br>
The two rested for a moment, Kreeden hiding in the corner and Zatdatine humming a soothing song.  Kreeden broke the silence, &quot;So, do you know your way around in here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine replied, &quot;I believe so, it should be a straight shot through, but I don't know what kind of opposition we might face.  When we leave this hallway it opens up into a vast area, bathed in sunlight, there is so many tunnels here that it will be very easy to get lost, so stay very close and remain hidden unless we're in serious trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden nodded, Zatdatine stowed her lute in her backpack, slid her dirk into her boot and they moved towards the exit of the hallway, Kreeden cloaked as always. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 253<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/17/03 9:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Wild Creatures of Everfrost</span><hr size=1> Zatdatine and Kreeden wound their way through the<br>
empty tunnels of Blackburrow, helped by their clear<br>
Infravision in the darkest places.  Eventually, they<br>
emerged into a snow-white landscape, the atmosphere<br>
fogged with a flurry of snowflakes. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is Everfrost,&quot; said Zatdatine.  &quot;As long as we<br>
stick around here, and not wander too far out where<br>
the ice giants can get us, then we should be able to<br>
sneak back into Blackburrow and through Qeynos<br>
Hills to the Western Plains of Karana very shortly.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kreeden pulled his dark shroud more closely around<br>
him, and Zatdatine sang her Elemental Rhythms, <br>
learned in her ninth season, protecting them both<br>
from the hazards of heat and cold.  The two explored.<br>
<br>
As Zatdatine expected, they encountered white wolves,<br>
gnoll pups, woolly spiders, snow orc troopers, ice goblin<br>
scouts and whelps, and other aggressive creatures.  However, none of them dared attack them, for Kreeden<br>
and Zatdatine were both far above them in seasons.  Instead, the wildlife watched them warily, unharmed. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, in the midst of their explorations, they heard<br>
a tiny voice:  &quot;Ugly creature near my feet, methinks you'd be good to eat!&quot;  It was an ice goblin whelp, no<br>
doubt, but THIS young goblin, unlike its fellows, was <br>
a bright shade of GREEN.  Green, like Tunare's leaves!<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Zatdatine said haughtily, &quot;but I don't think<br>
you'd want to eat us!  The Iksar and I are both well above<br>
you in levels, and as for the taste of us, well, we taste<br>
stringy and bland!&quot;  The green goblin laughed, showing<br>
his tiny and yet very sharp teeth.  He doubled over. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dragons are the thing you seek.  Climb on up to <br>
Veeshan's Peak!  If you're too low-level to take this<br>
advice, then head off to Kelethin!  That place is nice!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Kelethin has forest drakelings, for sure,&quot; said the Bard,<br>
&quot;but if I venture there, then the Fier'Dal militia, the Emerald Warriors, will slaughter my Iksar companion!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Iksar bad and Iksar mean,&quot; rhymed the green goblin. <br>
&quot;Kill him with songs, Zatdatine!&quot;  The Bard gasped! <br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know my name?&quot; she asked.  &quot;And, for<br>
that matter, how in the world did you know that I sought<br>
the dragons?  Are you psychic or what, green whelp?&quot; <br>
<br>
The young goblin grinned.  &quot;I eat Trolls!&quot; he exclaimed.   <br>
<br>
Zatdatine looked to the Iksar.  Clearly, this creature was weird, as in W-E-I-R-D, and yet she didn't know what<br>
to do next. <br>

Through mysterious potions and mystical chantings they are about to prophesie unusual events.  I'm sure that an iskar in the lands of everfrost is quite an unusual sight, muchless traveling in peaceful terms with a half-elven bard.  How he gathered such in-depth information about you is beyond me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine simply nodded, still accepting the fact that a goblin had just told her of her own intentions, likely not hearing a word that Kreeden had just spoke.<br>
<br>
Kreeden thoughtfully reproached the situation.  His intelligence was well above any normal iskar.  &quot;It's also possible that whom we talked to was not a goblin at all..  could be a shapeshifter of any sort, a form of a diety, anything really.  Claiming to eat trolls is a large statement for someone with such small stature.&quot;  Kreeden's eyes shifted and pale green strands of color swirled within.  It's definately something to think upon.  I am for whatever you decide, Zatdatine, I am simply here for adventure.  Veeshan's Peak sounds very dangerous, and I know not of the location, however Kelethin is far off I believe, and though I am entirely disliked upon that continent ('as on all continents' Kreeden added silently to himself), I would enjoy seeing the tree villages and witnessing the lore I have only dreamed about.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine looked rather puzzled, and weary.<br>
<br>
&quot;We should head back to our origional camp, you don't look so good, sleep on it and let me know what you want to do in the morning.&quot;  Kreeden said, extending a helping, albeit scaly, hand to Zatdatine to steady her on the slippery slopes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/18/03 2:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Choice and a Consequence</span><hr size=1> Zatdatine was pleasantly surprised as Kreeden, the<br>
necromantic Iksar, extended his hand to help her down<br>
the icy slopes of Everfrost. Secretly, she had always<br>
wanted to touch an Iksar, but deep down, she knew <br>
that this would likely be impossible.  No other Lizardman<br>
would want to touch palms with a Half-Elven Bard except<br>
to capture, or maybe to Harm Touch, them.  Now, her dream had come true!  She was grateful for Kreeden's <br>
assistance, and amazed that one of his kind WAS kind!  <br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!&quot; called a tiny voice.  The green goblin whelp stumbled down the slopes after<br>
Kreeden and Zatdatine, barely keeping his balance. &quot;I<br>
sense you want to go to Kelethin, the home of the <br>
Wood Elves.  Would you like some assistance in<br>
getting there?&quot;  He grinned his gleeful, sharp-toothed grin and spread his arms out wide, as if greeting them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Zatdatine warily, since she did not fully<br>
trust this goblin, &quot;but maybe tomorrow.  The Iksar and<br>
I want to return to our camp outside Blackburrow to rest,<br>
and perhaps when morning comes, we shall seek you<br>
out.&quot;  She gazed into the goblin's black, beady eyes. <br>
As it was, she could not read his motives.  What then?<br>
<br>
&quot;Go, go!&quot; said the goblin.  &quot;Rest, rest!  But remember, <br>
that tomorrow morning, you two face a choice and a<br>
consequence. Both are of the utmost importance!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;A choice and a consequence?&quot; asked Kreeden.  &quot;What<br>
might those two things be, goblin whelp?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Tomorrow, tomorrow!&quot; cried the creature.  &quot;Sleep on it!&quot; <br>
<br>
So they did.  The Half Elf and the Iksar nestled down <br>
inside the wooden room nearest Blackburrow to sleep<br>
as the campfire blazed.  The Bard thought that the <br>
fire must be enchanted, or something like that, because<br>
it never burned out or consumed any of its wooden fuel. <br>
<br>
The next morning, they were faced with nothing but a<br>
few watching gnolls.  The camp looked deserted, <br>
although within a few hours, swarms of adventurers<br>
would be heading for the caves, trying to kill lots of <br>
gnolls and win faction with Qeynos.  Suddenly, a <br>
white light appeared in the purplish-red eastern sky...<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the sun,&quot; said Zatdatine, but as she looked closer, and her eyes widened to the size of dinner <br>
plates, Kreeden hissed, &quot;That's not the sun!&quot; <br>
<br>
The bright light seemed to engulf them.  Was their choice either to run or to flee?  The two did not know. <br>
And what was the consequence?  Still a mystery! <br>

The iskar looked angrily back towards the east, after the light had died down.  Lowering his claw down from shielding his eyes, he hissed, &quot;What'sss to the eassst of here?&quot;  His stress on his s's comes out when he's angry.<br>
<br>
Zatdatine, sitll somewhat squinting, replied &quot;Umm.. Halas is somewhat northeast...Umm.. maybe the caverns of Soluesk Ro.. but that's more to the south.&quot;  Kreeden nodded thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
&quot;Think it was an explosion of some sort?&quot;  Kreeden inquired, more relaxed now, immediate danger gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not sure..&quot; replied Zatdatine, &quot;But what that goblin said to us.. I wonder if this is the choice... I say we head to Kelethin.. Kelethin is east, albeit far from here.  We should go at once to the karanas, and travel by spires from there.&quot;<br>

by this new development in their quest, Zatdatine and<br>
Kreeden, the unlikely pair of Half-Elf Bard and Iksar<br>
Necromancer, set off for the Karanas to discover<br>
what lay ahead for them in Kelethin--and what that<br>
mysterious light was...<br>
<br>
While zipping through the Western Plains of Karana with<br>
the aid of Zatdatine's rendition of Selo's Accelerando, a<br>
young Wood Elf, brown and green as the trees she served, came running toward them with the aid of the<br>
Spirit of Wolf.  Since she wore no chainmail, Zatdatine<br>
supposed she was a Druid as opposed to a Ranger. <br>
The Wood Elf's face, though pretty, was torn with panic<br>
and sorrow.  What in Norrath could be wrong? <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Leleli Leafrunner,&quot; said the Wood Elf, tears in her<br>
eyes.  &quot;I am a Druid in the service of the Soldiers of<br>
Tunare,&quot; she told Zatdatine.  Through her tears, she<br>
could see an enshrouded figure that she instinctively<br>
did not trust, so she addressed herself to the Half-Elf. <br>
&quot;Or, at least, I was until a few moments ago!  Innoruuk,<br>
the Prince of Hate, has sent his servants, the Orcs, <br>
to set explosive devices in every building in Kelethin <br>
and make our fair city blow up!&quot;  Leleli was frantic. <br>
<br>
Zatdatine felt like someone had just punched her in the<br>
stomach.  Kelethin?  Blown up?  Since when had Orcs<br>
gotten the upper hand in their perpetual battle against<br>
the good-hearted Fier'Dal?  The Bard's heart raced. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; she asked the Druid.<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm going to alert Surefall Glade<br>
and tell them what has happened.  Then I'll return to<br>
my despoiled homeland and slaughter every Orc in<br>
Crushbone until they're all dead!&quot;  Leleli's green eyes<br>
blazed with righteous anger.  &quot;And then, after that, <br>
my heart will finally be ready for the great battle against<br>
Innoruuk himself!  Veeshan, the Wurmqueen, wants to<br>
lead the charge, and Tunare has not told her nay!  <br>
Normally, we'd regard this supercilious serpent as a <br>
traitor and a haughty beast, but since we need all the<br>
help we can get to destroy Innoruuk, we regard Veeshan<br>
as an ally instead of a foe.  Will you help us fight?&quot; <br>
<br>
Zatdatine nodded her head up and down furiously.  &quot;I<br>
will help my mistress fight!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Veeshan shall<br>
triumph over the puny efforts of the Hateful One!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And Tunare,&quot; scolded the Wood Elf, mindful that the<br>
Half-Elf was thinking only of serving her own deity.  <br>
Leleli looked toward the wrapped Iksar.  &quot;And what<br>
about your friend here?&quot; she asked rather disdainfully. <br>
&quot;Will he fight, or is he too much of a coward even to<br>
show his face?&quot;  She tried to look beyond the shroud. <br>
<br>
&quot;He's very sick,&quot; said the Bard.  &quot;I'm taking him to the<br>
High Elves to have him cured of leprosy.  Even Rodcet<br>
Nife, the Prime Healer, has not been able to cure this<br>
serious disease.  When he is well again, he will decide <br>
whether or not to join the battle against Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;See that he joins us,&quot; growled Leleli, &quot;or dies in his<br>
cowardice!  Meet us at the Karana spires when ye are<br>
ready to join forces with us, O Bard of Veeshan!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the leper,&quot; Zatdatine mentioned humbly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yes.  And the leper.  Farewell!&quot;  Leleli sped off. <br>
<br>
&quot;No matter what happens to me,&quot; whispered Zatdatine<br>
once the Wood Elf had gone, &quot;I would not deliver you<br>
into the hands of certain death!  The High Elves of <br>
Felwithe, the goodliest race of them all, would kill ye!<br>
That's why we'll avoid that pompous place and head--<br>
and head--!&quot;  Since Kelethin had exploded, where<br>
would they go next on their DragonQuest?<br>
<br>
&quot;Also,&quot; said Zatdatine, a concerned look in her eyes, <br>
&quot;I know that your master, Cazic-Thule, is an ally of<br>
Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate!  I must help my Mistress<br>
fight her dark foe, yet you might not want to.  Whatever you decide, I shall respect you all the more.  Vacht?&quot; <br>
She smiled.  &quot;Vacht&quot; was Half-Elvish for &quot;All right?&quot; <br>
<br>
She waited for the hidden Iksar's reply.      <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreeden>Kreeden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.badassbuddy.com/images/buddies/badassbuddy_com-hydros.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/19/03 9:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You want ME to do what?</span><hr size=1> The iskar nodded thoughtfully.  &quot;This is a matter I have not given much thought to.  My alegion to a diety that is.  Sure, it is to Cazic-Thule that I devoted mindless hours of perfecting the art of sleeping with my eyes open in the chapel, however it is the closer 'appointments' of Cazic-Thule that deemed me to be an outcast.  I have no faith in such a belief in which cultural knowledge is frowned upon.&quot;  The iskar paused, collecting his thoughts.  <br>
<br>
Absentmindly, the iskar began walking towards the spires in the karanas.  He continued, &quot;My profession, is seemingly dependent upon worship of an 'evil' god.  However they, too, would shun my intentions of venturing Norrath, willingly or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So, what are you suggesting?  Even if you declare to be neutral to the Feir'dal, you will still be handled mercilessly, for simply your skin alone.&quot;  Zatdatine said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know...  but I believe I have a plan.  Innoruuk can very well know of me but he very well may not.  I'd doubt he has time to sit around and monitor the dealings of a hermit iskar.  I consider myself neutral, I only seek understanding.  Thusly, it is my belief that Innoruuks invasion must be stopped.  Leleli only mentioned Kelethin.  I'm assuming Felwhite is still holding out, but not for long.  I'd assume an alliance with Kaladim has been forged also.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine nodded agreeingly, eyes darting about out of thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe, I could act as a double agent of some sort...  It's a crazy idea, but truly, my stay here, among softskins will not be much longer, it is only time before I am sought out by a bounty hunter, framed for some un-committed crime.  Why not chance it...  though you may be in dubious standing with your current alligences with the elves, I ask of you to seek their headmaster, king, whatever title he is donned, and ask about me, grant me and my kind understanding in his city, and I will grant him intelligence of Innoruuk, and his buddies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine's eyes got fairly wide, noticing the sucidial consequences of this proprosal.  Could she not only admit to dealing with an iskar to the high king of Felwhite,  but then beg for admittance to his own stronghold for her scaly friend and his brethern?  Kreeden's eyes narrowed as he looked seriously back to his comrade, the spires were near, the time to decide was now.  The destiny of Faydwer, and Norrath alike could depend on it. <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; Kreeden - 60 Phantasmist Retired&lt;/font&gt;<br>

Those strangers shall be you and me, Iksar, no<br>
matter if Cazic-Thule be offended or not!&quot; <br>
<br>
She slowly unsheathed her Dragoon Dirk and pricked<br>
her right index finger with it.  Three drops of blood<br>
fell onto the shell-like gray scales of the Iksar's hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is not the ritual of the High Elves, or even of their<br>
good-hearted and flighty cousins, the Fier'Dal, but<br>
we half-breeds have our own rituals!  These three<br>
drops of blood represent the three things I pledge to<br>
you:  loyalty, kindness, and service.  I will not stop<br>
fighting until both of us lie wounded, captured, or dead!&quot; <br>
<br>
She pressed the Iksar's hand gently into her own, letting<br>
the scales absorb her blood.  &quot;I will do as you ask!&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreeden>Kreeden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.badassbuddy.com/images/buddies/badassbuddy_com-hydros.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/03 11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Enter : Faydwer</span><hr size=1> Kreeden nodded, taken back by such hospitailty and acceptance, wishing once more that everyone was so accepting in Norrath.  &quot;We must hurry then, the spires are within sight, let's go!&quot;  Kreeden cloaked himself in shadows once more, and ran with Zatdatines lovely rendition of Selo's songs, and within no time at all they were at the spires.<br>
<br>
They sat off to the edge of the spires, waiting for the right moment to jump in to the center, rather then to risk Kreeden being detected.  There was quite a few eager adventureres at the spires, talking excitedly about going to Faydwer to combat the evils, many talking mournfully of going to look for survivors and family.<br>
<br>
The scion announced that two minutes remained until teleportation began.  Kreeden and Zatdatine made their way, cautiously into the center, Zatdatine making sure not to pay Kreeden any attention, as paying attention to an invisible figure wouldn't look to good to the others.<br>
<br>
Within a few seconds, teleportation began, and nearly instantly they were dumped in a large pile in Greater Faydark.  The kinks of modern teleportation obiviously still had to be worked out.  The sky was somewhat reddish, and smoking still, from the trees of Kelethin and other areas.  There was a distinct smell of death in the air, and a smell Kreeden knew all to well from Cabilis, yet he couldn't remember exactly what it was.  <br>
<br>
Kreeden remained close to Zatdatine, tugging on her cloak to let her know he's still with her.  They followed a path eastward, which curved northward.  The smoke was getting thicker.  &quot;Up ahead is Felwhite, I have no idea of how strongly it may be guarded and it's best if you head up to the hill over eastward and wait, I'll come for you there once I've spoken to the King.  Kreeden nodded an invisible nod, and wished her well as they split ways for the first time since meeting, and Kreeden found a hill and began ordering his spellbook for the possible battles to come.  Off in the distance, a foul laughing could be heard snaking through the trees of Faydark. <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; Kreeden - 60 Phantasmist Retired&lt;/font&gt;<br>

silver-armored Paladin guards at the entrance<br>
neither smiled at her nor prepared to attack.  <br>
Instead, their expressions were a mixture of<br>
mistrust and sorrow.  They must have sensed<br>
intuitively that a Bard of Veeshan--and a half-<br>
breed, no less!--was headed into their fair city,<br>
the fairest of all cities now, for who knew what<br>
purpose!  They hoped she was not on Hate's side.<br>
<br>
She headed straight for the center of the gleaming,<br>
white High Elven city, looking for anyone who might<br>
know the way to the King's palace.  Shortly, she<br>
came upon a strolling Paladin, Sentry Mithriladil,<br>
who looked at her with an expression of helpful<br>
curiosity.  &quot;May I help you, milady?&quot; he asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  I'm looking for the King of Felwithe,&quot; she said<br>
meekly, &quot;and I would be much obliged if you would<br>
let me speak to him right now.&quot;  Her eyes were full<br>
of sincerity, which the Paladin did not miss.  Mithriladil<br>
nodded purposefully and led her off toward the castle. <br>
<br>
Inside, the Clerics of Tunare all surrounded their <br>
monarch, protecting him with holy spells and assuring<br>
him that within these walls, nothing could harm him. <br>
Neither the Orcs' fury nor Innoruuk's hate would enter<br>
here, they said, for Tunare herself was guarding them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Mithriladil.  &quot;This young lady wants<br>
to speak to you.&quot;  The green-robed King (favored as the<br>
royal color of the Mother of All instead of that pretentious<br>
purple), pursed his lips and ordered Zatdatine, &quot;Speak!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Zatdatine,&quot; she began, kneeling on the ground before the King, &quot;of the League of Antonican Bards.  I<br>
am a Half-Elf, milord, so you can imagine the great<br>
pain I felt when I first heard of Kelethin's destruction!  <br>
I've travelled here all the way from the distant city of<br>
Qeynos, both by foot and by spires, and I've brought<br>
a friend.  Both of us wish to help you fight Innoruuk.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent,&quot; said the King.  &quot;Where is your friend now?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Outside the city,&quot; said the Bard, &quot;waiting on a nearby<br>
hill.  I must tell you, milord, that due to his race, he<br>
is not well-accepted within your magnificent city, Sire!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;When does a Half-Elf hang around with a Dark one?&quot; the<br>
King growled.  &quot;Hang ye high, you young witch!  Do you<br>
seek to destroy us by bringing this 'friend' of yours into<br>
our midst?!  All of the good races of Norrath are duly accepted in Felwithe, even the simple-minded Dwarves! <br>
If this companion of yours is not tolerated here, then he<br>
must be one of the Evil races--Ogre, Troll, Dark Elf, or<br>
the worst of all--the wicked Iksar!  Which one is he, <br>
wench?&quot;  The Clerics of Tunare raised their maces high.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's an Iksar,&quot; replied Zatdatine, prostrating herself flat and face-down on the ground humbly.  &quot;He wants to fight, merciful King, so let him take up arms against<br>
Innoruuk!  The Iksar of which I speak is a Necromancer,<br>
yet he's been exiled and wishes to gain faction with<br>
this fine town!&quot;  She dared not raise her eyes upward. <br>
<br>
The King, abhorring all things Iksar, turned to the<br>
Clerics.  &quot;Mind ye go out and slay this beast, or all <br>
your faithless and treasonous Elven heads shall roll!&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot;  Zatdatine screamed.  &quot;If you kill him, I'll die, too!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't harm yourself over slime, milady,&quot; said the King,<br>
&quot;for he, that Iksar you speak of, would rather turn you<br>
into one of his skeleton pets than to help you truly!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not so!&quot; the Bard cried.  &quot;I yield me to you, and all <br>
my service to Veeshan, so long as you give this one<br>
a chance!&quot;  The King was taken by her fierce devotion. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll test this one,&quot; said the King, and he called for some<br>
parchment to write a note.  In the brownish-green ink of<br>
the Koada'Dal, he wrote, &quot;Iksar:  Commit yourself to<br>
Crushbone, and hide in the caves until some Orcs<br>
start talking of their latest plans.  Tell your Bard here<br>
the battle reports, and then I shall let you into our city.<br>
Signed, His Majesty, King Tearis Thex of Felwithe.&quot; <br>
<br>
He would not let Zatdatine deliver the letter.  Instead, <br>
he called for one of his Clerics to place the document<br>
in a lowly forest drakeling's mouth, which soon reached<br>
Kreeden.  Reading the letter, his resolve strengthened,<br>
yet he wondered whether he should not go elsewhere.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreeden>Kreeden</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.badassbuddy.com/images/buddies/badassbuddy_com-hydros.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/03 10:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hello Crushbone.  Bye Crushbone.</span><hr size=1> (ooc: wow, this is way to long, however I won't be able to post tomorrow (Saturday) so I'll post next Sunday.  Apologize for this being so long but I didn't want to condense it and make it so simple :P )<br>
<br>
<br>
Kreeden hurried, yet stepping carefully, towards Crushbone.    He knew not the exact location of it, and dared not follow the common paths, however heading towards the sounds of the cycles of battle seemed good enough.  <br>
<br>
Kreeden eventually came into the sight of a small orc, likely a pawn, who seemed to be scouting the area.  Kreeden dared to uncloak himself in the clear view of this young orc.  The orc seemed very ready to throw himself to death at the iskar's feet, however kept his distance.  &quot;I am Kreeden.  I am here to see Innoruuk, or Emperor Crush, possibly even Ambassador D'Vinn.  It would be much appreciated by myself and advantageous to you to guide me to your superiors.&quot;<br>
<br>
The orc pondered things for a moment, and likely fearing the iksar would kill him if he didn't oblige, he lead Kreeden in a straight line to the entrance of Crushbone.  The outside was well fortified, powerful orc legionaries manned a line in front of rather intimidating goblin spellcasters.  No being seemed to pay attention to Kreeden, which was a good thing.  Suddenly a very bad thought came to Kreeden's mind.  The letter from the High King was still stowed in his backpack.  He had meant to destroy it, however it was to late for that now.  They would surely search his belongings.  <br>
<br>
Kreeden considered placing the letter in a passing orc's pocket, however the letter itself was addressed &quot;Dear Iksar:&quot;  No, that would not work.  Passing through the short cavern that is the entrance to Crushbone, Kreeden saw a large torch, perfect..  Kreeden all in one fluid motion reached into his pack, which was shifted to his side, and placed the note carefully into the fire.  The note burned a bright green for just a moment, and then it was gone.  The Orc led him around an eastward wall, and up to a shabby looking castle.  &quot;Orcs are ones for hospitality&quot;  Kreeden mused to himself. <br>
<br>
The pawn left Kreeden at the steps, and Kreeden thanked him and walked up the stairs, opening the two large doors and walking in. <br>
<br>
The castle itself was as shabby on the interior as the exterior.  You'd think that if Innoruuk was taking over Crushbone, he'd at least add a nice palace to accompany him and make himself feel at home.  There was no hallways, just one straight corridor, a few steps, an incline, and a right turn and he was in what appeared to be a conference hall of some sort, a throne was the central feature, with benches in front of it, and a large table in the back, closet to Kreeden.<br>
<br>
A large orc was sitting on the throne, in a hunched over position.  He whispered something to a nearby oracle, who nodded and disappeared behind the throne.  Kreeden stood for a moment, uncertain of where to move or what to say, he hadn't thought this far ahead, getting rid of the hot note was enough stress.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yessss,&quot;  Kreeden said at last, making sure to stress his s's, as a normal iksar would, one who hasn't been 'tainted' by relating with softskins, &quot;I am Kreeden, an iksssar on a field missssssion for my guild in Cabilisss.&quot;<br>
<br>
The orc nodded, beckoning him to continue.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard of the fight againssssst ssssoft sssskinss here, and wissssh to ally myssself with you...&quot;<br>
<br>
The orc held a hand outward, palm facing Kreeden, and shifted a little bit to peer behind the throne.  A  medium build dark elf appeared from behind the throne, dressed in chain mail and wielding a small dagger and a short sword.  &quot;Yes, what have we here, Crush?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden assumed the orc was adressed as 'Crush', and made mental note of that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ambassador, Dis lizard say he want fight softies.&quot;  Crush's grammar was bad, but not as bad as those horrendous ogres.<br>
<br>
The dark-elf replied, &quot;Well let's see what our friend is made of.. word has it that the oh-so-high-and-mighty Feir'Dal, or as I like to say, INfeirOR'Dal&quot; here the dark elf laughed at his own joke, joined in a chorus by the orcs and Kreeden, &quot;are planning another full frontal assualt.  Let's send our friend to the front lines.&quot;<br>
<br>
Crush nodded, and the same oracle that had fetched the dark elf grabbed Kreeden by the arm and led him back out of the fortress, back to the entrance of Crushbone.  Here Kreeden sat on the steep slope, watching the orcs and goblins talking and trading, some sleeping.  A battle horn sounded and instantly everyone wheeled around in the direction of the sound.  Sure enough, it was a full frontal assualt.  First, two mages on horseback charged up the steep mound, casting while riding, one fell to two arrows from some orc archers, however the second, a young male, directed a fireball to the right wing of the orcs, it devastated many, Kreeden was positioned in the center however, but his intelligence told him something was up.  Kreeden moved to the left wing, attempting to avoid death, giving or recieving, at all costs.  Within seconds of the fireball, the mage fell to a chorus of spells from the goblins, who cheered at their smiting.  Their grins faded as at least twenty paladins on horseback and numerous rangers wielding shimmering swords and whips began charging up the mound.  The battle was intense, and Kreeden did kill many, as the dark elf whom had talked to him in the castle had come down and joined the fighting.  He knew he was being watched and he knew the purpose he was here was worth far more then the few lives Kreeden ended with his dark magics.  But yet, the senseless killing made a knot in Kreeden's stomach.  <br>
<br>
The battle was over, and Crushbone won, largely due to the magics of the high level goblin wizards, and the assistance of the Ambassador, whom Kreeden did not know.  The lines were dismissed with a new shift, so they may get rested back within the stronghold.  Kreeden followed them but the Ambassador pulled him aside.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was watching you...&quot; the Ambassador began, &quot;you're pretty good.  We might have use for you yet.  Come up to my quarters in the castle tonight, when the moon is fresh.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden nodded, his open wounds from battle were almost healed already, only two, one from the blade of a ranger and the other from the kickback of a spell he fired at the fore-mentioned ranger.  <br>
<br>
Kreeden familiarized himself with the fortress, incase the King would need such information, which was doubted yet helpful nonetheless.  Kreeden was unable to sleep, so occupied himself swimming in the canal system.  He found it more appealing then walking, and soothing to be alone and contemplate things.  Kreeden thought of his home, Zatdatine, the stakes being so high, and all depending upon him, since Zatdatine had done her part.  Yes, the stakes were so high as to say that the destiny of Norrath depended on this, and here was the hero, floating on his back in a canal in Crushbone.  He wished for Zatdatine's safety, knowning that her message had been delivered but not knowing of her condition.  Kreeden momentairly lapsed into a napping state, and awoke when his head came into contact with a ladder leading out of the water.  <br>
<br>
It was nighttime, and it seemed well enough to go back into the fortress, and proceed into the room he was in before, and meet the Ambassador behind the throne.  Kreeden did just that, and upon meeting the Ambassador, the Ambassador dismissed his servant orcs and offered Kreeden to sit.<br>
<br>
Kreeden's tail didn't allow for easily sitting, however he managed as the Ambassador spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Ambassador D'Vinn..  I am here as the material force of Innoruuk, whom has moved this assualt into action.  We aim to conquer Faydwer, and then extend the regime to Neriak by way of Freeport, and to expand in all directions from that.  We will conquer Norrath, however we're confronting obstacles early.  The Feir'Dal are quickly wearing out the simple minded orcs and goblins we have as hired help until Innoruuk can organize his minions in the Plane of Hate, to come through a portal and attack.  We need to plant false information into the hands of the Feir'Dal.  They no doubt assume our full assualt will come from this stronghold.  While in fact, our blessed Innoruuk has devised a way to summon his minions from the spires in Faydark.  A brilliant plan, really, to feed the Feir'Dal information, the correct date and time of the assualt, however the wrong location.  If we accomplish this, the Feir'dal will protect the wrong side of their defense, Innoruuk's minions will overrun and slaughter them, while we sit back and drink fine mead and prepare for Kaladim.&quot;<br>
<br>
D'Vinn paused here, and Kreeden broke the silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brilliant, however where do I come into play?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you'll give them the false information.  You see, if an orc or goblin, or even Teir'dal were captured, we would be killed just as quickly as the hundreds of others they have.  However, an iksar in these parts is rare, and they would likely interrogate you, believing that you held a high rank or were an ambassador of some sort.  Don't give the information quickly, however give it piece by piece.  The attack will be in ten days... when the moon is high.  Go now, become captured, and plant this information.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden nodded, shocked that D'Vinn expected him to blindly walk into Felwithe, become captured and tortured.  Wow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you may be a bit apprehensive of walking into death for the greater good of things, however just remember, an entire regime of evil will rule because of YOUR sacrifice.  My legionairres will show you out and make you look fit to capture.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fit to capture?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you have to look a little beat up.. this will only take a second...&quot;  A blunt object hit the back of Kreeden's head and he crumpled to the ground in a heap.  Everything faded to black.<br>
<br>
When Kreeden awoke, he squinted through his sore eyes, between bars, and into the concerned and stressed eyes of a high elf in a green-robe.  What had happened in the time Kreeden was out was of no memory to him.<br>

meekly asked King Tearis Thex, &quot;What are you going<br>
to do with Kreeden, my Iksar companion on this quest?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I've sent him to Crushbone,&quot; said Tearis purposefully.  <br>
&quot;I'm hoping the lizard can spy on the Orcs and tell me<br>
what their future battle plans are.  It seems to me that<br>
these simple-minded servants of Innoruuk are crucial<br>
to preventing further attacks on Faydwer.  We must<br>
find out what they're up to, before they strike again!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure you didn't send him there to kill him?&quot;  <br>
Zatdatine knew how much the High Elves hated the<br>
residents of Cabilis. They were wicked in Tunare's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Zatdatine, your words cut me straight to the core!&quot; <br>
the King cried. &quot;I am not offended, however, or worried<br>
that you've discovered my true motive. In this time of<br>
disaster, we must rely upon all our allies, scaled or no,<br>
in order to stop Innoruuk and his hateful minions. If the<br>
Iksar wants to fight, let him fight! Let him spy, also,<br>
for this is the task that I've set him to.  Now for yours...&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine waited with baited breath for Tearis' words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since you serve Veeshan, the Mother of All Wurms,<br>
then I send you out into the forests of Faydwer to call<br>
all the drakelings to war!  Surely, there are several <br>
young green dragons that are far too weak to stand<br>
alone in a battle and live, but with your help, even the<br>
youngest of drakelings will be able to aid us in our<br>
fight against the Prince of Hate!  Go now, and send<br>
word to all the Wurms that Veeshan is no longer our<br>
enemy! She is our ally now, as are all her servants!&quot; <br>
Tearis folded his arms across his blazing chest. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Sire,&quot; said Zatdatine, kneeling before him again.<br>
&quot;I shall do my best to tell the drakelings of our cause!&quot; <br>
<br>
She ran out into the midst of the forest, drumming the <br>
Chant of Battle as she sang a war song in Dragon: <br>
<br>
&quot;Drakelings, Hate's destroyed your home,<br>
 Leaving you helpless to roam<br>
 In the wilds of this wood, <br>
 Where there's barely drink and food!<br>
<br>
 The Prince of Hate has gone too far<br>
 In his never-ending war<br>
 Against all forces of Good! <br>
 I hope this is understood! <br>
<br>
 All you Dragons, large and small,<br>
 Help us fight, O one and all!<br>
 I serve Veeshan, your dear Queen!<br>
 Come to me!  I'm Zatdatine!&quot;<br>
<br>
After her song was finished, Zatdatine was amazed to<br>
hear a furious flapping of leathery wings. All the dragons<br>
in the realm of the Greater Faydark came charging <br>
toward her, claws reared for battle and teeth bared for<br>
the fight!  &quot;Zatdatine, we come!&quot; they cried, some of<br>
them breathing fire in small orange puffs as they spoke.  <br>
&quot;Innoruuk has damaged us! We will do anything to<br>
support the fight for his downfall!&quot;  They hovered near.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; smiled the Bard.  &quot;Head for the spires, and<br>
make sure no one stops you!  The travellers and fellow<br>
fighters there will not harm you if you tell them what's<br>
going on.&quot;  With a hiss goodbye, the Drakelings sped off.<br>
<br>
She returned to the King, her mission accomplished,<br>
expecting to hear his high praise, yet the concern on<br>
his pale face unnerved her.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Iksar,&quot; said the King.  &quot;He's been beaten and captured!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zatdatine cried, &quot;Take me to Kreeden!&quot; and a Paladin<br>
guard obliged, his silver armor ablaze.  Yet when the<br>
Half-Elf saw her scaled friend, he lay unconscious on<br>
the floor of his iron cell.  The Bard sang a song to <br>
comfort him while he recovered from his head wounds.<br>

He reopened his eyes, the green robed figure had been replaced by a elvish appearing female, with a lute in hand, singing some sort of calming ballad.  Kreeden once more released his eyes to darkness, in his mind the clear picture of Zatdatine strumming notes on her lute.  Kreeden was lulled to sleep.<br>

When he awoke, he had been carefully placed in a fine bed, in a room by himself.  There was a bell on the stand next to the bed.  The floor and walls were of white marble, what most of the city was made of, or so Kreeden had read.<br>
<br>
Kreeden rang the bell, within seconds the High King and Zatdatine entered through the door.  The High King looked rather relieved to see Kreeden in this shape.<br>
<br>
&quot;What day is it?&quot;  Kreeden asked, impatiently, and trying to lift himself up, refusing help from the clerical aids.<br>
<br>
&quot;You left here two days ago...&quot; the High King said, then asking more purposefully, &quot;What do you have to report?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden was sitting up fully now, he noticed the bandage on his arm, and a large one across the back of his head.  &quot;Let me think...&quot;  The King shot him an impatient look, yet one of understanding.  Here the King interrupted, &quot;Take your time, you're lucky that you Iksar have such an amazing regeneration, it would take even the finest of my guard a week to recover from the injuries you likely sustained.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden absentmindly thanked him, and continued, &quot;We have six days until there is a large force from the spires, planar creatures of hate to invade and flank your forces while a divisionary offensive takes place at Crushbone.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Kings jaw started to droop a bit, and he regained his composure, though barely, saying, &quot;How.. how many?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden shrugged, &quot;Hard to tell.  I'd estimate at least forty.  I've been to the Plane of Hate before, and the Plane of Fear as well.  Field trips for necromancy courses in Cabilis.  I have knowledge on any planar creature from those areas you may need.  Though I have a commending respect for your elven people, for allowing me to stay here, and a I respect your military for staging off invasions of Ambassador D'Vinn, I suggest an alliance with the gnomes and dwarves alike, and humans if possible, you need all the help you can get, especially if Innoruuk can figure out how to launch his larger planar dragons through the spires.&quot;<br>
<br>
The King thanked Kreeden immensely, confirmed that in five days the attack would occur, and left Kreeden to welcoming sleep.  Zatdatine stayed and strummed her lute, hoping her drakelings were successful. <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; Kreeden - 60 Phantasmist Retired&lt;/font&gt;<br>

the Veeshan Bard, and Kreeden, the new Iksar spy,<br>
back into service. The young Half-Elven girl's first <br>
mission had been thoroughly successful; more of the<br>
larger drakes, and even some full-grown dragons, were<br>
headed for the Spires. That accomplished, Tearis spoke: <br>
<br>
&quot;Girl, I want you to venture into the cities of Kaladim and<br>
Ak'anon. Send word to the Gnomes and the Dwarves that<br>
Innoruuk has laid siege to Kelethin, and we High Elves of<br>
Felwithe need their help fighting if we're not to die next!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I will do as you ask, Sire,&quot; replied Zatdatine matter-of<br>
factly, &quot;yet I don't think I'm the best one to accomplish<br>
this task! Brell Serilis and Veeshan consider themselves enemies, so I don't think either a Dwarf or a Gnome would take kindly to an order from a servant of the Wurms!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not give them orders,&quot; advised Tearis Thex, &quot;but rather approach them humbly. Stress the importance<br>
of their help in our fight against Innoruuk. Remember,<br>
the Dwarves abhor anything evil, and the Gnomes do<br>
also, although some of them are slaves of Bertoxxulous.<br>
Go straight to the good clockwork, King Ak'anon, and<br>
tell him that both Felwithe and Kelethin are soon to be <br>
fully destroyed if the Gnomes and Dwarves don't help!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Right!&quot; cried Zatdatine, and she sped away. <br>
<br>
Alerting King Kazon Stormhammer to the dangers ahead<br>
proved to be a rather difficult task, for Zatdatine had to sing one of her charisma-increasing carillons in order<br>
for the armored Dwarf to stop glowering at her dubiously.<br>
However, once the song was sung, King Stormhammer<br>
listened with undivided attention to the young Bard's warning. &quot;Brell help us all!&quot; he cried when her tale was<br>
done.  &quot;You tell that Thex of Felwithe that we'll fight <br>
and die, if that's what we ha' to do, in order to kill Hate!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank ye for your assistance!&quot; called the trembling Half-Elf as she raced out of Kaladim. The King of the Dwarves, mused Zatdatine, was not a bad sort if you<br>
kept singing your charisma song. Otherwise, he was <br>
rather a stubborn and hard-nosed old twit with a crown!<br>
Then, Zatdatine thought, the same could be said of King <br>
Tearis Thex, minus the Dwarven heritage!<br>
<br>
Ak'Anon proved to be far easier than Kaladim to enter. <br>
The Gnomes rarely emerged from their subterranean<br>
tunnels to mingle with the other races of Norrath, and<br>
since King Ak'Anon was not a Gnome himself, but<br>
a clockwork, the frightened emotions that Kazon had<br>
shown at her scary tidings was not present in the former.<br>
<br>
King Ak'Anon turned towards the young Bard with a mechanical whir. &quot;We will fight,&quot; he said in a monotone,  <br>
and then the Lord of the Gnomes said something that<br>
puzzled even himself: &quot;The Lord of Disease calls you!&quot;<br>
Instantly, King Ak'Anon exploded into a thousand bits,<br>
and the fiery forces of the blast chain-reacted through<br>
the tunnels of the Gnomish city one by one, destroying<br>
them all. Very systematic, at least for Bertoxxulous. <br>
<br>
The Gnomes of the Dark Reflection had allied with Hate.<br>
Zatdatine lay on the floor of the King's fragmented chamber, barely conscious of anything save the fleeing<br>
of several scared Gnomes. She closed her eyes, and<br>
everything faded to black. Was this the end, after all? <br>

The cleric checked the bandages covering Kreeden's wounds, which he himself had not seen clearly yet.  <br>
<br>
The cleric undressed the wounds, noting of the marvels of iksar regeneration, something new to Felwithe medical research.  Kreeden rolled his eyes around, &quot;I'm feeling much better, thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cleric nodded, and dissappeared, leaving the stone door open.  Kreeden stood up, waited for the dizziness to subside, and exited the room.  He went right in the hallway, the room around the corner from the right had to have been well-lit, for the light was very bright, even from where Kreeden stood.<br>
<br>
Stumbling around the corner, bracing himself on the walls, Kreeden appeared in a vast room, with floors of sparkling marble and a cieling of the same.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, our iksar has awoke.&quot;  the King said, somewhat cautiously.  &quot;I trust you'll make no sudden moves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is this?  Are we not on friendly terms?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly, I can use you for business and such, and you are here within Felwithe, as you requested.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden let it slide, he could prove more useful and figured he would be granted more liberties as that came.  &quot;What of Zatdatine?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's on an errand, she left for Kaladim and Ak'anon two days ago.&quot;  That leaves three days to the invasion, Kreeden mentally noted.  The King continued, &quot;She should be back by now, scouts saw her enter Butcherblock Mountains by way of the small pass through the mountains, and they also saw her come back through, and enter the Lesser Faydark, here they lost track of her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden's eyes narrowed.  &quot;She was being stalked?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, of course, you don't expect me to fully trust a half elf young girl traveling with an outcasted iksar, did you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Trust seems to be hard to earn here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone has standards.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you have anything else for me to do?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I would like you to go back to Crushbone, claiming to have escaped, and tell them that our force will be completely centered on the northern flank, nearest Crushbone.  Maybe that way our size of our forces will be underestimated.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kreeden nodded, though he had other plans.<br>
<br>
Kreeden non-chalantly walked out of the city, under the ever-dubious eyes of the local militia and the towns-folk.<br>
<br>
Kreeden walked up the path towards Crushbone, completely knowledgeable of the stalkers behind him, sprinting through trees.  When Felwithe was out of earshot, Kreeden stopped and retrieved his spellbook from his pack.  The book hadn't been used in quite some while, he held his hand over the scroll for &quot;Summon Dead&quot;, and chanted outloud in iksar, something the stalkers could not understand.  He repeated this process for scrolls of &quot;Dooming Darkness&quot;, &quot;Words of Spirit&quot;, and &quot;Vampiric Curse&quot;.  He stood, mentally grasping where exactly the stalkers were located.  By closing his eyes and using superior concentration, he was able to detect one stalker behind him, on a tree branch, another was a bit ahead and to his left, behing a large tree, and a third was off to his left, hiding in the shadows.<br>
<br>
Kreeden released magic from his concentration and from the ground arose a minion for him to command, a brittle skeleton.  He reeled and fired a lifetap spell in the direction of the stalker in the tree.  It hit solidly, and instantly the other stalkers closed in on Kreeden for the kill.  The lifetap was not enough to kill, however it knocked the stalker off the tree, and though he landed safely, he had to gather his senses for a moment.  Kreeden sent his minion towards the stalker that was behind him, charging him was the other two stalkers, the right-most one Kreeden casted Dooming Darkness on, slowing his movement and spiritually slowly harming him.  The other stalker charging him Kreeden casted Vampiric Curse upon.  The stalker was reeling in pain, clutching his chest.  With both of the stalkers following him, he made his way to his minion, who was in a dead-lock fight with the third stalker.  When all were in the same general vicinity, Kreeden let loose with an immensely powerful spell.<br>
<br>
Words of Spirit was channeled through Kreeden's fingers, and all three stalkers fell dead immediately.  Kreeden allowed a minute to rest and backtracked quickly southward, past Felwithe, avoiding the guards, and into Lesser Faydark.  Here he cautiously traversed the right side of the mountain, and in no time came to the Steamfront mountain range.  Here, Ak'anon was clearly visible, even though an underground city.  Following the gears and contraptions, he made his way into Ak'anon, resisting the urge to stop and investigate some of the trinkets, and keeping one eye out for Zatdatine.  <br>
<br>
Upon entering Ak'anon, he forgot of his unacceptance in the land of Faydwer, and he was promptly knocked unconcious and drug to a mechanically engineered cage.  Here he awoke, and Zatdatine was in a cage across from him, her cage very much like his.  She was still out cold, or so he thought, however Kreeden was wide awake and aware of his surroundings. <p>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt; Kreeden - 60 Phantasmist Retired&lt;/font&gt;<br>

the Dark Reflection in Ak'anon, had other plans for the<br>
wandering Bard and the Necromancer Iksar besides death. Evah Xokez, the leader of the Gnomish Clerics<br>
of Bertoxxulous, watched over her captives with a <br>
triumphant smile on her face. The Dark Reflection had destroyed the city--indeed, they had survived the very blast they had caused--for the Plague Lord had spared their lives in exchange for their allegiance and service!<br>
<br>
&quot;Good morning,&quot; Evah chirped to the Iksar as he struggled against the bars of his mechanical cage. <br>
&quot;I trust you've been feeling well.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, I feel somewhat like gnoll dung,&quot; Kreeden hissed, &quot;and this seems to be because of you!  Why<br>
have you caged us here, and why, if you wanted us<br>
dead, didn't you leave us to expire among the rubble?!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I did NOT want you dead,&quot; replied Evah huskily.  &quot;The <br>
Plague Lord prefers his servants living, if diseased. The skeleton pets he employs are only creations of his Necromancers, and Bertoxxulous loves a living servant<br>
far more than a dead one!  The dead, after all, don't have minds of their own.  They act just like live beasts!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If you didn't want us dead,&quot; growled the Iksar, &quot;then I<br>
suggest you revise your assumption that we will serve<br>
you.  The Bard, after all, pledges her loyalty to Veeshan, the Queen of all Wurms, and I already have a master,<br>
Cazic-Thule!  Not that I'm so loyal to him right now, but at least he demands service from me to him alone!&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I pity you,&quot; sighed the Gnome Cleric.  &quot;You suppress your evil desires, and for what?  All to be scorned and<br>
rejected by the races of Norrath, and killed on first sight if you ever take one step into a Good town!  Freeport, a haven for Evil, shall even slaughter you if you go there! <br>
Come join us, Iksar, and help your master, Thule, aid<br>
Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate.  Evil shall soon conquer!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Rrrurrrurgghhrrrss!&quot;  This was a very bad Iksarian word.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Shhh,&quot; smiled Evah.  &quot;The Bard's waking up.&quot; <br>
<br>
Zatdatine stirred in her cage, barely noticing the shards<br>
of metal stuck into her skin like splinters.  A greenish,<br>
cool underground cave was where she seemed to be.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; asked the young hybrid girl, gasping in pain.  &quot;What happened?  What's going on?!&quot;  Her heart raced.  She remembered a king--yes, a clockwork king--and then a violent and fiery explosion...<br>
<br>
&quot;We set an explosive device inside King Ak'anon,&quot; the <br>
Cleric explained with a smirk.  &quot;That pathetic, rusty old<br>
defective clockwork exploded, and now all of Ak'anon<br>
is ours, a sacrifice to our new ally, the Prince of Hate!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;How could you?!&quot; cried Zatdatine.  &quot;AAAAHHH!&quot; <br>
The shards of metal were digging into her skin, and<br>
the Bardess was too weak to move or to pull them out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pain is a catalyst for change, milady,&quot; Evah said gently.<br>
&quot;A change of allegiance, for one thing, from the forces of Light, or at least Neutrality, to the forces of Darkness. <br>
Another change it will effect is a change from your worship of Veeshan to the worship of Bertoxxulous. You'll be the first Bard to do so!&quot; Evah was elated. <br>
<br>
&quot;Never!&quot; cried the fearless girl.  &quot;I shall never worship<br>
Bertoxxulous or assist the Prince of Hate, and I--aah--HISSSSSSSSSS--!&quot; This last gasp was of pure agony.<br>
<br>
&quot;Atropos is upon you,&quot; said Evah Xokez. &quot;The third Fate,<br>
or the one who holds the Shears of Death, is soon to<br>
cut your thread. Unless you serve the Plaguebringer, and us, the life which gentle Lachesis has measured<br>
will shortly slip past us into the Void.  What will it be?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Death!&quot; cried the Bard, and she passed out again.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1008.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1008.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1008.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1008.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1008.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1008.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1008.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm63">Ayrielle's Story Contest!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
