<br>
I can see where the attitude against things like tarot and the occult and the like comes from, because that at least is wound up with believing in stuff which has been proclaimed 'evil' and 'wrong'.<br>
<br>
But where's the argument against D&amp;D and, by extension, EQ? Do these people not comprehend the concept of fantasy?? It's pure madness, in fact it's worse because when I sit down to play with my Necromance of an evening, I am NOT suddenly worshipping Bertoxxulous the Plaguebringer. I'm not even pretending to believe in him, a character that is completely ficticious that I am controlling believes in him. <br>
<br>
Sheesh. Presumably they don't like to read any books or watch any films featuring agnostic characters either.<br>

This article does nothing to prove me wrong. The majority (note I did not say ALL) of your religious fiends that have the audacity to write about something that goes against the grain of what they've been brainwashed into believing their entire life just proves their closed-mindedness. They seemingly have the complete incapability of looking beyond their own God-driven world view, and desire to railroad and brainwash others into believing their way is the ONLY way. Now, as I said before, I'm pagan by choice, but I do believe it says somewhere in the Bible &quot;Let no man judge another for their actions, for that is God's domain.&quot;, or something to that effect. In review of that, what gives these people the right to judge you or me for playing a game? Never mind the fact it might actually be something FUN... <p><font color="red">Kryshal<br>

I agree, Christians are the only politically correct religion to attack with jokes and comments.  No, I don't expect any different, but that doesn't mean I don't feel the need to clarify.  As I said, many people are actually so narrow-minded as to believe that all Christians follow the established leadership of the sects and branches blindly.  Case in point...<br>

Brain-washing?  Rail-roading?  Trash?  Sounds to me like you have become what you despise.  There is a difference between defending your beliefs and attacking others.  The post above was very clearly not a defense of your beliefs.  Don't let those people that have been close-minded, judgemental, and ignorant just make you into their likeness.  Am I embarrassed to be a Christian?  No, not at all.  I do not let others define me with their poor actions.  Am I embarrassed by the actions of other Christians?  Yes, just as much as I would be by any other member of the human race.  Christians aren't exempt from their own rules, despite what a few of them might think.  It would be nice if I could deguild them, but alas I cannot.<br>

This is a lot more complicated than could be summed up in even a paper.  I tried once, though I think I still only skimmed the surface... but hey, I got an &quot;A&quot; on it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Overall, it coincides with what Jenelle said, in the belief of the ideals presented within the game rules of D&amp;D.  Demon summoning, the use of magic, pagan symbols, etc... none of them rank very highly with the beliefs of most Christians, regardless of denominations.  Except with the Roman Catholic church (and similarly organized denominations) where there is a pretty strict structure of stances on such issues, most of it is left up to the local minister or preacher to deal with.  I'm sure you would get 10 different 'stances' from 10 different churches about what (if anything) is wrong with D&amp;D.  Most will refer to what I stated above, but some will say that it is satan's tool while others will say it's in line with any other book that exposes and encourages such ideals to people.<br>
<br>
And no, some Christians won't read Lord of the Rings or watch Xena because of the included components.  I respect them if they can do that (well, I don't watch Xena either, but that's because I think it's cheesy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), as long as they don't burn my books or turn off my television.  In turn, don't be surprised if they don't let their children watch/ read/play any of those things either.  Of course, this tends to lead to rebellious kids, but they usually learn that too late.<br>
<br>
But that to me is usally the biggest problem.  Interpretation.  Most ministers and preachers I know are intelligent enough not to just shout out how Gary Gygax is the devil and D&amp;D is the next Necronomicon, but most would say in line with what Jenelle was told.  But when it flows down the channel to the church members or what not, they sometimes miss the details of what is wrong and just hear that it IS wrong.  That is where I tend to run into issues within my own family at times.  My father tends to be quite intellectual about his study of faith, but one of my sisters tends to be one of those sheep that grate on my nerves due to her 'blind' following.<br>

<br>
First, I can understand why the conservative wing of the christian community disagrees with this game.  Everquest is a fantasy game, and fantasy games are escapist by their very nature (hense the word 'fantasy').  While escapism is not necessarily bad (heck one could qualify any religion a escapist, depending on one's pov), it does not solve any problems.  Rather, it is a soma for the mind--a drug which has not been illegalized by the government.<br>
<br>
In cases where individuals have very real problems, and they use escapism to pretend (for however long) that their problems do not exist, then escapism is detrimental to their own well being.<br>
<br>
example:  I hate my job.  I play everquest and call in sick.  -- arguable, but it's been done to one degree or another by just about everyone.<br>
<br>
example 2:  I hate my job.  I play everquest and call in sick for a week.  Job goes away.  Problem solved? -- here, it's a definite problem and the game is detrimental.<br>
<br>
Further problems arise with those people who play so often and so long that the difference between fantasy and reality begins to blur.  This is a borderline psychotic condition (inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality being one of the hallmarks of psychosis).  In cases such as this, the individual is not only a danger to themselves, but possibly to others as well.  <br>
<br>
Because of this, religious groups tend to raise concerns regarding games of these types (D&amp;D included).  I think they're right to do so.  However, that doesn't stop me from playing, because I am secure in my handle on reality and I understand the dangers of nonstop exposure to a medium which operates under a different ruleset than RL.<br>
