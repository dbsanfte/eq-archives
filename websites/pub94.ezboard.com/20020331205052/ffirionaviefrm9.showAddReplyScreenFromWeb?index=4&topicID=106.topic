Diablo in first person? :)</span><hr size=1> Good game, solid launch, lacks content and a purpose <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Has a lot of nice features people have wanted in other games for a while: bind stones, useful tradeskills, all sorts of exp bonuses for different reasons (pro grouping, anti camping), alternate ways to gain experience, anti-twinking coding, relevant backstory.<br>
<br>
But how these all translate to the fun of playing is different, and is very affected by the fact that I'd wager 75% of the people in DAoC are ex-EQers, with biases on how to play already built in.<br>
<br>
People immediately became enamored with anyone-binding at bind stones. This is a nice feature and makes sense for DAoC, though I don't think it would work well in EQ for a number of reasons.<br>
<br>
We loved that we could do Tasks for experience rather than hunting, but you know what? This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> just</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like questing in EQ. Didn't know this until I came back to EQ on FV and actually did some low-level quests. DAoC has two types of quests: deliveries between NPCs and go-out-kill-and-bring-back-his-head types. Hehe, sound familiar (Bard Mail, Orc Runner, etc.)? Consignments for tradeskills give exp too, but I never did these. It's nice to have another way to gain though even if that's the only different one.<br>
<br>
Anti-camping is nice. You actually automatically gain an exp bonus in a new area, and that exp bonus decreases the longer you are there. Moving around is encouraged, except that a group of 8 gets such a nice group-exp bonus that many just continue camping, since they're used to that already.<br>
<br>
Anti-twinking is a mixed bag. Each item has a /con rating. A player wielding a Purple+++ /con weapon will get no use out of it, and actually destroy it in short order. Same goes with armor (so no passing Fungi tunic's to Level 10 Monks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). You NEED to ensure you're armor is always upgraded, and this puts a pinch on your finances. Nice thing is that spells are free, but I still never had any money. There's penalties for super high levels grouping with super low ones, but that's the same as in EQ anyway.<br>
<br>
Classes aren't really balanced. The concept behind RvR is nice, and probably been well proven out on paper for 20 years. But it translates differently when battles are resolved in realtime and not with dice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  They're constantly tweaking the classes, and have made some fundamental changes to others even now, that are not conducive to choosing a class to play through for a while. Those pesky players keep finding ways to exploit their class' talents, only to have those talents nerfed because they were just designed to be way too powerful to begin with. The wonders of actually having high-damage-dealing Archery were great, but that has been eroding since Day 1. Maybe because of this, the classic duo of Tank/Healer is still the preferred way. <br>
<br>
The specialization system is neat. It does help that you can have two level 30 Wizards that do two completely different things because they specialized differently. But, people STILL play the min/max game, and use sites like Catacombs Character Builder to find out at level 1 what they should spec in so they can be uber at level 50. As in EQ, specializing in nothing is a weakness when up against others that spec in one thing, and this has big implications in RvR.<br>
<br>
I didn't see a big difference between mob AI in DAoC and that of EQ, though the mobs in DAoC <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> move more logically. Mobs don't follow the 8-point compass directions they do in EQ, but pets still have pathing problems in tight spaces.<br>
<br>
That's my synapsus of the play experience itself. Here's my thoughts on the mentality of it:<br>
<br>
It's more &quot;gamish&quot; than EQ. No spell memorizing, fully 1/2 the downtime in mana and HP regen, easier to get around (horse taxis), far-easier-to-learn tradeskills. But you know? It's just not that &quot;fun&quot; for me. I'm not into PvP (get my kicks from Unreal Tourney <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and that isn't really done yet. There's no Realm Rewards, and lacking that essential purpose, playing capture the flag has it's detractors too. There's certainly not enough PvE content. Imagine playing EQ for 50 levels in JUST Crushbone, Northern Ro, Lake and Dreadlands (throw in Befallen for the dungeon).<br>
<br>
I'd seen almost zero roleplaying, and I played on Percival, the first &quot;roleplay&quot; server. Like flies to a bluelight, everyone flocked there thinking GMs would appear more often or something.<br>
<br>
I like EQ because there's more to do. The games has 3 years more content in it, and I only have a limited amount of time and money to play, so I can't afford to wait around for a game to improve if I'm not having a good time. <br>
<br>
As with EQ, it helps to have RL friends there, but the anti-twinking coding prevents fast leveling if there's a big split. Anti-twinking is important in RvR combat, but it hurts powerleveling friends if you don't want to start from scratch.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the manifesto. Believe it or not this is 1/2 of what the original version was <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>

<br>
First off, I'm playing both.  I have that luxury unlike those people that have to decide on one or the other.  So I don't have to be as critical either way.<br>
<br>
Great launch.  Don't know what content and purpose is lacking in Dark Age that is present in EQ, but I'll leave that as a shrug.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I'd agree with his evaluation of gamers.... probably 60-75% are ex-EQers and the rest seem to come from AC.<br>
<br>
Bind Stone:  It works in Dark Age and it would work in EQ if they didn't make it part of some classes feeling important by holding part of their importance on being able to bind/buff/port/ress.  While buffs are nice and resses are too, they aren't crucial to having some purpose like in EQ.  Imagine if people didn't need ports, binds or buffs... druids would be all but ignored in EQ.  I recall over the past three years hearing enough complaints about wizards and druids not being wanted in groups, imagine if they removed all of the things I listed above?  That is the only reason I see EQ and binding stones not working together... because Verant would have to admit they rely on those things to make some classes 'balanced'.<br>
<br>
Tasks/Quests:  I see a big difference between those in Dark Age and EQ.  In EQ, the quests are grossly imbalanced, they either give ridiculous xp or useless xp.  The level related tasks coincide with your level in reward and you don't have this false players market created because of them (ie, auctioning off orc belts).  You also don't have to spend hours competing with other people for mobs to do them, you just go to a vendor and type /task and get your mission.  You can get up to half of your level by doing those tasks, but you can't level up on them.  There is no means for you to hand a level 1 twink several backpacks full of orc belts and wind up with an 8th level unskilled twink.  Other quests are level triggered and the 'special mobs' only drop items if you've triggered the quest.  They also respawn quickly... not forcing you to spend 5 hours waiting on a spawn only to have someone KS it and get the phat lewtz!<br>
<br>
Anti-camping:  I would say it's not really anti-camping... more like Darniaq said in that encourages you to go elswhere. Fortunately there are plenty of places to hunt and you don't have to run around all night trying to find a place to hunt.  I see more of the anti-camping coming from the removal of the EQ-uber mobs that drop single items I referred above.  You have to trigger the quest for them to get the item or the quest piece, and they respawn quickly.<br>
<br>
Anti-twinking:  It is a mixed bag, but it addresses the complaints that people have had since six months into EQ about twinking and the whole reason that Verant tried (poorly) to implement a TLC.  You can twink, certainly, but you can't overtwink if you have a clue what's going on.  I've made decent armor for many a new guild member, because it didn't cost me much to do so.  I make them items that are yellow and they last for several levels.  But eventually you have to twink them again.  There are several items that you can get randomly off mobs or by doing quests that help offset your expenses at upkeeping your armor.<br>
<br>
Classes balance:  I have the fortune of recalling how horribly unbalanced classes were in EQ and if you look at the drastic changes they are making even recently, I doubt if you could come close to saying Dark Age is worse.  In fact, I would say most classes are balanced across realms and even inner-realm better than EQ is.  EQ just gave up from the beginning and deemed some classes as 'solo' classes and others as 'group' classes and hid behind the excuse that they wanted to force you into groups anyway, so forget soloing after a certain point.  I find this to be less the case in Dark Age, and considering the time frame that both games have been out, I would rank Dark Age at least as good as EQ when it comes to class balance.<br>
<br>
Speciailizations:  I always hated the min/max game, but things are at least possible to alter in DAoC.  EQ allows the only difference between one druid and another to be equipment based.  That is one of two issues that I have always had with EQ that bothered me most... the other being the incorrect conning system.  If both factors had been implemented correctly (or ever actually corrected in three years), I would not have gotten sick of the game EQ (not the people, not the world... but the actual GAME).  Yes, people will play the min/max shuffle no matter what game they play, but at least in Dark Age there are counterbalances that while you might make yourself vulnerable to one thing, something else will be more vulnerable to you.  It makes the chances increase that you can't come up with a 'perfect' character, because you will always offer yourself as a weakness in another area.<br>
<br>
Mob AI:  There are a few differences, but they are more subtle.  Especially when you have a 'lookout' that sees your group (ie aggros) and rushes back to the other mobs to shout warnings.  The more you play the game, the more you see that mobs have differences here and there, and they are fun to notice.<br>
<br>
As for your personal views, I think you missed a lot and I'm sorry you never looked me up, you scoundrel.  <br>
<br>
There are ways that you can help folks PL up to your level if that is what you want as long as you know what you're doing.  It's much better and much funner PLing in Dark Age, since you are actually part of the group, not sitting there in Unrest while a druid casts crazy buffs on you and you hit each thing once so you get the xp.  You don't PL people in Dark Age by giving them level 40 items, you do it by giving them items for their level and grouping with them.  So the risk goes to the PLers and the PLee... not to those people of a certain level that can't fight in a certain place because Uberdewd is pulling the whole zone to PL his buddy that's all twinked out and buffed to the max.<br>
<br>
I also have played on Percival since it started and I have seen a lot of roleplaying... easily as much as I've seen on the FV server.  In fact, our guild is part of a large alliance gathering that has been meeting once a month and we're having a blast!  <br>
<br>
RvR combat is like nothing I have experienced in any other game, and it is as far from the UO PKing or Quake as you can imagine.  Every person that I've gone into RvR with has said &quot;You know, I always hated player-player combat, but this is a blast!&quot;  There are realm point rewards in, by the way.<br>
<br>
Bottom line - not everyone is going to like Dark Age.  That's fine... and quite honestly the arguements I've seen between people (not here, but on other boards) are ridiculous.  I'm not here to get everyone to play Dark Age.   I like the game a lot and if others like it, that's great too.  I play EQ to see my friends, but I play Dark Age not only to play with my friends, but because I actually enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
It's not a perfect game (heh, no game has even gotten close to that label yet), but it's a far more complete and enjoyable game than EQ was at this point since release. In fact, at this point a few years ago, you still could rarely get into EQ because the login server was always crashing and even when you could log in you were usually dropped a few times a night.  My opinion is it is actually just as complete as EQ is right now, and EQ has had three years to get it right.  I guess I view 'content' differently.<br>
<br>
Regardless, if any of you do try it out, look me up... I'll twink you!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But we've talked to a few folks that were in Wolf Pack on Karanas that are playing Dark Age..  Actually, there have been several Wolf Pack guilds scattered around different worlds of Norrath, and we aren't any of them.<br>

<br>
Gameplay: Gameplay is an evolution from EQ. All melee classes have special moves like the EQ monk. But for the most part, it's level based and you spend most of your time camping critters. Camping for dropped gear is not that important because player made equipment is frequently of higher quality giving bonuses greater than the magic of the item. There are more chat options. Parties are larger which really opens it up to meeting new people and trying new combinations of characters. Originally parties could have a much wider range of levels than EQ, but a patch made it so the range is narrower unless you're willing to take a major experience hit. The world is small and there is not much variety.<br>
<br>
Balance: Balance is way off and IMHO most of the changes they have made since release have either not helped or made things worse. The need to balance PVE and PVP at the same time has created huge balance issues. When I left archer's were easily the most powerful class by two or three times in PVP, but were next to useless in a group hunting monsters. Similar problems plague the game and Mythic doesn't seem to understand the basic issues causing them.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying: The beginning of my disenchantment with DAOC came when I realized I knew more roleplayers on Morell-Thule and more roleplaying guilds on Morell-Thule than I did on the hardcore roleplaying enforced server Guinevere in DAOC. To my knowledge, there is ONE RP guild on that server: Shadowclan and they are very very specific in their interests and carry a lot of baggage from other games. About the only time I ever really saw roleplaying invoked was as an excuse for griefing. I'm &quot;roleplaying a barbarian&quot; became DAOC's version of pre-Trammel UO's &quot;I'm roleplaying a psychokiller.&quot; There is policing of names and OOC talk in public, but most of this is degraded day after day in the forums as the work of &quot;RP nazis&quot; by which people basically mean anyone who came there expecting the rules to be enforced.<br>
<br>
Griefing: This was what put an end to it for me. When my first character went up through the levels, it worked the way the game was supposed to. You hit a certain level, bit below 20, and you started to go into the frontier. You began to see members of opposite realms raiding and you had battles. And this was great. Now that people have levelled up a bit, the same zone where I had a load of fun the first time is now dominated by a few 40th+ levels who one shot kill anyone lower than them that dares to hunt in the zone--a zone designed for 15-25 to hunt in. One of the features of RvR/PvP combat was that it was designed to not cost you experience, so snipers have taken to waiting until one is engaged with a mob. They then drop you 1/2 your health, the monster finishes you off and you lose XP. See above: they are &quot;roleplaying&quot; and this is a war and there are no rules in war. The latest argument on the servers message board regarded &quot;/em urinates on soandso's dead corpse.&quot; Upon objecting to this, I received private mails calling me &quot;puzzy&quot; etc. This is the mentality I found was slowly taking over DAOC and was really why I left. <p>Numtini Lightheart

<br>
I agree with a lot with Jantis's impressions of daoc.  But some of the reasons I enjoy the game a lot are: <br>
<br>
--you can play for 30 minutes and actually be hunting/doing something productive for 20 minutes of them - doesn't matter what class, I have a healer, runemaster and my hubby has a shadowblade, thane<br>
<br>
--people actually *want* to buy the armor I've made.  Yes there are dropped armor, but the pc made armor is still the way to go most of the time (quest stuff still better than pc made stuff)<br>
<br>
As far as griefing...I personally haven't seen anyone be unpleasant within my realm.  In-realm reputation means a lot here.  In the frontier I consider everything is fair game.  We play honorably (most of the time, some of the kiddies in my group are really bloodthirsty) but we don't *expect* the other side to play that way.  Just because we wait until the enemy is done killing a mob and indeed has almost recovered from attacking said mob, doesn't mean they will for us.  <br>
<br>
For the rude /em's ... you *can't* understand a word or emote the enemy is making.  It'll say so and so says something unintelligable.  The best they can do are the canned animated emotes (such as /dance).  Not very honorable in my mind, but heck, they're hibernians!  What'd you expect from wussy elves? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And Jantis, I expect to see you on the battle field someday!  Hopefully face down in the dirt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

--Wynfred, dwarven healer, midgard, guinevere server - have taste tested the dirt in almost every hunting area in midgard and surrounding frontier!<br>

Even with the Seeking party or whatever option flagged I got zero messages to join anyone. My number one annoyance was they took the enchanter class from EQ and made it into two, i suppose just for the sake of having more classes to choose from, but in essece giving either one less to do.....and I do like to keep busy =)<br>

I don't know if I will try it, I think once I get bored of EQ that I will go over to a game along the lines of Return to Castle Wolfenstein, although I have to say, if you want constant insults and childishness, you can never go wrong with a multiplayer shooter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
