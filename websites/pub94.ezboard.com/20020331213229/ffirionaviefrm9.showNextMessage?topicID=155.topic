Jan 3, 2002 - VERANT INTERACTIVE NEGOTIATES PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT<br>
==========================================================================<br>
AP - San Diego - Verant Interactive, the makers of the successful MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) Everquest, has teamed up with Microsoft to enhance the popular Windows game, Solitaire. &quot;We're excited about this move and hope to bring the Windows gaming community additional excitement to an already challenging game&quot;, says Gordon Wrinn of Verant. Gordon went on to say that Verant has made extensive changes to the game, including 2 new choices of decks, but would not comment on anything specific. &quot;We would prefer the players to find new content on their own&quot;, he said.<br>
<br>
The enhanced version of Solitaire is scheduled to be released on January 14th, 2001. Before playing, users will be required to &quot;patch&quot; the new game code over the Internet on or after that date. The update process should take 30 minutes on a 56k modem, or less time if you have a faster connection.<br>
<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
Following are statements from Verant......<br>
<br>
Jan 14, 2002 - PATCH MESSAGE<br>
----------------------------<br>
Welcome adventurous Solitaire players! If you enjoyed Solitaire before, you're going to be blown away by the new version! Here is the list of enhancements.<br>
<br>
-- 2 new decks of cards were added, one with cute gerbil pictures and one with pictures of each American President.<br>
-- Playing with the vampire castle deck now allows you to play cards where other decks cannot.<br>
-- Removed the ability for multiple game windows to be open simultaneously. This game is called Solitaire, which we believe means to &quot;play single&quot;.<br>
-- Removed a bug which allowed players to double click on cards to move them to the build piles as this was deemed overpowering.<br>
-- The robot deck has been removed from the game as it does not fit in with our vision.<br>
-- Shuffling the deck now causes a &quot;flappy&quot; sound to be played.<br>
<br>
Jan 14, 2002<br>
------------<br>
It is being reported that some people are experiencing difficulty patching the new Solitaire code. Problems include patch times up to 14 hours, aborting during the patch, and PC lockups. Admittedly, we are seeing much higher volume than expected and are working to install an additional patch server. We didn't know so many people used Windows.<br>
<br>
We forgot to mention that the new version of Solitaire requires DirectX version 8.1, which might be found somewhere on the Microsoft web site, although we're not really sure. Also, we apologize to everyone running Windows 95 or earlier as the game will not be playable. Sorry, you won't be able to even play the old version. Write to Microsoft for a refund of Windows.<br>
<br>
Jan 15, 2002<br>
------------<br>
We apologize to everyone who is having problems running the new Solitaire code. Apparently, some PC's are locking up, requiring a reboot. Our suggestion is to reinstall Windows, repatch, and then try again. In the meantime, please send an image file representing everything in memory at the time the crash occurred. Help us to help you. Without this file, we won't even listen to your complaint because you're probably making it up.<br>
<br>
Also, it is being reported that some decks of cards are missing Aces. We have noted the issue, but be aware that it is not a high priority for us at this time.<br>
<br>
Jan 16, 2002<br>
------------<br>
Players are reporting low framerates when the cards bounce off the build piles after a victory. We are aware of the issue and are working hard to correct it. We have one programmer doing nothing but playing the game until he wins so he can reproduce the problem. He hasn't actually won a game yet, which may be related to the missing Aces issue reported yesterday.<br>
<br>
One player reported that there hasn't been 52 American Presidents yet. We are currently looking into this issue.<br>
<br>
Jan 17, 2002<br>
------------<br>
We're receiving complaints that the number of cards flipped over is completely random, sometimes flipping over up to 20 cards. Note that this is a new game, so you should expect things to work differently. Have fun!<br>
<br>
Some reports have stated the game slows down the longer you play it, eventually to a point where it becomes unplayable. This is by design, since you shouldn't be playing at work anyway. Sorry, there's nothing we can do. <br>
<br>

<br>
When I was at 29 Palms right after Boot Camp, the friendly Tankers gassed my barracks. I was on Mess Duty ( kitchen slave, for those not aware) and worked  usually from around 4 am to around 10 PM.<br>
<br>
 We all learned to live in the residue from that friendly attack. Only time it was a problem was when you got a few hours break and went anywhere in the outdoors, then you suffered when you returned to the barracks for a short while.<br>
<br>
Doing a CS chamber over and over will also teach you the finer points of breathing in the more intense fumes. For those not aware, if you can control yourself and take shallow short breaths AND avoid rubbing your face, you will survive in one fashion or another ).<br>
<br>
Large quantities of the gas inhaled can be fatal, a marine at Camp Lejuene died because he got trapped in some barb wire and was stuck in a dense CS cloud for quite some time.  Take a lot and takes special circumstances but it can happen. Poor guy spent several days in the hospital before he finally passed on. Usually nature prevents the large build up of the gas when used in the environment. Think he had an asthma problem that aggrevated the problem.<br>
<br>
Ahh so  much for my morbid tidbit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=145.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=145.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=145.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=145.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=145.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=145.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
