I do, however, disagree with lowering standards for admissions just because someone is of a certain minority that a school wishes to admit more of so they can be give more federal monies.  I do, however, disagree with lowering admissions standards so that the school can have better athletic teams.  <br>
<br>
As an example of this, my roommate my freshman year at HSC was an African American fellow who played on the basketball team.  He was about as intelligent as the bricks with which the college was built.  I resent the fact that because he was of a minority and was good at basketball he was allowed to go to a college i busted my ass to get into with a 1600 on the SAT and a 4.23 GPA.   American Undergraduate education became a joke when athletics were allowed to become more than an intermural activity.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190957" target="top">Sage Yendys</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
Well maybe you wouldn't be so ignorant. I think your smug post, with your pompous all white school, and the narcissistic praise of your own academic acheivements makes my point.<br>
<br>
But the true answer to your question, is that it does a lot for the learning process, in fact it is very important. You are small minded if you think that education is only about book learning. All colleges seek to educate and develop the mind and the soul. Learning about yourself and the world around you is just as important, and goes hand in hand, with your academic learning. How can someone expect to become a truly engaged individual in the diverse world we live in, without having any interaction in a diverse setting? As you have shown, the result is becoming defensive, and criticizing the system, calling it unfair. <br>
<br>
When in fact, the system in place seeks to make the system MORE fair. I'll give an example that unfortunately is way too common in inner city public education. You have a minority, who does really well in school, let's say top 10% of the class. But, the school is in a poor neighborhood, this means less taxes, which means less money available to the school, which means a lesser quality education. What usually goes hand in hand in this situation is a lack of SAT preparation. So, this student, who does great in school, has dreams of going to college, tests poorly on the SAT. For this student, this precludes them from being admitted to just about any half-decent college out there. But, it is not really the student's fault. They have the intelligence needed to succeed in post secondary education, yet will be forced to follow that dream at a community college or state school. So, what happens if that rich white kid happens to lose his spot to this minority (which by the way is not how most colleges work-because a minority with lower credentials is admitted does NOT mean one deserving student is then rejected-I'm just using the scenario that most think is how it works)? Well, what a shame, I guess it's off to Princeton instead of Harvard for poor Todd, whereas the minority doens't really have any other options. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=639407" target="top">Kozul Goodheart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I don't think my previous message, one you clipped a quote from, was clear.  I was opposing the position of those, like Yendys here, who believe that reverse discrimination runs rampant in the U.S.  In re-reading what I wrote, I can see there's room for confusion, since I used the term &quot;anti-PC people&quot;, which could actually refer to either side.  I meant the people who shrilly cry &quot;political correctness!&quot; every time someone tells them to consider issues such as diversity or, in some cases, simple civility. <p>     &quot;Why can't we be friends now?&quot; said the other, holding him affectionately.  &quot;It's what I want.  It's what you want.&quot;<br>
     But the horses didn't want it--they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it, sending up rocks through which riders must pass single file; the temples, the tank, the jail, the palace, the birds, the carrion, the Guest House, that came into view as they issued from the gap and saw Mau beneath: they didn't want it, they said in their hundred voices, &quot;No, not yet,&quot; and the sky said, &quot;No, not there.&quot;<br>

<br>
With affirmative action, its not. There is bias leaning towards one group and away from the other. As for schools letting in minorities that normaly would be able to get in, they dont do it for diversity, they do it because the State or Federal programs give them money if they meet the required percentage. You really think that college admins sit and look at all the minorities that wish to come to thier college and say &quot;Golly Bob/Sue, SoandSo would really bring some change to this campus.

<br>
On the other topic here, though.  Ethnic minorities were after equality.  Any person who has a problem with that is seriously fucked up.  However, in an age of equality, the colour, creed or so one of any two particular people should have no inpact upon the choice to do a job.  Equality is just that, EQUALITY.  May the best person win.<br>
<br>
Political correctness, however, is fucking up the notion of equality with ethnic superiority, hence you get the complaints about ethnic minorities being offered jobs over better qualified people in the ethnic majority solely for the reason of..  you guessed it: race, colour.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely no reason why a white guy should be ever given a job over a black woman, solely because of his race and gender, if they are of equal ability and their circumstances are the same.  However, there is no reason why a black woman should get the same treatment.  That is not equality, it is the very same racism that was argued against and supposedly is close to being abolished.  It's fucked up.  It's not even the reverse of what was happening before, it's the exact same fucking thing.<br>
<br>
I won't even go into the rest of this race war bullshit.  When are people going to fucking learn that humans are humans, whether they are black, white, or blueberry, whether gay, straight or bisexual, man, woman, or transgender.<br>

You prove the case FOR affirmative action. The playing field should be even. That's what AA aims to do. Do not try to say that without AA, that minorites would be on an even playing field and be held to the same standards...it just wouldn't happen...there's too much ignorance and hatred in our society to have that at this point in time.<br>

Close, not exactly, people arent looked at as numbers. Now, I am at a private university, no funding whatsoever, so I can speak for private universities. With state schools, yes they have funding, but again, the people are NOT looked at as numbers. I am a college admissions counselor, I would know. Until you work in the university environment such as me, you have no idea what you are talking about. When I come across the application of a minority, from a bad neighborhood, who has done well in school, but has low SAT, I bring the app to the dean, and we go over it. Usually, what happens is we agree that this person has come so far from so little, who are we to crush their dreams of going to college. We give them a chance. We feel their experiences would be a nice thing to share with the others. We dont get a cent from it, in fact, it detracts from our statistics such as average SAT, and other numbers that are used to determine rank and such. So, yes, we do it for the reason I listed before.<br>

Ah yes, the myth of the even playing field.  <br>
<br>
How is the playing field even when society is still deeply uneve?  Can you have an even playing field in a marathon where two-thirds of the participants are forced to wear leg irons?<br>
<br>
We still use admission standards based on SATs which are inherently biased towards English-speaking participants. The school systems are biased towards males as curriculum remains defined based on male, not female, brain development.  Why is it males still far outnumber females in science and math?  Where's your even playing field there?  <br>
<br>
Society is NOWHERE close to being unbiased towards rich, white males.  Until it is then those who face an inherently UNEVER playing field must be given advantages simply to CREATE an even playing field in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yendyseq>YendysEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/03 3:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4039.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: worms</span><hr size=1> Kazul, you are the biggest bigot of any on this board.

Im white, but that doesnt make me anglo saxon or protestant, which i am neither.   How is giving preference to anyone simply because of their race leveling the playing field?  What self respecting black person would take a job knowing they were getting it DUE to affirmative action.  This flies in the face of capitalism and is simply  an ignorant course of action for a country/culture.<br>

If you are not a wasp, that's fine, I don't care really, I don't judge people based on things like that. I consider myself white and anglo saxon, I don't prescribe to any religious affiliation (that's another can of worms <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). The fact is, most white people are anglo-saxon. The general definition of an anglo saxon is anyone influenced by English/British culture/language. Surprise surprise, our language, system of law, and a lot of other things are exactly that. The English did settle America first, and did inhabit it with their people, hence their culture influenced our society. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beaudlair>Beaudlair</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/fallenmicaela/tzegif2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/03 2:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4039.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/fallenmicaela/tzegif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: im a bigot?</span><hr size=1> Kreelos, I have to disagree with a few things you claim<br>
<br>
First you stated that,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We still use admission standards based on SATs which are inherently biased towards English-speaking participants<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So what?  We are an English-speaking country.  My mother's mother's family spoke only Yiddish, and my father's mother's only Italian when they first moved here.  They learned English.  If I were to move to Japan, I would not insist the whole of Japanese culture bow down to my ignorance. I would learn their language.<br>
<br>
Second, you cited that <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The school systems are biased towards males as curriculum remains defined based on male, not female, brain development. Why is it males still far outnumber females in science and math?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Possibly that male brains are better suited to seeing the world in a binary fashion (right vs. wrong, black vs. white), which forms the basis for math and science.  Women, from what I understand, are better at seeing things in shades of grey.  Which explains why they typically outpreform men in English and history (which usually stress interpretation).  By no means am I saying men are better in math and women in English, just natural inclinations.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, your theory that <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Society is NOWHERE close to being unbiased towards rich, white males<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Leave off white and male.  Society is biased towards the rich.  Money = power.  Personally, I don't think America is as concerned about black and white anymore nearly as much as it is about green.  A black woman in a nice pant-suit will be treated much better in most of society then a white male in torn jeans and a soiled t-shirt.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/fallenmicaela/tzesig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

And so I want a even playing field, is that wrog? I dont think anyone should not be hired because of thier skin color. It should be based off thier abilities, not because of anything else. If I was an employer, I wouldnt turn someone down because they were black. If they have more experiance, training or ability than the white person applying with them, they get hired, white guy can go home. But if they arnt, they dont get hired. <br>

So you're saying that it applies to EVERY SINGLE person? Of course not, but then that means it is wrong to assume that any person falls into the stereotype, that is just prejudice.<br>
<br>
If you're Polish, it's OK for me to call you dumb, because that's a stereotype and it exists for a reason.<br>
<br>
If you're Irish, I can call you a drunk?<br>
<br>
If you're Jewish, I can call you cheap?<br>

Still think stereotpyes are OK?<br>

Look, because of sterotypes, people will react a certain way to someeone. You see some back guy decked out in gang colors and ridding in a dropped car, are you going to wave at them? If they cut you off, are you going to get pissed and yell? Prolly not. You will keep your mouth shut. Why? Because we automaticly assume they are mean, nasty gang bangers. <br>
<br>
Sterotypes are all bad either Koz. Its a general sterotype that black people are better at sports, and its true. The jewish people I've met are rich, just like people assume they are. But they worked hard for that money, saved and did the right thing with thier money. <br>
<br>
Just because some one may see someone new and place them in a sterotype, doesnt mean they are prejudice people. Sterotypes cant be ignored, mostly because they are partly true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/03 8:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4039.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: im a bigot?</span><hr size=1> Stereotypes and being opposed to Affirmative Action are two totally different issues.

The ill effects of such horrible treatment doesn't go away by sticking your head in the sand and pretending that discrimination and the after effects don't exist.<br>

Now stereotypes...well that's more of a lighthearted deal and it can be fun to debate whether a stereotype is true. My husband, the love of my life is white. If we ever have children, they will be half white, so don't think I am for Affirmative Action just because I'm against whites.
