The gift bestowed upon this young boy,  was the Power of Hate,  and with this gift..  came unimaginable power...aswell as unimaginable  hardships.  When this child was born, he was born with the mark of hate upon his body.   By the laws of their culture..  a child born bearing the mark of hate, war, or pestilence ,  was to be disposed of..    having its soul stripped from its body and sent back to its creator , long before it could bring about chaos.   The parents of this child, destroyed emotionally after seeing what they brought into this world.. and knowing what was going to happen,  could not allow their child to be destroyed.  And so they fled Freeport,  taking their newborn son with them..   seeking refuge in the untamed deserts of Ro.   Here they raised their son,  as best they could in such a place.. living amongst a band of gypsies and dervishes.<br><br>        It was in this desert, that Zoronious lived the first portion of his childhood.  For years the family lived there..  Zoronious' father supporting the family with the bit of money brought in with his fur trading business..  his mother looking after him day and night.. always being ever so careful to keep the child's secret hidden from all.  As a child, Zoronious was a bit off normal when compared to other children..   he seemed hollow..  unsatisfied.. cold...     ....hateful even.    He was very placid most times, a vacant look in his eyes... almost as if there was a part of him missing.  Placid he was,  but there were times when you would catch a sparkle of pleasure in his eyes..  or a smile upon his face..    oddly enough.. it was when something terrible happened.. or when he was doing something wicked.    A rampaging Sand Giant trampled the dervish's caravan..  killing many..   Zoronious stood by,  watching the giant..  fearlessly..  with an ear to ear smile upon his face.   A young dervish boy felt it was funny to kick sand in Zoronious' face...and call him names..     Zoronious felt it was funny to pick up a skinning knife and slice open the young boy's stomach..  as the blood spewed forth..  and the boy screamed in pain..  Zoronious' eyes widened..  an evil grin forming upon his face as he began to chuckle at the dying dervish.  It was becoming more and more noticeable..that Zoronious was not a normal child...  no ordinary child could be so twisted and wicked at such a young age.    <br><br>        It was the very same night of that incident,  that Zoronious' life would change... he would begin his life as what he was desitined to be.    That night, as Zoronious' parents still remain in turmoil..  thinking &quot;How could an eight year old boy take the life of another... and not feel even the slightest bit of guilt, remorse, or grief?&quot;,  a Teir' dal dervish stormed into their home. A slender yet incredibly muscular Teir'dal male...  his skin a dark and menacing blue..  his hair.. an enchanting mixture of silver and white..but his eyes..  yellow like that of a jackal... showing the same ferocity as the animal it resembled.   &quot;My name is Dorn..    Dorn B'Dynn,  and I have come to see this child of yours&quot; said the Teir'dal.   Zoronious' parents.. feeling an unpleasant mixture of &quot;awe&quot; and &quot;fear&quot;..  simply pointed toward's the boy's bed.   The Teir'dal quickly walked over..  looking over the boy as he still slept..   then violently snatched the child up.. ripping the back of his shirt open.. exposing the brand of hate upon his back.  &quot;Do you see this!?&quot; yelled Dorn. &quot;Do you have any idea what this is?&quot;..  Zoronious' parent's could only nod as they stare at their son in the hands of a Teir'dal.  &quot;Then if you know... why is this child not where he belongs!?&quot; .    The child being out of his daze now..  turns to see who's arms he is in..  snarling and kicking ferociously as he realizes its not those of his parents.    &quot;Calm yourself young one&quot; Dorn whispered..taking hold of Zoronious' face to look him in the eyes &quot;Look at me..  look at my face..  look deep into my eyes...  and you shall feel the presence of your true father&quot; .    The child's eyes widened staring deep into those of the Teir'dal... his ferocity subsiding as a feeling of &quot;belonging&quot; washed over him.   Dorn slowly set the child down upon his own two feet.. the child staying near Dorn's side..  a look of peacefulness on the boy's face.  &quot;It is time your boy be raised as he was intended to be raised..  He can no longer remain here...or with you&quot; said Dorn... his hair glistening in the moonlight as he begins to escort Zoronious out of the hut.    As Zoronious and Dorn took their first steps out into the desert..  Zoronious' father cried out.. reaching out at Dorn.. placing a firm grip around his arm. &quot;You can NOT take my child from us!    I will not allow it!&quot; screamed Zoronious' father as he pulled Dorn back.. spinning him around to look him in the eye.  &quot;I..can not.. allow you.. to do this&quot; said Zoronious' father.. his voice trembling as he unsheathed a dagger.  Dorn promptly connected eyes with him..  looking hard into them..  then down at Zoronious..  dragging the father's eyes down to the young boy.  As the father looked down..  he saw not his son...  but a snarling child... glowing eyes.. a deep blue..almost violet coloring to the glow.   &quot;As you now see..  it would not be wise to keep him here..  should you hold any value to your own life.. or that of your neighboring gypsies..  you will let him ..and myself..  leave&quot;said Dorn.. in a calm and serious voice.  Zoronious' mother now balling in tears.. not knowing what is about to happen to her son... turns and looks at his father.  The sight of his wife's tears and heartache drove him into a rage..   ..he lashed out with his knife..  attempting to drive it deep within Dorn's body..  only to have his thrust halted immediately by something.    The father looked down at his arm..  to see Zoronious' hand gripping it tight..  not allowing it to move an inch more..   then suddenly a feeling of weakness grew within him..  his arm beginning to whither in the grasp of his son.   Zoronious keeping a firm grip upon his father's arm..  the violet glow now a flame.. flowing from Zoronious' body into his father's..  sending him to the ground as he writhed in agony.  Dorn carefully removed the boy's grip from his father's arm.. looking down at the child and grinning..  now seeing the power..and potential.. stored within this HUMAN boy.   Somewhat impressed..  Dorn then escorted the boy out of the hut.. and away from his former family..  his father lying back inside on the floor..  still feeling the pain throughout his body..     his mother kneeling next to him.. sobbing as she watches her son and the Teir'dal walk out into the seemingly endless desert.<br><br>        After hours of treading over dune ..after dune.. of the desert..  the sun just barely peeking up over the horizon..    the two finally came to what looked to be ruins.  It looked to be the top of a larger building.. seemingly a pyramid..   but only a tip of it above the sand now..   four pillars sorrounding it..  which seemed to extend deep into the sand aswell.    Upon the top of this &quot;pyramid&quot;..  there were engravings upon its surface.    Zoronious , curious to know what they were..  stepped towards them only to be halted by Dorn's arm. &quot;Stay back young one..  &quot; just as the words left Dorn's lips..  a column of light appeared.. centered on the top of the pyramid..    within this column looked to be a tunnel..  brilliant energy moving about inside..  at the end of this tunnel..  he could see darkness..  and what appeared to be the same &quot;pyramid&quot;.. almost as if it was in another world..and that tunnel linked them.     After a brief moment...  there was a flash of light.. and a robed figure stepped through the tunnel and began to approach them.  As the robed figure moved in closer..  it was clear that it was another Teir'dal..a male..  this one looking somewhat older.. more frail.. but giving off an aura of magnificence and power.    The robed Teir'dal began to speak..   in a tongue completely forgien to Zoronious..  but with each word that touched his ears..  there was a familiar feeling stirred inside of him.  After a brief exchange of words.. Dorn looked down at Zoronious..  then back to the robed Teir'dal..  nodding.. as if answering a question.. then once again turned his attention to the boy , to speak. &quot;You will go with Myr'Dirinn now..  you will be safe.   It is time you were taught to be.. what you were chosen to be&quot; and with those words..  he nudged the boy forward..  towards the elder Teir'dal who put his hand upon his shoulder and began to escort him towards the tunnel of light atop the pyramid.  As Zoronious walked forward with the elder,  he was suddenly surprised as a voice entered his mind..  &quot;Do not be hesitent young one,  you have much to learn.. in little time..     you are one of Innoruuk's chosen..  and it is time to begin your life as one&quot;.     Gasping in awe..  he looked up at the elder Teir'dal..  to see a grin upon his face.   After recieving a comforting nod from the elder..  he walked forth into the tunnel..  and as the elder followed in behind him..  the opening behind them sealed shut..  resulting in a loud thunderclap and a flash of light. <br><br><br>To Be Continued...<br><br>~Zoronious Bonedaddy~<br>    Knight of Innoruuk <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzoroniousbonedaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zoronious Bonedaddy</A> at: 2/13/02 2:18:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 240<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 12:15:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zoronious: The Tainted Child (Long Read)</span><hr size=1> /applaud <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzoroniousbonedaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zoronious Bonedaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/02 2:17:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Plane of Energy</span><hr size=1> Zoronious, startled by the thunderclap of the closing doorway, looked nervously about.   As he turned his head side to side,  he noticed that the tunnel was made of pure energy, the walls completely transparent with the exception of the occasional bolt of energy which streaked across them.   He looked down at his feet, amazed to see no ground beneath them.. only walls of energy which crackled occasionally as his foot touched down upon it.  <br><br>As he peered through the walls.. he could see a pinkish sky that seemingly wrapped around them, there was no horizon in sight..  just an unending sea of pink sky.  As he looked out into the sky.. he could see brilliant streaks of color and explosions of orange lightning.  Zoronious looked up at Myr Dirinn and spoke <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;Where are we? What is this place?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;This is the Plane of Energy...  a universe made up of living energy.   Scorcerors such as myself are able to travel great distances in our world, by entering this plane of existance.  This place is filled with unknown wonders, but sadly we are unable to explore it ..  if we were to leave this protective field we are in.. our bodies and souls would dissipate  into the universe.. as our energies would be absorbed.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->said Myr Dirinn.      The boy's face showing a somewhat puzzled look as he nodded at the Tier Dal. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;Look around you, look upon the beauty and magnificence of this realm.  Aslong as this field of energy sorounds us, we remain material and are safe.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said Myr Dirinn. <br><br> Zoronious curiously walked over to one of the walls.. and cautiously touched it.  The wall crackled and sparkled where he touched.. giving him a slight tingling sensation as some of the energy passed throughout his body.   He rubbed his hand along the wall..  leaving a bright trail of crackling energy behind..  disappearing shortly thereafter.  <br><br>He paused to look out into the pink expanse..  then noticed a pulsing red globe of light.    It was about a fourth his size, and seemed to be coming closer towards him.    It stopped just at the wall of energy, and hovered about.  Zoronious stood there, staring curiously into it...   Myr Dirinn behind him with a grin upon his face.   After a brief moment, the globe let loose a bright flash of pink light..    then where the calm globe once hovered..  was a swirling mass of red energy.  Zoronious stared  into it, seeing a form begin to take shape in the energy..  the form grew more distinct now..  it was humanoid.. and rather short..  almost..  childlike.   The energy let forth another flash of light, Zoronious shielded his eyes from the brightness.   When he uncovered his eyes..  he gasped in amazement as he saw what the energy's form was...  it was himself.   <br><br>He looked upon the form..  it was so precise.. every little detail was perfect.. down to every hair being in the exact place as those upon his own head..  it was as if he was looking into a mirror.. seeing a perfect reflection of himself..  then only difference was in the form's color.. it remained a glowing red.    Myr Dirinn smiled down at Zoronious and spoke <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;It appears to like you&quot;.   &quot;What is it?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> asked Zoronious.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;It has no name, it is only energy..  living energy.    It can be anything it wants to be....     or.... anything you wish it to be&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> replied Myr Dirinn, a wicked grin upon his face. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    &quot;Oh?...   anything i wish it to be?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> inquired Zoronious.    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;The energy of your mind can shape it to be anything you wish,  ... think it.. and it shall be&quot;... &quot;Have anything in mind,  child?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> replied the Tier Dal, curiously looking down at the boy.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;Indeed I do..   &quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  replied the boy, with an evil grin forming on his face.   <br><br>His attention returned to the red form..  as he did.. it began to melt away.. breaking away into a red mist.  The boy stared out into the expanse.. smiling..  as he did.. a loud rumbling, almost thunderlike, began to sorround them.   Myr Dirinn, puzzled, walked towards the transparent wall.. looking about to find the source of the rumbling.  Meanwhile the child stood there.. motionless.. staring out into the distance..  an evil grin on his face.    Moments later there was another flash of pink light..  almost blinding..   as Myr Dirinn's vision returned..  his mouth dropped in awe.   Just outside the field was an immense form..  an unmistakable form...  it was a Dracolich.  The creature roared and spewed forth red streams of mist and smoke.  It's skeletal wings spread wide as it glided through the sky,   roaring and snarling.  The skeletal dragon slowly approached the wall,  its feet making thunderclaps as they set down upon a non-existant ground.   The dracolich lowered its head down to Zoronious.. pressing his red skull against it.   It's eyes, as pusling red light, it stared into the child's eyes...and the child stared back into the dragon's.  The boy touched his hand to the wall.. as if to touch the creature's red skull.   As he did so,  the dracolich became silent.. and set himself down as if resting upon his stomach.   The creature lowered his head further, placing it before the child's feet..  loudly breathing as it did so..  small puffs of red mist leaving its mouth and snout.  The creature then began to slowly melt away,  leaving only a thin mist behind. Shortly after, there was another blinding flash.  Myr Dirinn, amazed once again as the figure of a man stood before him and the child. <br><br>  The red energy had taken form of a knight, in full armor.. carrying with it, an emormous two-handed blade ladden with ancient runes.  The knight stood before the child, and removed its helm.   Its hair was long and flowing,  its beard-a neatly trimmed goatee.  It's armor was ornately runed, but ridden with wicked blades, chains, and hooks.  The armor looked to be almost wet.  The red color glistened as if a liquid was running trickling down it.    After closer examination, it appeared that there were thin streams of liquid , occasionally trickling down the platemail..   it seemed as if they were coming from the armor itself.  The streams would slowly run down over the knights chest,  down to his stomach..  where they would disappear into the armor.. almost as if being absorbed.   <br><br> The knight placed his helm , once again, on his head..  and then nodded at the child.   It began to turn, and walk away..  heading back out into the expanse.   As the knight's back turned to Myr Dirinn, he noticed a strange mark upon its neck..   he looked closer.. and realized it was the mark of Hate. <br><br> Puzzled, the Tier dal placed his hand upon the boy, nudging him to move through the tunnel.  The boy nodded, and turned.. walking before Myr Dirinn,  with no hesitation now.  As the boy walked ahead of the Tier dal,  Myr Dirinn noticed a mark on the back of the child's neck.  Myr Dirinn's eyes widened to see that it was the same marking that was on the back of the knight's neck- it was the mark of hate.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;Could the knight have been the child, many years from now?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>Myr Dirinn thought to himself.  Shaken,  the Tier dal continued to escort the child to the end of the corridor..  wanting to return to the Tier dal city of Neriak, so that he may tell the elders of what he saw.  <br><br>        As the two approached the exit,  Zoronious could see that outside of the doorway..  it was dark.   Trees seemed to go on and on forever as howls and shrieks echoed through them.   The two then stepped forth, through the doorway,  their feet setting down upon solid gray stone.  As Myr Dirinn's foot left the doorway.. and both were set upon the stone.. the doorway immediately collapsed, leaving a flash of light and thunderclap behind.<br><br>        The two were now atop another stone pyramid,  the top- flat and etched with runes.  A soft humming could be heard, seemingly coming from within the stone itself.  Myr Dirinn escorted the child to a side of the pyramid, where there where stairs leading down to the ground.  As Myr Dirinn lead the boy down the stairs, he spoke.. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;There is something different about you, child.    You have within you,  something powerful.   Where you are going,  that power will be unleashed...and you will harness that power and use it to spread the beliefs of our kind.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  The child, looking somewhat delighted, nodded at the Tier dal,  grinning wickedly as he stared up into his eyes.   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;Let me show you to your new home, Zoronious.    Come with me.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  As he spoke, Myr Dirinn motioned for Zoronious to follow him..  leading him towards the Tier dal city..  deep within the dark forest of Nektulous.<br><br>~Zoronious Yigsawla<br>Knight of Innoruuk <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzoroniousbonedaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zoronious Bonedaddy</A> at: 2/13/02 2:27:22 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=129.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=129.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
