I am under no illusions that it will be a RP utopia, but the long list of changes made for this server can only help.  From the TLC to the one character per account, and on down the line, these are all changes that while not being overly discouraging to roleplayers, tends to dissuade the average target demographic for EQ, increasing the opportunity to meet other roleplayers and have roleplaying be the norm, not the exception.<br><br>On a normal server, it's not 100% dood. Here it will not be 100% roleplay.  If the ratios even came close to being reversed, would that not qualify as &quot;more friendly&quot;?  <br><br>I know you are advocating for a 100% 24/7 roleplay only server where no one ever uses /ooc or behaves as an &quot;anti-roleplayer&quot;.  If that is your criteria for being happy, then yes, you are unfortunately doomed to misery.  <br><br>Use ignore until all 40 slots are filled and then turn on your mental ignore after that.  I think you'll be surprised at how different it is from your old server. By chasing after phantoms before the server even begins, you are dooming yourself to heartache. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dawgtide>dawgtide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/01 10:40:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_money.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Crash and Burn</span><hr size=1> Well I think it will definately be a better server just due to the harder rules.  This will not encourage people that like it easy to come here.  The big question is will brand new buyers know these rules when they log in.  If not it could end up being bad.  I am not thinking it will be all roleplay by any means but I think there will be much more of it.  Yes there will be &quot;ubers&quot; as some call it to come here just to do things first.  This actually is not a huge issue as long as they do not go around bragging about it to all the others that aren't interested.  I really hope the hard ruleset will keep the &quot;doods&quot; off but I know it will not the true &quot;ubers&quot;.  I happen to know quite a few on one of the top ten guilds as far as achievement in this game period.  They are really good people and to be honest they just put more time in this game than a lot of us.  I am not saying this is good for them in real life but that is why they level and get it done faster than some of us.  Many are good people though.  I just hope the finding a group problem does not kill the interest of many here.  This could be a real issue for evils and goods. I think many  will choose neutral alignment due to this.  Not me, I am playing the hardest race/class/diety I can find and look forward to being in an evil guild eventually with the iksars, ogres and dark elfs.  I hope I can roleplay him too and not get in shouting matches when there is nothing personal in evil roleplaying. I hope in my heart this server will be more mature and I really think it will.  Actually I wish it had more rules to keep the folks that want it easy out.<br><br>Dawgtide <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uembermae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EmberMae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/01 10:58:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Crash and Burn</span><hr size=1> I am very afraid as well.

On my other server, roleplayers are few and far between, and it's hard to find each other.  That's why I think the coalition of guilds is a good thing and it's why I'm trying to join a roleplaying guild from the start.  We have to stick together and set the tone for the server.
