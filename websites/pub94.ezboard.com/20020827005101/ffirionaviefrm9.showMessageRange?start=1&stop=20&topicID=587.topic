When they find out you have one, their perception of you can change. <br><br>Certain people feel that permanently altering your skin with a tatoo is bad. It can say a lot about a person if they have a tatoo. <br><br>Certain behaviors can reveal a lot about a person. For instance, if I meet a good-looking woman who is a smoker, I know right away a LOT about that person. I know they have absolutely no care for the dangers of smoking, or else they wouldn't do it. I know they have no self-control to quit, that they are addicted, or else they would have quit already. I know that they won't be beautiful much longer, because smoking causes premature aging in your skin cells. I know their clothes smell, they spend a lot of money to support their habit, and that kissing them will taste, quite literally, like shit. <br><br><br>A lot of conclusions can be drawn from something as simple as a behavior like smoking, or having a tatoo.

What other harmful things does she engage in? How long has she been smoking? (this determines the level of addiction, which determines the likelyhood that the person will quit)<br><br><br>Smoking is bad. There's no rationalizing that into some acceptable form. You are putting nicotine-filled SMOKE into your lungs, that will eventually give you CANCER. <br><br>There's a reason the first time you took a drag on a cigarette you COUGHED. Your body is smarter than you are. It tried to reject it. Unfortunatley, you were more stubborn than your body, and you forced it. WTG. You won. Good for you. You can have that put on your gravestone. <br><br><br>The nicotine will cause a person to become addicted. The more they smoke, the more addicted they will become, to the point where, no matter how much willpower and inner strength you have, you will NOT be able to quit. Eventually, you will reach that threshold, cross over it, and there won't be any turning back. You will be permanantly addicted. Only outside intervention *may* have a chance to help you. And even then, it probably won't work. <br><br><br>My mom smokes. My sister smokes. My mother's best friend died from lung cancer caused by smoking. I've seen what it does. My mom can't quit. She's tried. She's gone past that point of no return. She'll die from those cigarettes. <br><br><br>And you want me to what? Not make a judgement, or draw a conclusion, from someone who smokes? Be real. <br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Not everything has some hidden meaning<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I would agree. I think the meanings are quite obvious in most cases. <br><br><br>As for tatoos: I never made a judgement either way about them. The point of my post wasn't to judge behaviors, but to point out that ever time you reveal something about yourselve, you change people's perceptions of you. The poster above made the statement, &quot;But I'm the same person I was 5 minutes ago&quot;, or something to that effect. <br><br>That's just not true. New information changes who you are. <br><br><br>When I see a person with a tatoo, my conclusions usually run along these lines: That person made a *permanent* change to their skin. Did they think that all the way through? Do they realize exactly how permanent that is? Do they know what that is going to look like when their skin cells stretch out in their old age? <br><br>I question the judgement to get a tatoo. But I don't hold that decision as seriously as something like smoking. Smoking is harmful, and will kill you. Tatoos won't. They might just look bad when you're old and wrinkly. <br><br><br>Last thing: Don't think I don't hold myself to my own standards. I am about 25 lbs. overweight. I'm actively following the &quot;Body for Life&quot; program, trying to get myself into better shape. <br><br>I've spent the past decade being overweight. I'm making progress toward a goal, but I also realize that a person with bad judgement and weak willpower turned me into a fatty. I excercised poor decision making in my life, eating too many sweets, and fatty foods, and not excercising and working out. I showed weak willpower because I didn't do anything to fix it. It took my doctor telling me I would become Diabetic if I didn't change my ways to get me on the track to fix myself. <br><br>I would expect anyone who saw me at my heaviest, and anyone seeing my right now, to draw these same conclusions about my decision making skills and willpower. And they would be right to draw those conclusions. <br><br><br><br>People aren't blank slates. We do things that are good, and things that are bad. And that's what makes us unqiue. <br><br>But we should never, ever ignore who we are. We should never use excuses to justify our behavior. Saying that something &quot;just is&quot;, is trying to remove responsiblity for our actions. <br><br>I won't do that. I can't do that. <br><br>-Krazak<br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udiamondtiger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DiamondTiger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/5/02 5:17:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=587.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Back on tattoos...</span><hr size=1> Yes, I know that the chances of my tattoo stretching into a funky lookin snake as I age are really good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That's okay.

Now, I am stronger. This is life - the chance to change, to grow, to become stronger. To correct our weaknesses. <br><br>I don't believe in evolution of man from monkeys, but I do believe each person can evolve from who they are when they are born.

Strength? It's something. <br><br>If a person *knows* that smoking is bad, but doesn't quit, why is that? Willpower has to factor into that equation at some point in time. <br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There are people who have quit, if you don't realize that, well....back to the cave, I guess.<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>So, you would like to personally attack me then? Inferring that I am a &quot;cave man&quot;? What purpose does that serve?<br><br>As for people who have quit - yes, I have known some. My own father quit smoking when he was very young, before he had me. I've known other people who have quit as well. My 8th grade science teacher quit smoking after 9 years of the habit. I will always remember his story. He had been some years quit when I met him, and he recalled how even then, some 8 years after having quit, his body was still puking up green matter. His lungs were still cleaning out the damage he had done to them. But like he said, &quot;the sooner you quit, the better chance you have for your body to repair itself&quot;. He didn't like hacking up green stuff in the morning, on occassions, but it beat the alternative - dying from cancer. <br><br>And that is a great thing, that people can quit! Good for them. It means that for some people, there is hope. <br><br>But here are the facts: A person who smokes is less likely to quit, the longer they continue to smoke. This is because of the addictive nature of nicotine. The more you smoke, the smaller your chances of quitting become. <br><br>This is why, when I meet someone who smokes, it is very important for me to know how long they have been smoking. Because if it's been a long time, they aren't likely to quit. But if it's been a short time, perhaps they have a chance to quit. Maybe I can help them? <br><br>Just because I draw certain conclusions about people, doesn't mean I'm a heartless person. I draw those conclusions, often times, to determine what *I* can do to be a part of the solution. <br><br>I've tried to help my mom for years. But she is past the point of no return. She's tried to quit so many times... but the end result is the same: she cannot. The addiction has surpassed her own personal level of willpower. It is sad to see someone reach that point. <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>And I never said smoking wasn't bad. I know first hand it is.

If so, when?<br><br>Also, why would you continue to smoke, to participate in an action that damages your body? Do you not respect your body?

Please don't draw conclusions and then assume that I draw the same. <br><br>We each draw our own conclusions, and make our own judgements.

I don't have to agree with *everything* a person says or does in order to be friends with them. If someone I know has a tatoo, I don't quit being friends with them. I just have some piece of information that I didn't have before. <br><br><br><br>Really, I think you just liked to read more into my statements than what I was trying to say. Maybe you needed someone to fight with today. Maybe you just didn't like me attacking smokers. I dunno. <br><br>I know this much: I don't believe in the mantra of &quot;don't judge a book by it's cover&quot;. Because to me, the cover *is* part of the book. It is only one part, and I give it what I feel is the proper weight in the final analysis, but I don't ignore it either. <br><br>Everything about a person makes them who they are. To ignore any part of it is to ignore some part of that person. Would you want someone to ignore you? Even the smallest part of you? <br><br>I try not to ignore anything about people.

And will that person do the same? <br><br><br>-Krazak<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=587.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=587.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=587.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=587.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=587.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=587.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=587.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
