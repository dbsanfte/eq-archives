<br>
First; Monks, Rogues, and Bards are the three classes that make up the collective known as &quot;The Rogues&quot;.<br>
<br>
Second; Rangers fall in the collective known as &quot;The Hybrids&quot;.  This includes Shadow Knights, Paladins, and Rangers.  These hybrids are all derivatives of the &quot;Warrior&quot; IE the grand dady tank.<br>
<br>
Rogues were not designed to be tanks.  They can function in this capacity, should the need arise, however they will generally speaking require alot of help doing this.  Whether that be extreme twinking, or extreme buffing / caster support.<br>
<br>
Bard's lose effectivness in a MT situation due to the fact that you cannot reliably twist 4 songs when you are being pounded upon and stunned constantly.  The most MY bard has been able to twist while soloing is usualy about two songs with no instrument switching.  This is due to the fact that Bards have almost 0 avoidance AC ... nearly all Bard AC is mitigation.  This means that although Bards tend to take less damage from hits, they get hit alot (hence they are stunded easy, interupting songs).  This also means that if a Bard is tanking more than one opponent, the Bard WILL NOT last long.<br>
<br>
Rogues lose effectivness in a MT situation due to the fact that rogues must be behind an oponent to BS, which is their primary damage source, especially at higher levels.  Although I know many people think rogues are taunt machines (and they are), once you remove BS from that equation a large part of their taunt factor is removed, and they may not be able to hold it (aggro).  Also if a rogue evades while he is MT, your group will likley die, since the mob wont default back to a warrior or such, but rather a caster.  On the plus side Rogues have a balance between mitigation / avoidance AC, however they are still inferior to an equivalent warrior/derivative.<br>
<br>
Monks have very little mitigation AC ... nearly all Monk AC is avoidance.  This means that although they will get hit less, they tend to get hit for MORE damage per hit.  This combined with naturally low hp means trouble.  A properly twinked and caster supported monk is actually a quite effective tank, but a properly equiped and caster supported warrior/derivative is EVEN more effective.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Rogues&quot; (the collective) recive much less HP per level than warriors/derivatives.  This becomes more of an issue post 50 when warrior/derivatives HP scale upwards, while Rogues remain constant.<br>
<br>
Why did I type all this?  Because your post (the original post) gives the impression that Rangers are on the same level as &quot;The Rogues&quot; in terms of tanking ability.  Now I am the first to say Rangers are not the most effective tanks, later in the game, when compared to Warriors, SKs, and Pallys ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     But Rangers are still warrior derivatives, and all things equal will out tank a Rogue 100% of the time, with less upport work required from the group.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rangers get stigma because they are the least twinked class on blue servers, and an untwinked anything compared to an uber twinked anything <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     ALWAYS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> looks inferior.<br>
<br>
P.S. I have played a Monk to 60, and have soloed at 60.  If you pick me over a similarly equiped Ranger at level 60 to be YOUR tank, I dont want to be in YOUR group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     .<br>

<br>
Oh well I have no choice but to sound like I support you cause you werent picking on Rangers, LOL.<br>
<br>
This post has good points about why Rogues and monks should normally avoid Tanking. The class really wasnt intended as one, though it can in a pinch.<br>
<br>
A well equipped Rogue can have more ac then a same level Ranger between 43 and 60. Simply because after 42 Rangers Defense is capped till they get 2 points a level at 51 ( humm, unless rogues cap at 42 till 51 also, dont have a rogue over 11 so..). But the intent of the Rogue was not to act as the main tank , Falzure explains it well.<br>
<br>
A Monk really needs to be high level to even consider tanking in a full group. The term tanking doesnt really apply to a duo.(in my opinion.) And again as per Falzure's post, the purpose of a monk really isnt to tank. They are geared for other purposes by the class design.A Ranger can hold agro over a monk, though may need a little help from monk to do it depending on monks equipment compared to ranger.<br>
<br>
Rangers are not main tanks after 40. They can and do tank but are secondary tanks, only becoming main when no preferred main is around. Also tanking requires a mind set and proper equipment.<br>
<br>
Verant has tried after Kunark to dump the Ranger into the Rogue family. There are posts by Brad McQuad that clearly state he meant ( course none till well after Kunark) the Ranger class to fall in that group. Funny thing is, until they get Jolt at (51?) (not a spell I use a lot) they have zero avoidance capability in a fight like a monk or Rogue. Except for camo (outdoor only) at 15 and Improved Camo (used to be 49, is it 39 now?) (indoor capable), a Ranger did not have the unique scout capablities of a rogue (sneak/hide) or a monk (non casted feign) and invis really is no substitute. Rangers do get sneak and hide but they are capped at 75 and cant be used to move hidden like a rogue. Also the spell Jolt came out AFTER the sudden shift by Brad as to what a Ranger was.(and was originally 55)<br>
<br>
A Tanking Rogue is not living up to the potential of the class in my opinion. A Tanking Monk is giving away part of the class ability also  (at least a part most players have come to expect). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/02 4:41:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If you had these folks to tank.. who'd you choose?</span><hr size=1> Ah, let me change one thing about my arguement.

Rogues should never main tank, because rogues are all about damage.  I don't want to hear about how rogues never get hit.  If a rogue is getting hit, he can't backstab and there's 20% of your damage or so.<br>
<br>
Bards should be pixie striking or the like.  They're casters, they shouldn't be bashed.<br>

Have the ranger or the monk.  At 40, have the monk tank.<br>

Anyhow, I'd probbly pick the ranger, it would make it easier to keep aggro and the mitigation should help... having all avoidance myself, I can see how a monk could get hammered many times in a row for lots, and that's never a good thing.

I had one group that was just me and two rangers.  The rangers passed the aggro back and forth, and I healed as necessary.  When I caught aggro from healing, if they couldn't pull it back, they snared and I got the heck out of the way.  Don't think any of us got down to less than 1/2 mana the whole time (except when I took time to buff), we fought almost constantly, and only had to run once, and that's when someone trained us from another room (and we almost made it through that one).  At least around my level, I'll take the ranger as my tank any day.<br>

Mostly because of the warrior based hitpoints advantage and great taunting ability.<br>
<br>
The most difficult thing i've tanked is the Black Dire in Mistmoore.  It has a fair amount of hp, decent MR, and hits for up to 200.  I was the only melee present at the battle.  Sung haste(50%+str+atk), slow(32%+lowerAC+lowerAgi), debuffed MR(and DoT) so i could land slow, and clicked BoH(7hp per tick+7str).<br>
<br>
Bards don't have double attack, but we have great personal haste.  At 47th season our haste becomes 50%(adds Str+Atk too).  Effective slows and DS make up for a lack of hit points.<br>
<br>
The last time i recall pairing with a cleric was at the ry'gorr camp in EW.  Of course, we had no trouble with anything there, but when it came time to kill the chief we used Fear.  I'm not sure if this is a good example to make the comparison, chief is a fairly big challenge, for his level. My question is: Could a ranger or monk kill him with a cleric partner?  Assuming both cleric and tank are 52.<br>

When it comes to fearing, the ranger just has to deal damage.  Honestly, with a cleric, I could straight out tank him, if the cleric were to chain cast stuns, too.  I can do that now, and I'm nowhere near 52.  He hits hard, but not that hard.<br>
<br>
Better example maybe would be shaman/ranger vs shaman/bard combo.  I think shaman/ranger is stronger during the fight, but shaman/bard will recover faster after the fight.<br>
<br>
One important note, too.... ranger vs monk tanking... the ranger gets self only dmg shield buffs that add up when you are tanking.  I was doing some math, and at level 49, if I can get my 8th ring by then (I'm up to 7th now), I can self buff myself to 23 dmg thorns.  With a druid or mage if their shield is around 30, subtract 8 from mine, since I get a fairly mediocre thorn equivalent... 23-8+30 = 55!<br>

...but we can take quite alot of damage and keep the agro without any problems...<br>
<br>
I was grouped with 3 rogues and a shammie...<br>
One of them outdamaged me for about 5 to 1...<br>
But a little snare and MORE IMPORTANT...Flame lick!....<br>
and I kept all the agro on me.This flame lick spell is lvl 9 spell<br>
All it does is a minor amount of damage (about 4 or 5 points, lol), lowers targets AC about 11 I think, has an incredible fast recast time and gets yourself TONS of agro.<br>
<br>
Ever tried as a ranger to group with a rogue or warrior and kite?<br>
Ranger runs in front of MOB and uses his snare/flamelick/weak DoTs combo and the rogue/warrior runs behind and deals damage?<br>
<br>
Should take down many MOBs easily without getting hit<br>

<br>
Paladins and SKs are closer, but I tend to take less damage overall than them as well.<br>
<br>
Rangers don't have THAT many more hps than monk.<br>
<br>
I will never tank over a Paladin or SK if, and only if, there is a cleric who is Chealing in the group.  Although I see that I generally take less damage overall, I just don't have the hit points to be efficient with Cheal.<br>
