I figured a topic like this would be burning with flames. It is impressive to see tolerant religions folks...<br>
<br>
Religion is merely a tool to instruct/enforce morality.<br>
<br>
But that being said, I fall somewhere in the native belief scheme, although I am hesitant to call it religion. When I was young, I was a hardcore bible thumper on the protestant christian side of things (compounded with being sent to a catholic school). Going to college, I was exposed to so many more religious views than I had ever seen during my sheltered christian life. During that time, I became fascinated with and started to explore my native cultural past. Once I was exposed to that, I started to realize that christianity was something that was too harsh on the world... too filled with hate and unbendable ways.<br>
<br>
In something that you think only happens in books or movies, a kind native shaman took me under his wing for a few years. It was an increadible spiritual awakening that helped me to see and interact with the world in a different light.<br>
<br>
Since then, learning about different religions/cults has become a bit of a passtime. Once you become tolerant of other's beliefs, it is easier to interact with them.<br>
<br>
Well, except for a number of death/harbinger religions. Those are the groups that the world can do without. Folks use Cthulhu as the basis of jokes, but you would be surprised at the large number of people dedicated to it. <p><TABLE ALIGN="center"><TR><TD>

I have followed Taoist principles for most of my adult life, and although there is some religion there, it is not truely a religion. That is why I dinna mention it before.<br>
<br>
Tao translates as &quot;the Way&quot;. It isn't a set of beliefs, but a set of practices, a guideline for how to live a peaceful happy life. It is similar to Buddhism, but different, and not contradictory. A Taoist can be of almost any religion. <br>
<br>
Best book I've ever seen on Taoism was Benjamin Hoff's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Tao of Pooh</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. And yes, for any of you unfamiliar with it, it explains Taoism from the point of view that Winnie the Pooh is pretty much the perfect Taoist. After that, almost any one of the &quot;miniature&quot; books with translations of Taoist sayings would be very helpful.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  In Which Piglet Meets a Heffalump</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
One day, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were all talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly: &quot;I saw a Heffalump today, Piglet.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What was it doing?&quot; asked Piglet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just limping along,&quot; said Christopher Robin. &quot;I don't think it saw me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I saw one once,&quot; said Piglet. &quot;At least, I think I did,&quot; he said. &quot;Only perhaps it wasn't.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So did I,&quot; said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't often see them,&quot; said Christopher Robin carelessly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not now,&quot; said Piglet. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not at this time of year,&quot; said Pooh. <br>
<br>
Then they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh and Piglet to go home together. At first as they stumped along the path which edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn't say much to each other; but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the stepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the heather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and Piglet said,&quot;If you see what I mean, Pooh,&quot; and Pooh said, &quot;It's just what I think myself, Piglet,&quot; and Piglet said, &quot;But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember,&quot; and Pooh said, &quot;Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for the moment.&quot; And then, just as they came to the Six Pine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and said in a very solemn voice: <br>
<br>
&quot;What have you decided, Pooh?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have decided to catch a Heffalump.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for Piglet to say &quot;How?&quot; or &quot;Pooh, you couldn't!&quot; or something helpful of that sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that he had thought about it first.<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall do it,&quot; said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, &quot;by means of a trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Pooh,&quot; said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, &quot;I will.&quot; And then he said, <br>
<br>
&quot;How shall we do it?&quot; and Pooh said, &quot;That's just it. How?&quot; And then they sat down together to think it out. <br>
<br>
Pooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and----&quot;Why?&quot; said Piglet. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why what?&quot; said Pooh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would he fall in?&quot; <br>
<br>
Pooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be walking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down, when it would be too late. <br>
<br>
Piglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were raining already? <br>
<br>
Pooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn't thought of that. And then he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the Heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would clear up, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down....When it would be too late. <br>
<br>
Piglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap. <br>
<br>
NEXT STORY: Pooh and Piglet start planning their trap for the Heffalump.<br>
<br>
LEAD-IN: Christopher Robin says he saw a Heffalump which gives Pooh and Piglet the idea or trapping one of these scary animals. <br>
<br>
Pooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this. Where should they dig the Very Deep Pit?<br>
<br>
Piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on.<br>
<br>
&quot;But then he would see us digging it,&quot; said Pooh.<br>
&quot;Not if he was looking at the sky.&quot;<br>
&quot;He would Suspect,&quot; said Pooh, &quot;if he happened to look down.&quot; He thought for a long time and then added sadly, &quot;It isn't as easy as I thought. I suppose that's why Heffalumps hardly ever get caught.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That must be it,&quot; said Piglet. <br>
<br>
They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to himself, &quot;If only I could think of something!&quot; For he felt sure that a Very Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way to go about it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Suppose,&quot; he said to Piglet, &quot;you wanted to catch me, how would you do it?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Piglet, &quot;I should do it like this. I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and-----&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And I would go in after it,&quot; said Pooh excitedly, &quot;only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then----&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of-----I say, wake up, Pooh!&quot; <br>
<br>
Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't think so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, he would have to find the acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some of his own honey, so he said, &quot;All right, honey then,&quot; just as Pooh remembered it too, and was going to say, &quot;All right, haycorns.&quot; <br>
<br>
LEAD-IN: Piglet has been worrying . . . again. He has been trying to decide if he should go to the Cunning Trap with Pooh to see a Heffalump or if maybe he should stay in bed pretending to have a headache, just in case Heffalumps don't like Piglets. <br>
<br>
And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six Pine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there was a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and if there wasn't, he wouldn't. <br>
<br>
So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffalump in the Trap, and then he thought that there would, and as he got nearer he was sure that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping about like anything. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!&quot; said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see what a Heffalump looked like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and looked in.... And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck. &quot;Bother!&quot; he said, inside the jar, and &quot;Oh, help!&quot; and, mostly &quot;Ow!&quot; And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see what he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much of that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar and all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair....and it was at that moment that Piglet looked down. <br>
<br>
&quot;Help, help!&quot; cried Piglet, &quot;a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!&quot; and he scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, &quot;Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hollible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hollerump!&quot; And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he got to Christopher Robin's house. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever's the matter, Piglet?&quot; said Christopher Robin, who was just getting up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heff,&quot; said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, &quot;a Hepp---a Heff---a Heffalump.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Up there,&quot; said Piglet, waving his paw.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did it look like?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like like, It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like---like nothing. A huge big---well, like a---I don't know---like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, &quot;I shall go and look at it. Come on.&quot; <br>
<br>
Piglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they went.... &quot;I can hear it, can't you?&quot; said Piglet anxiously, as they got near.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can hear something,&quot; said Christopher Robin. <br>
<br>
It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found. <br>
<br>
&quot;There!&quot; said Piglet. &quot;Isn't it awful?&quot; And he held on tight to Christopher Robin's hand. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, Christopher Robin began to laugh....and he laughed....and he laughed. And while he was still laughing---Crash when the Heffalump's head against the tree-root, Smash went the jar, and out came Pooh's head again... <br>
<br>
Then Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast together.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Bear!&quot; said Christopher Robin. &quot;How I do love you!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;So do I,&quot; said Pooh.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I mean, wouldn't through creating a character and playing it as an extension of yourself be realising yourself and thus go against the concept of becoming selfless?  Or would it mean that you would become selfless through the game thus eventually relinquishing it and trying to help those around you in the game until that time?  I still don't understand how one can strive to become selfless without admitting that they are thus striving for something and thus proving that they exist through the admission of striving.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Gah, I should be quite before I am told I know nothing of Buddhist beliefs and that I should go away. <p><p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373025>Rubis<BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/sigs/rubissig.jpg></p></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=745.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=745.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=745.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=745.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=745.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=745.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
