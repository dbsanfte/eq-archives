Nothing of benefit can come of this endeavor, but I must attempt it.  If I fail, then my teacher will have my brain for his research.  Argh!  It is costing me a fortune already to have this letter translated into other vile tongues.  I have to trust this ugly gnome to get it right.  I bet he would taste so good over a fire….<br>

(Posted in various taverns across Norrath.  Some copies have been seen blown about the Plane of Knowledge)<br>
<br>
“Races of Norrath, Xsasx greets you.  I am newly hatched…come…to this world.  If upon your quests you see the need to remove obstacles of the fleshly kind, I would be most willing to assist you with this obstacle.  Please leave a message with the owner of this fine establishment on how I may contact you.”<br>
<br>
I must learn the other tongues of this land.  It is stupidity.  The only thing I need to learn can be found in a fresh corpse.  However, if I am to accomplish my endeavor, I must actually interact with these other inferior races.  Where am I going to find a foul elf who will be willing teach me?  It will be difficult enough to find an elf below the surface of this world to teach me their tongue, but how to even approach a wood elf or a high elf?  <br>
<br>
To make matters even worse, I am commanded to not kill or torture the one who teaches me!  I had hoped to experiment with cutting open their skulls to figure out how the brain tissue worked as they spoke.  That hope is now lost.  Cursed teacher.<br>
<br>
Most of my race that knows these languages do not visit our home very often.  Maybe soon I will be able to grab a few moments of their time to at least learn some phrases to get me started.<br>
<br>
I tire of killing these beetles and scorpions.  I look forward to the day when I will be able to sneak into that gnome city and bring terror into their dreams.<br>
<br>
Upon waking this morning, a brilliant idea has occurred to me.  I have been instructed to not kill the one who teaches me a language.  However, I have not been told that someone else can do the deed for me.  It is not the ideal situation, but my options are greatly increased now to find a victim.<br>
<br>
Curses upon all that stand against me.  My teacher has learned of my plan.  I fear I was not careful enough in my last meeting with a fellow necromancer.  I have not seen her since.  <br>

Greetings.  I sometimes get pretty windy when the writing muse hits me so I ask for forgiveness if my introduction is too long.  <br>
<br>
I am wanting to give more emphasis to role-playing in my EQ experience.  The other server I play on is nice but I am wanting to expand a bit.<br>
<br>
I know Xsasx is really young in the world, but I hope to connect with others who are willing to role-play yet willing to stretch beyond the “pure” good versus evil.<br>
<br>
Send me a tell anytime even if I do not have LFG on.  I do not care how many times I die if I have the chance to get to know others.  I have taken other chars into the 50's on another server and not taken time to get to know others.  I do not want to repeat that again.<br>

I have finally learned how to reach this plane they call &quot;Knowledge&quot;.  Perhaps we can meet there.<br>

I am currently in great need of bone chips to summon my companion from the underworld.  I only have resources for one more summoning.  Do not worry, I have full control of the undead I summon.  <br>

She thinks of her &quot;brood,&quot; her abbil, the Shadow Knight, and the others that had made themselves known during their session. &quot;Babbling?&quot; she asks, her eye brow arching high. &quot;The only babbling Usstan heard was that of your forked tongue attempting to form the words of our superior language. &quot; She laughed at his &quot;protection,&quot; as she had been instructed by her Father not to touch him with her magic.
