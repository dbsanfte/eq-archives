<br>
I was in a group today that decided to try to take out a few of the minis in BoT.  Laef, Oreen and Gaukr are all up.  We decide to take out Laef first.<br>
<br>
At this time I get a tell from someone asking if any minis are up.  I tell them that we're about to fight one now.  We engage, win, and decide to move on to Oreen.<br>
<br>
We arrive at Oreen's room and I get a tell from the individual saying they attempted to solo Oreen but failed, and were setting up for another attempt.  I told them that my group was also preparing to attempt to kill Oreen.<br>
<br>
To which I get the response, &quot;You going to steal my camp? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I wasn't really expecting this response, though maybe I should have, because I didn't really think of what the person had as a &quot;camp&quot;.  It's not as if they were there for hours (or even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>a</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hour) clearing PHers.  Seeing that a mob is up, making a run at it and failing, isn't what I ever thought of as a genuine camp.<br>
<br>
I'm not even sure the person is serious at this point, so I just respond, &quot;Heh.&quot;  The person starts talking with others in my group, and she begins making comments about how what we're doing is bad ettiquette, camp stealing, impolite, &quot;not cool&quot;, ect.<br>
<br>
Now, I know the official Sony stance is that camps &quot;don't exist&quot; and that it only matters who engages the mob first.  I also know that there are some unwritten rules of EQ that most players try to respect about not moving in on someone else's &quot;camp&quot;.<br>
<br>
The problem is, I really didn't agree with this individual's view of what constituted a camp, as I mentioned above, and I didn't really think it was right for me to tell my group &quot;Sorry, I've got to leave, because I think we should give this individual an unlimited number of attempts at killing this mob for an indefinite amount of time&quot; while we are there with a fully prepared and clearly capable group that can take out the NPC in question.<br>
<br>
And for that matter, I think it's a bit impolite for an individual to essentially deny such a group an attempt at a NPC where they've already failed and been forced to at least temporarily abandon the camp.  When we got to the camp, in fact, I didn't see the individual in question there, and the people in my group were claiming we had a person there first.  I'm not sure of this fact either way.  I guess it's possible that the individual didn't even make the failed run at Oreen that they claimed, though I don't really believe that they were lying.<br>
<br>
So anyway, my feeling is, neither party is any more &quot;entitled&quot; to the camp or the mob as any other, and that if the individual wants to make another attempt at the mob before us, that's up to them, but that we shouldn't wait forever while they prepare, attempt, possibly fail, and try again.  So I tell the person if they think they can solo Oreen, to go ahead and do it.  Apparently this got the person in a &quot;rush&quot;, made an attempt, and failed.  We then engaged Oreen and defeated him.<br>
<br>
I try to explain my reasoning to the individual, who makes comments like &quot;I thought you were cool&quot;, ect., but my opinion of what constitutes a valid camp is dismissed as &quot;BS&quot;.  I obviously don't think of my opinion as BS, nor is my reasoning behind what constitutes a camp something that I conjured up &quot;on the spot&quot; as justification for my own &quot;greedy&quot; actions.  It's just what I always thought of as common sense... that it's not fair to lay indefinite claim to a camp you're having clear difficulty holding.  That's not something I personally would do.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to accept the fact that I might have been &quot;wrong&quot; here, or as wrong as anybody can be in what is essentially a rather grey area of ettiquette without any clearly defined rules.  I'm curious about whether the &quot;majority opinion&quot; is with me or against me (though I understand that this forum would hardly be capable of producing a true scientific determination of &quot;majority&quot;).<br>
<br>
It bugs me, because apparently in the eyes of this individual, I did something that makes me &quot;worse a person&quot;, when really all I did was attempt to live up to my own personal beliefs about what is right and wrong in such a situation.  I've argued against &quot;taking over camps&quot; at times where I felt another group or individual really did have a true and well established camp, and by and large I try to save the people I interact with as much grief as possible. In this situation, I'm afraid it was a no-win situation... either I cause grief for all my groupmates by abandoning them, or I earn the ire of the person whose camp we &quot;stole&quot; by not respecting the &quot;camp&quot; I don't think they had adequately established.<br>
<br>
It sucks and either way seems to me a pretty good argument to never stepping foot in a zone like BoT again and spending all my time in instanced LDoN zones. ;\ <p>--Velsor<br>

I know that sony's offical stance is there are not camps, First aggro, yada yada. However I do respect camps but in this case..Can a person who attempted to solo a mob of this magnitude and failed be allowed to &quot;Claim&quot; the camp untill he finally gives up when there is a perfectly capable group there to take the Target? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~sopersix/CymrySig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=634707"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:Purple;font-family:verdana;font-size:x-small;"><br>

If they got killed and are on their way back then in my book they have the camp. Any other interpretation is an open invitation to camp-stealing by surreptitious training or aggro-management.<br>
<br>
That said they have to have some hope of actually holding it. I am put in mind of the flame a few months back about the 30ish druid &quot;claiming&quot; an IG camp because they were there but needing help to kill anything.<br>
<br>
It is a judgement call. Were they ever really there? I have been in Seb when a camp check was called and seen people at the entrance replying &quot;Disco&quot;.<br>
<br>
The giveaway is usually a fresh corpse. Without that their claim is highly suspect. Ok they could have evacced, zoned, gated, but in that event they have no more way of proving they were there first than you do of proving they were not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lnyaniel>Lnyaniel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/03 8:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4055.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The age old 'camp' debate.</span><hr size=1> I personally believe that First in Force - first to gain aggro is the rightful owners of any mob.

Nothing worse than a person running in and taking your spawned mob after your group spent an hour or more clearing it's PH's<br>

In my own scenario we were trying Guak with 4.  Just wanted to see if we could do him.  We engage get him to 20 percent... bad things happen...loss.  We recovered.  Ran up and tried him again and got him to 10 percent before he munched us.<br>
<br>
Then....i got a tell from some folks.  &quot;We are going to try Guak.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Now in this case... I was a bit mad.  I too know that I really had no claim to the mob... but I still got angry because we had been there for quite a while and were close to succeeding.  In the end of the discussion they &quot;allowed&quot; us one more attempt... a chanter friend came up and we took him down.  But I really wanted to do it with just 4 of us.<br>
<br>
So I dont have a solid answer.  Were we enough to take Gauk down??  I dont know.... I never got the chance to see if that third attempt would have been successful.  Did we &quot;own&quot; the camp... I dont know that either...sucks when you wipe and people swoop down and gank the mob.<br>
<br>
Ultimately playing nice and working out some solution is best.  How I worked out the above is I asked them for 1 more attempt... and by chance my chanter buddy had just zoned in to the zone and joined us.  <br>
<br>
All i can recommend is communication and coming to some agreement.<br>

<br>
Don't have enough of a force to take down the baddy?  Keep wiping and claiming the camp till you get some more bodies there.  It happens all the time when ill equipped and undermanned forces want to contest a spawn.  They sit there and tread water on repops or they wipe wipe wipe meanwhile saying its 'their' spawn.<br>
<br>
Someone stronger comes along and takes it then they start crying rivers.<br>
<br>
First in Force means if you are there and take your shot good for you, but don't expect others to wait for your continual wipes before they take their shot.<br>

<br>
Here is a more real scenario.  Reso shows up to kill mob X.  They try and wipe.  Is it ok for FnF to now kill mob X?  What would the FV Boards think of that.  Reso has the strength but is fine tuning tactics.  It has always been accepted that if a guild is attempting a mob that the others would back off....well except for Klandicar that one time.......<br>
<br>
Now....how is that different from groups?<br>

So how is that different than what i described?  <br>

I think you missed the last sentence or I conveyed it wrong.  If your group is first aggro on any mob * that is not spawned * then it's yours.

<br>
Fine tuning tactics is fine when there is not competition for a spawn.  As you said, 10 percent is damn close and you probably could have gotten the mob given enough tries.  Hell you might not even need better tactics, just a better swing of the random number generator.<br>
<br>
The problem with continually wiping while others are standing there waiting is that you are wasting the time of quite a few people, those in your party who cannot beat the thing, and those in the opposing party(ies) who can't even take a shot even if they could easily kill the critter.<br>
<br>
Who is in the right?  The people treading water or wiping while they wait for more of their friends to show up, or those that get tired of waiting and claim the spawn as their own?  I would side with first in force, I don't believe in wasting my friends time or other peoples time.<br>
<br>
Thats what makes mobs like the Arbitor in Earth, or Avatar of War in Kael so nice.  They are a supreme pain in the ass because realistically you only get one shot.  There is no kill stealing to worry about.  If you fail no one has time for another go.  Arbitor is one of the most difficult encounters I have ever seen, the timer is absurd and he is a very tough fight.  You have to do alot of things perfectly just to get a shot at him and even then he still might kick your ass.<br>

It is going to spawn regardless of what you do, no matter how long you sit on your ass and how hard you stare at the spawn spot. Timed spawns should be a first come first served. They are too easy to monopolize if you consider them as camps. <br>
<br>
Mobs with placeholders are a different matter, because there is an effort that goes into killing placeholders and maintaining the camp. <br>

I personally dont think i have ever stood by and watched someone do a mob thinking...after they wipe im gonna send them a tell saying im gonna kill it.

<br>
As a general rule if a group wipes while trying to take out a mob like a mini in bot I won't move in over their corspes to kill with my group unless they do not intend to try again. As far as I am concerened its theirs to try as many times as they want. There are too many other places and things to hunt for me to be worried about 1 mob or camp.  There are always exceptions to this, largely depending on the circumstances, the above case I would think would be one such exception.<br>
