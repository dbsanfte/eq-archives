I find it truly offensive that many low lvl people were there roleplaying their hearts out, whilst he did not roleplay even noticeably and was given the reward.  I have been at low lvl events and tossed out of the zone by GMs for doing nothing more than talking to the event NPCs (not even threatening them) because I was too high lvl.  At this event, which was obviously one of the lowest lvl,yet most interesting ones I have seen, the high lvl people trampled all over those the event was designed for.  As far as I know on other servers the artifact was given to people in the appropriate lvl range, but not on D Ro.  I saw the whole thing and I was disgusted.  I am lvl 60, I could have happily trampled over the event, but I didn't, and I find the fact the GM allowed this sort of thing disgusting and very telling of matters on D Ro. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>Kaludram Aderlas, <i>Master of Shadows</i> for the <a href=http://www.theshadowcongress.com>Shadow Congress</a>...<i>arrogance personified</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 10/17/01 10:55:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 11:29:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leaving Uberquest</span><hr size=1> Let it go.<br> <br>Really.
