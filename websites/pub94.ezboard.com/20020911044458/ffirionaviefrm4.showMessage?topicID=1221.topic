<br>
Is a character only his/her stats?  <br>
<br>
That's what somone else other than the original player playing it would imply.  Can a different player imbue the character with the same life, the same spirit, the same personality, the same role? Or is the roll, the stats, really all that more important than the roleplaying, even on this, the roleplaying preferred server?<br>
<br>
I know I will encounter this directly as I enter the realm of raiding and perhaps am a bit glad I don't play one of the &quot;raid defining&quot; classes so I won't be asked to compromise myself in that way, but will I compromise myself if I go on a raid where I know at least one of the clerics (or a mage or some such) has been logged in by someone else and isn't really there.<br>
<br>
Oh... and I already do encounter it... in the form of a friend of mine who plays a high level character allowing his account to be logged in when his stats are needed but he can't be there.  It bothers me greatly whenever I know it is happening and I do think less of the friend for allowing it, but at the same time.... I can understand the mechanics of it *sigh*.<br>

There were also guilds that had multiple accounts that everyone played.

I think that is about the only valid (in my mind) reason for giving someone else your account and permission to &quot;play&quot; you, but that would be for the less than 5 minutes to get you to a &quot;safe&quot; place &amp; then camp you out.  Not to actually use any of your stats.<br>
<br>
Oh &amp; for not RPing while foraging, tradeskillng, or other mindless tasks... Actually... I do a lot of RPing when I am wandering foraging or doing clicky click tradeskills.  I can catch up on my socialising in those &quot;dead&quot; times.  <br>
<br>
For language teaching, yeah, that's harder.  One of the few times I dual-boxed my 2 accounts was to be able to teach someone 2 languages at the same time.  For language lessons, I am far more likely to read a webpage on my other monitor since to socialise with anyone else used to mean they had to know the language I was teaching or I had to switch languages, type replies fast, switch back and continue to use the hot key.  Ya know what, even though I am going to be participating in a language fair (or 2) this weekend as teacher mostly, I HATE the spam method of teaching.  But.... I have been trying to work out in my head was to do it that are less offensive to my RPer heart.  I wish there was a way to import text into the hotkeys while not logged in *sigh*.  I have been tempted to put in poetry or stories for the hotkeys for language instruction.<br>

It is my Wizard's personality...the unique set of quirks (many would call rapidly developing insanity) that make him such a memorable character to play and to play with.

BTW, on the topic of loans, I've never given my PW to anyone and won't.  OTH, I've been given PW's to a wide variety of 60s for all kinds of purposes at various times.  The casual ease with which some hand out their PW's boggles me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujharycleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jharycleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/17/02 2:18:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1221.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RP'ers don't ..</span><hr size=1> Cause in the end, what's the worst they can do?

druid = one of the best way to power level a twink (low level ) +port<br>
<br>
Cleric = res without waiting for them to get out of a group etc<br>
<br>
Wizy = quick port<br>
<br>
high level melee best way to pl a mid level character<br>
<br>
chanter = enchanting 2.3 billion ores , clay, other stuff<br>
<br>
Shammy = good pl high end<br>
<br>
what's the worst that usually happens gear strippage. What's the point in deleteing the character. it can be rest to the last server save.<br>
<br>
That being said haveing had to deal withthe BS that goes on when Verant  has to look at a mess like this, I nolonger lend my account about. nor do I ask for any other persons.<br>

Let somebody else be Didi?  Good Innoruuk no.  How much would that poor person suffer, getting all the bizarre tells from complete strangers!  Heheh.<br>
<br>
Plus, seriously, my mind is boggling trying to imagine any situation where a shadowknight would be so desperately in demand that someone would even want to borrow Didi.  *laugh*  Ah, wouldn't that be a nice world to live in, where Shadowknights are loved!<br>
<br>
Yep, it's just me and my small corporation of dedicated Australian employees manning Didi here.
