He wasn’t up so we left. We left all of the minis up except for Magi P’tassia.<br>
<br>
In regards to reservations – most of you know that I am and have always been a big advocate of the bigger guilds respecting open raids and such. Most of Clan Twisted feels the same way. There was no reason for us to clear Hate – we didn’t need the armor or the experience – we were only there for Inny – so I feel we did the right thing and bugged out when we found he wasn’t up.<br>
<br>
However, due to past problems – most notably a Fear raid which we scheduled and posted here out of respect for everyone else – and were promptly leap-frogged and every mini killed the day before we went up (the guild who did it never came forward to admit it and save us the trouble of breaking in either) – we aren’t posting our raids in advance anymore. We feel bad about this because it will eventually cause problems between us and the open raids and guilds who still post intents. But we feel this is a necessary thing since it was displayed to us that other guilds are using intents as a way to schedule their own raids around planned and posted raids by other guilds in order to ensure that content will be available to them. Please note that we will never follow this practice – we plan things on our own timetables and will not intentionally leap-frog another raid.<br>
<br>
We will always respect FCFS – if your guild is in a plane or assembled and buffing with enough people to enter a plane or kill a creature, we will always stand down and find something else to do. Also, we don’t and have never recognized the legitimacy of intents on single spawns – this includes Trakanon, Gorenaire, Talendor, Phingel, Severilous, Lodizal, Venril Saithir, Va’Dyn, Zelnithak or any other boss-type encounter. We continue to recognize FCFS in regards to these creatures.<br>
<br>
We hope that our policy will have a minimal impact on the community – most of our targets are beyond the capability of open or small-guild raids and we rarely spend time in the old-world planes. However, eventually conflicts will occur and we apologize for any problems that might arise. Open raids are welcome to announce their intentions to raid old-world planes on our message board <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/bclantwisted">pub21.ezboard.com/bclantwisted</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and if we haven’t scheduled a raid for that location already, we will try to avoid the times you have planned.<br>

Not to be rude or inconsiderate, but you don't set my timetable. If I want to sit and watch VS for 4 hours before I kill him - it is my business. If we fail 100 times before we succeed, it is still our camp.<br>

***SPECIAL NOTE*** - I had spoke to Tarin during the raid and the matter was cleared up peacefully and beneficially to both guilds. This is not a flame!<br>

To think for one minute that you have any say over another Guild or their interest in foolish. We post here (and EQ Raids) as a form of consideration and respect. To keep others from downtime and wasted manpower.<br>

Continue with your &quot;rules&quot; as you see fit. But the reputation you build with other Guilds now will follow you far into the future. My 2 cp.....<br>

You said CW in your post, that to me means Clan Werre.  Did you mean CT for Clan Twisted?  I am a bit confused as I do not recall any incidents on any Venril Sathir kills recently.<br>
<br>
If you are in the zone WITH A RAID FORCE your intents will be honored.  If you are sitting in the zone 'camping'  Venril Sathir, waiting for your raid to arrive you will most likely be waiting quite a bit longer.  One person is not going to claim a raid level mob, unless you happen to be a 65 enchanter, then maybe you can kill it, who knows.<br>

I think if you have engaged the mob and had some bad luck and wiped out you should be given plenty of time to regroup and try again and again and again if necessary.  But that's just me, others seem to think if you can't kill it the first time they have every right to come in and kill it on top of your corpses.  <br>

Out of respect, I would let whomever try as they may and go back some other time. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:helvetica;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Anezkia Devine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I get the sense that once guilds reach a certain stature they tend to find that they have more to lose by abiding by Battlefield intents than to gain.  I think it is still good in the sense that it gives open raiders a chance to plan/coordinate events.  As Meledi mentioned, many of us don't have a lot of time to play Everquest and often have to make special arrangements for certain excursions.  <br>

However, there will be times when we don’t know about events being planned. That is unfortunate, but it may happen. Most of us don’t read this section regularly and might miss intended raids.<br>
<br>
Anezkia – that is not the right thing to do and any guild that leapfrogged another like that, I think, would be very much in the wrong. If you are making attempts at something, of course we and I think most other guilds will let you try as many times as you want until you win or give up.<br>
<br>
As for Venril Saithir – to make things short – he is a FCFS creature and nearly everyone recognizes him as such – same with Phinny and Lodizal. You can’t reserve him or “intend to kill him” for a “couple days” – those reservations won’t be accepted. As long as you are there trying to kill him, others will leave you alone – but if you give up for the night, don’t expect everyone to leave him alone for you the next day. That is always how it’s been even on servers with a full-fledged reservation system.<br>
<br>
As Shabba said – one or two people in a zone shouting “X creature is camped – everyone else bugger off” isn’t going to reserve something. There needs to be a decent raid force already there and prepping for the kill. Otherwise you could send out scouts and “reserve” nearly every FCFS target in Kunark, Luclin and Velious permanently with one or two people – no big guilds will recognize this.<br>
<br>
Back on another discussion about reservations, someone put it well – that after a certain level, everything is FCFS and guilds that reach that level have to deal with the jump to FCFS. That’s not saying you don’t have to be disrespectful or play fair, but FCFS is the nature of the game past a certain point (on this server at least). Guilds must adapt to this – not try to bleed the “intent” system over and start trying to reserve stuff that has always been FCFS here. I’m all about respecting “the little guys” but if a guild gains the coordination and knowledge to take down stuff like Va’Dyn, Trakanon, Venril Saithir and Zlandicar, they are no longer “little guys”.<br>
<br>
We don’t want to beat a dead horse with this and we probably won’t bring it up again because it’s always messy to talk about FCFS versus reservations. We just wanted to let people know that most guilds won’t honor “intents” for FCFS creatures. If it’s up, kill it – if you can’t or don’t want to and someone gets there first, congratulate them. <p>Vulrath Vadrigaar<br>

You have a solid group of people with some solid classes and levels. With a little more coordination and planning, you can take down much more than you think. I stop by and visit your boards on occasion and I have played with many of you in the past and I know you are a good group of dedicated people. You have no need to post “intents” here. People will only use them against you as it was done to us when we still posted intents. Just plan your big raids internally and send out trackers every day for Targets of Opportunity – doing this will be good practice for when you are able to take down bigger things and are in contention with guilds like us, Ebon Storm, Demented, Were etc. Start perfecting a heal chain and get The Fellowship into HoT to learn the lessons there and you will be surprised at what you can do. Half of the ability to take something down is having confidence that you CAN take it down even if you have never tried.<br>
Have confidence in yourselves and your alliance – that is the real key IMHO.<br>

<br>
But in the defense of us &quot;little guys&quot;, it is often times extremely difficult to build an acceptable force to take on a high level mob such as VS, the various dragons, etc.  It often takes a few days of planning.  There is nothing worse for us of the smaller guilds than planning to attack a creature for 2 to 3 days (planning means building a large enough force to even attempt it), sending a scout on the day of the kill to verify that the target is up, and having an uber guild march in and kill the beast.<br>
<br>
Granted, we could possibly overcome this by forming alliances and such.  Nonetheless, it is disheartening when this occurs; thus the primary reasoning for posting our intents and our desires for the &quot;big guys&quot; to respect those intents regardless of FCFS.  Where is the honor in not granting that type of respect?<br>

<br>
It's always refreshing to read through a message string full of inteligent and focussed posts, intended not to ridicule but to inform and discuss.<br>
<br>
I have only recently entered into the grand arena of zone raiding in EQ as this is my first time having a character of the season to join in on these raids. As a result, I must rely on the wisdom and knowledge of others around me to guide me along the best path to achieving goals. With this in mind, I look upon these inteligent and pointed posts and I learn how things are and are not done. I am happy to have one or two points to add to this discussion, though I do not expect to change policy.<br>
<br>
In most of the raids I have attended, there is a specific target in mind. In most cases it is an epic quest NPC and is the purpose for the raid taking place. Along the path to this target as well as after the intended target has been defeated, there are often what could be considered Targets of Opportunity, some of which can be avoided (as seen in Vulrath's initial post describing CT's brief trip to Hate) and others that simply cannot (I'm thinking of the Black Reavers in CoM that are in the way of about every other epic NPC in the zone). In the zones where there are optional Targets of Opportunity, it is very easy for an &quot;Intent&quot; driven raid force to convert to a FCFS raid force who should consider the upcoming plans of the next &quot;Intent&quot; raid. Obviously it takes a given amount of time for each epic NPC to respawn and this Intent board should be refered to in such cases to ensure that one guild's week or two of advance notice and preparation are not wasted because theirs was a Target of Opportunity for another group.<br>
<br>
Vulrath, I'm saddened to hear that there are those who would use CT's posts of intention to beat &quot;the big guys&quot; to the prize. Truely there is no honor in that kind of gameplay and it detracts from the enjoyment of those who come to spend a few hours away from RL. Certainly CT has members who also need epic quest pieces and want other high level loot and should be afforded the opportunity to aquire them. Perhaps as a compromise, CT would be willing to post intentions on epic NPCs to keep the rest of us informed, and leave the high-level loot NPCs in the FCFS category. I have yet to read a reply on such a post that is anything but encouraging and informative, and an individual's persuit of their epic weapon seems to hold the interest of the entire community.<br>
<br>
Happily, Firiona Vie is a server with a relatively small population of active characters. I recall reading about the larger servers where a group would have to reserve an NPC (just the one target) a month or more in advance. In such an environment it seems that the FCFS policy would be greatly frowned upon. Here, though, we remain blissfully low in population and the FCFS policy does seem quite reasonable when combined with this Intent board. Certainly &quot;the big guys&quot; should have the option of quickly building a raiding party and hunting down a Target of Opportunity. This is the advantage of being part of such a large group. I would simply request that this message board be watched by such a group and enough time be given for the NPC to respawn for the next group intending to make an attempt. I'll use CoM for another example. If one group decides to head to CoM to take on Lord Ghiosk for a shaman in their group, but reads of the intent of another group to slay Neh'Ashiir, the first group should head in a few hours early, or even wait until a few hours have passed to give the Black Reavers enough time to respawn. Killing Black Reavers is a large part of the fun and excitement in a CoM raid, and the supply and demand for Jade Reavers is well known.<br>
<br>
Well, I've bent everyone's ear, as it were, long enough with this post. Perhaps a compromise might be made and policies changed, perhaps not. What is important is that we're all able to have as much fun as we can in the time we have to play.<br>

Aye,<br>
<br>
What I would do if I was a small guild wanting to kill a &quot;big&quot; target, would be to schedule the raid on my own message board(s), with multiple back up targets if the main place is camped or already taken or the NPC isnt up etc.<br>
<br>
The small guild would post here to invite others or announce which nights are their raid nights if they don't raid regularly and want additional support etc.<br>
<br>
By creating backup targets and sending out scouts with tracking right before the raid, they will (like so many of us already do), ensure they have some target to raid and the people/resources to take out such a mob and remove a level of expectation (which can lead to disappointment) that the creature will be up or &quot;reserved&quot; for them.<br>

<br>
a non raiding guild isnt interested in killing just 'some mob' to get the loot to enable them to do something else easier, they are interested in seeing and doign something new. Most non raiding guild minded people just wanna see and do it once and thats enough for them (will help others and go back and do it again of course but its just the seeing it once thats the main motivation)<br>
<br>
they have to plan and make allowances to make a commitment, and getting a capable force together to do that is hard enough for a big target when its a set target those making this arrangement, if you try to get the force to do all this to be able to go and 'kill something maybe' it wouldnt work<br>
<br>
which is why big targets are planned this way for non raiding guilds. <br>
NOT because they are lazy<br>
NOT because they arent capable<br>
BUT because they need the goal of seeing this mob and the time for people to arrange schedules for a set time to do so<br>
<br>
as for the this server is FCFS its not written in stone, sony didnt say its this way.<br>
<br>
any server is the way the people on it want it to be, so please dont say it IS just say what you mean, you intend to play this way...<br>
<br>
and 1 other point about the hate raid, as you said you knew we had plans (you even posted you were going up same day so we should reschedule! because you had planned for a week - to our 2 and posted 2 at that - to go up that day) so decided to go up the day before, as inny wasnt up you left most mobs up (but not all), and what if he had been?... Can you get to and kill inny without killing any of the others? evangalist in particular (sorry if you can i dont know)<br>
Sorry but i fail to see where this makes you the 'hero' you are making yourselves out to be<br>

On a server with no PVP, you have to rely on guilds to cooperate with each other so there is no conflict over raids targets.  Unfortunately, there will always be someone who will not go along with the crowd for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
Here is the most blatant example I can think of as to why a reservation system is philosophically better than FCFS.  Lets say you have two guilds.  Guild A is like Reso or FnF.  Guild B is like my guild (Winds of Destiny) or perhaps an alliance of smaller guilds (i.e. the Fellowship).  Guild A has killed Trakanon countless times.  He is no longer a challenge to them.  Guild B has never killed Trakanon.  Most members have never even been to his lair.  Guild B (or the alliance they belong to), decide to go for Trakanon the next time the server comes up for a patch.  They post their intent on this board so hopefully no one else will go after Trak.  They plan this for days and everyone is excited about the possibility of doing something new in the game.  Patch day comes and everyone in Guild B gathers to start the raid.  However, their plans are dashed when they find out Guild A killed Trak less than an hour after the server came up with a group of 6 people.  The members of Guild B are disappointed and discouraged. <br>
<br>
A FCFS system is realistically better than a reservation system because you don't have to worry about the hassle of making a reservation system work.   <br>
<br>
I've been playing EQ since the week it was released so I've seen this issue discussed countless times.  Based on these countless discussions, here is what I can tell you about reservation versus FCFS.  FCFS is the preferred system for guilds that have a large roster of folks that play during primetime.  They are not necessarily a hard core raiding guild, but they can mobilize quickly if needed.  A reservation system is preferred by guilds with a lot of casual players.  They never have a consistent number of players on at primetime.  They have to schedule raids in advance so their members can fit it into their real life schedule.<br>
<br>
A reservation system could be used on FV, if the entire community was committed to making it work.  The problem is there is little incentive for the Top10 guilds to participate.  Without their support, a reservation system is doomed to fail. <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Don't want to be considered a hero, just respectful. We got to the second floor without killing any minis but the Magi - if there was a way to get to Innoruk without killing anything else including the Evangelist we would have done it. Innoruk isn't like Cazic - he doesn't summon the zone to his aid.<br>
<br>
We could have cleared the entire zone AoE style in a few hours - but we knew about the raid the next day and chose to be respectful. We didn't need to be but we did. Judging by your scorn displayed above obviously this respect means nothing to you. If this is the case, let us know so we don't have to go through the trouble of leaving things up for you all next time.

<br>
In this raid we had attendance from people from Finland to Vancouver. Effectively that meant that our top time to do the raid was 7 to 8 hours, as sheer fatigue takes its toll.  Here is an example where without preplanning we could not have all raided together, the GMT side of the pond had to make special arrangements to be with the PST folk. We have great fun together in the Fellowship, but our reality is with the spread in levels and time zones we are not often able to gather, and must preplan.<br>
<br>
But it is encouraging to hear another say we could probably take on larger targets ... personally now that my work schedule has normalized I will be planning a few.

The chances of my getting my epic are very slim, even though it is one of the easiest to get.  I have to kill Venril Sathir and the Broken/Enraged Golem in Fear.<br>
<br>
My guild has a total of 15 members, half of which are alts.  I have to rely on a small network of friends to be able to do anything.<br>
<br>
I have my BCS, and the gnarled staff I could possibly get at some point.  But what are my chances of getting to Fear without a dedicated raiding guild/association?  Very low.<br>
<br>
And even if I could find an open raid, what are the chances the golem's not already taken?  Again, very low.<br>
<br>
I enjoy raiding.  But it's not something I want to do every day.  To me, raiding is the once-every-few-weeks event that I look forward to attending.  It's not my main focus here.  And there are many others like me.<br>
<br>
Without this Battlefield area, those of us in small, family-oriented guilds that do not focus on raiding are pretty much screwed when it comes to doing what we'd like to do.<br>
<br>
It's hard enough trying to get a group of friends and others together to do something as easy as Venril Sathir.  It's very disheartening when you can get them together and the mob with the drop you NEED is gone.<br>
<br>
So, I know how CT feels in that regard.  But I also know that without at least some cooperation from the larger guilds, some of us might as well just reroll as soon as we hit 50.  Because there's really nothing else to do. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/thewok/jarasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Epics are a status symbol, that I understand.  But if roleplaying was more of a priority to me than raiding I do not think I would even worry about my epic.<br>
<br>
Raiding is really the only reason I play this game, to see more and accomplish greater objectives.  I like the challenge and I like to push myself and my friends to do everything I can.  But even being in a raiding style guild my epic will never come before fun.  I would much rather help push a group of guild mates through trials, or kill a new boss mob that we have never dropped than to try and drag people around the place to get pieces for my epic.  If I collect it along the way, great, if not I won't really have much problem with that either.  There are much better drops in the Elementals than epics anywho.<br>

This is another thing that gets me.  I will never see the elemental planes.  So, how am I supposed to get this better equipment?  This little line is so often used to blow off the arguments of the non-raiding people.  &quot;There's better in the planes/ToV/VT/whatever.&quot;  How do I get to these places without joining a raiding guild?  I don't.<br>
<br>
Yes, the epic IS a status symbol, and that is exactly why I want it.  Jaranna's goal is to become the most powerful wizard she can.  She is a follower of Solusek Ro.  The Temple has charged her with gathering four staves that are relics of the faith.  She now has one.  She needs the other three.<br>
<br>
That is my reason for wanting the Staff of the Four.  I don;t think it's wrong or even unrealistic.  Maybe it is on this server.  I don't know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vicairedelestacia@firionavie>Vicaire Delestacia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/10/03 5:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=497.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Message to Those Posting Raid Intents</span><hr size=1> Just because you choose not to join a raiding guild in no ways means you shouldn't be trying for you epic.  I will even go so far as to say if you choose not to join a guild at all that doesn't mean you shouldn't go for you epic. <br>
<br>
In my humble opinion if you are in a raiding guild, and from what I have seen this is true, you don't even need your epic since you can aquire much better gear much more easily.  This is excepting certain classes such as clerics etc.....  <br>
<br>
For a casual player however an epic is probably the best item you might ever obtain.  Realistically, I don't ever see myself obtaining something better than the SK epic.  Additionally, there is a large amount of pride that comes with achieving your epic.  Not as a status symbol, but as a personal goal and even as a goal among a group of very close friends.  <br>
<br>
Personally I hope to achieve my epic in just such a way rather than have it given to me by a guild with no effort at all. Being in an uber guild just to obtain uber items doesn't appeal to everyone as I will personally attest.  In my humble opinion adventuring and tackling content with a group of friends will always be more satisfying.<br>

I have no idea how tough the broken golem is, though I will look it up, however it is very possible to one group fear or even solo there. The only tough part is the break but that can be handled easily enough with a decently leveled enchanter or by an FDer that runs fast enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The mobs are really very wimpy with some exceptions.  If you choose to do it this way, feel free to contact me or my wife Calarriel.  My wife and I, 61 druid and 62 SK, would be more than willing to give a hand.<br>
