<br>
With short, 5 minute skits or videos our kids are developing attention spans of equivalent length. What happened to story time where a kid could sit for an hour or so an be read to? Now a kid can't sit still for more than 5 minutes with out getting super bored.<br>
<br>
I blame this on seasame street. This program gets the kids while they're young and then music video stations as kids get older.<br>

Let me tell you, my TV broke about 6 months ago and I've been too poor to get it fixed, and I can't afford cable anyway so it's a moot point. I listen to the news on the radio in my car, so I know what's going on in the world. But let me tell you, except for stuff I've seen on friends' TVs or stillshots online, I've missed almost all the footage of the 9-11 disaster, the various presidential speeches including the State of the Union, the faces of all the people who talk on the news radio I listen to. I am now going to miss Olympic footage, too. None of this includes &quot;minor&quot; things like not knowing what the heck people are referring to when they talk about shows like &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; or &quot;Survivor III&quot;, or the latest sitcom, or the grammys/emmys/oscars. I also get to miss the History channel, anime on Cartoon Network, plus pro wrestling (which I never have time to watch anyway, so I have to hear about all of it secondhand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  <br>
<br>
TV is bad if you sit your two year old in front of it for hours a day and never talk to them about what they see. NO TV at all is bad because you can lose touch with the fact that you are just one of 275 million people in this country.<br>
<br>
TV brings this nation/world together and keeps people in touch with reality, believe it or not. Think about all the moving things you've seen on TV your whole life, then live without TV for a long period of time, and then think about how important TV really is. <br>
<br>
Oh, and about music videos: I listen to music anyway. I see no reason why I can't watch Gwen Stefani dance around at the same time.<br>
<br>
So, to summarize: TV = an inanimate object which can be used in a good way or a bad way. Like almost all inanimate objects.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 328<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/7/02 5:33:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /rant Seasame Street, music video stations</span><hr size=1> Woohoo A RANT!!

<br>
TV is not evil....its the shows, which right now seem like 80% evil.  Its not how you, the average adult is affected by TV.  Its how Americas or the Worlds youth are.  <br>
<br>
I used to watch a lot of TV as a kid and Im not obese.  So I wont even go there.<br>
<br>
What does bother me is that TV is all about shock, hurt and sex....all the things that sell are evil.<br>
<br>
TV is not a tool to educate and communate...It is a tool for advertisement and the selling of goods.<br>
<br>
Dont fool yourself.  It is not there for the good of the people.  It is there to SELL.   <br>
<br>
Now there are people who got a clue and made some shows and channels that are good to watch, good for people and educate etc....but they are few and far between the ones that do just the opposite.<br>
<br>
I think for adults I could give a rip but frankly do you want your kid 1-17 year olds watching the 80% of the BS on TV??  I dont so I monitor it and dont.  I make the choice...for my kids.  But my kids have to live in this world with all the other kids too.  How are they affected by it?  How will they interact with my kids?  Makes me think.  <br>
<br>
Just my 2cp.  But I agree communication is good....its just what you communicate.<br>

<br>
&quot;...Rosemarie Truglio, chief researcher at the PBS show's production company, the nonprofit educational Sesame Workshop, says research proves children today are &quot;expecting a story to be all together&quot; and will lose interest if that story is spread out over 45 minutes. That's a polite way of saying kids have a shorter attention span--which is why the show no longer tells one main story interrupted along the way, but several 10- to 12-minute stories in the same order each day. Truglio also notes that kids &quot;really enjoy structure and predictability.&quot; ....&quot;<br>
<br>
They acknowledge kids attentions spans are shrinking. They've been shrinking for the last two decades. They don't give any reason why Kids attention spans are shrinking but they are acknowledging it and changing their format to compensate for it (thus making the problem worse?).<br>
<br>
Something needs to be done. I understand that TV is only a tool, but it seems to me that this has become &quot;acceptable&quot; and if we don't bring attention to this nothing is going to be done. Infact, its just going to get worse, as that article shows.<br>

<br>
I dont watch it now either. I come home and play EQ or talk to my husband and cat..<br>
<br>
I think I am a happier person for not watching all that footage of 9/11 on the TV, over and over.. I saw it once and turned it off.  I also think I'm happier for not being subjected to all those commercials...<br>
<br>
If/when I have a child, the TV will NOT be constantly on. I'd encourage computer usage over TV, and good old fashioned &quot;Go outside and play!&quot;<br>

Only things worth watching are Star Trek, the weather channel, and british comedy :&gt;<br>

Just pay attention to what your kids are doing and I don't see a problem. If you really must direct do-gooder energy somewhere, put it toward improving public schools, or stopping real child abuse or neglect. <br>
<br>
It's like all the stories you hear about some parent getting mad at something their kid saw while playing EQ. You know, they might have seen something bad, but they probably shouldn't have been there anyway. Don't blame the machine. <br>

<br>
First, the format change on Sesame Street is to increase attention span, not reduce it... previously, spots on SS were from 1-2 mins in length, scattered, and nonlinear... good for CERTAIN kids, especially kids who grow up in certain urban environments... now they are going to fixed segment formats with centralized themes and story-act style presentation... all of these are LONG attention span ideas, not short.<br>
<br>
Second, there is no good data on attention span lengths. There is not really a way to measure it and frequently, ADD and ADHD (if you don't know what they are, look it up) are labels applied to kids with OTHER learning disabilities to get them in the best environment. (I could go on about this for SOME time, however suffice it to say, my wife is a special education teacher and I took several courses on the subject).<br>
<br>
Any researcher who says that they (attention spans) are getting shorter doesn't really know what he or she is talking about... its like crime statistics... REPORTED burglaries and REPORTED rapes are going up or down... but what about the NON REPORTED ones? Taking statistics like this is nearly impossible and reporting or doing research using them is irresponsible.<br>
<br>
Then, take into account some parts of cogntive theory: Different Intelligences and Favored Senses and you have a REAL problem with reporting on attention span: WHAT is the kid really paying attention to?<br>
<br>
My son can pay attention to a teacher for hours, but never look them in the eye once... he relies on auditory input for a huge majority of his learning and entertainment. But to a researcher, if he's looking around the room, he's not paying attention...<br>
<br>
So... before you wax intellectual on how bad things have gotten and how good things were when you were younger... how about you think about it first... and maybe do a little homework.<br>
<br>
Sorry to poop on your rant, but well, you published it.... <p>Nakath<BR>

Children who grow up in those environments might not GET the chance to watch 10 minutes of TV uninterrupted. So 1-2 minutes is good... because SOMETHING gets through.<br>
