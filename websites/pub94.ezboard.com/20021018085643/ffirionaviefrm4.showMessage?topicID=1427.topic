After the thread by Bumbum, I began wondering... would you petition someone for their name?  Honestly, there's no way I would, then again, I consider it a waste of time to petition people at all.    Be it KS'ing, training, or vulgarities, I just don't see myself ever bothering.  I'm more of a &quot;I don't get mad, I get even&quot; kind of guy.  <br>
<br>
Really, as far as behavior goes, the only thing I think should be petitionable would be harassment or threats.  I would never personally petition or report for either one (I've got thick skin, and I usually don't give a shit what people say or think), but I understand why someone would need to.<br>
<br>
So I guess the question is, where do you draw your petition line?<br>
<br>
Zel<br>
<br>
P.S. Yes, I realize if everyone were like me there would be no petitions, but then again, it's not as if your petitions are ever answered in a timely manner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 963<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 7:51:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1427.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why petition?</span><hr size=1> I petitioned an erudite named &quot;Iamblack&quot;<br>
<br>
I think I may have petitioned &quot;Cyberstoner&quot; although I'm not sure about that one.<br>
<br>
Mostly I just snicker about these names and send tells to all my friends so we can make fun of them together.<br>
<br>
Generally I think you're right about petitioning...it's barely helped me any.  Usually by the time they are answered the offending event transpired hours ago.  I did get some pretty fast help after someone tried repeatedly to train me, then tried to KS me, and then sent me tells threatening to kill me IRL.<br>
<br>
Basically I don't have any set guildlines.  Generally if something gets me really upset, I'll petition.  The last petition I submitted was when a surnamed character was training a number of us young halflings in Misty Thickets with mobs that were yellow to me at level 2, but I had no chance of surviving.  Somewhere about 15 mobs at a time.  He wasn't just ruining my fun, but also everyone elses, and we petitioned together.  I rerolled shortly after that.<br>
<br>
Alot of people may view petitioning as tattling to the teacher, but I feel I'd be stupid not to use the tools available to me.  Vigilantism is entertaining to read in comic books but it seems it rarely works in real life or video games. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 923<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 11:44:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1427.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I petitioned ..</span><hr size=1> .. one named Pokguy (&quot;fuck you&quot; in cantonese, iirc) and also &quot;Fallus&quot; and &quot;Tossmysalad&quot;.

Petitions are for those that can't get their body out of the wall, or have just fallen for 10k damage. I fell to my death once when I ported, took 4-5 mins for the GM to respond and offer me a rez, but I had already looted my body. Any death pre-50 isn't worth the effort of a rez. God knows how long it would take now, with all the weenies petitioning every numbnut thing that they can. Figured the GM might like to make a note of the bug.<br>
<br>
So the guy is called &quot;fuck you&quot; in gaelic, who cares, let him run around and get bored, he'll change it eventually. Stop wasting the GM's time petitioning every 10 seconds for some minor infraction of a set of rules that has been changed a half dozen times since the game went live. You guys been to test? now there are some petitionable names, and they're the Devs..lol<br>
<br>
I still get a chuckle out of all the fucktards that /tell me that they are petitioning me because they were sitting at the zoneline as I ran to it with a few mobs. These guys go out of there way to be the fricking gestapo. What are they? 14? lol. I notice most of these fucktards seem to have gravitated to Resolution lately, must be one of the criteria for getting in the guild, being a whiney, petitioning, bitchboy.<br>

I mention this time and time and time again, On the box it has an age group lable 'designed' to help parents decide what kind of content the game includes.<br>
<br>
Online games can contain any type of content because of the whole chat interface.....and there are age warnings and there is a minmum age requirement on the box.<br>
<br>
If you sent an 8yr old to buy everquest in England, they computer store would not sell it them at all, pure and simple. Because selling goods to children below the agr limit stamp is illegal, just like selling tabaco to under 16's is illegal, just like selling alcahol to under 18's is illegal....<br>

If someone wishes to create silly names, it is up to them.  I only petition KS'ing and training.  I have only petitioned once in 40 levels on this server.  I have petitioned about 4 or 5 times ever ... most of those to get me out from underneath the scarlet desert floor when Verant bugs me on zone in or somesuch!<br>
<br>
My character is called 'Baldisking'.  Many may see this as not a roleplay name .. well .. its more roleplay than 'wolffinder' or 'greyfox' etc etc.  I play two visibly Bald characters with a penchant for killing Orcs and Giants.  I often:<br>
/say I have ruined my own lands, now I am here to ruin yours!<br>
<br>
Frankly, I'm surprised the 'olde' english roleplay police have not been onto me.  We did have a guildy who was getting fed up with having surnames rejected by Verant (used, barred etc).  He had a laugh and put in 'genetalia' only for verant to accept it!  It was kind of funny but sad that the name was accepted.  Changed now, of course.<br>
<br>
Its one thing that does annoy me a little about the server in general.  I originally come from a blue server and had not roleplayed on their BUT If someone roleplays with me, I will roleplay back, but NOT in 'olde english'.  Some take this as me not roleplaying purely because I do not use 'thees and thous'.  It has been refreshing to meet players who roleplay their class and race.  Credit to 'Duncon' the iksar monk for being such a character. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 523<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 11:55:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1427.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  IMHO</span><hr size=1> Your name is not a &quot;roleplay&quot; name.

I doubt most people would classify roleplay as dialogue with &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thy&quot; thrown in everywhere, but just like you have a right to have your vision of roleplaying, they have their right to have theirs. It doesn't mean you have to like it or even pay attention to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubaldisking.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baldisking</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 1:03:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1427.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why petition?</span><hr size=1> Tzaroth, you got my point exactly ... people insist that I change my game to suit THIERS .. hence the problem.

Also, the name thing.  Well, strictly according to the rules yes, but then again I did not read all the rules when creating my first character on Saryrn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I created this char with the same name to be recognisable by others in my guild (before we got to tagged).

But the other day I ran by a guy named Patiofurniture. <br>
<br>
Hehe, the damn thing is just stuck in my conscious now, why why why? It's not like I'm going to petition or anything, I mean, if he wants to name himself Patiofurniture he can, not my business, but why? Won't stop running through my head picturing this guy sitting at the name selector and choosing...Patiofurniture. hehe<br>
