<br>
Weakness isn't in death-it is in fearing your own death and doubting yourself. When you fear death, you second guess yourself. When you do that, you doubt yourself. When you doubt yourself, you no longer have strength. You are only left with worry and fall into a spiraling descent of weakness, wanting for things such as peace and love, needing these things to cling to because you need justification.<br>
<br>
Your hold to this &quot;darkness&quot; you claim to follow, as I said, is fine. You have a need to cling to philosophy to justify your want for power and need for violence. Darkness is nothing. Light is nothing. Power is everything. Violence is the sweet nectar of power. <p><BR>

Ah, so then you believe in complete non-violent means to solve any situation. You've never raised a blade, or casted a spell, to end another being's life (or unlife, in some cases). I see, you never raise a weapon of any sort to even defend yourself.<br>
<br>
That is what violence is, and whether you choose to believe it or not, you live it. You slay creatures, you take their possessions, then you go out to find more to slay. Everyone that wanders Norrath does. Try as you might to deny it, you must kill to grow in power. If you do not, then you gain nothing and go nowhere.<br>
<br>
At some point you have used violence to serve your own purpose, and justified it in some manner. You need to do so, as all who are weak do. Otherwise, you would be admitting the truth of yourself. You would be admitting that you kill, and must kill. However you slice it, whatever icings you put on it, you are a killer. You use violence, even if it's &quot;controlled&quot; in your perceptions and justified within your philosophy.<br>
<br>
You say people make that choice. You are right, they do. The moment they leave their safe homeland and set out to explore the world they made their choice. Eventually they will resort to violence to solve a dilemma. It is inevitable. <p><b>Serci</b>, Dark Ranger on the <b>Path of Power</b>

I was only pointing out that even though you may laugh at violence, you use it. I could care less about how Shintou weaves his madness and justifies his lust for power. I also care less about what you think and/or do with his philosophy. Laugh at it all day long and make fun of it. You can laugh at the way I see things, too. I don't care. Laugh at the whole world, Kimaya, and run from it for the rest of your days.<br>

So, in order to respect and revere something, you need wield it absolute?<br>
<br>
By this reasoning, anyone that worships hate is a moron unless they hate absolutely. Hmm, anyone that worships nature is a moron unless they wield natural forces absolutely. The only reason to worship or revere <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is if you hold it undisputed in your hands.<br>
<br>
Besides, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said I worship power, I said if you insist on worshipping something. I hold power in higher regards than emotions, life and death, and the many other things people seem insistent on falling to their knees and worshipping.<br>
<br>
You seem insistent that it is something I will never obtain either, and I will only be crushed by those that hold it. So on top of knowing what I believe when I state only what is worth worshiping if you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> worship something, you can read the future as well? My my my, you should open a business to let people know their futures. You could hire gypsies to travel around and speak of your glorious powers.<br>
<br>
Saying I recklessly chase it is quite amusing as well. You know everything I do? You've watched my movements and know I chase after power without thought or planning? Are you stalking me, afraid of when I do obtain power that your philosophy will seem hollow? Maybe that is your problem, but it is not mine. Another's philosophy does not threaten me, but your words seem to dictate that yours do. Prove me wrong.<br>
<br>
Saying Kimaya knows better than thinking she will obtain power is just saying she is a weakling, which is the only thing you said that I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> agree with.<br>
<br>
Kimaya obviously doesn't care what other people say or think about her, but what other people think seem to be high on your list. That will be your downfall, if we want to start predicting the future. <p><b>Serci</b>, Dark Ranger on the <b>Path of Power</b>

Fire and fear. They are the 2 primal forces of the universe, ancient and undeniable.<br>

Solusek Ro is the embodiment of fire. Fire is the first mystery and the final mercy with the power to make and unmake worlds. Without it's primal energy all of the creations of the Bitch Queen Tunare and other godlings would wither and die. It's primal essence fuels all of creation and those who master it's powers can end it.<br>
<br>
The other primal power is fear and it is embodied by the Faceless. Fear is the most primal of emotions, and gives birth to the others. <br>
<br>
Without fear you could not hate that which is greater than you.<br>
<br>
Love cannot be experienced without the hovering shadow of fear of it's loss.<br>
<br>
One cannot fully appreciate the tranquility of peace without first knowing the fear that hardship and war brings.<br>
<br>
Those who strive to know the true nature of fear can control all of the emotions experienced by others.<br>

Serci?  The reason what I said about &quot;the circle of violence&quot; wasn't directly to do with what you were saying is simple... I wasn't talking to you.  And I think what Bakanome meant by &quot;recklessly chasing something you will never obtain, Kimaya knows better than that&quot; really is true...  I don't recklessly hound after things I'll never get.  Oh sure, I'll playfully scamper after when I find them fun, but deep down, I really do know what causes are already off the cliff before I even hafta see them jump.<br>
<br>
And that gets down to why my babbling wasn't to you.  It's not that I don't care about you, cause of course I do, but I really don't care what you hafta spout on and on and ON about.  Cause you're not rambling to try to answer anyone's question, or in hopes someone might find a bit of their own insights sparked by something you've said -- you just like to talk.<br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah, Shintou does that too, but then I've got a giggly spot for Shintou, while you and I are nothing to each other.  Since I really don't see that cause flitting its hiney back up to the cliff, I've got other bunnies to chase!<br>
<br>
You take care!<br>

&quot;will be the lioness in the jungle called Norrath. I will crush those weaker than myself. I will burn cities to the ground, and slay the gods themselves. What do I seek power for? To be strong. What will I use violence for? To show my strength, and make others tremble when my name is uttered. To have them scatter as a flock of birds when the lion roars.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not chasing absolute power, eh?  If you're going back on your own words, why should I take notice of anything else you have to say? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usercifv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SerciFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 6:00:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oooh, Half wit ninny, that's a new one!  *beam*</span><hr size=1> Never said I don't chase it.

<br>
I don't chase after it like Shintou fiends for destruction though. I don't throw myself to the nine winds without thought of consequences.<br>
<br>
Kimaya-very well, I had made an assumption. You said circle of violence, Shintou says circle of darkness, I'll just leave you two alone to enjoy each other. <p><b>Serci</b>, Dark Ranger on the <b>Path of Power</b>

Watch your back, little Ranger girl. I hope you are as Violent as you say, I'd be very disapointed to come out of a battle without some wounds, you know. <br>

But how about it. I'm sure Maladominous would enjoy using your bones for an undead pet. I'm sure he'd get a kick out of it. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A>
