I posted this for the story contest as well, but thought to share it here....<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Beren's dreams had been strange for days, filled with barely seen shadows of evil folk....and the chanting of ritual magic in the dark tongue. <br>
<br>
But then, there had been other dreams as well. Visions of the lovely Reena, cooking and singing, in the log home Beren was in reality still building in Surefall Glade for them to call home. Nothing in all the universe was so fair to his ears, his eyes, or any other of the senses. In such dreams Beren felt a great contentment. A strange feeling for a man who had ever been driven, seemingly by the will of Karana, to walk far paths and bring war upon the darkness. Surely he had served Karana well, and perhaps his service was nearing and end. Perhaps he could actually make a home with this flower of loving grace. Perhaps the long travels might be less, and he could enjoy a bit of rest, some good ale, a roast of meat, and a song and dance or three. Beren wondered aloud to himself.....&quot;contentment, who'd have flamin' thought I'd ever find that?&quot;.<br>
<br>
His toils had taken him off on lonely paths too often of late. Yet somehow on this day he was driven to ignore these other works and rejoin his Tavern mates in their adventures. Besides, he knew she would be among them, and his heart would be lighter for seeing her again. Taking up his helm and blades, he set out to join the good folk of Lux Aeternam as he so often had over the years.<br>
<br>
Strangely he felt less in strength than he thought right. Not weak, but somehow bearing a weakness. He pushed aside such thoughts, for only by skill and confidence can a warrior survive. &quot;Second thoughts are often one's last thoughts when battle comes&quot;, were words he had lived by for many years. They had stood him well.<br>
<br>
The path of the hunting party took them through the Maiden's Eye this night. Strange name for a place that reminded Beren of neither a maiden, nor an eye.<br>
<br>
As soon as he entered the Eye, all such trivial thoughts passed away, for Reena was there. They embraced and danced together on the green grass as though they were in the youth of life, as though no dangererous beat or tribal warrior was near. Just as the sun plays across the most pristine tropical seas, so did Reena's eyes glitter in the eternal light of this place. Her armor a burnished gold, hair cropped short, her wits ever sharp, and blades at the ready. Small wonder Beren found her so wonderous a creature.<br>
<br>
Soon enough the small band was ready to warm up with a bit of fighting before pushing on. In his happiness to be again among his comrades, and ready for some long missed battle, Beren of course charged off to engage some of the rather aggressive local Goranga tribals. He was not at all disappointed, as noticing him, they charged after straight away. As expected, the tribal folk were no match for the party of Luxans. This was really just a warm up. Running off to fetch more, Beren smiled to himself in thought, &quot;Here is where I am meant to be....among good folk, with battle to be fought, and the finest lass in all the world at my side....by the gods life is good!&quot;<br>
<br>
And then it happened.....<br>
<br>
Beren was coming back to the party with a tribal or two in tow, nothing to be concerned about. Suddenly his joints nearly locked up, and he stumbled. He felt a great heat, and his armor seared into his flesh with agonizing quickness. &quot;What manner of sorcery is this? These tribal's are not so strong in such magics!&quot;, thought the warrior as he struggled to his feet. Just then he wished for that furnace of heat, s a blast of bitterest cold enveloped him, searing and burning him worse even than the invisible fire had done. Teeth clenched against the pain, Beren lifted his head to seek the source of this ambush. With a great effort, he bellowed out to his comrades, &quot;We are ambushed, be wary!&quot;. Thankfully by their swift actions were the tribals engaged, and Beren could focus on the true threat at hand.<br>
<br>
He saw her then, revealed by the casting of such great and terrible spells. She was surrounded in a green nimbus, and in her hand was a curved blade with dark runes. &quot;Sulissa!&quot; Beren Roared at her, &quot;What is this? No bloody wizard in all the world this much power, it cannot be!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh but it is today&quot;, she smiled in reply, &quot;and someone greater than any that walk Norrath would have a long word with you.....an eternal word if I do not miss my guess&quot;.<br>
<br>
The exchange had given Beren time to muster what strength was left in his limbs. He raised his great halberd and made to charge Sulissa and cleave her in half....the distance was a mere forty yards. Yet in his weakened state, the charge lacked the speed, if not the fury, required to reach her in time. Her eyes wild with power, and yet still a hint of fear that he might reach her, Sulissa finished one more great incantation. Even as Beren closed, his great back swing complete, what seemed to him a great glacier smashed down onto him. In that split second he was broken, his armor shattered, his bones cracked, his skin torn away, his organs burst. Blown back by the impact, he landed like a rag doll on his back in the grass of the hillside.<br>
<br>
Beren felt no pain, and as darkness swiftly took him, he heard a voice like music. With what little breath was yet in his lungs, he returned her call......&quot;Reena&quot;. And then he fell silent.<br>
<br>
Sulissa ran to the fallen warrior swiftly and kneeled at his side. She noted with satisfaction that his armor had been blasted away, so as to leave his flesh unprotected. She worked quickly, the point of her curved blade twitching back and forth, as she carved runes of power into flesh. Satisfied, she stood. &quot;Weakened by the power of our rituals, vanquished by our strength, and now forever cast out and soulless.....goodbye Beren, may an eternity of woe be yours.&quot; With that she quickly opened a gateway to the safety of her study, and dissappeared.<br>
<br>
Valiantly did Beren's comrades gather him up and carry his body safely up the hillside. Estreya and Brunhild were among them, and they stood in well with their gods. Beren had fallen before, even if this time had been both more eerie, and spectacular. Surely their great magics could yet save him?<br>
<br>
Beren, his spirit awaiting the call back, felt a shivering cold clinging to him, and a tingling numbness. &quot;Strange&quot;, he thought to himself, &quot;Never before have I felt such sensations, even when defeated so&quot;. Even as these thoughts came to him, he was being pulled back to be again among the living. Back to his comrades.<br>
<br>
His eyes opened, and he was returned to the moon, to the Maiden's Eye. It had worked after all! Brunhild came up to him and handed him a refreshing ale. Beren reached to take it, and it fell to the ground. Brunhild looked at him perturbed, as wasting a good ale is no small offence among the chosen of Brell. Beren, suddenly with greater worries, ignored her and went to gather his belongings with grave concern. He reached out to gather his weapons and his pack, and his hands passed right through them. &quot;What manner of bloody magic is this?!?&quot;, he wondered. Stopping to look at himself, he realized he was as a ghost, and he was fast fading. In that moment, Beren Fellhand experienced something he had not felt perhaps aver before in his life.<br>
<br>
He panicked.<br>
<br>
Rising, he went to Reena and embraced her. Stumbling he passed right through her and so stood at her back. The look on her face as she turned to him was too much to bear....he could not stand to see her in pain most of all. He noticed each of them then. Each of his comrades staring at him in fear and wonder. Never had Beren been at a loss, never without a wink and a nod, even in the face of grave peril, never had he seemed so vulnerable. Moreover, they all could see straight through him now, and there was no mistaking he was naught but a formless apparition. And his fading was coming swiftly now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Help me, by the gods I do not know what to do?&quot; But even as the priestesses worked their spells, none seemed to touch him. Quickly he saw that there was nothing for it now. He was at last defeated.<br>
<br>
He stodd still for a moment, seemingly struck dumb by the cold realization. At last he shook himself and spoke. &quot;I shall be with you all, in your hearts&quot;, he said, a strange look of resignation on his face.....a look never seen in his eye before by any in this company, &quot;and Drink an ale for me now and then eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
He moved to Reena, for if these were his last moments, they would be spent most on the one who most made his life worth living. &quot;You can't go&quot;, she said through her tears, &quot;I only just found you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will never leave you love&quot;, he replied, his ghostly from melding with her, surrounding her, in some way trying to shield her from the pain even as he faded at the last. &quot;You are the strength of my heart Reena, and if I've any strength of spirit left to me, let it rest there, in your heart, where all my joys might survive me.&quot; As he spoke his own ghostly tears fell upon Reena's shoulders. Beren felt just the smallest bit warmer, somehow, standing with Reena in his midst. A sense of calm washed over him.<br>
<br>
He was all but gone now, barely able to even be seen by the tear filled eyes of comrades he had spent many years with. His voice came to them as a mere whisper on the breeze.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goodbye to you my friends, and watch for further treachery. &quot;Do not share my fate......&quot; With a last pause he continued. &quot;Take care of my dearest Reena, she will have need of your strength, for I may only be in her heart in spirit it seems, in all your hearts I may hope.....Karana make me strong enough to help her from there.....&quot;<br>
<br>
And then he was gone.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It was some time before any moved. At last Ahnna turned towards the fallen body, and moved to have a closer look.<br>
<br>
Most of the armor was cracked or blasted away, and Beren's pack lay nearby. His weapons scattered about, torn from his grasp or blown off him with his belt by the massive magical energies.<br>
<br>
The green aura that had surrounded the runes carved into him by Sulissa had faded away, and seemed dormant. Yet touching the corpse seemed unwise, so Ahnna busied herself gathering the scattered belongings. Stores of food and drink, various items of a warrior's kit, trinkets of one form or another, and deep in one of Beren's scorched packs, a small bundle.<br>
<br>
It appeared to be a package wrapped in a blue silk scarf, and tied with a bright green ribbon. A thinly beaten metal tag was tied to the ribbon, and inscribed with the following: &quot;For you on our wedding day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly and quietly she paced off the distance to Reena, and held out the small bundle. Taking it, Reena did nothing save stare at it for a while. She sat for some time, shoulders barely moving as the drops fell from her cheeks to the ground where she sat silently.<br>
<br>
At last she untied the ribbon, and unwrapped the large and deeply blue dyed silk of the scarf. Within was a small ring, forged of sturdy velium, a beautiful diamond sparkling at the center, and two small emeralds flanking it. There was a brief inscription: &quot;Reena, I pledge to you all that I am, Beren&quot;. The scarf itself was embroidered with words in a fine and glowing golden thread. <br>
<br>
It read, in the Elvish tongue: It seems so long ago now, the day I asked you to be my wife on the seas in Erudin. Never had I dreamed that a man like me, with a life such as I live, might find time for love. Yet you walk the same paths as I, and brave the same dangers, and for us neither risks more than the other. Truly a marriage of equals, if I can be said to stand equal to one of your qualities. You said to me as the sun set over the sea in Erudin that I was secretly a poet, though my tongue seemed rough. You were right of course, while I am a simple fellow, I am not unlearned. But it is ever by your inspiration that I am pushed to any such eloquence. Not in this bundle is my other wedding gift to you, a house I have built from logs in my homeland. May our hearth be ever warm for us in the night, and our house be merry for all our lives to come. Thank you my love, for making my life a greater thing than I once could have dreamed. May I prove worthy of you. ~Beren<br>
<br>
Folding the scarf carefully back into place, Reena placed it securely within her pack. Afterward, she stared off into the sky for a long while, and was silent.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melediweaver>melediweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dirges, a specialty</span><br>  Posts: 334<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/19/03 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1011.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here lies Beren Fellhand - R.I.P.</span><hr size=1> Well told and well played Beren, though I mourn the loss of a fine warrior !<br>
