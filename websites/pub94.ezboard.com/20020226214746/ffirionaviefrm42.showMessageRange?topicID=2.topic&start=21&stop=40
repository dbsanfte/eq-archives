Sorry about the delay in responding anything 'official,' but classwork and school is demanding more time of me than EQ is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway.<br>
First of all, if the two people who responding saying they wanted to join could send me an email at<br>
beeskneesplease@hotmail.com<br>
I would be ecstatic!<br>
<br>
Second of all...<br>
The people I've already talked to (being Eliezer, Antoin, and Nystul) sorry for the delay in sending another email.  I've decided on new stuff (mainly thanks to Eliezer's input) and I'll be sending an email tonight, if not tomorrow (again, I apologize for the delay, but real-life stuff is sorta taking precendent).<br>
<br>
Thirdly...<br>
About meeting in-game to discuss stuff.<br>
I'd be more than happy to... However (i believe I'm repeating myself) real-life is taking a large chunk of time away from me (classes at my school only last 10 weeks, so, although midterms are ending, finals are just beginning)....  I'd love to do an in-game discussion, however, I don't know any of our play-times.  I usually play quite late at night (last night i was the ONLY person in the Warrens... imagine...).  If we could all settle on a set time, I'd be happy, but sadly, I have no idea when my free time will be.  I'll try to post/email soon (i have quite a bit of homework for this weekend).  But i'll try to keep you all informed.<br>
<br>
Finally,<br>
I want this family to start SOON, so we can begin freakin' role-playing!  I'm getting sick of all this planning-stage stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm probably babbling,<br>
<br>
Talk to ya all later (hopefully)<br>

<br>
The other post I made just a few moments ago goes into detail on my story, but I would love to have a &quot;family&quot; to roleplay with.<br>
<br>
I am an Agnostic Erudite Magician, named Montagor.<br>
<br>
I am roleplaying a self-imposed exile from Erudin right now.  In brief, Montagor fell in love with a Heratic, brought her home to his parents, and they did not approve.  She killed herself the same night, and in bitterness, Montagor left Erudin.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of his family would eventually come looking for him... that would make for some excellent roleplay.<br>
<br>
I'm mainly on at night and in the evenings, especially very late.  I'm in America, AZ time zone. (MST.)<br>

My name is Verion Bluehawk, Philosopher of Quellious, and nephew of Geoard Bluehawk, owner of the store in Erudin (I was left with my uncle for long periods whilst my father was hunting in Velious).<br>
<br>
Working in my uncles store as a bakers assistant, and being not so bright or bold as the other young Erudites, I learnt an unusual thing for my race - humility. The other youngsters in the High city often viewed me with similar contempt as they would for humans or barbarians, and my childhood was lonely and unpleasant. However, it did make me more wise an understanding than my brethren, and I upon my coming of age my father gave instructions to the peacekeepers to train me up as one of them. I inherited some basic equiptment and set off for the warrens.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukentassolgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/12/01 1:51:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wow, lots of latenighters...</span><hr size=1> I'm amazed.

<br>
In brief, I've met Lemeth and a few others.  Montagor is from Erudin and not actually blood related to the family, but he *was* related through marriage.  Montagor fell in love with and married a heretic, only to return home with his new bride to find that his family wanted nothing to do with either of them.<br>
<br>
A noble son of a family of spellcasters by birth, Montagor found himself alone and penniless, and also without the love of his life by his side any longer.  Meralith (Montagor's wife/lover) commit suicide the night they came into Erudin.  She didn't want to take Montagor's family from him.<br>
<br>
Since Montagor's own family will have nothing to do with him, even after the tragedy, Montagor returned to Paineel where he spent some time with &quot;in-laws&quot; for lack of a better term.  An agnostic by faith, his belief in Order is quickly being shaken up... (what alignment choices do Erudite magicians get at level 10, again? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Since there has never been a funeral for Meralith, that might be an interesting event that would drag both sides of the family together.  Some of the residents of Erudin might even be looking for Montagor, since he disappeared and has not had contact with his family in months.<br>
<br>
Montagor was last seen near Qeynos, disgusted with his own people.  Rumor has it that he has taken up with a band of druids and rangers in the area, and this group works to keep the Qeynos Hills area safe for travelers.<br>

I have been neglectful of my family situation engrossed in my own studies.  Obviously this must be rectified.<br>

Does anyone in the family have a plot that would/could result in the parents being killed?

Could it be they discovered some ancient writings which were extremely dangerous?  Either they were killed to silence them, or they went adventuring to try to accomplish something (a quest which some of us might take up).  If there's interest in coming up with some story arcs involving our family, this could be an excellent opportunity (you can only kill off your parents once, generally). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uincandescent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Incandescent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/16/01 5:54:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm...</span><hr size=1> Since Meralith (Montagor's wife/lover before she commit suicide) has been gone, Montagor hasn't seen his family at all.

<br>
Anyway, Montagor is currently welcome in both Paineel and Erudin.  He could probably get both sides of the family together from an IC standpoint.  Montagor's wife, Meralith, commit suicide because of the bigotry of Montagor's non-heratic family... so now, of course, he is closer with his Paineel relatives.<br>
<br>
It might be interesting if some family members from both sides started dropping... that would be a great reason to get together.  Perhaps Meralith didn't commit suicide after all...<br>
<br>
...how much more twisted and evil might Montagor become if he thought his family actually KILLED his wife?<br>

<br>
Ammdayan is the last remaining member of the house of Gadrieldor, a Heretic family.  Actually, last member isn't technically accurate as his parents still serve as guards of Paineel.  Ammdayan couldn't point them out though, as the necromancers assign new names to everything they raise...  Anyway, the Gadrieldor family was remarkably open-minded as far as Erudites go.  They recognized that most people, even the children of light and non-Erudites, can be honorable and worthy of respect.  They treated everybody as equals, though they never actually strayed from the teachings of Cazic-Thule through fear of the Faceless.<br>
<br>
This could be why they ended up as guards of Paineel.<br>
<br>
Ammdayan, a loyal cleric of fear, embraces the views of his parents, though he will never actively help a child of light out of fear for his Lord Cazic.  Because of this, he does not trust even the friendly smiles of his own fellow Heretics, and as nobody else will trust him, his life is a constant search for friendship in a harsh world.<br>
<br>
While I can't be an actual member of your family tree, I would be glad to be adopted into the Heretic branch of the family.  Or just establish friendships with either side of the family.  Ammdayan needs friends--desperately.  I figured this would be as good a place as any to look. <p>-----<BR>
