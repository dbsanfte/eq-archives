Reply | Edit | Del All  Bravery? Or Psychosis? You decide.. (warning very long!)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Sunlight shined down through the trees, slowly permeating his consciousness. Eyes closed, Castinar sighed contentedly, remembering the journey of the previous day --- the journey that brought them home once again. Home --- after so many perilous travels. Home -- where he would once again visit the Master and report on his progress, and, if Tunare blessed him, receive further training. Well, the day wasn't going to wait on him. <br>
<br>
Slowly, Castinar opened his eyes. &quot;Belov......&quot; he broke off, suddenly. He distinctly remembered he and his Love making camp in the outdoors, un the shadow of the walls of Felwithe. But --- the walls were no longer there. Staring around in confusion, he soon pinpointed his location. Somehow, during the evening, he had returned unto the boundary between the Butcher's Block and the Faydark. Grinning sheepishly, he turned and trudge back toward Felwithe, wondering at his sudden habit of sleepwalking. Well, mayhap not habit, after all, twas the first time he could remember.<br>
<br>
Quickening his pace, he hurried toward Felwithe. It would not do for Javanna to awaken and find him gone. A private smile lit his face, as memories of previous days where he had done just that came to mind. And she suspected nothing. He hoped his effort was worth it.<br>
<br>
Approaching Felwithe, he stared in dismay. Javanna, too, had apparently awakened already, and was no longer at the campsite. Quickly, he cast about the ground, seeking signs of where she might have gone, and how long she might have been gone. But, with the passage of so many, his beloved's tracks were not to be found. A quick, simple prayer to Tunare did not reveal her presence either. Confused a bit, the ranger sat and pondered the turn of events. <br>
<br>
Presently, conversation intruded upon him. Twas idle chatter he'd heard as he travelled, but words of danger did intrude upon him and catch his attention. It appears that a new evil did walk the Commons, way away near the land of Kith's Curse and the Fallen Caves. <br>
<br>
A plea for aid came loudly. Sighing dejectedly, he pulled himself to his feet. Mayhap Javanna did go on one of her mysterious errands, much as he had done in the past. One could only hope. <br>
<br>
Checking his supplies and his accounting of coin, he decided to make a quick trip unto the Master in Kelethin and report, and hopefully, receive training. Quickly, hearing more cries for help from the lands far away, he made his way. &quot;Hopefully, the Master will see me this day&quot;, he said to himself as he hurried along.<br>
<br>
Tunare smiled upon him, for the Master was present and available. Making a quick report, the Ranger was delighted to hear that new training was available. Arming himself, the Master and the apprentice sparred for near an hour. Twas a shorter session that the young ranger was used to, but the calls for help were coming with alarming regularity, and after the Master did teach a technique of parrying a blow from an enemy, the Master did send the apprentice away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go to where the danger is, Castinar&quot;, the Master said. &quot;Protect those whom need it, for that is thine tasking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding with understanding, the ranger set forth in a hurry. Retracing his steps, the young ranger made it back to near where he had awaken, before it dawned upon him that he had neglected his supplies. Cursing his stupidity, he started back, once again, along the path home. Mentally, he cataloged the goods he needed, that he might trace the shortest route through the trees. &quot;Food. Water. Hmmm, fletching supplies --- tis a task I've long neglected. And there be few places during my travels that had such supplies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hurrying around, Castinar was startled out of his reverie by an an icy cold presence. At the same time, cries were heard within the forest --- cries of an invasion of the Living dead. Looking up, the blood drained from the ranger's face. Floathing there, cowled in the black of death, eyes glowing red, and carrying the sickle of the Reaper, was a wraith.<br>
<br>
He stood there staring at it --- for about 3 seconds. Then, he turned and fled back through the forest, screaming in terror. Looking back for a moment, the ranger tripped over a branch, tumbling him to the ground. Around him, the screams of the dead and dying floated through the forest. An alarm went out -- &quot;The children! Protect the children!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nononono...&quot;, the ranger whispered. &quot;I cannot....&quot;<br>
<br>
The Master's last words floated back to his consciousness &quot;Protect those....it is your tasking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. I...cannot...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Not the children.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gasping for breath, he got back to his feet. One step --- back toward the shouts. Sweat beaded his brow, as he took another step. And another. Another shriek of agony. Another step.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he was running again. Toward the battle. Some small part of him came to the fore --- the part of him which hurt for those who hurt. It took his fears, his very consciousness, and locked it away. For now, there was a task to do. Running back to the danger, that small part of him took stock. All around, the corpses did lie -- and most of them the corpses of children. <br>
<br>
Saddened and angered, the ranger looked around. Standing there, grinning maniacally, was a fearsome wraithe. There was but one, and it did appear, while threatening, not so that he should have trouble with it. Focusing his anger, the Ranger charged.<br>
<br>
Swinging and chopping, the ranger attacked the dread spectre. A part of him noted that his magical and non-magical weapons both did hurt the ghoulish creature, and he took small satisfaction in that. Soon, another adventurer, this one from the far of Vale of Rivers, did join the fray. Then another, an elf warrior, it appeared, and another, and another. It appeared they should make short work of this beast, that vengeance would be had.<br>
<br>
It was not to be so. The Ranger's health started to ebb, drained by the foul magics of the beast. Taking pause, and catching his breath, Castinar backed a bit, while the others did engage the beast. A few healing prayers, and some protective spells, and the ranger was ready. Clinically, he noted that, for as much damage as had been done to the Wraith, it appeared little the worse for the battle. The beast was robbing the very health of its foes and adding unto itself, healing with every blow it struck.<br>
<br>
Wailing in anger, the Ranger waded back into the fray, intent on bringing this one down. For another several minutes the battle did ensue, with little ground being gained. Twice more the Ranger disengaged to heal and rest, ere rejoining the battle. Then, suddenly, in a moment, it was gone. Castinar blinked. Eyeing the wisps of vapor in the air, his eyes tracked the movement of the beast. It had somehow removed itself, and now hovered on the lift into the city itself. Yelling in alarm, the ranger charged past the Priest of Discord to battle the beast, ere it gained access into the trees and the helpless merchants therein.<br>
<br>
A swing, then suddenly, pain. Sharp, deadly pain. From behind. Whirling, he stared in disbelief as the sword of a guard --- an Elfin guard, caught him in the throat. &quot;What...&quot; was all his mind registered, ere darkness stole over him, and his lifeforce slipped away.<br>
<br>
Sunlight shined down through the trees, slowly permeating his consciousness. Eyes closed, Castinar sighed contentedly, rembering the journey of the previous day. A soft voice, well recognized. <br>
<br>
&quot;Awaken, champion. Go forth into battle, again in my service.&quot;<br>
<br>
Opening his eyes, Castinar stared around, and memories of his battle --- his failure, crashed upon him. Memories, and a blessed voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;Castinar! Beloved -- where are thee? You do not answer, and I fear for thee! Castinar!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Javanna!&quot;, he gasped. &quot;I am here -- I am well, I think. Wherefore art thou, beloved?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am here, near the city! Beloved --- we are invaded by.....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;... Creatures beyond death&quot;, Castinar finishes. &quot;I know --- and worse, Beloved, have a care! Stay away, until I be there at thine side! There is danger, from.....&quot;<br>
<br>
A scream from Javanna cuts him off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Javanna!? Beloved?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Castinar --- the guards, they did just slay Ancaza!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Wizard -- taken as well?&quot;, Castinar groans. &quot;I should have warned thee at the first -- some foul corruption did overtake the guards....twas they whom did slay mineself as well. Stay away, keep thineself safe -- I shalt surely be there shortly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hurrying along, heart as cold as ice, Castinar did find Javanna, in the wood near the new-born lift. Hurrying to her, he gathered her in an embrace, glad to see that she, at least had survived. Surveying the scene, the ranger notes that the creatures of death have been slain or driven off. Silence has descended --- silence broken only by the moans of the injured --- the dying. Bodies lie all about the forest --- many concentrated around the lifts into the city. <br>
<br>
Eyeing the guards warily, the ranger retrieved his corpse. But they, too, seemed...back to normal... as normal as one could be in such a situation. Some of the guards gathered up --- to start a burial detail. One detail was dispatched over the hill, where the corpses of the children littered the countryside. <br>
<br>
The smell of blood and death, the sudden warmth, and the sight of the dead turned upon the ranger. He stumbled away a bit, stomach chrning, fell to his knees, and vomitted. Tears stung his eyes. &quot;Failed. I have failed. Again. Again. Again.&quot;<br>
<br>
That word kept running through his head. Again. Again.<br>
<br>
A tenative touch, and a soft, subdued voice. &quot;Beloved -- let us...go. somewhere -- anywhere -- but here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Eyes rimmed red, the mute ranger took one last look, shuddered, and nodded. Anywhere... anywhere which would not remind him of his failure.<br>
<br>
Subdued, the pair wandered away. As if in silent agreement, the two headed toward the Butcher's Block, and unto the docks. Their homeland had been profaned, death lingered there. Twas not the place to be --- twas no longer...home. Maybe another day, but not today.<br>
<br>
At the docks, they were met by another of the Court. Devun, Ranger in service to Tunare, described news within the lands. Werewolves, SeaSerpents, Undead --- hardly a land existed that was not beset. It appeared as the end of the world was upon us. <br>
<br>
But, good news he did have. Somehow, the Elder Ranger had snuck into the headquarters of the Enemy. He had obtained a map --- a map which detailed some of the attacks which even now, were underway. &quot;I am followed&quot;, he declared, &quot;and I must move on. Perhaps I can lure the enemy away from my goal.&quot;<br>
<br>
He reaches out furtively, and hands a rolled parchement to Castinar. &quot;Take this unto the Ranger Lord Morin, within Kith's Cu... Kithicor.&quot; At the mention of the cursed place, the blood drains from Castinar's face. Devun continues, oblivious to the younger ranger's grief. &quot;With this, the evil might be defeated. I will lure those who follow me, that you might complete this mission.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The fate of the world goes with thee. Deliver this, and the tide may be turned. Fail, and......&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No time&quot;, the elder Ranger says. &quot;I must put more distance between you and I. I don't want the Ghoul Lord realizing that you now have the map, and turn upon you now. Do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Castinar shakes his head vigorously. &quot;But...&quot;. It is too late, the elder Ranger has run off already.<br>
<br>
&quot;.... I can't... I don't want....&quot;. He sighs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Beloved?&quot; <br>
<br>
Javanna looks back, encouraginly. &quot;We will go, beloved. It will be safe -- I will be with you. I'll keep you safe.&quot; <br>
<br>
The ranger shakes his head, sighing. &quot;I...&quot;, he starts. &quot;If you wish, my dear. If this must be done, and if I must be the one, so be it. Though, my heart shall surely fail if... if we see even one more of those... things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some time later, the pair board a boat, heading across the Crying Ocean unto the Port of Freedom. Leaving through the West Gate, they cross unto the Commonlands, from East unto West. Even here, sounds of war are heard. A werewolf Lord cackles gleefully from somewhere in the distance, announcing a luncheon of some unknown soul. Lesser werewolves roam the lands as well, but these are easily avoided as the pair approach Kith's Curse, intent on their mission.<br>
If Devun's intelligence is correct, this map contains the key to ending the reign of terror.<br>
<br>
Turning unto the pass which led into the dread forest, the two are suddenly confronted by a pair of the werecreatures. With an almost casual swipe of its claws, the greater of the two opens a deep wound across Javanna's shoulder. Screaming in anger, the Ranger charged, waving his weapons, rather futilely, at the pair of creatures. The attack, though not lethal, nevertheless, had the intended affect --- it distracted them from his Beloved, allowing her to escape deep into the wood. Using a fighting retreat, the Ranger, too, eludes the pair and escapes to safety.<br>
<br>
Inside the wood, Castinar is happy to find his beloved still alive. Examining the wound, he shakes his head. Another inch higher, and her throat would have been ripped out. Summoning the prayer of healing to memory, the Ranger quickly heals the dread wound, expunging any taint of evil that might remain in her blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was.... frightening&quot;, he manages. &quot;I did fear you had fallen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Javanna smiles, sadly, and says &quot;And I did fear you would make a foolish stand against the two of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I, um...I did distract them in hopes you could escape.&quot; Looking down at himself, he notes &quot;And I am quite unharmed for the attempt, so all is well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around, he shivers &quot;Though it be day, this place still spooks me. Shall we deliver this, and pray Tunare it contains what it should, and escape this place?&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around, he points at the faintest of tracks which indicate one versed in travelling the woods. I do believe these will lead us where we must be. Together, the two set off, keeping near the edge of the dark wood. Here and there, daylight peeked through the trees --- a muted daylight, but one which indicated relative safetly. It would not do to be caught here at night.<br>
<br>
Finally, they broke through to a clearing, where a trio of cabins stood solidly against the backdrop of the wood. Soft voices are heard from one cabin, and a Guard stands without. <br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me, sir, I seek the Ranger Lord Morin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;State your business... Lord Morin is occupied.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have been charged with delivering this document. It is supposed to contain a map of the enemie's plans. Or so I'm told.&quot; &quot;Sir,&quot; the young ranger adds as an afterthought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, I know that Lord Morin seeks after such. That cabin.&quot; The guard indicates the cabin from which the voices come. The young ranger notes proudly that he had already known which cabin, based upon the tracks he had been following. Either the Lord Ranger was too occupied to hide his tracks well, or else the Master's comments about his ability to track were on the mark.<br>
<br>
Looking at Javanna, he takes a breath, and opens the door. All conversation ceases suddenly. Castinar takes a deep breath, looking around uncertainly. How does one address such a hero? All eyes upon him, he flushes uncertainly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fair day, my Lord, sirs. I hath come unto the as commissioned with a document upon mine body. Tis something thou'rt looking for, or so I hath been told.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lord Morin looks the young Ranger up and down. &quot;And where, pray tell, did you...obtain...such a document? Twas but one other I have assigned the task to. And you are not he.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mi..Milord, twas a brother of mine, an Elder Ranger named Devun, who didst commission unto me to bring this to thee. He didst say a thing about a Lord of Ghouls which did follow upon his trail, and he feared holding unto the document overlong, lest he be caught with the document upon his person.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Devun,&quot; the Lord mused. &quot;Aye, twas him that did seek to recover the....information. Very well, then. I shalt have the information, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young ranger rummaged through his packs, seeking the document. Not the backpack... Hmm, toolbox?<br>
<br>
&quot;Any day now, young ranger. And, for your sake, you had better not be playing at messenger --- the document had better be valid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Castinar gulped, wondering where he had placed the document, and praying that Devun had truly found aught of import. Finally, he remember, he had placed the document in a wrist pouch, where nimble fingers were less likely to... explore... during the trip through the Port of Freedom.<br>
<br>
Hurriedly, he pulled it out. &quot;Please ignore the condi....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never mind that, let me have it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Castinar cringes, but walks over and hands it to the Ranger Lord.<br>
<br>
As the Lord unrolls the parchment, Castinar catches glimpse of a map. At least part of Kith's Cur.... Kithicor, is visible --- and various markings are upon it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. See here?&quot; the Lord mutters at another. &quot;Tis as I thought --- undead from the Karana's passing through unto us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What of the Faydark?&quot; Castinar asks, then stops abruptly as all eyes turn unto him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What of it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sir, you see, this day... um... this day the Dead did walk upon the lands of My home. Our home... Um, the Faydark, that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Does the map indicate...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The map indicates the menace to this land. The menaces affecting other lands are... different. You should go seek that fight this day, else you'll have naught to fight for.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young ranger flushes and bows, ready to leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, young one,&quot; the Lord says, somewhat softer. &quot;You have done me a great service this day, and you should be rewarded.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me, Mi'lord? Nay, twas Devun who....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Twas Devun whom had gathered the intelligence, and he will be rewarded well. But it was you who did brave...many challenges...to bring this to me. I am thankful, for it may be the key I have sought after. From now on, you will be welcome here, where I might consent to train you upon various skills. But, for now, I offer thee another gift.&quot; Slowly standing, the Lord unbuckles his sword belt. &quot;Please -- take this, as a measure of my respect for your courage. May it serve you as well as it has served me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Castinar catches his breath. &quot;Nay, mi'lord -- twas not for any treasure did I deliver this. That you consent to train me is enough.....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough! I have made up my mind -- this is a gift freely given. Take it as it is meant.&quot;<br>
<br>
Castinar nods, and slowly reaches out. Half expecting the Lord to change his mind, he sighs gently as the sword is firmly in his grasp.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, unless you have other business with me, I would bid thee leave. We have...planning... to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding humbly to the Lord, and bowing to each in turn, the Ranger turns and hurries outside. There, he finds Javanna, a smile upon her face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mission accomplished?&quot;, she asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, and...&quot; he pauses, blushing slightly. &quot;And, look upon the gift he has bestowed me! Twas the very sword he did wear when I walked in upon him!&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling, the enchantress says, &quot;Of course it is, silly. Everyone recognizes the Short Sword of Morin -- it is a well known symbol.&quot; Looking the ranger up and down, she adds &quot;And you do look well able to wield it, standing there so proudly.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighs, looks around, and says &quot;And, I fear, you will soon have reason to wield it. The lands all around are beset with evil, and... well, we must be off. Our brothers and sisters have been calling from afar --- from... everywhere. Follow me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two take off through the forest again, heading further west, unto the High Passes. Pausing briefly to catch their breath, Javanna outlines the plan. A quick run unto the keep, where our soul's affinity will be changed, and then unto the the Eastern Plains. There, Saffyre and Skizex are beset upon by... evil.<br>
<br>
Nodding his understanding, the two take off at a run. The orcs that live within the eastern section are already under attack by a band of heroes, so the two slip by through the outskirts of the battle, and quickly make it to the safety of the keep. Javanna recites her incantation, and the two sigh as they feel their the length of their affinity lesson to nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis done, beloved, now let us be off to aid our friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding again, the two set off. Again, encountering no dangers, the two finish their climb through the cold mountain passes, and find themselves on the other side.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sky...&quot;, Javanna gasps.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sky&quot;, Castinar says, at the same time....&quot;it's wrong --- its...red...red as blood!&quot; He shivers, a cold dread entering his heart again. In a small place, he adds, &quot;This place -- it be like a graveyard...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, and a moment beloved. I like this place not, and I do fear....&quot; Quickly pulling out her book of charms, she flips through to a certain page. &quot;I will work this spell of unseeing upon us to hide us.... from that which is here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding his understanding, the ranger says a quick prayer to Tunare that the charm wilt take upon him. When the spell works, it is a much safer way to travel... but Tunare.... seems to think that such a charm is usually not needed. More oft than not, the Ranger finds the spell gone ere a dozen yards are travelled. Some time, it is pierced ere Javanna even casts the charm upon herself.<br>
<br>
Closing his eyes, he waits until Javanna's incantation is done. He feels not the tingling which normally indicates that she has worked the charm to allow one to see through the mystical veil, so he is much surprised to open his eyes and see not just himself, but his beloved as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, Javanna --- I think that the charm hath again failed, and not upon just mineself, but thineself as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling, she says, &quot;No, love --- it has not failed. The charm I worked does not protect from...normal creatures, but from the undead. Thou'rt fully hidden from their foul eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Un..Undead?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, silly, they do be about. Cannot you see the tracks?&quot;<br>
<br>
Casting around, he looks in dismay. Phantom knights, Ghouls. Undead Reavers. All here, very much evident.<br>
<br>
&quot;What....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know, beloved...but we must do this. Now, listen carefully. We are going to run... run all the way unto the bridge. The undead cannot cross the river, so we will find safety there.&quot; Somewhat solemnly, she adds, &quot;You are not to stop, regardless of what happens. I will not stop either. If either of us should fall, the other must...MUST... carry on. Do you understand me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You WILL. No questions, no debate. Now, do you understand me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, and knowing there is no arguing with her when she is in this mood, he says only &quot;Yes, dear.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot; She smiles fondly, &quot;No heroics, my dear. And, I am sure we will be quite safe. The charm will hide us well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding again, content that this invisibility has been useful in the past, he announces he is ready.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay --- run... now&quot;, she says, and starts off.<br>
<br>
He follows, eyes open for danger. &quot;Phantom Knight&quot;, he gasps, as an apparition appears out of the ground to the right. <br>
<br>
&quot;Keep running, we are safe&quot;, comes the reply.<br>
<br>
True to her word, they safely pass the horror. Several more are passed on the way down the hill. &quot;5...6...789...&quot; Sweat is standing on his brow, as terror grabs a hold of him again. His breath is coming in ragged breaths, part from the long run, but more from the flying fiends that are all about them.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a scream from his side. Stopping suddenly and whirling, he is confronted by Black Terror, wielding a scythe of bronze, hacking at his beloved.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, he shouts, starting to charge.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;RUN!&quot; she shouts.<br>
<br>
A step toward her, fear tearing his insides out.<br>
<br>
&quot;RUN!&quot; again --- this time with the power of magic behind it.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOO&quot;, he shouts, as his feet turn of their own accord and send him fleeing down the hill.<br>
<br>
&quot;Run to the bridge! Remember...they...cannot..cross it...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I shalt...not..make it...&quot;<br>
<br>
Gritting his teeth fiercely, he shakes off the power that had caused his flight. Turning back, he is just in time to see the enchantress fall still. <br>
<br>
&quot;Runnnn&quot;, comes a final plea.<br>
<br>
Turning and crying, cursing himself for a coward and a fool, he does just that.<br>
<br>
The world whirs by in a blur, the blood red sky filling his sight, and the mocking laughter of the fiends floating on the wind, all around him. Twisting and turning, the ranger finds himself beset at all sides.... The fiends all leer at him, the face of his beloved on each.<br>
<br>
A space, and he runs to it. Out of the ground pops his beloved Javanna, a gaping whole where her heart would be. <br>
<br>
&quot;Noooo&quot;<br>
<br>
Another turn. Another Javanna --- this one holding her head in both hands --- laughing gleefully.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOO&quot;<br>
<br>
Space. The sound of running water. Desperately, he looks for the bridge. No sign of it. Left? Right?<br>
<br>
To the right, Javanna floats to him, chanting &quot;coowwarrrdd... Fleeeeaaaa&quot;<br>
<br>
Desperatly, he wheels to the left, crying in terror.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOO. THEY HAVE TAKEN HERRRRRR&quot;<br>
<br>
Heart pounding, he plows straight through a group of spectres, ignoring their icy touch, the touch of their weapons. <br>
<br>
Gasping for breath, he barely notices as the ground beneath him changes from grass, then to dirt, then to wood.<br>
<br>
He continues to run, until he collapses, whimpering in terror.<br>
<br>
A soft touch -- he cringes away from.<br>
<br>
A whisper. &quot;Beloved.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What...&quot; scrambling away, images of her in death in his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shush --- it is okay. I have returned unto thee.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ja..Javanna? Is...is it really you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, beloved. It is I. I had feared... I had feared you would do something foolish. Had you done so, I would be most wroth with thee.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Foolish. Aye, I did. I watched as you were hacked down --- worse, I allowed the beast to come upon us unaware. Twas just like this morn---if'n I'd not frozen, then fled like a coward, thee, and the children, might have been saved. I have failed thee... I have failed Tunare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shush, my foolish noble ranger. Twas naught you could have done --- they did pierce the veil of invisiblity that surrounded me. Twas not thine fault. And, I am here, at thine side again, am I not?&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling wistfully, he just nods. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now then, we must aid our brother and sister in the fight. They do be just across the bridge.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ranger looks around, finally realizing that somehow his feet did take him to safety. Shivering, he looks back upon the eastern plains, where the battle continued. &quot;I cannot...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You must, beloved. Skizex and Saffyre do count upon us, for they cannot survive upon their own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I..&quot; He looks down at the ground. &quot;They have no use of a coward. I would likely desert them and leave them in deadly peril.&quot;<br>
<br>
Javanna persists, &quot;They already are in deadly peril, beloved. And...you can do this thing. You must. For them.&quot; She looks closely at him. &quot;For me.&quot;<br>
<br>
A small sigh escapes him. &quot;For my friends. For you. Aye, I must.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come along then. With more of us about, we will be safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
A nod.<br>
<br>
The two make their way back across the bridge, where they meet the Paladin and Ranger, recovering from their wounds, a grim look upon their faces. &quot;Castinar. Javanna. We are glad you have made it. The battle is been hard, but with your help, we should withstand. Let us move off the road a ways, though, as it does appear to be a thoroughfare for evil this day. We will do better picking them off singly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Together, the four make their way to a grassy knoll, marked by a single tree. Skizex then trots off, in search of prey. Each time, he comes back trailed by a creature of night -- and each time, it falls to the combined might of the weapons and spells of the group.<br>
<br>
The younger ranger, wielding his new sword, starts to realize that the battle might be won. The terror still grips him, but in the presence of these friends, he realizes that these creatures, though fearsome of appearance and terrible in their evil, can be felled. The terror, at one time crippling, starts to recede.<br>
<br>
Then, disaster strikes. Skizex is again on the prowl, and announces that he has found a Phantom Knight. Standing up from where they did rest, the three watch as the form of Skizex approaches. Sure enough, upon his tail is a dread knight. But suddenly, the one becomes three, and the mighty ranger is hit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Run, he yells&quot;, and for once, none, not even Castinar, questions him. Together, they set for the bridge, and the safety of the water. Skizex, already running, gets to the bridge first. He crosses into safety.<br>
<br>
Castinar quickly realizes he is slightly ahead of the others, and glances back over his shoulder. The three are being chased, but all are well, and ahead of the pursuing nightmares. They will make it. His sets foot on the bridge. A scream. Time slows to a crawl. Turning, he identifies the source of the scream. Terror wells up in him again. &quot;Javanna! Run --- they'rt upon thee!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Run. Run. Run. Ru............&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot; <br>
<br>
Her broken body, once again lying lifeless not a dozen steps from me --- not two dozen from safety.<br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot;<br>
<br>
Weapons bared, he turns to confront the beasts --- but they are many --- to many, and he is forced back across the bridge.<br>
<br>
Once again, he collapses in a heap, crying brokenly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cast?&quot;, says Skizex<br>
<br>
&quot;Javanna's...gone. Taken from my side. again.&quot; Castinar suddenly looks up, irrational anger flashing through him. He stands. &quot;It was.....&quot;, suddenly he realizes what he is about to do, and stops. Not his fault. Not his fault. Not his fault. He recites that as a mantra. Oddly, it calms him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not his fault. Not his fault.&quot; The terror subsides. &quot;Not his fault. Not his fault.&quot; The anger changes --- subtly altered. &quot;Not his fault. Their fault. All their fault.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young ranger looks up, an icy calm about him. &quot;Let us return&quot;, he announces. A new strength in his voice. &quot;This must be stopped. Here. Now.&quot; <br>
<br>
Turning, he stalks across the bridge. Shrugging at each other, the other two join him. <br>
<br>
Upon the end of the bridge, he gently picks up the body of his fallen love. He carries it up the riverbank, and gently sets it beside the tree. Mayhap his love will somehow return again. If so, he will keep her body and belongings safe.<br>
<br>
Looking at Skizex, he announces &quot;I am ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
Skizex looks back intently. He meets the icy stare of the younger Castinar, knowing there are no words he can use. Shrugging, he sets off again. Soon, the undead are about once again. The bodies pile up. Ghouls. Knights. Pawns. Each one, the young ranger wades into, almost with glee. Shouting battle cries, and cursing the creatures which beset them, even mocking the voice of the one whom claimed responsibility, he waged a private holy war. <br>
<br>
In a sudden lull, he looked around. He was drenched in sweat, and his muscles ached from the fight. Sometime during the battle, it seemed his beloved had returned. Rushing to her side, he pulled her into an embrace. &quot;Beloved...thou'rt restored to me. I... I saw thee fall... and...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shush, beloved. I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two stand together, each holding the other, until Skize breaks in. &quot;Castinar --- you go on the hunt now.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young ranger looks up and agrees --- eagerly. &quot;I shall do so, my friends. The battles this day will be glorious ones.&quot; <br>
<br>
He sets off, following the tracks to the biggest concentration of Undead beasts he can find. &quot;Aha... there are some..4..5..6. Perfect&quot;<br>
<br>
A voice floats behind him &quot;Be careful, beloved.&quot;<br>
<br>
A pause. &quot;Javanna&quot;, he whispers. Regretfully, he looks at the group, then decides that it would be foolhardy to attack them --- foolhardy to risk his beloved again. Revenge will come another time --- another way.<br>
<br>
Sighing, he casts about and finds the tracks of a solitary creature. Setting off, he tracks it to the hillside, where it tormented the shopkeepers with its wailing. Setting arrow to bow, he fires, then sets off at a run back to the group. A quick fight. One more down. Sets off again, and finds another. A short fight. One more down. Sets off again.<br>
<br>
Eventually, he sets off, but there are no more undead to be found. A further search shows the entire plains cleansed of the disease. Trotting back, he makes the announcement, then collapses. <br>
<br>
Raising himself, he congratulates all. Their work, it seems, is done this day.<br>
