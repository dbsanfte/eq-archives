EQ The SoV is an expantion pack for the world-renowned Massively ... Online Game..<br><br>Oh Dear lord no.<br>It doesn't say Roleplaying. It doesnt say Roleplaying..<br>WHAT THE HELL..<br><br>It doesn't say Roleplaying.<br><br>It doesn't say Roleplaying.<br><br>Why doesn't it say roleplaying.. my OriginalArgument is hammered.<br>Looks like I'm the one that got owned on the Factor.<br><br>Even Verant has given up on us. Us the lost Children of Roleplaying.<br><br>The Opressive Powergamers have driven us into a Corner. They have taken from us what was ours, beat us into a corner. Destroyed our homeworld, raped and piullaged our land, backhanded our kid, knocked our team out the playoffs, badly dubbed anime, and hung us out to dry.<br><br>Why doesn't it say Roleplaying in Velious? I fully expected it to as I typed in the words. But it doesnt.<br><br>Just now, I remembered something that the Small tightknit Roleplaying community on Innoruuk said.<br><br>They said, with the Release of Kunark, Roleplaying began to Fade in favor for Uberisum and Powergaming.<br><br>I see it more clearly then I have ever seen it in my entire time playing Everquest.<br><br>They come, in shades begging for Equality, crying words of Racium and Biggotry, crying of Intolerance..<br><br>While, with their conversionary methods, and their way of Uberisum, they have taken the Rug right out from under the Roleplayers Legs, Beat his children infront of his face, pillaged and raped his land, and destroyed all that he holds dear.<br>In short, we are the Oppressed Few.<br><br>We are the pilgrums, who were oppressed because we were not allowed to pratice our religion.<br><br>We didn't leave our land because we wanted to.<br><br>We left our land because we had to.<br><br>We had to survive.<br><br>We had to live on.<br><br>We are the Oppressed Roleplayers. Oppressed by the Powergamers.<br>The Man. The Powergaming Man holds us down.<br>And soon, the Powergaming man will snuff us out.<br><br>The Roleplayer cannot escape the Powergaming man. He is too strong. His draw is too powerful. Those that do not assimilate into the Powergaming man's fold are overwhelemed and Destroyed.<br><br>I stood out infront of the Powergaming man, and I said, in a loud boustious voice.<br><br>'FUCK YOU~!'<br><br>And I was destroyed. My land was taken from me. My Sheep were eaten. I was booted from my land.<br><br>Then I saw a glimmer of Light.<br><br>Faint that it was, i still saw that Glimmer of Light.<br><br>Thank you Jaxy for providing that Glimmer of Light.<br>And I followed it.<br><br>And It lead me here.<br><br>To the promised Land.<br>The Promised Land of the Roleplayer.<br><br>We didn't have to worry about the Oppressive force of the Powergaming Man, for we were free from his Trynarry. I got new Sheep. I had new land that I could cultivate and grow fresh Beets from. I could finally have my Corn, I could raise some Chickens and fry them up. I love fried Chicken.<br><br>But the Powergaming man.. he is bored. He has no more Roleplayers to oppress. His Loot, his attude, his power means nothing if he cannot use it to dominate another.<br><br>If everyone is Uber, who will look up to him?<br><br>That glimmer of Light has brought the face of the Powergaming man to us here as well.<br><br>He stands up, bearing fangs and mighty claws.<br><br>And once again, he is raping our land. He has killed my chickens.<br>Now I can't fry them up. I was looking foward to my fried chicken :_:<br><br>His Roar is Monsterous. His eyes, bloodshot red. Even his Roar makes Innoruuk Tremble and fall to his knees in death.<br><br>His alligance is to no one. No one but hisself and his Greed. His Pride.<br><br>This Monster can appear in ths most demonic form..<br><br>Or he can be small. Cute. Cunning. A Handsome Man, Poor, crying out..<br>Crying out the words of Intolerance, Biggoty, and Racism.<br><br>WHERE THE FUCK WHAS YOUR TOLERANCE OF ME ON INNORUUK, YOU POWERGAMING SON OF A BITCH! WHERE!?<br><br>I have no sympathy for them. I shed no tear for you, Mr. Powergaming Man.<br><br>I have seen your horrors. I have felt the pain of your blade against my chest.<br><br>I have no sympathy. None at all.<br><br>I have seen you burn down our houses. I have seen you destroy our land. I have seen you beat and or turn our children into your minions.<br><br>I have no sympathy.

Not bad at all, for a dark elf.  <br><br>Oh, come on! people....this is a rant board...let the man speak his mind.  People says he is a bigot, he has no tolerance, a nazi, and some even go as far as saying he is a racist.  Well, blade cuts both ways.  He call some of you powergamers, and he gets branded as an intolerant racist bigot nazi.  *shrug*  looks like both sides gets a stab at each other.<br><br>And Shintou....I understand your desire to keep the server as RP-pure as possible.  Trust me, coming from 6+ years of text based mud which is RP enforced (did I mention ppl can be deleted for inproper name?), i know exactly how you feel.  But EQ isn't any sort of traditional RP games.  ANYBODY can cough up the $10 monthly and can play at any server they want to.  You just gotta accept that this is by no means a perfect world, and work with what you got.   A milder tone of suggestion might work out better in the end. <br><br>RP or non-RP...FV is the only server I would ever chose to play.  I did not pay my $10 a month to hear people shouting &quot;reding 8!!!&quot; across the zone and basks in the glory that is him.  I did not pay $10 to be put on a waiting list to fight the orcs at Highpass.  I did not pay $10 to enter Crushbone only to find the zone is filled with lvl 30+ camping the warlord/trainer/emperor crush to farm items.  I did not pay my $10 to see Trolls, Ogres, dwarves, wood elves all grouped together in some happy little family way.<br><br>I came to FV for so many reasons that I cannot list them all here.  But I do know that my experience here in FV is the BEST i've ever had in EQ - great people (Rp'ers AND non-Rp'ers), friendly atmosphere (cept when Scratchy beat fanatically on my head <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), an entirely too hilarious guild that I belong to, least amount of unpleasent experience, and last but not least Roleplaying is actually accepted here (don't give me that &quot;oh, i RP and I was never harassed by powergamers when i was in other server&quot;, you have to be told &quot;d00d! wtf is that j00 trying to d0? get the F*** out of my group&quot; to know how Shintou has felt).<br><br>This is our server, I have the utmost respect for anybody who can hang on to FV.  As we all know, with TLC bugs, grouping restriants, language barriers, the general RP v.s Non-RP wars, FV is not really the easiest server to play on.  <br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukarlithas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlithas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/17/02 10:34:33 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caparelli>caparelli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 10:16:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The No Spin Zone (TM)</span><hr size=1> you have problems dude, go play another game since everquest obviously brings out too much rage in you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 10:24:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The No Spin Zone (TM)</span><hr size=1> Hell-of-a-rant eheh<br><br>Karl is right.
