Try again.  We can't touch a Rogue, even using Trueshot.  <br>
<br>
I'm just thinking that this is an &quot;overfix&quot; when there are simpler ways to improve pure melee, without intruding on Hybrids abilities.  I think the /disc changes are fantastic, it's going to be great for a Warrior to use their riposte /disc, followed by Defensive.<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Talastius for the most part as well.  It wouldn't be right for Hybrids to get Defensive, or other Warrior disciplines.  In the same light, it just doesn't seem fair for melee to get a load of Hybrid abilities.  Monks are getting a lull...honestly...<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am concerned a tad bit, but not having the same type of reaction as some members on The Rangers Glade.  I was just wondering if other class boards were showing similar concerns.<br>

You get snare, root, dots, nukes, archery, melee, harmony, and fear animal which allows you to solo. If you dont like the class reroll to a rogue and see how you like playing a pure melee. <p>Toxox<br>

So, if these silly aspects of the changes go live (Monk lull, Rogue snare, etc..), where is the tradeoff?<br>

Some feel this is going to hurt Shadowknights.  Some feel Warriors deserve this.  I'm not yet really decided, since I haven't seen this in action.  I mean, this is Sony we're talking about.  Chances are, they'll screw this up and Warriors will get even less aggro than before.<br>
<br>
Rabbitsmasher, are Paladins/Shadowknights able to do more damage than Warriors?  The information from Rangers Glade doesn't agree.<br>

Worst case scenario, I, as a Shadowknight, will become &quot;back-up&quot; tank.  I will wait with LFG up, begging for groups but getting turned down by even the most desperate of them.<br>
<br>
&quot;We need a REAL tank,&quot; they'll say.  &quot;Someone who can actually take damage!&quot;  And then a warrior will walk up in Validus Custodus Plate and wow them with his Centi Shortsword, stealing MY GROUP.<br>
<br>
Sure, my true friends will still group with me until they're tired of rezzing me and hearing me complain about how I should be able to do my job and take more than three hits at one time.  At that point, I'll probably stage a protest in PoK with all my other Ain't-Got-No-Group friends.<br>

Absolutely no buffs.<br>
<br>
Now, you might think, &quot;well, every melee can get exactly the same buffs making the DPS gap % similar&quot;, which is true to an extent. However, this parse was done on, pay attention, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the class on its own and it's benefits without outside help.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Which means, biased to the bone. I've seen many, many, many parses which show, fully buffed, that a ranger has outdamaged a monk, rogue, and warrior. <br>
<br>
Why wasn't the ranger allowed to self ATK buff? It *IS* part of his class, just because the warrior can't self buff doesn't mean squat.<br>
<br>
The monk was at 46% haste while the others were at 41% haste (I believe rogue was also at 46%, but I'm not positive on that as I am about the monk), so no shit the monk will parse higher. This was done over a 13 hour span.<br>
<br>
Back to self buffing, as a ranger you KNOW how much our eagle eye spell improves archery. It's very noticeable. That's something only we can do, and it's built into our class. The fact that the ranger wasn't allowed to add this buff to himself as well as others goes to show this particular parse is invalid. If I warrior had a self buff that allowed him to increase his hit %, you know he would be pissed if they didn't let him use it.<br>
<br>
All in all, that test is inconclusive and shouldn't even be used. Those numbers don't apply to ANY actual situations, because no ranger in his right mind would go into a fight with no self buffs, period.<br>
<br>
Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we as rangers have the highest ATK cap, because of our self buffs and GoTF AA's. <br>
<br>
Let me end with this, I could care less if they totally neglect our class on these changes. I'm fine with how we are now. However, let me go ahead and say right now that SoE WILL eventually give hybrids some more disciplines/abilities through tomes. Maybe not on launch day, but over time they'll squeeze some in there.... to &quot;rebalance&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yea, I think that Warriors should get a good aggro skill higher up. For anything but raids, SKs and Pallys kill warriors. They're insta-aggro, and fair HP make them better for small battles. I dont think Warriors should get a aggro skill till they're 60s, but at SOMETIME they should get one. But as far as DPS is concerned, I dont mind a bit. With EQ, we're like a crappy wizard with infinate mana and sometimes longer range! ROFL I do think there should be more class specific help, not just &quot;melee&quot; help.

<br>
If the &quot;lull&quot; they are giving monks works as well as the &quot;fear&quot; they have had for a long time then I don't think it will unbalance the game.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is a curiously FV kind of rant. On a normal server with 8 chars per account it might just mean changing the amount you play different alts.<br>
<br>
If it fixes a situation where warriors at lower levels (before they can afford EB weapons etc) can hold aggro then as a ranger I have no problem with it. Being accused of &quot;stealing aggro&quot; when you are casting no spells, using slow weapons and just happen to cast a snare with the mob on 20% is annoying. If the warrior can't get aggro by that point he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>needs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xerriklizard>XerrikLizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Will bite you for 1pp</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/03 4:20 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/xerrik/xerrik.gif width=125 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Are other Hybrid classes as riled up about this?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> aken from the Rangers Glade:<br>

We rangers have had it good for a long while, and we'll still have it good after these changes take effect. I'm glad the pure melees will be stronger. Now they might actually be able to keep you alive long enough to get xp. Stronger melee ATK means less stress on us to kill shit. *Hint Hint* That's a GOOD thing guido.<br>
<br>
Besides, that DPS chart you put up is unrealistic. Those are all elite weapons and hell, I easily do over 111 DPS now with my eyes closed, and I don't even have the best bow in the game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Lose that Nightmarewood bow you got, do some real dmg, and then make a case.

You can go ahead though and sit around with your thumb up your ass if ya want, that's your perogative. Me? I'll still be chain pullin big uglies, kickin ass, and takin names. Peace.<br>

BTW, don't fuck with the Great Divide Scion. She don't play around, and neither do I. Step back and let the real rangers do the talkin. Jealousy of other melees aint in the job description.

Most are dependent on random openings that appear once or twice a combat, and their effects last for just one or two ticks.   <br>
<br>
Class imbalance really affects tank classes more than any others.  All dps classes, whether melee or hybrid, stack: i.e. a rogue AND a ranger is always better for a group than just a rogue alone.  Tanking classes are another matter.  A second tank in a group is a waste of buffs.  Consequently, balance between SK's, Paladins, and Warriors is essential for fair game play.  <br>
