All hail Cata.</span><hr size=1> Hrm well, without slandering anyone else, here's just some bits of reality for you Tonkins.<br>
<br>
Sure, I will accept that you have been here for over a year as whoever, assumingly not Tonkins as some of us have in fact tripped over you in game and know what level you are. Unless maybe you are just still in your teens because you've been so busy cybering *shrug*<br>
<br>
However... if you really wanted some sort of interaction with the people here, on this board, in game, at all, seeing as most of your larger and more respected guilds are represented here, well... dude you kinda fucked it up pretty good.<br>
<br>
So either you're going to be able to find one of the other smaller blue guilds that are springing up everywhere who dont care about this kind of stuff and who's members don't read the boards, or you'll be the uber solo guy for the rest of eternity.<br>
<br>
Either way, if you were looking to actually interract in some way with the folks here, rerolling might be your best bet at this point. If there is one thing that can be said about the quality of people on this board, its that they have very, very good memories...<br>
<br>
Just some input.<br>
<br>
And just some realizations. I, yes moi, am a RP Nazi. I will always RP. I will always be IC. I will not speak to paleskins unless I see the words &lt;Ebon Storm&gt; after their name, or similiar respectable traits. I am one of the first people to rant and rave at the lack of RP in the newbies arriving on this server. I tend to bitch loudly about the drooling male Teir'dal showing up all over Neriak. I still petition names. But dude... you proved that wow, it really can get worse. Some people know who I am, playerwise. Listening to you mouth off? Yeah, suddenly I forgave a lot of the little dinks who've appeared in the last few months because well hell, even if they were little blue drooling wood elf wannabes, they were at least doing something remotely less offensive. The level to which some people can sink still utterly amazes me. This is a game. I try to play the game and enjoy myself, and not ruin other people's days. I hope that now and then maybe someone gets a kick outta me. But just the lengths that some folks go to to outright upset other people just... floors me. Congrats dude.<br>

and you said in an above post that you thought that was the end of it...<br>
BUT then you said &quot;wanna gang GB (J/K)&quot; ...<br>
<br>
You are the type of person that makes every single real female player cringe and hide and pretend they are male!<br>
<br>
I play a male AND a female character.. what does that make me? A crossdresser? :-P  If you asked me, I'd say a guy.  If you asked more, I'd say a gay guy, and proceed to hit on YOU.  Turn about is fair play... <br>
<br>
Cata TRIED to get you to lay off, repeatedly, using many of the same tactics I would. It gets soooooo old when guys hit on pixels that happen to have boobs.  Trust me, create a female wood or dark elf, stay in the bikini clothing, and count the number of innuendos you get within the first 10 levels.  <br>
<br>
Some guys are more persistent than others. But I tell you, saying something as offensive as you did, following it up with a &quot;just kidding&quot; doesn't fix it. If you dont mean it, DONT SAY IT. Especially in a chat room open to the public for crying out loud. YES these boards are moderated for a reason... and YES you have to watch your language. When the other players tell you to moderate it, then DO it. No excuses, no saying &quot;I had a bad day&quot; next day.. it's kinda like having a bad day at work and then taking it out on your family when you get home.. it's a no no.<br>
<br>
(The worst kinds are the ones where you try desperately to get them to stop, and type something like &quot;kicks your ass out the room&quot; and the person replies with &quot;dodges the kick and traps you and proceeds to kiss you&quot;.  To give you credit, you didn't go that far.  That's type of action makes my character feel violated. Yes, it's just a game, but making my character do something that I as the player dont want to do, is wrong too.)<br>
<br>
Jaehun, talk to me in game if you would.<br>

An amazing feature of message boards is that people will try a bit of revisionist history on what has been said when everyone is only one click away from seeing it again firsthand.<br>
<br>
Another nice feature is that there is always somebody who will agree with everybody.<br>
<br>
As to why Tzaroth didn't flame him.  He was dual boxing the chat room and Tokin is his alt. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.irexes.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/dactylos/irexes-iksar.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rubisthenome>Rubis the Nome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 3:32:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1968.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: :)</span><hr size=1> I HONESTLY tried to explain to Tokins last night what people were mad about and he wen't all out about me trying to say that him saying the word &quot;fuck&quot; was the problem.  Now, I had never mentioned the word fuck and honestly I don't mind him saying the word over and over because its just what some people say when they can't emphasise what they say in a more productive manner.  I was trying to show him why it was that people could take what he says and how he talks as being offenseive, especially to women and also thought he had something hinting towards racism later in the late night talks last night.  Anyhow, I was blown off by him rather quickly and he tried to retort even but following my replies to it he just continued to say fuck.<br>
<br>
So of course I did what anyone would do, sat there listening to him make an ass of himself because about every 5 mins I would bust out with laughter.  Of course, it was 2:30 in the morning so that probably had just as much to do with it as anything. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373025">Rubis<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/sigs/rubissig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaehunleifong>Jaehun Leifong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Of the Blue Duck Style

Some things you get a couple chances to learn before someone classifies you as a fumducker like sitting up on the walls of Hate. Other things you get no chances on. No &quot;freebies&quot;. No, &quot;oops, messed up by insulting half the server, hey I just learned not to do that, forgive me, k?&quot; Usually if you would treat me like that, you'd have to go through a lot to make me think you are other than a complete asshole.<br>

As a general rule if you want to know if something is non-offensive here, just imagine saying it to your mom over dinner. &quot;Yo, bitch, I'm starvin - got the munchies from smokin all that weed - what's cookin'? Wheeeu, that be stank! Smell like when I smoked up last week and went and ate a whole bottle of fish food and shat dat out. Yo, yo, wazzup sis, you look dope. If you weren't my sis, it tap dat ass like *BAP*. Don't like my language ma, well Fuck off or I'll give ya a mushroom stamp on yer forehead you stank ass bitch!&quot; Now how do you think mom is going to like that?<br>
<br>
Ah well, you don't care anyways, just sit back in front of your comp screen safe and secure with your Backstreet Boys posters surrounding you comforting you or go watch Friday a few more times Smokey.<br>

Just have to say I do not regard anyone in this entire tirade at all , I think they are pretty much the bottom rung of humanity in my eyes at the moment , and my view on humanity being loose...well umm..I'm pretty sure that the person playing Tokins isn't a super genius Guinea pig or something?  <br>

This thread must have single-handedly popularized the chat room.<br>

I've just got to go see if there is some other train wreck in progress.<br>

P.S.  My opinion on this?  Yes, this was a pretty brutal backlash against Tokins.  Then again, it's a lot better than getting the hell beaten out of him in some back alley, which is very likely the RL response he would have gotten if he was bothering some poor girl like that.  It is just a game, after all.  He can turn off the computer, he can reroll, he can find a new game.  Better the lessons are learned here (and I hope they are learned) because RL consequences are a lot more lasting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oligith>Oligith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 4:59:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1968.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/10869.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: :)</span><hr size=1> It is true that he made not one, not two not even many mistakes, he made so many that it is revolting, but even then, we could show the kid some mercy.

But seriously, to be branded for some foolish mistakes made in our youth.... Heck, most of us would have *bap* pasted on our foreheads or something like it! <br>
<br>
You have all had your laughs, and now it is time to let him alone so he can learn from his mistakes. He will not learn in anger or any strong emotion. It is only in calm thought that anyone can truly change. <br>
<br>
Or at least that is my opinion.

Hes roleplaying a weed smoking drug dealing dwarven rogue.  All fine and good until you realise that drugs and weed haven't ever existed in everyone else's FV server.  No one has ever used half the language he does in their roleplay before.  Sure, it fits in well in Anarchy Online but here it just doesn't fit into the general server roleplay genre at all.  If 2 characters get married they generally have *something* in common, but there was none here.  Cata would end up following him around and shooting fireballs to light his weed and thats not in her character at all, except for the shooting fire part.  Personally I don't see how the Tokins character can fit into the FV community very well witht he roleplay that he does.  Maybe its just me though.  If we can have dark elven dread gnome pirates then can we have weed smoking dwarves that sell shrooms and go around uhm *bapping* people?  Personally when he says stuff like &quot;I will smack that shit like *bap*&quot; it says something to me that would honestly never fit into my roleplay at all.  Oh well, time to let it die I guess. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373025">Rubis<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/sigs/rubissig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enedlithien>Enedlithien</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shadow-striders.com/images/wolfIcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elle est trés jolie</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 5:32:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1968.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cpinternet.com/~theduke/MythStuff/ez-tres.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: :)</span><hr size=1> Just when you thought you've heard every pick-up line...<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am pretty good at fishing maybe we could go fishing and I could catch you a fish or something<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Enedlithien</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
