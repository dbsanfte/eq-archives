<br>
I've played this game for quite some time now and I've been known as over 15 names.  So I could absolutely care less if I had to change this one, and that would hold for any of my other names.  In my mind it is far, far better than running around as &quot;Smegma&quot; to a large subset of players!  That's one scarlet letter I'd rather not have on my head, thank you.<br>
<br>
By the way, Smegma and Stumpy are in no way comparible.  Nor are the comparisons to Gay, Dick, or Randy (and yes, in the US we know what Randy means also).<br>
<br>
Smegma: the cheesy sebaceous matter that collects between the glans penis and the foreskin or around the clitoris and labia minora.  (Thanks Mirriam Webster!)Colloqually known as &quot;smeg&quot;<br>
<br>
Stumpy: A nickname, that is not politically correct for someone who has a wooden appendage.<br>
<br>
And you are telling me that &quot;Toodumbtorun&quot; is somehow more petitionable?  OK... And I'm sure that the Erudite I saw running around the other day named &quot;Bignigdik&quot; is peachy also, because for all I know it means &quot;beautiful day&quot; in Swahili and who am I to spoil his fun...  <br>
<br>
Honestly now folks, it seems a bit silly to blast people who petition names; everyone is equally entitled by the $13 to their fun, whether it is running around as ninja turtles on a RP server, or whether it is roleplaying an evil drow out for world domination.  That's why there are GMs, to mediate, and see whether things are in violation of the policies of the game.<br>
<br>
As for Verant's actual level of risk in this situation, that doesn't matter.  It was high enough that they made a naming policy to prevent usage of trademarked name.  The policy is what it is, and as you said yourself Jens, they knew it, they ran the risk, and I'm sure they will still have fun with their new names. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kloevis>Kloevis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/5/02 1:07:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=502.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.cci.clarku.edu/ebarry/pix.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I wouldn't care</span><hr size=1> This all boils down to one thing.<br>
Some fucking asshole having problems with someone else's harmless fun.<br>
That simple.<br>
<br>
RP_Nazi_01 petitions because he can't deal with *gasp* something that might remind him of reality, whines like a child- tattles.<br>
<br>
GM/Guide/whatever (possibly of the same vein of said RPN) decides:<br>
1. RPN01 has a point<br>
2. RPN01 has a point, and is a RPN himself, so acts on this.<br>
3. doesn't want to listen to piece of shit gutless RPN01, and does what he suggests to shut him the hell up because RPN01 has been whining.<br>
<br>
cut. dry. plain. simple.<br>
<br>
I think every dipshit who petitions a name should have a <br>
&quot;(insert RPN name here) wishes to have your name changed&quot;<br>
message show up on said named person in question.<br>
<br>
See how many people have any REAL guts after that.  <p><br>

<br>
On OTHER servers, they actually take a fairly lax view of the whole thing, depending on the GM staff.  Since FV is actually billed as the role-play server, the GMs here seem to take VI’s stated policy a little more seriously.<br>
<br>
“The Turtles” probably would never have been nixed on, say, Prexus, I’ll wager.  Here, on the server that Verant ostensibly created for the enjoyment of people who like to be a little more fully immersed in the fantasy, they removed what was a pretty obvious parody.<br>
<br>
Again, the person that petitioned did nothing.  The GMs were alerted to the names, evaluated them and decided they violated the policy.  If this (alleged) person had not petitioned now, they would have simply had a stay of execution, not permission to continue.<br>
<br>
There is also the possibility that there is no petitioner.  The GM who changed their name may have just made that up so that he would not have to listen to the turtle’s complaints as he implemented Verant’s policy.  Unlikely, I’ll grant, since the GMs don’t usually have any issue with saying what they mean, but possible.<br>
<br>
Although I would not have petitioned them, I am not sorry to see a reference to a kid’s TV show be removed from the game.  I would have the same feelings if Ashkatchum, Peeekichew and Charmannder had their names changed.  Same with the adventuring pair of Megaatron and Optimous.<br>
<br>
I know some people really get joy from making up clever names in-game.  I respect that they do not have the same inclination to actually ‘create a character’ (as opposed to a ‘toon’) in the game as I do.  But in the end, my opinions on names are meaningless: the are rules in the sandbox, and complaining once you finally get caught is just silly.<br>

<br>
Kloevis, prove that the person who did it is a &quot;RP Nazi&quot;.  The simple truth is that you don't know who did it or why they did it.  Like Henk said, the GM could have just been saying that they received an e-mail, like the turtles said it could have been someone who just didn't like the show. It could have been a non-roleplayer who just thought the names were stupid, and didn't realize they took their names so seriously that petitioning them would cause people to react as if he had hit one of them with a car.  Could have been the trademark holder's lawyer. Could have been some VI employee.  It could have been one of the people on this thread who is mercilessly bashing RPers.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line is, we don't know, and I doubt we ever will.  So what good does it do to start fanning the fire of &quot;Evil RP Nazis out to take over EQ and spoil it for the rest of us&quot;.  That's just your own bias talking there.<br>

As I stated in the Save the Turtles thread, I feel that the debate is over.  The GM's have made there decision and I agree to it.  However, I would like to state that during the whole ordeal, in which I dealt with Zelorixa, no once did we bitch, moan or whine about the changes.  We had a very good repoire with her from the start.  We understood the reasons from the beginning.  We were not pleased of course, but we did understand from the start that this may happen.  The issuse is now closed.  We have or will have our new names in place and will gracefully go about playing.  We appreciate those that cared enough to try and make a change, but it is not going to happen.<br>
One thing that is forgot so much is that it is JUST A GAME.  In a year there will be another and one the year after that.  Good games, however, are hard to come by and unfortunatly, as is the fate of most good games, they are ruined by bad players.  Whoever did e-mail about us is not a bad person, but also not the kind of person that I would want to play with.  I am glad that I do not know who it is for this would make it hard for me to be around this person in the game.  We were out to have a good time and WILL continue to do so.  We play this game and HAVE played this game for sometime because we love it.  There are many things we dont agree with, but they are the rules.  So, finally (because I know this is getting too long and seems to be in no particular order) Thank you all once again for your support and Im sure we'll be seeing each other in game...AND if your really lucky, Donatelo will hit you with a turtleskin and make you an honorary Turtle.<br>

I almost understand Verant's position, though I am prepared to argue with them over their points (as someone involved occupationally in parody) for their legal protection under copyright law, but honestly what sort of pathetic being would petition this?  It is not offensive.  It aids to the players using the parody as a source of unity and a moniker for identification (my character does the same same thing as a member of clan Ethu...where we have ETHU in the middle of our given name) and improves their enjoyment of the game.  How can a non offensive name make it less enjoyable for someone else playing unless they are some pathetic p.o.s. who has some form of inferoity complex and makes themselves feel better by bringing others having fun down?  I have a much more serious issue with the process of removing names and the name police nazi's and their PC informers then any name I see, even if it was offensive.  I am a roleplayer... I go waaaay back (my best friend was RPGA (tm) President for several years, the late Jeff Albanese) to the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons (tm) in the 1970's and find ANY motivation that aids a PC to develop an identity (stolen or otherwise)  much more interesting then some phat loot dudz (at RolePlaying conventions we call them &quot;Saturday Morning Screamers&quot;...&quot;If it moves, kill it... if it doesn't kill it anyway!&quot;) in some mad rush for hack &amp; slash accumulation.  The right thing needs to be done here and have the names restored and the petitioner needs some sort counselling for their issues...<br>

It does NOT matter what real world rules are about use of trademarked property.  <br>
<br>
(But certainly as someone who is involved in parody you would know anyways that use of trademarked and copywritten material is not always protected; you can be reasonably certain that if you don't get permission to use the material first, you open yourself up for legal cease and desist/lawsuits.  These days, corporations take action on even positive fan material that uses TM images/characters, let alone parody.  But that is beside the point..)<br>
<br>
First of all, read the User Agreement that you click accept on every time you play Everquest.  You know, the one that basically says regardless of how real life works, that you are in their world and will abide by their rules or face account suspension.<br>
<br>
Second, read these two policy documents:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp">everquest.station.sony.co...naming.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming_faq.jsp">everquest.station.sony.co...ng_faq.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Notice that use of a trademarked name is listed as the fourth worst type of &quot;unacceptable&quot; name that you can have. These have been the rules for years, and just because you don't agree with them doesn't mean they are going to change.  Verant has clearly taken the stance of no opportunity of legal action being the best way to go.  Again, if RA Salvatore can't use his own trademarked creation in the game due to the rules, the chances of letting someone use someone else's creation is slim to none.<br>
<br>
The rules are what they are.  Like Leonardo/Raaza said, we may not like them, but they are the rules.  By all means, petition Rivervale if you want to try and make a point to Verant.  It wouldn't be the first time they had changed a quest or NPC name because someone was offended by it.  But of course, then you become a name petitioner, and by your own argument, become a &quot;pathetic p.o.s. who has some form of inferoity [sic] complex and makes themselves feel better by bringing others having fun down&quot;.  And we wouldn't want that, would we?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/5/02 6:38:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=502.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Missing the Boat</span><hr size=1> Bah.<br>

And yes I do see the points (scare tactic, do as I say not as I do), if all Sony wants to do is upset their customers over a name dispute then they will won't be long for this world.  Intellectual properties aside (and it's not like they they created something new here, just the forum in which it is used is... no one ever played an elf or dwarf before... or knew what a Paladin is...or heard of Riverdale, er Rivervale...) it is merely a control mechanism to try to get people to act the way the want us to act.  The main reason most people or corporations enter litigation is money, and I see no one here involved in this dispute making any except Sony/Verant.  Without any real monentary damage done and no financial gain to made by it do you believe Sony/Verant would pursue this?  This is obviously a move by folks to in their eyes hold the line and follow the letter...and possibly make a name for themselves.  No harm, no foul I say. <br>
<br>
Who said I was petitioning anything?  I believe I said I was observing the pot calling the kettle black.  Logic would dictate that this is is a ridiculous situation and should never had come to pass.<br>
<br>
And yes the United States Supreme Court Ruling protecting parodies is relatively new, so perhaps Sony/Verant should follow legal precedent and change their policy as NOW today the accepted legal practice, not what they were doing 58 years ago when they first wrote it.  It's the rules so it's ok? Under that logic, minorities would need their own 'seperate but equal' servers to play on if those rules had been written back, say before this ruling... BAH!<br>
<br>
If you want to say it's Sony's game and they can do with it what they will (and you did), that's fine.  But don't pretend there is some higher calling or even now legal reasons for the naming policy EXCEPT Verant/Sony or some of their employees and/or representatives being a bunch of killjoys and/or too lazy or stubborn to check.  Make them take heed and take a look...  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujethuj.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jethuj</A> at: 4/5/02 8:17:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukaylabinkroog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaylabinkroog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/9/02 4:08:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=502.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.streamload.com/Download/AccessNodesPolicies.asp?nodeID=259267572&tab=inbox&index=1&resultCount=3&viewType=0&extraQueryInfo=nodeID%3D2592643 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: /bye Ninja Turtle</span><hr size=1> you should have named yourself after the 4 frogs in the cartoon next.But someone would whine about that too.<br>
