&quot;So here it is. The Runins of the former Capital.. The Undead here are stronger then those pitiful creatures of the forest...<br>
This place will offer me and my skills a proper challenge..&quot;<br>
<br>
The Young Samurai narrowed his eyes as he looked upon the sandy entrance to the City of Befallen, clencing his Tarnished Bastard Sword tightly, and bringing his shield off of his back, leaving the Ebon Shield to serve as a Shell to protect his back as he used the other Shield for attacking and Defending himself. He took a short hop and entered the city, and instantly, he began fighting.<br>
<br>
Skeletons and Skeletons. Legions of Undead instatly happened upon Shintou, who took them all with a smirk, a smile.<br>
He was in battle from the monent he first set foot into Befallen, and he loved every minute of it.<br>
Using his skills learned by Chaos, he pushed himself, slashing at every undead creature in sight, his heavy Bastard Blade crushing the bones, his shield bashing in their skulls..<br>
Two of the skeletons fell before him in a heap of bones before his bruises and wounds in the battle forced him outwards, beaten out of the city. The leather armor he had sewn together provided him hardly any protection from the army of Undead, and it shown in his bruises and his wounds. The Young Tier'dal sat himself down, allowing himself to heal.. and allowing his Rage to grow before he entered again..<br>
And began exploring, searching for fordimable foes to fight, so that he could pratice his skill and become even better, so that he could fight to feed his Rage.<br>
<br>
This continued on for 3 days, only stopping to sleep outside the city, Shintou continued fighting, sometimes standing above the scattered remains of his enemy in Victory, or falling under the combined forces of the Legion of Undead that resided within. But in time, Shintou even was able to overtake the ShadowKnight that resided on the first floor, Gaining the Key to his corspe.<br>
This day would not be important to him for this reason however..<br>
<br>
No, this is the day where he first saw them.<br>
Them, he had always read about them in the Library. Fair skin, curly locks flowing in their hair. Sharp yet gentle features about their face.<br>
This is the first time he saw.. Elves.<br>
A Highelven Cleric, with a Woodelven Warrior decided to hunt in the city as well, taking up space Shintou enjoyed to fight in, and causing an uneasyness within him.<br>
That uneasyness easily turned to Hate. Within Seconds, Shintou was taunting the elves, trying to guade them into battle, but the elves always refused. Always too busy with destroying the Undead to undertake in a real battle.<br>
Cowards they were, at least according to the Dark Samurai.<br>
<br>
That was, untill one day, outside of befallen, once Again Shintou was engaged with a Verbal battle against the elves. Shouting Vile threats in the language of the Darkelves, and being shouted back in the fair language of elves.<br>
And once again, the opening for battle was presented.<br>
And the Woodelf Warrior stood up, looking over Shintou.. And seeing that he was slightly wounded. Small scars.. a mark here or there. An easy win probably ran throught the mind of the Elf as he accepted to fight Shintou, who was at sixtty percent strenght.<br>
<br>
That was his first mistake.<br>
<br>
The elf wielded an elgant blade. Probably more for show then for fighting, it did little against Shintou, who with his shield, knocked that little toy of a blade aside and laid down blows of his own with the Bastard Sword. It tearing apart the leather armor of the elf and cutting open his flesh. Blood spewed everywhere from Shintou's powerful slashes, each time his sword severed flesh and opened wounds, making hte elf cry in pain after every strike. Shintou kept the elf missing, dodging and weaving inbetween his offensive slashes as Shintou kept countering his moves, his blade unleashing a final combination of Cutting across his stomach. A quick spin on his heels to unleash a striking cross slash, then he ramed the elf into a wall, using his Shield to Bash him backwards. The Elf fell off the wall, wincing. The Highelven Cleric stood up, and in her language she began casting a spell..<br>
And instantly, the wounds on the warrior were healed. His body rejuvinated, the wounds closed.<br>
<br>
That was his second mistake.<br>
<br>
One on one battle was always the perfered route of Shintou. It was in the way he was trained, that Victory could only be gained in this way.<br>
This elf was a coward. Hiding behind his Cleric.. and his weakness was known.<br>
And that made Shintou's rage peak. Even before the elf could begin his attack again, Shintou was upon him. His blade reopening the wounds with rapid strong attacks, cutting his leather apart into almost shreads with his quick moves. The Elf tried to fend off his attack, but it was just too fast.. too powerful. The elf fell back into another corner.. and his eyes.. filled with pain. Filled with suffering looked up to his Dark Challenger.. and saw those Dark green eyes..<br>
<br>
Once filled with Hate.<br>
<br>
Now filled with total Insainty.<br>
<br>
Shintou lept back to the elf to finish off the Job, a quick downwards slash resulted, but the elf rose his sword.. that toy of a blade stood inbetween Shintou and the elf's fair soft skin.<br>
So Shintou took the best way to get his bastard sword into the elf's flesh. He cut right throught that toy of a weapon, cutting it in two and laid down another blow against him. The elf yelped in pain as this bastard sword bit against his flesh, making a huge gaping wound..<br>
<br>
But another spell from the Highelven Cleric healed the Elf, allowing him to spring back to his feet.<br>
<br>
But Shintou did not let up. He continued his attack... but he was suprized.<br>
A dagger? Yes, the elf drew another weapon, striking it against his side and catching Shintou completly off guard, the Dark blood of this Samurai dripping over the small blade. Shintou flinched in pain, but it was not enought to stop his onslaught. His bastard sword continued its parade on this elf, cutting him to and fro, relieving him of more of his blood, but this time.. the elf started to fight back.<br>
<br>
The Animal had been beaten, broodied, and cornered.<br>
<br>
Finally, it drew its fangs. Blow for blow this elf had against his darker verion, his blows taking as much of a toll on Shintou as Shintou's blows took upon this elf. Blood flew everywhere, and their blades did not stop because of it. They continued in this dance.. only one way to end it. One way to finish this dance of hate, in the name of the Father Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
The elf tried to send his blade directly into Shintou's cut, but Shintou sidesteped it.<br>
<br>
That was the elf's final mistake.<br>
<br>
Shintou let loose a howl, his blade arcing high as he rose it, and brought it down right onto the hip of that elf, seperating limb and body, and striking the elf down into a heap of blood. The elf coppased, and cried out loudly as his blood stained the desert. The Highelven Cleric looking on this battle.. her eyes wet with tears as she could do nothing.<br>
<br>
She ran out of mana.<br>
<br>
The elf looked up to his asilant. Blood intermixing with the leather armor worn by this indigo Warror, a pant, and a stagger.. fighting this elf had weakened him greatly..<br>
But he still managed to drive the bastard sword right into that elven skull of the Woodelf, his blade striking the desert floor as it passed throught his skull.<br>
<br>
The elf struggled for just a second.. and then his arm went limp.<br>
<br>
Shintou fell off of his sword, laying against the sandy wall.. blood over his face.. along his body.. and flowing out of the many puncture wounds that the elf and his Knife created.<br>
<br>
But Shintou still cackled, wincing slightly he did laugh, looking back to the sobbing Fair Highelf, cackling as he spoke these final words.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the name of Innoruuk. I claim this elf. And you can do nothing to save him. Tunare, watch as the first of your children that I shall slay lay down in the dirt..&quot;<br>
<br>
And he closed his eyes, and allowed himself to pass out... the last thing he saw was that of another Woodelf. A Female.<br>
<br>
A Bard.<br>

<br>
Drixa rushes over to his side and firmly grabs him by his elbow. &quot;I think you'll enjoy the table over here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Drixa thinks of the delivery of furnature she just got to replace the damage from the last bar fight as she leads Fritz to the far side of the room.<br>
<br>
She smiles and winks at Fritz. &quot;Now, you stay right here and I'll be back with an ale for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
As she delivers the ale she leans over far enough to whisper in his ear without anyone else hearing, &quot;I know it is difficult to hear of a defeat, but I'm calling on your honor. Do all in your power to keep your temper low and avoid any trouble in my bar or I'll call the guards.&quot;<br>
<br>
As she straightens back up she adds, &quot;Enjoy that ale, and just holler if you need anything else.&quot;  <p>Drixa<BR>

<br>
With a mischievious grin, then, he leans forward and stands to applaud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huzzah!  Huzzah!  A fine tale, Shintou.  There's no dishonor in being bested by the better man.&quot;  He turns to regain his seat, then halts a moment.  &quot;Just keep in mind that you maintain your skills.  For a day from now, or half a day, or an hour hence, you might not be the better man still.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fritz seats himself again, and waits for his ale to arrive.  Nay, there'd be no trouble tonight in this bar.  At least not until he had finished his ale.  Then all bets were off.<br>
<br>
He let his eyes droop deceptively as he took stock of the mettle of those in the room.  Yes, it appeared that this would be the beginning of an epic fued.... <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>
