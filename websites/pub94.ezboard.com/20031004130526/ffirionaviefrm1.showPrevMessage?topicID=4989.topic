We had a timeline once, but since Makhrazat retired from Norrath, the timeline has, sadly, been lost.<br>
<br>
A number of original LoS founders and members are still about in various forms - some still in the League, and some in other forms or pursuing other goals.  I'm asking all the old-timers to reach back in your memories and, if you were associated with the LoS, see if you can think of any dates and significant events.  Once I started keeping Didi's diary most events are dated but before that I do not have any information.<br>
<br>
Do you know any dates for the below, or any other events of significance?<br>
<br>
Founding of the League of Shadows (leader: Jaynus - who were co-founders and original officers?)<br>
<br>
Handover of leadership to Lord Gray<br>
<br>
Any early raids of note?  I know that back in the early days, LoS and FnF were neck and neck exploring those new zones!<br>
<br>
When was our alliance to the Blackened Roses formed (and when did they disband)?<br>
<br>
Were there any other guild alliances back then?<br>
<br>
Were there any guild wars?  (I believe Apep left to form Ebon Storm and promising the downfall of the LoS at one point, but am not sure when this happened or exactly what was said?)<br>
<br>
Etc...<br>
<br>
Any memories, particularly ones with dates, would be appreciated for the sake of history! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

This was a hard task when I tried to do it, a few months after the League was founded--after all this time, it will be nigh impossible. I will certainly try to remember all I can, though....<br>
<br>
I know the League was formed in the great cave in the EC tunnel in October (I think). Jaynus was the Guildmaster, and... Valdria? (or someone whose name started with a &quot;V&quot;)... was his co-leader.... Gray was an officer, I think. I don't remember any of the others, sadly (I was an Iksar Shaman at the time, and unaware of events outside of Kunark).<br>
<br>
Jaynus and his co-leader (I think they were a RL couple) quickly found themselves at odds with the rest of the guild--I believe it had to do with their vision of the guild in terms of role-playing. Not wishing to compromise that vision, they left the server altogether, and passed leadership on to Gray. Many, many months later, Jaynus' co-leader returned, and was welcomed warmly by Gray back into the guild. I think she ended up stepping on a number of toes, though, because she ended up leaving rather quickly.<br>
<br>
LoS' first raid was into Mistmoore--it was disasterous as I recall <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . And I have to say, FnF quickly outdistanced LoS in terms of levels and raiding. The majority of the League was happy to focus more on RP and exploration, than levelling. There were a number of exceptions though (Biji comes to mind), and very shortly, tensions began to grow between the more RP oriented members, and the more Gamer-oriented ones (an old story on FV), which led to an exodus of many of the highest-level members of the guild.<br>
<br>
Zsuzsana (whom I've seen back in the world recently) could tell you more about the details of our alliance with Blackened Roses--it was the only guild alliance we had in those days. It started mainly due to the friendship between Gray and Zsu--eventually, Zsu decided that merging BR with LoS would serve everyone better, and joined LoS as an officer. Many of the BR members, though, were bitter about the whole turn of events, and decided to keep BR alive without Zsu. BR quickly degenerated, and fell apart.<br>
<br>
I somewhat recall a guildwar of sorts with the Council of Silver Griffons, but I really don't remember the details.<br>
<br>
As for dates, I'm sorry, I don't have any <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . Sadly, I did not keep the timeline I had created for the guild after I left--no one in the guild really seemed to care much about it besides me.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=makrazhat>Makrazhat</A> at: 9/14/03 2:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 1375<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/14/03 4:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4898.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeking a history of the League of Shadows</span><hr size=1> The LoS was founded on the first day guilds could be founded on FV - anybody know when this was?<br>
<br>
The first leader seems to actually have been Venan, he was co-leader with Jaynus I believe but Kyri thinks Venan held the tag.  Venan was Valdria's brother.  When Jaynus left, Gray assumed leadership.  Jaynus was gone from EQ for over a year due to computer problems I believe, he did come back last year and rejoined the League before deciding he wished to raid at a higher level.<br>
<br>
I have some dates for the Gore events due to stories in the League Special Collection and due to Didi's diary, but by the time I joined the League Gray was already leader, and in the early days (before about January) I have no notes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=carlluce>Carl Luce</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/14/03 10:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4898.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> An outsiders memory</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have some dates for the Gore events due to stories in the League Special Collection and due to Didi's diary<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Guilds were permitted one week after FV opened--October 6th or 7th I think. And Venan was the official guildleader, and Valdria was his co-leader. Once they left, Gray and Jaynus shared power as co-leaders, with Gray being in charge of RP, and Jaynus in charge of hunting. Jaynus soon had to leave EQ, and left Gray as the sole guild leader.... It's all coming back to me now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
Makrazhat joined in November, and even at that time, Gray was uncertain as to many of the details of the guild's founding. I had asked questions along these lines in the general LoS members' forum--assuming they haven't been purged, you might still find the post, and the answers I received back then. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaileena>Kaileena</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_whitespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#9900CC>I am Mod<br>

Gray and I had talked of doing some joint raiding, and just overall helping the other guild out.<br>
<br>
Then Shadows of Luclin hit and both guilds suffered pretty bad from it.  I personally lost all of my officers except for 1.  That's when the alliance talk turned into merger talk.  <br>
<br>
It ended up that I and about 5 others left BR for LoS.  I was made directly into an officer.<br>
<br>
The Ebon Storm split happened around January 14th or so.  It was shortly after Gray returned from his disappearance due to rl issues.  Apep and Azhrei had issues with some things, and left to form their own guild.<br>
<br>
We raided Mistmoore once that was very memorable as Thrads came to our rescue due to a bug that brought every mob in the castle to the Dhampyre room.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I could go on and on. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913" target="top">Zsuzsana Dracul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It was probably the first raid on Firiona Vie.  A good number of the raiders became members of the League of Shadows.<br>
<br>
Roughly 20 dark elves met at the entrance to guk.  It was very unorganized as it was a collection of three proposed guilds.  Kaen led the raid that day.  He was a dark elf enchanter and preparing to form one of the guilds.. although it never was created.  If i remember correctly, once the raid was over the League contingent went north to the caves in EC and officially formed the guild.  I was there, as a dark elf warrior named Kinael.  Other names that i recall from those early days - Sliver(warrior), Baltos(warrior), Dasho(cleric) and Agannazer(cleric).<br>
<br>
Yep, that first Mistmoore raid wasnt what I'd call successful..  We gathered in greater faydark and moved to Mistmoore..  The idea was to invis to the fountain behind the castle.  While we seemed to get there without much trouble, the entire castle soon came down on us.  We must have tried again, without success.. I just remember a lot of death and beating Sliver in a duel. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
As for the exact dates - I dont know.  Venan and Valdria disappeared during the days we were fighting in High Pass - would guess near the third week of that October.  That must be when Gray took over.  Valdria did come back some time later, but I never saw Venan again.  Didn't Gray and Valdria marry? and later Gray married Katinka, and maybe others - too many wives to keep track.  There really wasnt a lot of events in those early days.<br>

And Gray married Katinka *before* he married Valdria, didn't he? I don't remember Valdria, when I first joined(but that could just be because guildchat was a blur for the first month or so, as languages were still level capped, and I was a non dark elf, under level twenty. /grin <p><center>

(( to this day you have to do /who all &quot;league of honour&quot; to see the right league...<br>
<br>
Gray and I met on the Butcherblock docks, and there began our long habit of dicing when we met. The wagers were quite innocent despite certain suggestions to the contrary. I often had to however extricate young rangers and such from his clutches as he cast his spells upon them. Truly the evil twin of Blayze...<br>
<br>
Our first large event with the League of Shadows was held I think in Lower Guk, where we outdrank even their mightiest troll  (*blushingly confesses to winning the bout with Mudwart?). Many other duels, arena challenges and battles have followed. The rivalry is much fun, to this day I count you as my favourite enemies.<br>

That's right, Katinka was kidnapped back to Neriak by the Duke she had been promised to by her house, Gray never got to marry her.  Valdria he married in Mistmoore Castle, with Thrads performing the ceremony, and then Syllestrae in a quiet ceremony in the Tower of Frozen Shadows sometime thereafter.  Lynnette had fallen into her coma by that point and vanished, so they didn't actually marry.  By the time Lynnette recovered, Valdria had vanished while in search of their kidnapped child, and Sumida claimed Gray for her own (and that's one ranger that Meledi failed to 'rescue').<br>

I remember quite a few dates and incidents but I don't think it is what you would want to put in the history.  Feel free to send me a tell in game, Didi, if you would like to hear some of these things and decide on your own.<br>
