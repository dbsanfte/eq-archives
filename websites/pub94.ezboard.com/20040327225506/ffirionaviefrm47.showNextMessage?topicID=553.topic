I had a forum set up, had to pay a little money, but it's a nice forum, lots of options and such. I'll be changing the URL as soon as my membership gets processed, so don't bookmark that and forget about the fact that link won't last very long i'm thinking. I want any potential applicants, instead of posting here (although you're certainly allowed) to instead set up on the GoO forums. Those that have already expressed interest, please post there also. Plus, any well-wishes and such, please post there too. I'd love the company. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also, sometime in the near future (by that I mean within a month or so), I hope to have a web site put up too. Still ,i know nothing of programming and such, and even the forum maintenece is proving troubling at times, so I think I'll have someone help me withthat part.<br>
<br>
I'll have a complete description for the guild posted on this thread, and on the forums, in a day or two.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
The Guild of Opportunity<br>
<br>
1. Raids<br>
<br>
A. Distibution of Loot<br>
<br>
I) If an item is dropped that is wanted by only one person, that needs that item, then they shall be allowed to loot that item<br>
<br>
II) If an item is dropped that wanted by only one person, that does not need that item, then they shall be allowed to loot that item. However, they are required to keep said item for at least one week, in case there is another guild member who needs that item. If a week passes without such a case, then the looter shall be allowed to do as they wish with said item.<br>
<br>
III) If an item is dropped that is wanted by more than one person, and only one out of the amount needs it, that one person shall get the item in favor of those that have no need for it.<br>
<br>
IV) If an item is dropped that is wanted by more than one person, and all or a few need it, it shall be rolled for to determine who gets the rights to loot it.<br>
<br>
V) If an item is dropped thatis wanted by more than one person, and none of them need it, it shall be rolled for and given to the winner. However, they are required to keep said item for at least one week, in case there is another guild member who needs that item. If a week passes without such a case, then the looter shall be allowed to as they wish with said item.<br>
<br>
B. Definitions<br>
<br>
I) Want – If a person expresses an interest in looting an item dropped by a mob, then they are said to “want” that item. If a person needs an item, but expresses no interest in that item, then they do not want that item, and should not be considered to be trying for that item.<br>
<br>
II) Need – If a person directly benefits from possesing an item dropped by a mob, rhen they are said to “need” that item. Selling an item for money is not considered a direct need. A person need not gain statistics from an item, but if two people need an item, the person with the greatest benefits from the item will usually get the itemm. If the difference in gained benefit is small, then rollngi  will occur as usual.<br>
<br>
C. Planning<br>
<br>
I) Initiation – Any member of the guild may propose a raid, may orginize a raid, and may run a raid, barring the permission of guild leaders for leading. However, no guild member may orginize a raid on a newbie-friendly zone, such as a city with trading NPCs, .and should avoid killing quest initators.<br>
<br>
II)  Time – Raids may take place at any time of the day, for as long as is needed. If a raid iterferes with another guild’s raid, then the raid shall be postponed until such a time that the scheduling of the raid does not interfere.<br>
<br>
III) Members – Any member of the guild may participate in any raid. Preferably, raid members will be in the correct level range for the place being raided, but younger observers and older helpers are certainly allowed as well. Members of other guild, and non-guilded people, will be allowed, barring interview by the raid orginizerm,and after being explained the rules for raided that have been set forth by the guild.<br>
<br>
D. Raid Offenses<br>
<br>
I) Intentional Training – If a person purposefully trains a group of aggressive mobs onto a raiding party, whether that is for the purpose of killing the raid members or making them evac, that is known as Intentional Training. Normal training happens all the time, purely by accident, so it must be proven beyond doubt that the training was intentional for there to be an offence. If the trainer was a member of the guild, they will be given a warning, and be suspended from raids and other guild activities (besides meetings) for a month. If they choose not to comply with the sentence, they shall be banned from the guild and all guild activities, barring any future amnisty. If the trainer is not a member of the guild, they will be banned from the guild and their guild will be informed of their actions.<br>
<br>
II) Loot Stealing – If a person purposefully takes an item from a slain mob that has been promised to another person, that is known as Loot Stealing. If the stealer is a member of the guild, then they will be asked once nicely by the leader of the raid to give the item to the person who was to receive it in the first place. If they fail to comply, then they shall receive a warning and shall be banned from all guild activities (besides meetings) for a month. If they still fail to comply, they shall be gbanned from the guild and all guild activities. If the stealer is not from the guild, they will be asked once nicely by the leader of the raid to give the item to the person who was to receive it in the first place. If they fail to comply, then they shall be banned from guild activities and their guild shall be informed of their actions.<br>
<br>
III) Other – All other offences shall eb determned later<br>
<br>
2. Guild regulations<br>
<br>
A. Channels<br>
<br>
I) Say/Tells – Guild members may use the say channel how they see fit, barring the rules for all channel behavior.<br>
<br>
II) Auction – Guild members may use the auction channel how they see fit, barring the rules for all channel behavior. It would be prefered that guild members leave seeling to the Bazaar, but if that’s not an option, or if you are traveling and wish to seel, oit won’t be a problem.<br>
<br>
III) Group – If a guild member is in a group with other guild members, they are allowed to use the public guild channel to coordinate if they wish, although they should hold down on the chatter about the group to a minimum to lessen channel spam. If a guild member is in a group with members outside the guild, they should use the guild channel to coordinate events.<br>
<br>
IV) Shout – Guild members should keep use of the shout channel to a minimum. If a member does not have the Legends of Ykesha expansion, they may use it to advertize looking for a group. Auctioning items should be left to the appropriate channel, and non-local interguild contacts should be left to tells and the guild channel.<br>
<br>
V) Opportunty/Guild – The Opportunty chat channel, for current purposes, serves as a guild channel would. In the future, the Opportunity channel will remain open as a channel for potential applicants to meet guild members. The guild chat will become the interguild chat channel.<br>
<br>
B. Chat Rules<br>
<br>
I) Language – Any language may be spoken by guild members, but any member that joins the guild should make it a point to try to learn human. This will make communication at meetings and such easier for all sides. This does not mean that other languages are not allowed, or that not knowing human is grounds for any sort of punishment<br>
<br>
II) Roleplaying – Roleplaying is highly encouraged in the guild, and all opportunities to remain that are presented should be taken. That said, it is understood that sometimes things must be said out of character, or that someone might not feel like they are up to roleplaying at a given moment. These will be rspected, and there shall nbe no punishment of any sort for going out of character. Still, people should try to label being out of character if in the middle of a roleplaying enviorment.<br>
<br>
III) Swearing – Swearing in guild chat or without allowance with a person is highly frowned upon by the guild. We are all adults, but we must respect each other. While swearing is not inherently punishable, excessive swearing will be dealt with. If asked to stop swearing, and a person fails to comply, they will be given a warning and be suspended form guild events (exceopting meetings) for a month. If they still choose to ignore the rule, then they shall be banned from the guild and all guild activities.<br>
<br>
IV) Harassment – All forms of verbal harassment, from religious to sexual, and including racial and ageism, is not allowed in the guild. If a member is caught engaging in language that is of a harrasing nature, they shall immediately be givene a warning, and be suspended for guild events for 30 days. If they persist,, they shall be banned from the guild and guild activities. If a person wishes to roeplay such a thing, they must get explicet concent from their fellow roleplayer. We take this very seriously!<br>

As of right now GoO has 8 members including myself by my count, with 4 people that are out on a limb as to whether they're in or not. So, things are going along nicely by my measure. Just a few more people and maybe I can finally tag the guild officially, which will go a long way to helping in game promotion. <br>
<br>

<br>
1) If a person wishes to join GoO, first thing's first: they have to actually meet and talk with a GoO member, and I mean more than a friendly hi and that's it. Usually, at least so far, the &quot;recruits&quot; (although that term's not quite right at this point) have had two ways of having initial contact.<br>
<br>
A - They have been approached by one of the members of GoO (usually Animos), have been helped out by him in the spirit of the guild, have had a conversation in RP (and OOC too if they wished to ask questions too awkward to ask IC and such). After a lengthy talk, Animos brought them to attention to me,. In turn, I talked with them in and out of charector as well. If their views fit the guild (ie, they weren't overly zealous and were willnig to help out), then at that point I asked them to officially join.<br>
<br>
B - They have approached me or one of the other guild mates and expressed interest in the guild that way. The only difference from the first way is that the applicant put forth all the effort in this case. They still required a recommendation from a lower member and an interview with me.<br>
<br>
Mind you, I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>am</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rather leniant in my questioning and such. After all, the guild from an RP perspective is rather loose and encompassing in who can join. But with the recommendation and review system right now, it gets the job done. After getting larger (like around 20 people or more), perhaps I'll give more of the task to Animos (since he's in charge of recruitment), and maybe impliment a test period before tagging (which isn't an issue yet, sicne there aren't any tags as of now).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I don't want to be in a guild that does drive-by invites, for example.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You definetly won't see this happening, in conclusion. A person has to prove that they can at least Roleplay decently, that they fit in wwith the feel of the guild, and they have to have a recommendation and an approval period. Still, I'll talk to Llyra (who's in charge of Rules and Regulations) to see if she has any additional ideas for recruitment. If so, I'll let you know. <p>----------------<br>

Some of it might be a repeat, but you can consider it the official recruitment policey until further notice:<br>
<br>
1) Until about 20 people are in the guild, I'll keep recruitment simple, as it is right now (especially true for this time before we're tagged). A member (not nessisarily an officer at this point since there are only 3 officers, subject to change) interviews/hunts with/roleplays with an applicant and gets to know them. All the current members know the guild's policies and ideals, and I can take the time to make sure that's true since there are so few. After they approve the recruit, finding him/her to be fine, they turn the applicant over to me. If I'm not on, I interview them whenever we're both on of course, or when I can hop on EQIM (althogh I try to meet then face to face in game before I ever give my official stamp). If also like what I see, it's a go.<br>
<br>
2) After GoO gets tagged, and once the membership starts getting bigger and harder to control, I'll turn over recruitment to my officers as well. A recruit at that point can still be found by anyone, and they should still get to know them. At that point however, they can submit the applicant to any officer, who then approves or disapproves of the applicant. If the original interviewer was an officer, that's approval at that point. If not, a second officer needs to be contacted and also interview the perons (not nessisarily on the same day or anything). When we get tagged so that we're officially recognized, GoO will have a week trial membership system, where newly tagged members (after the approval of the two officers) are under the mentorship and guidance of a senior GoO member. After the week is over, then the mentor also gives his approval or disapproval. If it's no good,then the guild tag is removed from the applicant. <p>----------------<br>

<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Guild Leader - Perris Lemone<br>
<br>
Officer of Rules and Regulations - Llyra<br>
<br>
Officer of European Affairs - Ninylien<br>
<br>
Officer of Recruitment - Animos<br>
<br>
Vireth, Peht, Pryf, Magha, Illudin Arbiter, Flippus, Numelyen, <br>
Gaillinn? (Contact me please!), Friend of Llyra and Magha's (Still need to hear from him), Sekayn, Aivia? (In negotiations)<br>
<br>
So, officially, we're up to 12 people right now, but unofficially we have 15 (maybe even 16...Aivia has a friend). We've still never had 10 people on at once, so we're still not tagged, thus I'm still recruiting par the old rules (although I'd still kick someone out right now, just no need to worry about tags and all that). If anyone else is still interested (and I hope others are), drop me a line here, on the GoO boards, or in game if need be (don't forgot the Opportunity channel is where we hang out until guild chat is implimented). <p>----------------<br>

A few notes:<br>
<br>
1) Name change. By popular descision, GoO is now AotC: the Academy of the Compass. Same charter and all that, same membership. <br>
<br>
2) Speaking of membership, we're up to 12 people officially right now (Sekayn has left for another guild idea in formation, and Aivia is officially in), with one or two unofficials. All of us are in the teens and 20's, except for one senior member (illudin)<br>

3) New Forum Address, found at  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://aotc.aimoo.com/">aotc.aimoo.com/</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

We're still ooknig for anyone that's interested in the idea. Pop onto Channel opportunty in game (ie, /join opportunity) and we can talk. Otherwise, post on the forums.

<br>
1) There is no more Perris. Now, I've re-rolled as Gerizard, Iksar Shaman. Peht is holding as temporary leader in the wake of Perris' death (I'll have the story soon), but Gerizard is being molded to take over Perris' position.<br>
<br>
2) There was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> new applicant sicne I last said anything, and he hasn't shown up again. So, we're still officially at about 8 people (Gerizard, Pryf, Brocas, Peht, Flippus, Elluden, Llyra, Aivia [Kodo counts half]).<br>
<br>
3) Because of a lack of fully understanding from a few people, I thought I'd restate the goal of the Academy. &lt;Quote from Elluden&gt; <br>
<br>
&quot;We help others, and contain people who help others, and try to lead the populace by being a good example. By defeating those who act against the young and the ideals of objective good (which is quite a different thing from classic EQ &quot;good&quot;), and aiding young ones (who aren't necessarily in the guild), we promote a better Norrath, free of past prejudices.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Academy, in an ooc context, is around to help promote roleplaying at younger levels. For those that feel that up until 20 or 30 is just hack and slash, and that the only real roleplaying takes placce in upper-level areas, the Academy promotes stories from within itself, and tries to extend to others. From an ic context, the Academy is a group of like-minded indivisuals, who see the promotion of the protection and help on the young and innocent as a primary goal. Not all are equally as tolerant of those of more advanced training, but by that point, they are mature enough to make their own decisions, and strong enough to defend themselves.<br>
