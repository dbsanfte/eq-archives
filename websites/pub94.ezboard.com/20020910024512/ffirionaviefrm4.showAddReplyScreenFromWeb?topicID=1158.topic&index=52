class=title>   An example...</span><hr size=1> Think of it this way, Irexes...<br>
<br>
Banana_Republic00 is in the midst of a civil war in which tens of thousands or innocent civilians are dying.<br>
<br>
Major_Power00 has to decide whether or not to get involved.  Major_Power00 has no stake in the civil war, neither outcome will harm it, none of its citizens are currently in danger, and there are Banana_Republic01 and Banana_Republic02 there that should be able to deal with it.<br>
<br>
If Major_Power00 intervenes, it risks the death of its own citizens, the loss of equipment and prestige, the costs of the operations, and the reduction in capability to deal with other situations that might arise which might be a more immediate threat to the interests of Major_Power00.<br>
<br>
Moreover, if Major_Power00 intervenes, International_Body00, which is dominated by the various Banana_Republics, will no doubt engage in major criticism of Major_Power00 for intervening in the sovereign affairs of Banana_Republic00, since it is in the interest of Banana_Republic01, 02 and 03 that 00 remains in turmoil, since they are profitting from the situation by looting the refugees.<br>
<br>
What is Major_Power00 supposed to do?<br>
<br>
Ethics and Morality are fine for personal behavior, but at the level of nation states, making decisions based on them can very well mean that your people will die.  Bush, Blair et al answer to their own nations people, not to Afghans or Palestinians, and if American or British soldiers are to be placed in harms way, it damn well better be for the benefit of America and the UK.<br>
<br>
Yes, I freely admit it is brutal, it is not 'nice', it is not 'fair', it is not 'kind'.  It is reality.  No nation, no matter how 'progressive', acts in anything other than its own self-interest.  If that self-interest happens to coincide with common morality, we call it 'enlightened self-interest'.   The United States acts that way, the UK acts that way, Canada acts that way, Switzerland acts that way, EVERY nation acts that way.<br>
<br>
In many ways diplomacy is the art of making other nations see that their self-interest lies with supporting your national self-interest.  When nations interests coincide, you have alliances, and oftentimes a nations interests are quite moral, witness the international relief efforts throughout the Third World, witness the major nuclear powers uniting to pressure India and Pakistan into backing down from the brink of nuclear war...<br>
<br>
Personal morality really doesn't enter into this equation at all, where morality makes its appearance is in the methods and procedures, not in the actual decisions.  After 9/11, the US could, with the full support of the US populace and the full understanding of nearly the entire world, have launched a few ICBM's at the known terrorist supporters strongholds and incinerated tens of millions of people along with the terrorists.  Or the US could engage in a pin-point precision campaign against the terrorists while simaltaneously engaging in humanitarian 'hearts and minds' operations.  The 'interests' of the US was to destroy terrorism, where morality came into play was in deciding that it was more moral to risk our own soldiers lives in direct combat with the enemy rather than make use of our massive nuclear arsenal to obliterate it.<br>

<br>
International Affairs are by their very nature and practice amoral.  Morality, ethics, friendships, et al do not apply in the decisions of nation-states, only their interests.<br>
<br>
Those interests can, indeed, be 'moral' and 'ethical' if morality and ethics coincide with interests, but no nation state can afford to allow mere morality and ethics to overtake its interests, because if it does, it is quite possible that the 'moral' and 'ethical' decisions will lead to the deaths of citizens for no actual gain.<br>
<br>
Nation-states do not deal with issues at the same level as you or I do, when a nation state acts, it is quite possible that large numbers of people will die directly by either action or inaction, and oftentimes people will die either way, therefore, no nation state can be justified in acting in anything other than its own interests, because to throw away the lives of its citizens on things outside of its interest is amongst the worst things a nation state can do.<br>
<br>
Now in the practices and execution of these interests is where ethics and morality occur, where the leaders make the ethical decisions between options for attaining the nations interests.<br>
<br>
There is no 'new paradigm', there is no 'more ethical way'.  The basis for international relations has remained constant from the Pharoahs to today, and will still be the same when the universe succumbs completely to entropy.  'Society' is, by its very nature, amoral.<br>
<br>
Let me give an example... Somalia, where morality and ethics overrode national self-interest.... result? 19 American dead and the prestige of the US weakened, emboldening the terrorist threats and totalitarian opponents of US interests.  So, was ignoring self-interest in the interest of 'morality' justified? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>mistayn the mindless</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 2:48:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nakath...</span><hr size=1> that also depends on your view of morality.<br>

some people think its more than rude, almost immoral, to go around minding everyone's business for them.<br>
<br>
we don't need to meddle, but when we do we HAVE to have good reasons for it.  after reading a very large synopsis by a military general who was in the vietnam war, i'll agree with his point:  you aren't going to get citizens willing to lay down their lives for something less than what they feel is 'right', or righting a wrong somewhere.  <br>
<br>
ethics may have little to do with nation states and their interest.  but nation states are composed of, and supposedly serve the people that live in them.  at least ours has always given lip service to this concept.  <br>
<br>
and if the people think that their nation is a foul villain and agrees with almost nothing that it does because of their standard of ethics,  that nation state is not going to have a compliant populace and may not be in existence for much longer.<br>

That gets into the question of 'what are a nation's interests and how are they set', rather than how the nation state acts upon said interests.  Generally speaking, a freely elected government will have more 'moral' interests than a dictatorship, precisely because of the more communal setting of the interests.  But that is not always the case, and in many cases it is not the preferable way to get things done.  The Founders, and many political thinkers throughout history, have rightly abhorred mobocracy, because just because 90 percent of the populace thinks something is good doesn't always make it so.  That's where 'statesmanship' comes into play, and it is those crass amoral statesmen who oftentimes reap the greatest good for both their nation state, and, ultimately, mankind.<br>
<br>
Now to address the questions about the US 'over arming' and spending so much on defense.  There is a very real, moral, and ethical reason for a nation state in the global position of the US to do so, it's called 'peace'.  Peace is not achieved between nation states because of warm fuzzies or feel good words, peace is achieved when the most primitively barbaric thug on the planet is afraid to realize his ambitions because he knows that there will be a 800 pound gorilla hammering him into the dirt if he tries.  Crass?  Yup.  Crude?  Uh huh.  Uncivilized?  Damn straight.  True? Oh yeah, very.<br>
<br>
Its when the Osama bin Ladins and Saddam Hussein's and Jiang's and Qaddafi's and Arafats and Assad's of the world are trembling in terror of what the global hegemon will do to them if they dare disturb it that there is peace, and with peace comes such nice things as 'not getting blown up by terrorists' and 'not having to go to war'.<br>
<br>
Morally speaking, the US committed a great sin by allowing itself to be weakened by failing to act against previous terrorist attacks strongly, be drawing down its defense, and by weakening its military.  Why?  Because that emboldened the true barbarians fo the world into thinking that they could win, thus they struck.  World War III did not occur because the Russians were nice enough to want peace rather than conquest, World War III was prevented because the Russian leadership knew if they tried that they would die.  9/11 didn't occur simply because somebody hated the US, the US has been hated by much more powerful enemies in the past, 9/11 occurred because somebody who hated the US felt that they could get away with attacking the US without getting hammered.<br>
<br>
Once you have established such credentials that nobody dares piss you off, then you have, not just 'peace', but Pax.  Where the hegemonic power can bend events globally to its liking without the use of force, through the simple fear of the force lurking in reserve.  Then, a moral hegemonic power is able to impose more 'ethical' interests onto the lesser nation-states by making it too dangerous for a lesser nation-state to act on interests that may be seen as immoral (note, IMmoral rather than Amoral, there is a difference, immoral is the opposite of moral, amoral is the absence of morality) to the hegemonic power.<br>
<br>
I don't think that there is much argument that the US is more 'moral' and 'ethical' in its dealings than, say, Iraq.  The US is certainly not a paragon of virtue riding its white horse polishing its stainless escutcheon, but let us be honest, nobody else is either, and the US is certainly closer to the ideal 'moral hegemon' than any other nation-state that has achieved that level of ascendency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Feisty Dwarf!</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 4:21:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nakath...</span><hr size=1> Very nice post Edward Dunai.<br>

we don't always support the reasoning that the politicians &amp; folks in command give for sending those orders on down to you, but we support you for doing exactly as you signed on to do.<br>

you are right, it's a tough job and not all of us want to sign up for it.  that you do so frees us from the worry of having to be willing to give our own lives in service so that we can concentrate on whatever it is we like to concentrate on, like mowing the lawn perhaps.<br>

i've never had issue with the individuals in the armed forces.  actually, i hate the arguement that just because someone disagrees with the policies that set those forces into action, they are somehow disrespecting the people who had to go to war.  <br>
<br>
all of us who have ever been employed by others understand having to do things that we don't always agree with to maintain our jobs.  we may not like it, but we have to live with it regardless in order to pay the bills.  nothing personal, but you must follow orders.  we can all respect that, i'm sure.<br>
<br>
so, as you can see, we do respect you.  the arguements and dislike is for the people who are in command, the ones who actually decide whether or not to fight wars justly or unjustly.  the issue is not with you, it is with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upoppyseedmcmuffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PoppySeed McMuffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Muffin Chick </span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 1:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.namelessofmercy.com/pictures/1025208718.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: US ARMY as well</span><hr size=1> (ooc)<br>

Not IMmoral, Amoral.<br>
<br>
The reason that deterrence works is fear, the reason why there was no nuclear war between the US and USSR was fear, we both could annihilate the other if we pursued our national interests vigorously, therefore, instead both sides backed down, and instead made it their interest to oppose the other in ways short of war.<br>
<br>
And the 'fear' works both ways, if two small nations both know that if they go to war with their neighbor that the US will come down on them like a load of bricks, and conversely knows that if their neighbor goes to war with them that the US will come down on their neighbor like a load of bricks, and thus knows that neither them nor their neighbor could possibly win any conflict, might they not then be more amenable to peaceful settlement, knowing that there is a hegemonic force in the wings expecting them to do so?  Or would it be more moral for the two nations to go to war with each other and slaughter thousands of people so that the US can feel good about not making people scared of it?<br>
<br>
Is it more 'moral' to permit war and violence to reign unchecked throughout the world or to increase your own power to the point where the mere threat of you intervening keeps the peace?  Is it somehow wrong for dictators and tyrants to fear the consequences of their actions?  A moral hegemon is one who makes use of its power to further moral goals, and peaceful coexistance is by any defination a moral goal.<br>
<br>
As far as terrorists go, the United States is hated already, irregardless of what we do, by the authoritarians and dictators of the world, and those who follow them.  We will be the target of fanatics regardless of what we do, but with an overwhelming preponderance of power and a demonstrated willingness to make use of that power, few if any nation-states will risk their own existance to sponsor and support terrorist organizations, which reduces the threat to the 'lone wackjob' category.  Sure, lone wackjobs can do damage, but they also are far more likely to get caught before they manage to pull off an attack, and are far less well equipped/trained.  All in all, a worthy tradeoff, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
It's called 'peace through superior firepower' and, historically, is far more reliable than 'peace through warm fuzzy feelings of love and happiness' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=traxxus>Traxxus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 308<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 3:27:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Irexes...</span><hr size=1> Well said Edward <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukiluen73.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kiluen73</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 4:20:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Irexes...</span><hr size=1> Don't care much what everyone thinks or has to say on this subject.

<br>
In fact, during a debate with Gore (the second or third one), both candidates were asked which instances of recent intervention by the US in world affairs they would have supported.<br>
<br>
I remember very vividly that Bush didnt even recognize one of them and stumbled in his answer. The ones he did recall, for the most part, he said he opposed... and he attacked Clinton for &quot;policing the world,&quot; even though Clinton used restrained force and superior firepower during the conflict in the Balkaans to force stability in the region.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Those who say 9/11 changed everything have no understanding of history. 9/11 didnt change anything--it merely underscored lessons that should have been learned long ago, that were forgotten.<br>
<br>
The US is very much a part of the world community, whether it wants to be or not. I hope I live to see the day we realize this and start participating as a member of that community and not as an arrogant god that demands compliance with its standards and beliefs, but then refuses to answer to the inquiries of others.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
There are so many instances where the notion of &quot;peace through superior firepower&quot; can be shown to be false that making that statement and leaving it that simple made me blink.<br>
<br>
Look at the Middle East. Israel has one of the most advanced military machines in the world, and has the US constantly on its side. No greater firepower has been assembled in the history of the world. The Palestinians have virtually nothing. Result? No peace, nor will there be. Not due to &quot;military might.&quot;<br>
<br>
Look at 9/11. Our firepower certainly didnt help us much there, hmm? We sure smacked the Taliban around though. <br>
<br>
Look at Vietnam. My dad's a Marine, and was wounded fighting over there. At one point his unit, while entrenched, got attacked by a bunch of North Vietnamese irregulars wielding .22s and farm tools. Many of them in their mid-teens. His unit had to mow them down... Yet the North Vietnamese succeeded in their objectives, despite US &quot;firepower.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are instances where superior firepower and the threat of its use prevent conflict, I agree. The conflict in the Balkaan a few years ago is a good example, as is the standoff between China and Taiwan.<br>
<br>
But there are also a myriad of instances where it does not, because when determined, commited, absolute willpower and resistance meets superior firepower, firepower will lose more often than not in the long run, unless you are willing to commit genocide.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Edward, you stated earlier that 9/11 was not the result of someone hating the US, but of someone thinking that the US was weak--that they could attack the US and get away with it.<br>
<br>
You're forgetting that those most of those who attacked the US didnt &quot;get away with it.&quot; They died piloting the planes.   Same with the Palestinian bombers. They dont care about &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong.&quot; They were willing to sacrifice their lives because of their beliefs. &quot;Firepower&quot; doesnt figure into beliefs of that intensity. <br>
<br>
Bin Ladin is many things, but unintelligent is not one of them. He knew he might die as a result of his actions. So did those around him. Im sure that, even given the US responce, they would do what they did again in an instance.<br>
<br>
You listed a number of attacks previous to 9/11 that were not responded to by the US as being a reason that 9/11 occurred. By that rationale, the fact that we beat the tar out of the Taliban will mean that such attacks will stop, right? Because the world has seen how mighty we are. <br>
<br>
I hope that is the case, but doubt it very much.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
One last point... Edward, you stated that following 9/11 the US could have launched a few ICBMs, taken out tens of millions of people, and the rest of the world would have &quot;supported us.&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe that statement is STUNNINGLY inaccurate. Amazingly so.<br>
<br>
As much as I respect your knowledge of history and the complex nature of international relations, I would say that statement is an example of what I have said all along--that you, and many other Americans, have such an intensely one-sided view of world affairs its easy, if not inevitable, to become blind to the existence and opinions of those outside the US.<br>
<br>
I believe that, had we used ICBMs to take out tens of millions of innocent people in responce to 9/11, the world reaction would have been immediate, intense, and increadibly scathing.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, that will remain a matter of speculation on my part, since we didnt.<br>
<br>
This time anyway. I hope we never find out for real.<br>

<br>
The example in your post of the Cold War refers to Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) quite the opposite of the above as neither party holds the advantage. And despite the fact that the US and USSR never pressed the button and ended it all, hundreds of thousands died in proxy wars across the globe. In fact one of the hotbeds for the Cold War was Afghanistan where Russia was fighting US supported rebels and we know what kind of mentality some of the children who grew up there now have. Just because tanks aren't driving down Main Street USA doesn't mean there's peace in the world.<br>
<br>
Examples of 'peace through warm fuzzy feelings of love and happiness', tricky one, but Germany and France havn't been to war for nearly 60 years, which is a record. South Africa only turned around once the sins of the past were acknowledged and people started to look forward. The revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe where tanks were stopped by people wielding flowers (and David Hasselhoff on the Berlin Wall). Northern Ireland (closer to home for me), the peace process is built on an end to fear (not a smooth road but getting there slowly). Plus a few recent peace deals in Africa after 20 or 30 years of war failed to resolve anything (and the US, your potential moral hegemon, failed to intervene, not suprising given the absence of natural resources).<br>
<br>
So should the US intervene against whoever out of Pakistan and India goes nuclear first? Should we expect Israel and the Palestinians to stop fighting because the US (the &quot;moral hegemon&quot;) will do what is morally right and smack both their behinds?<br>
<br>
I get the amoral, immoral thing, even without the capital M, I just think it's wrong. Why does an individual have a right to ignore basic morality just because they become President?<br>
<br>
I'm not intending to come off as a US basher here, far from it, I would much rather an active US than a return to isolationism. No reason the US should help anyone really.<br>
<br>
I just think its disingenuous to claim that the rest of the world benefits from the US following its own agenda. Bottom line, if you're Kuwait (or other oil providing country) and you get invaded expect help. If you attack the US or support those who do, expect to get bombed. If you're a small European, African, Asian or South American country at war or sponsoring terrorism in your neighbours lands carry on regardless.<br>
<br>
Fair play to you Edward for discussing all this without it getting personal or offensive. At the risk of boring the board *shouts of &quot;too late&quot; from the back*, I'll make this my last post on the thread.<br>
