<br>
I have been in a situation like this, and I have to admit, it's not fun. As another character, I was stuck between two people I was guilded with who were playing the same class as me, at the same season. Both of them had bought platinum and powerlevelled up to my season, which was fine and all, but because of this they didn't know how to play their class particularly well. I had taken a long time levelling, and knew the class backwards. I was good at it, and enjoyed the class a great deal.<br>
<br>
However, because the two people I was stuck between were so ridiculously well-geared, it didn't matter that I was better at my class. They were much harder to kill because they had more HPs, and therefore were more desirable in a group. I became downhearted, and began to spend a lot of time soloing, which was neither easy nor fun for that particular class. Eventually I gave up the character altogether and rerolled as a different class, which I played for a few months before I realised that I just missed the old one too much and restored her. Now the two people I was stuck between are higher-levelled and don't play as much, so it's less of an issue. <br>
<br>
I am not particularly rabid about people buying platinum and ebaying characters and so forth, but to say that it doesn't have an effect on anyone else is a little inaccurate. I'm not getting the violins out or anything, but yeah, it made me sad.<br>

Let the people who want to buy plat, buy it. It doesn't truly ruin the economy of the server because the economy is not real: 1) There is unlimited amount of plat that can be accumulated. 2) The unique gear that drops only once is not purchasable. If they want to break the Sony rules that are not really enforced, because I have a suspicion that Sony gets a share of this RL money -- let them. If they get more enjoyment out of getting upgrades with RL money vs. spending countless hours farming (which I'm getting really sick of myself) -- let them. If you just can't stand them buying plat -- report them to Sony and be happy with your game-conscientious self. Their buying plat doesn't not interfere with the RP on the server;  the large influx of plat does not cause insane inflation (I still see prices steadily dropping over a prolonged period of time). Live and let live.<br>
<br>
And if I'm rich and eccentric enough to go to the movies and hire someone to sit next to me and tell me whats going to happen next, why can't I do it? Actually, this analogy is not entirely correct. The real analogy is as follows: I pay to see the movie, but find out that there is a better ending to it than what I was allowed to see. There are a few choices in front of me. A) I say: &quot;Damn it, I guess I'll be content with what I have already seen&quot;; B) I have to sit in the movie theater for weeks at a time and watch some crappy flick that I didn't care for to begin with over and over and over again and then they will let me see the better part of the movie I really wanted to see; C) I pay extra and they will sneak me into the &quot;restricted&quot; section so I can enjoy the better ending.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 966<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/28/03 6:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4286.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buying Platinum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So you leveled all the way from 1 to 55 on your own.

Those paladins that did solo during the hard times do come out better players.  Easily.  They stick out like a sore thumb in among the masses.<br>
<br>
Soloing a paladin to 55 takes a fair bit of skill, mate, a fair bit of knowledge and more than a little abuse of scenery.  I'd like to see you do the same, entirely untwinked, while earning your armour, with no Bazaar, no plat, no eBay, fuck all, with a Ghoulbane up until level 35.<br>
<br>
Welcome to the real world, where not everything is as simple as it seems.  I'd ask you to enjoy your stay, but you won't.<br>

What bothers me are these chars that buy there lvl and buy there gear and than think because i have less valued gear that they are better than me.  They go about flaunting there gear like it makes them better.  the people of gaulty know that gear does not make a char good it is how they are played and when you show your skill you will be respected more and valued for it.<br>
<br>
we really should not knock someone down because they got to the point we wanted to by going a different route which was easier.  They will not feel the same self respect or get the same respect of players as those of us that do it a harder way.  Honesty i veiw this games with rewards of respect.  The more people that respect me for how i play and who i am the more i have accomplished.<br>

Who cares!<br>
Once again, all of you who are against it just can't afford it, it's that simple stop BSing yourself.<br>
Another thing, most people who buy characters now have played for a while and just want a second account or don't want to level another character, there is probably 1% of newbies from all the sold accounts.<br>
In fact you high and mighty people are the people who kill my enjoyment of the game. All those lvl 55 warriors with paper-thin armor just because they went through the game and picked up what they could. I spend 10hours in bazaar making money and getting something and then this paperthin warrior gets an NBG loot in 10min in a group. Is this fair? Hell NO! But for some reason people are so stupid that the greediest system of all times like NBG is still considered worth it in non-friend situations.<br>
So now not only this warrior has crap equipment he also leeches exp and equipment off others. And then there are people who bought those 100k and equipped themselves decently, who contribute a LOT more to the group (don't kid yourself about the 'skill', you can have all the skill you want, without proper gear you will not stand a chance against good geared, average played character)<br>
<br>
The whole attitude is, well if I can't have it nobody else should is retarded, stop it. And if someone says once again that they wouldn't buy 100kpp for 5$ I will laugh in their face. There is about 0.00001% of people in EQ who just want to RP and use it as some kind of a chat system. Guess why EQ survived as long as it did and is still leading? It's not the shitty lore and quest system, not crappy tradeskill system, not infernal xp grinds, it's GEAR! Without it EQ is a graphic ICQ.<br>
<br>
I still get enjoyment (after 4-5 years) out of playing with friends and generally exploring stuff but there are some things I just can't have without an uber-guild. I can't play for many hours every night but I still want some things in game. So for me the answer is clear, if I want pp I will buy pp if I don't I won't but I will never ever bitch at someone for buying it.<br>
For the record, I do have decent gear without buying plat for real money but that's coz I trade a lot.<br>
<br>
In the end what does it matter? It will keep happening, if you are so passionate about it I think the only thing you can do is quit or you will be one disappointed player <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you solo a paladin from 1 to 55 solid, then you are honestly going to be a very bad group paladin.  You won't know how to keep agro, you won't know what other classes are doing, etc. So you're right, you will stick out like a sore thumb.  But not in a good way.<br>
<br>
Hell, I know one shadowknight who ebayed pp for nearly every single piece of armor she has.  Want to know what? She's a damned good shadowknight.  I can't pull taunt off her.<br>
<br>
I've done the 1-60 route with steel weapons, sol-ro armor quests, crusty armor, yadda yadda, so you can toss that argument out on your ear.  Most everyone has struggled through this game in one way or another, those who haven't don't make it very far, no matter how much they're twinked.<br>
<br>
I've found that the determining level for making it just off armor versus having skill is about 15.  Up to that point, you can fake it, your armor carries you through the levels, same with your weapons.  At about 15, even if you're in paludul, you have to start grouping, or learning how to solo beyond tanking and sitting on your ass for 30 minutes recovering. <p>Felitus<br>

NO!! I said that as sarcasm! So many people had come out to say who cares and everybody's jealous that I wondered why have any rules at all. If you read through this, it seems like the majority of the server doesn't care that they are clicking YES to sign a contract when they log in. They don't care what rules they break if a rule is inconvenient to them. <br>
<br>
I still think buying/selling plat is wrong. I still think buying/selling characters is wrong. I was angry because I hold my friends to as high a moral standard as I hold myself. I pointed out in my first post the other reasons I think it's wrong. But really, I don't do it for the same reason I don't shoplift; yeah I could get away with it, but I know it's wrong. Right and wrong aren't always gray areas that depend on your feelings.

You know me some what, you know I have had lots of stuff and gave away lots of stuff. I never bought or sold outside of the confines of FV and in the game. We share a lot of the same principles and ideals of characters. When it all comes down to it does it really matter if people sell or buy stuff RL?<br>
<br>
When I left FnF I gave pretty much all the equipment I had acquired while with them back and then erased a 65th level character with AAs. Not because it was the right thing to do but because it was right for me.<br>
<br>
If people buy plat and gear, even characters here it doesn't lessen the server as a whole as long as the individuals are there for interaction in game.<br>
<br>
We are FV whether we buy or quest and hunt the things we wear and carry. One of the best things about FV is we can gift and trade high end equipment but we have the restriction you can only have one character per account. This is our strength on FV. It allows us to do more and be more than any other server in EQ. <br>
<br>
Our stories and lives are all that much more richer because of the fluke that made them decide to try this crazy experiment.<br>
<br>
I can not imagine playing if I could not occasionally get the opportunity to gift some one with that special item that I know will bring them happiness and joy.<br>
<br>
Rules are set up for three things, to level the playing field in competition: we are not competing against one another. For safety: Well no one can really be hurt, unless they choose to be here in EQ. And to protect the provider (IE: Sony/Interactive or what ever.).<br>

We are competing against the environment.  That is sabotaged by buying platinum.  <br>

<br>
Buyers argue that their play experience is enhanced by buying platinum.  If so, logically, the experience of those who do not is therefore hurt.  Also some people who buy platinum, characters, gear etc. do not learn to play effectively and hamper the play experience of others.<br>

Let me ask you this.  Do you think restrictions of steroids should be lifted in sport?  After all, using steroids only hurts the people who do it and it is their choice.  Or does the integrity of the sports themselves have any meaning.  When something is meant to test an ability should that test be replaced by those willing to inject the most forgein substances?  And, given that some people do get away with using steroids, does that mean the rules should simply be removed because they cannot be enforced 100% effectively? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kundow>Kundow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hugs a Tree</span><br>  Posts: 347<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/29/03 4:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4286.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buying Platinum</span><hr size=1> Heh, for what Ichi said, if I could get 100k for $5.00, yeah, I'd do that.

But hell, spending my $20 on a tank of gas makes me about $200 more, so I think that's a better investment.  Plus, I'd rather save my extra cash, or spend it on comic books, which will still be around, nicely bagged and boarded, and boxed up all nice and safe for me to enjoy a few years down the road.<br>
<br>
I kind of agree that a new player, that bought a bunch of gear is going to suck ass.  Lets see..if I started a level 1, and loaded it with gear...Ranger, yeah, I could pull that off, I know my shit.  Rogue....maybe.  Warrior, most likely.  Magician, probably pretty good.  Anything else.  I'm gonna suck ass at it, and get people killed, and I can admit this.<br>
<br>
Main reason I wont buy plat though, is one of the same reasons I dont do drugs, even though that sounds silly.  I just can't justify spending money that I bust my ass for 40 hours a week, for something intangible.  Say I took my car payment, $125.00, right now, it's buying me a 98 Taurus SE.  If, it was buying me pot, it would just be....wasted...I might as well just take the cash and set it on fire, instead of going through the long complicated process, and dealing with the middleman.  Same as plat.  I might as well just set my cash on fire, because it's not giving me any tangible benefit.<br>
<br>
Although, you could say that my $12.95 a month isn't giving me any tangible benefit, but it's cheaper than going to the movies, and WAY cheaper than the hundreds of dollars a month I was spending going out to clubs before my roomate moved out, and I started playing EQ.<br>

Heh.  Ask Resolution what this solo'd paladin can do.  I knew how to keep aggro as soon as I had Cease.  It just made sense!  You know, you stun a mob, it gets pissed off.  If you blind them, it gets even worse.<br>

What's more, from soloing, I also learned everything that our spells can do.  The limits of them, how fast they cast, how much mana I had, what I could do with it, what I could channel through unslowed.  I also learnt how to operate without any sort of mana regen.  Period.  Also, since soloing is slower, you can bring all your skills up to max level.  What's more, they tend to be better duelers.  You also learn some interesting places as a solo paladin.  Single pulling, for one.  Pathing for another.  You learn aggro ranges very carefully, since when you're alone, you ain't got a cleric behind you.<br>

I have done the whole cloth armour -&gt; VT run.  I'm pretty convinced being untwinked and soloing has made me a far better paladin than I ever could have been being twinked and grouping.
