I would have liked to hear Raile's side of it but it seems that she deleted all of her post.  That alone tells me she has something to hide.  But before she did there are several quotes from her posted.  Doesn't paint her in a good light.  <br>

<br>
To be honest, there is nothing there that gives ample support to the claims made here.  Yes, Raile did take leadership somehow, but the details behind why are still VERY unclear, and the 'why' is the very reason so many people are mad.<br>
<br>
I can note that some people are angry with Raile and some people seem to support her, but what does that mean?  I can note that Fallguy apparently started kicking a bunch of people out of the guild in a fit of rage, but what does that mean?<br>
<br>
It means there are two sides to this story, both here and on their message board.<br>
<br>
The question still lingers:  There is overwhelming, undeniable proof to refute the claim made by Raile to the GM for why she took the guild.  So why is the GM doing nothing?  It happened at the latest on August 2nd, and that was four days ago as of now.<br>
<br>
It would mean that either no GM has logged on in four days, or that the GM simply does not care for this problem any longer.<br>
<br>
If he does not care for the problem, he is either turning a blind eye to a very large problem (unlikely) or there is a stronger reason behind why he gave Raile the guild in the first place.<br>
<br>
Do I believe Raile did this terrible thing to a respectable person who stuck around longer than any other person could be expected to?  Based on reports of her bitchy and selfish personality from my sister, I certainly do not doubt it at all.  This seems to be one of the most despicable things done to someone that I have EVER come across in this game.<br>
<br>
I just want to clearly see what happened through the eyes of people who were involved.  I want to know what happened in the words of someone who was there.  No one on the KotEW message board really say in a direct manner what happened.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to view this from an objective stance.  I'm trying to give Raile what little benift of the doubt she has before crucifying her.<br>
<br>
The facts of the story we are told so far don't entirely add up.  Would you burn the witch when there is reasonable doubt yet to be had?  Apparently, many already have.<br>
<br>
I prefer to draw my own conclutions as based on facts and testimony... not believe every single word as told to me by someone who, apparently, was not involved at the time.   If Aailin comes forth and says he was present for everything... then it will be a different story, but he hasn't claimed anything of the sort.  Add to that the fact that is is apparently misinformed about some of the facts, and I have questions.<br>
<br>
This is a BIG accusation to throw out as far as EQ is concerned (again, one of the most horrible things possible in all respects!!), and it's not something that you should take lightly before passing judgement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krogothbitterstar>KrogothBitterstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/6/03 11:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3817.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raile and the Knights of the Ebon Wolf..</span><hr size=1> Ok looks like I am one of the only people who were in KOTEW who is looking at this board so I will add my piece to this again. <br>
<br>
I was on holiday so I missed all of this incident, things were pretty much fine when I left, not a peep from anyone.<br>
<br>
As far as I know....from what I have asked of friends who were in the guild....<br>
<br>
I think Aailin may have misworded, I am not sure. I believe raile used the reason that she was the first leader in order to justify petitioning for the leadership role. I also believe she used her RL husband (Feelen) who was also in the guild to back her up.<br>
<br>
I am also lead to believe the leadership was transferred without consent or notification to Fallguy or any of the officers. She then proceded to kick most of the guild and whatever.<br>
<br>
Yep Raile deleted most of her posts (havn't looked fully as of yet) . Feelen has also deleted his. I also have yet to see her online since I got back from holiday yesterday.<br>
<br>
-----------------------Typed that half an hour ago-------------<br>
<br>
Here is the best account there is and backs up a lot of what I have been told by friends in the guild at the time who were involved. Will have to decide if you want to take my word on that.<br>

She was not GL, Safron was/still was, and Fall was an officer trying to rebuild the guild. The &quot;why&quot; of her taking back the GL status is unimportant. The known is that she went and had a GM give her back the guild that she founded, which they will do, and probably by their judegement, is what they have to do since she did found the guild. They will advise the other people to start a new guild, as she has some kind of rights to the guild name. The reason she did this is not relevant, it is the fact that she did it at all which condemns her. <br>
<br>
Also just because she founded the guild doesn't mean that she couldn't have been voted out. Some guilds have a voted on leadership. I know of two on my old server that did. You think that the two statements are mutually exclusive when they don't have to be. No reason both statements can't be totally true and completely valid.<br>

What was hidden was proof to what a two faced liar she is among other things. <br>
<br>
I followed KOTEW boards because when Fallguy was leader, Mithril Blade along with two other guilds had formed an alliance. I have watched Fallguy stay strong through much of the strife that goes with leadership of a guild. I have watched him make mistakes  (like all of us do) and immediately rectify them. He was alone for a long time and yet did not walk away from KOTEW. His loyality to his guild alone speaks volumes of his worthiness  to gain control of it back. <br>
<br>
 I have no doubt in my own mind that Raile is wrong in what she did and I back Fallguy in his efforts to get back which I feel is rightfully his.  <br>

(I have no way of knowing if she deleted entire posts yet)<br>
<br>
But, it is a claim that should be discussed now that it has been brought up.<br>
<br>
Raile made her post announcing her being the new leader of KotEW was made 8/2/2003 - 4:36 PM PST<br>
<br>
No posts by Raile have been edit after this date (unless I foolishly overlooked one)<br>
<br>
She did edit some things on 7/31, posts initially made on 7/19, 7/29, 7/30... maybe more.<br>
<br>
Everything I read seems to lead me to believe that Raile went back and deleted all her posts concerning major disorder within the guild (that she seems to be a cause of) but nothing concerning the accusations made here about guild stealing.<br>
<br>
The links given by Krogoth Bitterstar are about Fallguy and his (admittedly bad) decision to kick people out of the guild, but again, it's only a minor hint toward what happened.<br>
<br>
Why were these people kicked out?  Fallguy said: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>people were considering leaving and joining Sams guild, I became bitter, when I asked who was leaving? I was not prepared to hear that it was my most loyal and trusted friends. My anger raged like a volcano, reason and patience went out the window I was in a rage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This seems to have happened around 7/29 to 7/30<br>
<br>
Are you telling me that, after Raile claimed that Fallguy had left, the GM could not plainly see that Fallguy had been active as a leader very recently, nor could he see the petitions from Fallguy after?<br>
<br>
That's bullshit.  So much to support the idea that no GM would have switched and refused to switch back the leadership over the reason &quot;Fallguy left&quot;.<br>
<br>
So what are we missing?  Why did the GM switch leadership, and why won't he switch it back?<br>

<br>
Are you against ALL forms of GM intervention to take leadership of a guild?  If you are not, it leads to conclude that you would feel there are reasons when it is justified, which counters your own point that the reason is not relevant.<br>
<br>
Are you kidding me?!  The reason Fallguy himself gave for why the people were kicked out of the guild was because he heard a RUMOR that they were leaving to another guild!  Sorry, and I'm sure that Fallguy is a nice guy and all (who else would stick around a one man guild for so long) but that is not the action of a good or responsible leader, and it would be actions I would think a GM could consider 'destructive for the guild'.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>known is that she went and had a GM give her back the guild that she founded, which they will do, and probably by their judegement, is what they have to do since she did found the guild<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Accually, Cuellari would have been the founding leader, and if GMs do will give back guilds based on nothing more than founding leader (which is crap if they do!) then what claim does Raile have?  Or does it only have to be 'founding account'?  I don't ask this to drill you, and do so out of honest curiosity.  I don't mean to attack you or anyone, only to try and find out the truth.<br>

First off, from the story Aailin gave, she was not voted out of leadership, she was simply never voted leader to begin with, and that is why she wanted revenge.

<br>
These statements do not refute the (strong) possibility that Raile did infact steal the guild four days ago, but it does directly contradict the claims Aailin made in intially bringing this topic here. It makes it seem like he does not fully know what happened.<br>
<br>
And yet his testimony is all anyone has concerning the stealing of this guild.<br>
<br>

<br>
I seemed to have been misinformed on one point and that was the founding of KOTEW.<br>
<br>
Of the 10 ppl who founded it several wanted the title of GL.  Eventually Cueelari (Raile's first incarnation) was made GL and it was shortly there after (a matter of a few weeks from what I understand) that she stepped down and gave Safron the GL title where Safron kept it even when she went into her coma.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is this.  Raile used a time of upheavel in the guild and a time where Fallguy was trying to rectify mistakes he made, to seize power.  She then deguilded those members of KOTEW, planning to start anew.<br>
<br>
Gm's gave her the title because her RL husband who is known as Faeleen also petitioned backing the story and as Fallguy was not available from what I heard there was no one to refute the claim.  I still think the GM must have been assinine to do something w/o knowing all the details.  Furthermore Gm's have no right getting involved in internal affairs of a guild.  They are not here to judge who is fit to be leader and who isn't.  I mean imagine the trouble that could cause.<br>

The fact that the guild was taken via petition during a time when Fall was not around is bull. Anyone who is willing to do such a under handed thing is just gross. <br>

<br>
If all that is said is in truth, then all the people who are angry at Raile/Feelen should be equally upset at the GM.  Raile might have been a sleezy waste of humanity to try this in the first place, but the GM was the power that let her.<br>
<br>
As it is, I see two things:<br>
<br>
The story we are told of the GM giving leadership to Raile due to Fallguy being gone a few days is not correct<br>
<br>
Or the GM who did this is totally incompetent.  I believe GMs have the right to interfere in guild affairs, but only for VERY strong reasons (ie, guild leader quits the game but does not relinquish leadership for an extended period of time, guild leader displays an attitude through actions of using his/her role as leader to 'grief' the guild)   Being gone for three days is not ample reason by any sence, and kicking five people (who seemed to have been troublemakers) is not ample reason unless there is something much deeper behind it (which there does not seem to be.<br>
<br>
In any case, the matter of Rasaoakleaf's identity could prove to be highly relevant to this.<br>
<br>
At first I recognized the possibility that he was Fallguy.  I knew he re-rolled and had a rough rememberance of the new name.  Now that I have read of Feelen, I think it is far more likely he is Rasaoakleaf.  Isn't it just perfect that both have similar names and that both are closely related to the name I can't quite remember?<br>
<br>
If Rasaoakleaf turns out to be one of these two, it could potentially mean something.<br>
<br>
Or maybe he is neither.

I agree the GM did a lousy job here not even following up on it.<br>
<br>
ALso as for rasooakleaf he was also known as Drek I believe.  Drek left EQ a while back.  He and Raile disliked each other immensely so I'm guessing thats not him.

Panthero refused to do so out of spite. So we were forced to make a whole new guild. Bottom line: From what I experianced a month ago, that GM had no business making the switch in leadership. Whether or not Raile made the guild or not..she was not GL before Safron left, nor was she when she was reinvited.

But Fallguy, have you considered re-forming your guild under a name that honors Safron?  Could be a positive thing coming out of a truly ugly situation.<br>
<br>
I don't get to play on FV much, but it sounds like the name of the Knights has been pretty thoroughly run into the ground at this point.  You might want to give Raile the gift of living with her own creation, while you and your friends go on to make something new, and still remember and honor your friend and the importance of the original Knights. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mediaservice.photoisland.com/auction/May/2003517426396415772"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END-->[/image]</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=antoinnolouj>AntoinNolouj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EQ doesn't drain your brain, honest.</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/6/03 3:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3817.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Don't shoot the GM.

<br>
It has been stated multiple times now that the first leader of the Guild, when it was formed, was Raile's first incarnation.  She was the FIRST GL.  No matter WHO you change it over to, THAT ACCOUNT is flagged as the guildleader, NOT JUST the character.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the owner of the ACCOUNT can take back leadership of the guild any time it pleases.<br>

<br>
My only reasoning that I can give for why this is true is in cases where the person who has been given the leadership misuses it and refuses to give it back. <p>--Captain Antoin Nolouj<br>
