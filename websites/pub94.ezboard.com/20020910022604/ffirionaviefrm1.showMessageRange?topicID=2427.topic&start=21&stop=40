Not the gnomes though.  A few tons of gnomish fireworks and mount Kaladim does all the work for 'em.  Dwarves aren't even a prospect.<br>

I think the Iksar would defeat the gnomes though.  Sure, not every gnome would die...the cowards would port out...but in an all out battle the Iksar would win.  Regeneration, superior tactics, glory for the whole over the individual.  The Iksar would fight until it was clear they could not win, then keep fighting because there is nothing left for them to do.<br>

The humans would probably win, freeport may fall, since they have no human-cousins near them, but im pretty sure the erudites and barbarians would join with the humans, and the fact that there is too much internal struggle doesent mean much, people will abandon that quickly enough when their whole race is threatened. <p><center>

Then if they win or split to fight dwarves and gnomes they must travel thru Greater Fay and deal with 2 elven nations (mind you not the greatest but quite efficient) and then seperate again to deal with this new front or kill what they could and move on. By then the gnomes would have had immeasurable time to defend their homelands and may have gotten RoS in to let them avenge and right what they felt was a wrong long ago and therefor eliminate the iksar menace. <br>
<br>
A war is not over till the enemy is strewn across the field and none survive to come back and seek revenge or there is a treaty with of course servitude to the victor by the loser. <br>
Of course these are just the rambling thoughts of a Halfelf. It would be glorious to see the balance of this outcome.<br>
<br>
*EDIT- No side would have solitude as each would seek allies and have had scouts assessing an armies movements and watch it tactics target leaders and eliminate those in charge thru assassinations to allow Chaos to fill the ranks of their enemies. Cut the head from a snake/ Iksar it can no longer bite you and the body rots in the sun.<br>

The Vah Shir would control Luclin.  The Iksar would control Kunark.  Humans (Erudites) would rule Odus. Why?  Cause the first thing I would do is destroy the spires (why leave the backdoor open).  With all the spires gone...no one is going to get to Luclin.  Kunark as only accessible by boat which would be easily defendable when only point of entry is at FV.  Odus would be easily taken over and controlled by the Erudites.<br>
<br>
The Humans would take over the majority of Antonica.  The Ogres and Trolls would get pushed back to their swamps and left to fight it out between them with the Ogres eventually winning that fight.  The Barbarians and would invade Surefall Glade, Jagged Pine, and Black Burrow.  They would blow the entrances and be left in peace by their distant relatives the Humans.<br>
<br>
The battle for Faydwer would be great!  The gnomes would come out of their hole and start putting the smackdown on everyone.  The Wood Elves would be annihilated quickly when one of the gnomes nukes catches GF on fire and burns Kelethin to the ground.  The High Elves of Felwithe could either blow the entrance or fight it out....eventually losing.  And lastly the Dwarves could also blow the pass or fight.  If they fought they would eventually get pushed back into Kaladim or on a boat off to Velious.<br>
<br>
One big question would be the Dark Elves.  I dont think they would be wiped out, because they have a wide scope of classes and Neriak is a quite formidable fortress, but come to think about it....they just might be able to wipe out the humans.  Think about it....The Freeport human would be attacked by the DE from the West, and the Ogres and trolls from the South which would mean Freeport is gone.  The DE would make a truce with the Ogres and Trolls to leave them be (who really wants to live in a swamp anyway) and would turn their attention to Qeynos.  <br>
<br>
Qeynos in the meantime has been attack by the Barbarians and Half Elves.  When the DEs show up the Barbarians and HE pull back to their homelands and blow the entrances.  being battered and beaten, the Qeynos Guard falls to the DEs in mere hours.<br>
<br>
Just my vision...<br>

They have a lot of territory including Highpass Hold., The Bridge fort between north and south Karana which gives them control over the Wizard spire to Luclin. <br>
<br>
The Karanas are dotted with their fortresses. They have no enemies strong enough to challenge them. Surefall is actually an extension of Qeynos. A raid by the barbarians would cause a lot of damage but would become unsustainable. <br>
<br>
Odus could not attack except by sea. Not sure anymore but I think the boat from Qeynos has the flag of that city on it. <br>
<br>
The Bertox worshipers would be a problem but not enough to alter the outcome.<br>
<br>
After all Antonica is named after the rulers of Qeynos.<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, there are not enough gnomes to make much of an impact. Iksar would be bled white invading Antonica.<br>
<br>
I agree with one of the previous posters, Freeport would fall to a combined attack from the Teir Dal, the Ogres and the Trolls who would ally. They would Drive the surviving humans to Highpass where they would stop the advance. Hard to lay seige when Kithcor turns bad at night.<br>
<br>
The Teir Dal army with its allies would then leave a force in the West Commons to keep the humans bottled up and turn their attention to their ancestral enemies. They would take the boats to Faydwer and get involved in a long and protracted war there. The ogers were driven off the continent by the Dwarves and they would basically destroy each other, neither race has the numbers to make much of a difference alone. The gnomes would support the Light Elves and be enough to defeat the Teir Dal, unless Mistmoore came in on the Teir Dal side, if that was the case Faydwer falls to the Teir Dal who leave southern Antonica to the surviving Trolls and Ogers who lack the organization and numbers to expand their territory much further.<br>
<br>
Qeynos captures Whisp Isle and holds it against any agression from Odus, but it never comes since the two cites there destroy each other in a magical blast.<br>
<br>
Cats remain supreme on Luclin and the Iks on Kunark, the Lightbringer fortress of Fironia Vie after a very long seige remains unconquered. I hate those flying critters and it is a pretty well defended area. Only challenge would be from a Teir Dal attack by sea after the fall of Faydwer. But I see the survivors of the Teir Dal victory in Faydwer fleeing to FV or possibly Velious where we get the Ice Elves and the Dwarves moving into Thurgadin. The gnomes seeing the writing on the wall make a seperate peace with the Teir Dal and retain akanon. Overthere falls to Iksar assault, but it is more costly than expected. Iksar fleet lands in Antonica after theTeir Dal take Faydwer, Long war but Iksar capture Freeport ruins, Grobb and Oggok with the assistance of Cazic Thule. They also capture the Commons East and West but cannot enter Nektulos forest and leave that city of the Teir Dal alone. (Keep in mind that the Teir Dal also hold, Befallen and Najena, and Mistmoore soon after the start of the war)<br>
<br>
An assault on Highpass also fails and resistance from the surviving Ogres and Trolls in the Rathe Mountains prevents any further invasion.<br>
<br>
An Iksar assault on Faydwer is also defeated by the Teir Dal.<br>

<br>
&quot;Freeport would fall to a combined attack from the Teir Dal, the Ogres and the Trolls who would ally. They would Drive the surviving humans to Highpass where they would stop the advance.&quot;<br>
<br>
I cant see anyone being able to make it to Highpass by going directly thru the Teir Dal army.  Highpass would fall, it would just be whenever the Teir Dall got around to it.  The Guard in Highpass already have problems with the Gnolls, Orcs, and goblins there.  You add an army of DEs they got no chance.<br>
<br>
As Far as Qeynos goes, it would also fall to the Teir Dal.  As one can plainly see that the Teir Dall are very resourceful with recruiting the local refuse (ambassador D'vinn and Crushbone Orcs), they would more than likely use the same tactics before attacking Qeynos.  They would employ the assistance of gnolls of Splitpaw and Blackburrow.  I can see it now Fippy (or whatever his name) is seen charging Qeynos for the  billionth time, but whats that....oh $#!%....CLOSE THE GATES....CLOSE THE GATES...!!!<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, the Qeynos outpost at the bridge between NK and SK.....gone.  There isnt a big enough force there to stop a Teirdal army on one side and the Splitpaw gnolls on the other.<br>
<br>
Sorry to say but Humankind outside of the ones on Odus and outposts on Luclin wouldnt fair to well.<br>

<br>
But seriously, humans win if united, no questions.  They have controll of the spires, and massive luclin fortifications... Katta Castelum with Shadowhaven could smash the hapless Vah Shir into the dust, with Seru forces fortifying the various spires.  Once the Vah Shir are done with, the Katta and Shadowhaven troops can begin leading skirmishing raiders, and start an invasion force from North Karana.  They, with the Highpass folks, can take out Rivervale, then lay siege to Neriak until Freeport can get there.  Now you've got five human cities to attack Neriak, so that handles the dark elves.  The ogres and trolls can beat each other up, leaving the remaining human forces to clear the barbarians out of Antonica.  That leaves the humans with two continents, and the ability to hit any of the others.<br>

As proven by this thread, everyone forgets the haflings. Rivervale goes untouched, and masses a huge army of, rogues, ranges, pallies, warriors, druids, and clerics. They lay low the entire war race, and when all the races are weakened from the battle, they come out of their hills, and take over. They have more than enough raw damage, and the massive ammount of halfling druids out there can provide enough firepower.<br>
<br>
I don't know enough about Luclin to know what would be going on up there though. <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:Shadow(Color=Purple, Direction=225)"><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=197567 ">Gntik Littleblade</B></a>

Your consequence is -$12+ / month.<br>
<br>
Someone said earlier that disabling the spires meant that no one could get to Luclin. They fail to realize that level 59 Wizards get to transport to Nexus easily, as part of their alternate advancement. I could just imagine it now; groups of Wizards of no one race in particular, sent to lay waste to Shar Vahl, Shadow Haven, and other populated outposts on Luclin with Mana Burn. If enough Wizards were sent, all that would be left of Luclin is a wasteland. But if you're not counting that, then yeah, the Vah Shir could rest easily while the Norrath races were destroying each other.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I think that the races would divide in terms of deity. It would ultimately come down to good (Brell, Tunare, Marr, Quellious, etc.) versus evil (Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, Bert, etc.), with neutral (the Tribunal, Solusek Ro, Veeshan, etc.) characters sticking amongst themselves or assisting either side. I would say that the goodly races would end up winning, since there seems to be more of them than evils. If we were including NPC races (such as the Orcs, Frogloks, and so on), they'd probably represent their own respective empires, and not join any one side.<br>
<br>
I don't see a Paladin of Tunare cutting down a Paladin of Mithaniel Marr for no reason except that it's an all-out war. There'd definitely be factions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 563<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 1:05:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not quite</span><hr size=1> Iksar would not join up with &quot;evils&quot;...they would remain seperate unless their god came down and gave them a direct order to join up with those they would normally despise. Iksar would represent their own Empire and would likely not join any side if such a thing were to occur, although if for some reason they did, I see them being more likely to temporarily join up with the goods. (Which is what happend during the PvP RPing events on this server, heheh.)<br>
<br>
Assuming the Iksar did reclaim some of Kunark so they wouldn't have to walk through enemy territory to launch any attacks, I still believe they have a very good chance of conquering Norrath. Their the most organized and military minded race on Norrath, and in my opinian, 1000 Iksar could defeat 2000 humans just do to superior tactics and organazation. I could be wrong, but that is how it seems to me.<br>
<br>
It's a fun thing to think about isn't it? *smiles* <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/27/02 1:08:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucpete2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>c pete2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 1:33:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not quite</span><hr size=1> Buran plays Risk i see... <p><br><center><br><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pete3great/"><b>I too now have a Livejournal.</b></a><center><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelindale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelindale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 7:31:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not quite</span><hr size=1> *Thinks Zildrax is Iksar crazy*<br>

It would definitly pose a nasty obstacle, but one big giant blast doesn't win a war...<br>

As for the beer tactic...Iksar don't do thievery, so that tactic would not work. So there.
