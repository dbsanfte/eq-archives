<br>
<br>
Mystyre swept into the room, a slight furrow on her left brow betraying her long practiced calm demeanor.  Only close observation would reveal the flaw but there was no one in the room to observe.  Mystyre paused a moment, taken back by the emptiness.  She looked at the newly made bed and quietly reached out to stroke the pillow, her freshly manicured fingernails leaving the slightest indentation. Life still existed in this room of the dead.  <br>
<br>
Mystyre stood for a moment lost in thought until a flicker of light caught her eye.  She turned to the dresser and noticed a glass unicorn refracting a ray of sunlight that invaded the room through a small crack in the heavy velvet drapes.  She crossed the room to pick the trinket up trying to remember, but the memory dissipated like a wisp of fog not yet fully formed and now gone.   She picked up the glass unicorn and examined it carefully.  Her lips formed a derisive smirk.  “Child’s play,” she muttered as she dropped the unicorn to the floor.<br>
<br>
The expected sound of shattering glass was replaced by a thud and an outraged scream.  “Ouch!  That hurt!”  Seducia, no longer a girl yet not quite a woman, sprawled ungraciously on the floor rubbing her hip.  <br>
<br>
“Not nearly enough,” Mystere replied without a trace of guilt in her voice.  “Such sloppy work wouldn’t fool a blind beggar from across the room.  You’re lucky all you got was a good bouncing on the floor.”<br>
<br>
Seducia stood up slowly, choking back her indignant response.  It had been a good illusion and she knew it.   In the three days since her mother died not one of the busy people cleaning the room and making arrangements had noticed her there on the dresser.  She’d heard more than she could comprehend and understood less than she wanted.  But she dared not tell Mystyre or she’d get more than a good bouncing.  Seducia threw her shoulders back and returned the elder enchantress’ icy stare.  <br>
<br>
“You reveal too much, child.  The face is still, but your thoughts race and it shows in your eyes.  Still your mind.”  <br>
<br>
“Still your tongue you old hag” raced through Seducia’s mind and before she could realize her folly she was reeling from a stinging slap to her face.   Seducia covered her cheek with her hand and looked away.<br>
<br>
“Don’t expect pity from me, child.” A coldness hardened Mystyre’s voice and she grew quieter with each word.  “Anyone else, but never from me.  Now still your mind and look at me.”  Seducia hesitated.  “DO IT!” Mystyre commanded in a soft icy whisper.  <br>
<br>
Seducia turned and looked at Mystyre, but her inner resolve had crumbled.  The strain of holding her illusion for three days coupled with hunger, humiliation and the stinging pain from both her face and her hip overwhelmed her.  Seducia fell in a heap to the floor.  <br>
<br>
“You are too hard on the girl!”  A distortion in the air materialized into an older version of the enchantress, past her prime but showing the same radiant beauty Mystyre still possessed in its fullness.   “She is still a child,” Allure said with a tenderness in her voice Mystyre could never emulate.<br>
<br>
“She has no time to remain a child.”  Mystyre lifted the unconscious Seducia from the floor as if she were still a glass unicorn and easily broken.  Gently she placed the girl on the bed and sat down next to her, stroking Seducia’s hair out of her face. <br>
<br>
Allure sat down in the large over-stuffed chair opposite the bed.  “We must buy her time, then,” she said placing her finger tips together and staring at the pyramid her hands made.  “Does anyone else know you found her?”<br>
<br>
“Not yet, but they will,” Mystere responded still stroking the child’s hair.  <br>
<br>
“We have until then.”<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
“The art of illusion is in the details, Seducia.   I remember the night Fraillen broke the horn off the unicorn.  It was beautifully repaired, but even the best glass smith could not hide the flaw entirely.  You must show the flaws if you want the illusion to be convincing.”  Mystyre resisted the urge to pace and stood calmly before her student.  <br>
<br>
“But it held for three days!”  Seducia argued believing that even if she practiced all night she still wouldn’t get it right.  “I just want to go to bed.”<br>
<br>
“No one looked, child.  People see what they want to see, especially when they are busy.  Showing people what they want to believe will only last so long.  The minute someone really looks, the illusion will shatter.”<br>
<br>
Allure looked up from her embroidery.  “Even with flaws, some illusions still shatter.  The trick is not to shatter with them,” she added.   “You must learn not to shatter when your illusion does.”<br>
<br>
Seducia screamed in frustration.  “Show them what they want, don’t show them what they want.  Be perfect but add flaws.  Shatter but don’t shatter.  THERE!”  Seducia took the unicorn and threw it against the wall only this time the glass did shatter into tiny pieces.  “Ooops, it shattered, it must have been an illusion.”<br>
<br>
“You little bitch!”  Mystyre ran to the wall where the unicorn had hit and began frantically picking up the glass shards.   One of the shards cut Mystyre’s hand and she dropped them to the floor, putting the cut into her mouth and sucking to stop the bleeding.  <br>
<br>
Seducia stood in shock, terrified by what she had done and more terrified by what Mystyre would do to punish her.  Allure put her embroidery down and said quietly “It is time.”  <br>
<br>
Mystyre looked at Allure and then at Seducia who held her stare ready for whatever she deserved.  Mystyre nodded and left the room headed to the back of the small cottage.  Time stopped for Seducia who spent that eternal moment in absolute silence watching the illusions around her begin to break down.  This was not her home.  These were not her teachers.  This was not her life.  Not anymore.  Somehow Seducia knew even before Mystyre returned holding a letter signed by her mother.  <br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
The pack on Seducia’s back weighed far less than her purse, which carried no coin.  Inside her purse was her entire life – a single piece of parchment on which her destiny was written in an ink she could only read but not decipher.  She felt no sorrow as she turned to leave the cottage.  She felt no loss as she looked up to the window in the castle, the room where her mother had died.  The land looked unfamiliar, like a storybook land.   The memories it held were only fairy-tales told to young children.  <br>
<br>
A hand grabbed her shoulder as she began to walk down the path.  She turned.  Mystyre stood before her, not even a slight furrow on her left brow to betray her thoughts.  Mystyre grabbed Seducia by the hair, pulled her face close and kissed Seducia long and hard on the mouth.   <br>
<br>
Still holding Seducia’s hair, Mystyre pulled her back and looked deep into her eyes.   “Shed no tears for another soul, and even fewer for your own.” <br>
<br>
Mystyre let go of Seducia and turned back to the cottage.  Seducia stood for a moment staring after the departing figure.  With the back of her hand she wiped the kiss from her mouth and started on her journey.<br>
