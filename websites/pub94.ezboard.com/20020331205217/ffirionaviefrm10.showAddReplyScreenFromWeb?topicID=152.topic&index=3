What the hell?... Was Innoruuk controling it or something?.. Nah. It always chased her, today it just seemed more specific. Puzuzu glared at the stupid wolf. The damn thing was like a cow, so stupid it will not excape under the old fence without a will, it just munches on the grass until it is slaughtered. The dog would surely see his death if he messed with the already maddened necromancer. Did it care? probally not.. It howled then charged at Puzuzu's feet.. Grabbing on to her grey robe and pulling her down. It attempted to atleast. Puzuzu started to try and kick it in the neck.. finaly after many failed tries she succeeded kicking it right in the middle of the neck. Hoping she made it feel it the dog seemed to quit gnarling at her and sat down.. It started whining in utter pain. Puzuzu kicked it hard in the stomach killing it. It gave one last whine before dieing. <br>
<br>
Not looking back at the black wolf Puzuzu turned the corner to her underground house. Opening the door with the Innoruuk symbol on it, she spat at it, and walked down the stairs that lead to the floor of the house. Her mother was washing some robes and her father seemed to be deep in meditation. Puzuzu groaned loudly enough to get her mother's attention, &quot;What is wrong dear?&quot; The necromancer sat down pityfully like usuall, &quot;You will get your dinner, just be patient.&quot; her mother scoffed at her while trying to speed up. &quot;It's not that..&quot; Puzuzu muttered to herself, &quot;I am Innoruuk's little 4000th year sacrafice.. thats all.&quot; The pot dropped out of &quot;mom's&quot; hand... it interupted her father who had a growl on his face. &quot;YOU WHAT?&quot; Her mother screeched.. Puzuzu rolled her eyes, &quot;I am the god damn chosen one to be sacraficed to Innoruuk, ok? As in 4000th year chosen one?&quot; Her father's expression changed quickly from a maddened face to a awed glare... &quot;MY Puzuzu?... Our daughter?&quot;<br>
<br>
~Bleh.~ Puzuzu thought to herself. ~Just as I thought.~<br>
<br>
Her father put his arm around her and sat down... &quot;Our family? Our daughter?.. &quot; The mother had tears in her eyes... Puzuzu DID NOT want this type of attention at all.. here they were, proud of her when usually they were very ashamed. Always mocking her, whipping her and the such. But today they were pretty much worshiping her, muttering to themselves about how important it was, they couldn't get over it. &quot;Guys, chill out!&quot; She yelled... &quot;CHILL OUT?&quot; Her father laughed slamming his fist on the table, &quot;Out of all honor, I have finally got what I have deserved... What I have owed to Innoruuk...&quot; Puzuzu was confused, &quot;But I thought you hated Innoruuk?&quot; He shook his head, &quot;No. Not until I have realized how amazing he actually is, ok?&quot; Puzuzu gave a pouty face, &quot;I will not die for this bastard.&quot; It made her parents immediatly back up.. they had blank stares..<br>
<br>
Puzuzu didn't care. She thought they would help. But no. The odds went aggainst the favored... She kicked the door open and walked out... seeing the same black wolf once again on the ground motionless. Soon her body would be like that, stupid, non-aware, motionless... NO! She couldn't. What about her dreams of becoming a warlock?.. &quot;I will succeed in what I have been wanting for the past 4 years.&quot; She said sternly to herself. How would she bribe these people? How could she change their minds?.. She had to do something that would amaze them..<br>

She was related to Hydrokronik the Dreaded. Even Innoruuk wouldn't mess with him... Hydro has been to the evil Void.. and tooken hold of the black magick. Less then 10 warlocks had their hands on it, and lesser had the power or knowledge to control it. Many went to self destruction, dedicating their souls to it just like Xell, the creator did, then once they had used the black magick they were turned to ashes. But Hydrokronik had stayed strong... The magick had tried to control him but it always failed. Hydro only had used it once in killing some of his worst foes. Puzuzu was just a normal failing necromancer... The warlock's most pathetic spells could kill her instantly. But she didn't care.. If she worked for it she could grab it.<br>
<br>
Where was Hydrokronik though?... The last she had heard of him was he had married a Pure One, Sakurajosui the high elven cleric. Then went off somewhere and caused destruction... He was one of the most confusing people to figure out. One of the few who knew Xell well enough to talk to him normally with comparable powers... Since Xell's death he had been on a revenging streak. He wanted to somehow gain control over the magick of the Void and turn it towards making evil more powerful. He had respect for Innoruuk though... That was the downfall. <br>
<br>
Since she did not want to return home because that was pretty much suicidal she walked towards the gates of Neriak... Pulling over her long black cloak she treaded out. Many guards glared at her but did not bug her much.. They just took her as some useless lonely beggar. Puzuzu didn't care... She already was that way practically. <br>
<br>
The cold air of Nektulos bit on her face. She poked her face out of the corner seeing the handsome Tdail giving orders to some of those weird stone men. &quot;I want you to search out for Puzuzu the necromancer... We must sacrafice her at once or Innoruuk will not be pleased.&quot; Puzuzu knew Tdail could see invisibility but the stupid stonemen couldn't... After he walked off towards his watching area she quickly casted the smoky spell on herself then ran quickly towards the bridge. <br>
<br>
After a long tread of avoiding black wolves, undead, and other younger necromancers she finally made it to the log. The log where she, in her earlier days had fought for her life to survive. Now she just laughed at the snakes, firebeetles, occasional wolf cubs, and other things that crawled all over it. Remembering the errands of killing the silk for her guild. How stupid she had been to serve them. Walking over and noticing her invisibility fade she grabbed hold of a spiderling and crushed it with her bare hands... &quot;Soon.. This is how those Innoruuk following whores shall fall.&quot; A young necromancer cringed at seeing the spider blood all over her hands... Puzuzu just laughed and kicked the necro in the stomach... &quot;Curse you and Innoruuk.. Curse you.&quot; The necromancer was shaking all over... This is what she wanted them all to be doing. Realizing how pathetic she was at causing anger to such pathetic things she ran off... the necro's friends came over to help the hurt dark elf. &quot;That was Puzuzu... We better report her.&quot; One of them said.. <br>
<br>
Puzuzu had about 3 or 4 black wolves barking at her... She was running quickly as she could towards the bridge... Pulling her hood over herself yet again she walked on the bridge. Hoping the guards would kill the wolves first before attempting to capture her she went on without haste. She was right... Once all the wolves had howled their last howls the guards started chasing her. She was almost out. Once she had left the passage way that lead into the forest the guards would be too scared to leave their spots. She hoped anyways...<br>
<br>
&quot;Puzuzu!! Get back here!&quot; They roared... Armor clammering and all. Puzuzu laughed to herself, what energy they were wasting. Not showing any sign of tire she went on running. Seeing the light of the Commonlands she ran towards the hillside that lead towards Freeport. She climbed the deadly height and arrived on top of the mountain. The guards were still after her. Puzuzu groaned annoyingly as the fools struggled up the mountain side. She yelled at them.. &quot;Your armor is too heavy, your weapons too big.. fools!&quot; Flipping them off as they slid back down and ran back into Nektulos. But some shadowknights arrived... &quot;Uh oh.&quot; Clammering to her feet she ran towards Freeport.. Sliding down the mountain side and onto the wall she walked.. It was a long brick wall but the shadowknights stayed out of the guard's eye.<br>
<br>
After 20 minutes of balancing and stress she made it to 'safe point'. Jumping off the wall she struggled, breathing heavily, and running into the city. Many humans threw dust at her. &quot;Worthless peice of trash necromancers... go sacrafice yourself to Innoruuk you self destructing bastards.&quot; Some stupid young mage said. Puzuzu thought, what a brave idiot.. She ran towards him with her black dagger and struck him in the heart with no haste. Quickly pulling it out of his chest she ran towards East Freeport...  Noone really hesitated except a couple walked over.. &quot;What a fool.. Never mock the dark elves at such a age...&quot; They left him dieing and decaying.. <br>
<br>
Puzuzu ran through the streets and passage ways until she arrived at the docks.. A guard stopped her. &quot;Why would a dark elf be heading over the ocean? Nothing welcomes you here between the gnome city ya know.&quot; She shrugged... &quot;I am just a rebel.. I am leaving my city in search of someone. CLASSIFIED.&quot; She said sternly. The guard shrugged, &quot;Whatever... Don't cause trouble is all I care about.&quot; Puzuzu ran across the wooden planks and rested at the edge. She never realized how tired she was. The scorching sun was setting. A human monk, half elven ranger, and a dark elven necromancer were there. Noone interesting. The dark elf seemed to be of high status... Puzuzu bowed towards him and gave a simple, &quot;Hi..&quot; The dark elf glared coldy at her, &quot;Yuin is the name, what do you want, scum?&quot; She shrugged then asked, &quot;Do you know Hydrokronik the D--&quot; &quot;Of course I know Him.. What makes you think I don't?... Not a Defiler for nothing ya know?&quot; He was a chatty one.. &quot;DO you know WHERE he is???&quot; Yuin laughed, &quot;Of course I do, you think I'm some dummy?... Crushbone, stupid. Not a Defiler for nothing ya know?&quot; Puzuzu groaned, &quot;Ok thanks... Do you know when the boat gets here?&quot; Yuin seemed pretty laid back, guess he hadn't talked in awhile, &quot;Duh. I do. 10 minutes maybe. Not a Defiler for nothing ya know?&quot; The half elf chuckled....<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you quit saying that?&quot; Puzuzu said slowly... Yuin shook his head, &quot;I am a Defiler, and proud of my rank ya know?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you make conversation with yourself or something?&quot; The human monk asked... The half elf added, &quot;Yes.. You are pretty good at it...&quot; Puzuzu gave the glare.. &quot;I agree.... What if we don't care if you are a Defiler?&quot; That shutted Yuin up. He then rolled his eyes, &quot;Because you are boring people, and I worked hard for this rank.&quot; Pulling out a flask of black hellish smoke Puzuzu backed up, &quot;WHERE did you get that??&quot; Yuin laughed evily, &quot;Puzuzu, you were supposed to be sacraficed long ago, ya know?... Why the hell do you think I know all this shit about Hydrokronik?.. I'm Yuinapherius the Tormenter of COURSE.&quot; That made the other 2 back up and jump into the water. Puzuzu lifted her eyebrow, &quot;Oh I see... Well, I'm related to Hydrokronik the Dreaded, so HA.&quot; Yuin shrugged.. &quot;Like I care. Many people are. Doesn't make you special, well... You are in a way. BUT has NOTHING to do with my friend.&quot; <br>
<br>
Puzuzu turned away from him, &quot;WELL, Yuinapherius... Want to help me get to him?&quot; Yuin glared hard at her back.. &quot;No, Puzuzu, and call me YUIN, scum.&quot; Least he called her by her name.. She was silent the whole time. Finally the boat arrived and on board she hopped... Sitting down she began to meditate. Yuin seemed alittle more good looking in the light, she noticed he had the same scythe as Hydrokronik and a  horrifying robe. Yuin shrugged at her. Puzuzu shook her gaze away from him and glared at the endless ocean... Watching as the boat slowly descended from Freeport. <p><table><tr><td><img src="http://user.netomia.com/puzuzu/reap.jpg" alt="Reaper"></td><td><p><b>I walk in the black ashes of the graveyard... the full moon is like white in black.<br>The reaper has sliced my soul, that black hellish feeling has returned.. <br>Decaying and eating away at my spirit and soul.

The moon shown bodly, a half moon... She always wondered where the other half faded to. She squinted hard trying to see it, but to no avail, she failed. &quot;Stupid moon.&quot; She scorned. &quot;Why do people call it Luclin?&quot; She thought she was asking herself but Yuin was still there... &quot;I heard rumors of catlike creatures on there called Vah Shirs.&quot; Puzuzu bolted up.. Yuin was laying right next to her. *Ok.... When did this guy become so bored?* &quot;Vah Shirs?.. What the hell?&quot; Yuin sat up, &quot;Vah Shirs... catlike creatures. Walk on 2 feet, they survive on the moon. Have their own empire after they were driven off the face of Norrath, amazing ain't it?&quot; Puzuzu shrugged, &quot;Bullshit.&quot; The older necromancer laughed.. &quot;Say what you like but I do believe someday I will take a ride up there and see it for myself. Prove to you maybe.&quot; <br>
<br>
She was shocked... &quot;But.. I thought you wouldn't WANT to see me again...?&quot; Yuin shrugged. &quot;You never know.&quot; Puzuzu was feeling uncomfortable now and layed down with her back to the necromancer. She fell asleep.<br>
<br>
The human and the elf were in the dark backroom chatting with about 5 other people. It was a snuggled sort of room. A lamp in the center as they talked about their futures, destinations and other crap. A high elven wizard was alone up on top of the back room on the upper deck. He stared coldly at the 2 necromancers. Once the girl had fallen asleep he stared at the ocean. He liked the waves and the whole pattern it made... Seemed to be magickal in a way. <br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The next day Puzuzu was woken up by the hard sunburn on her back from the blazing sun... &quot;UGH.&quot; She whaled... She was not used to such bright light and heat. The monk laughed at her then motioned her to into the shaded back room or into the bar. &quot;They shouldn't bug you as much I guess...&quot; Puzuzu got up on her feet and stretched. Yuin was gone to her relief. She saw the ashes his footprints left behind... They lead down a ramp.. Puzuzu followed it and turned the corner. She was surprised such a crowd was here. A gnome, erudite, couple humans, the half elf, and a wood elf. She groaned hating such big crowds. They all appeared to be drunk anyways. <br>
<br>
Entering the room in the corner that was not visible from the ramp.. There was Yuin.. Slumped on the bench drunk. Why get drunk by yourself? She walked quickly over to the counter trying to ignore Yuin's hard glare on her. Was he hitting on her?<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi.&quot; She said to everyone. It stopped their little dances of joy and they backed up. They all stared whispering to eachother... Puzuzu actually liked that. She was the super star today. Turning towards the barkeeper who purposly ignored her before she bammed her fist on the table. &quot;What do you want missy?&quot; He scowled... Puzuzu pointed to a shelf of strong beer. The barkeeper laughed hard, &quot;We don't sell to dark elven scum, you hear me?&quot; Puzuzu rolled her eyes, &quot;Then tell me how...&quot; Pointing at Yuin.. &quot;HE got beer?&quot;  The barkeeper sighed annoyed, &quot;Maybe.... HE BROUGHT IT ON HIS OWN???&quot;  The others laughed.. &quot;O I C.&quot; Puzuzu didn't want to associate with Yuin right now. He was creeping her out.<br>
<br>
*I must have beer... GAAHHH.* Finally giving in she walked sloppily over to the staring necromancer. His eyes were black coals.. empty holes. &quot;Hi Yuin.... How much for a stack of beer?&quot; Yuin didn't reply. He just kept staring hard at her... *This guy is screwed..* She attempted to slap him on the forehead but he caught her hand and squeezed it hard. His glare changed to a evil grin. &quot;Do you expect me to fall for that, Pu?&quot; Puzuzu laughed, &quot;Look, I thought you liked being called 'Yuin' instead of 'Yuinaerpheorusseeg'.. I like my full name better then 'Pu'.&quot; Chuckling to herself. Yuin finally smiled.. &quot;OK, Puzuzu, beer is on the house..&quot; He handed her a bottle of it but then reached it away from her. &quot;Whats the deal?&quot; She asked annoyed. &quot;Ummmmmmm....&quot; Puzuzu KNEW there would be a catch. He had her caught in that damned tight spot. &quot;WELLLL... IF you will let me go on this 'mission', 'journey'.. whateve-&quot; &quot;DO you mean you want to go with me?&quot; Yuin nodded. Puzuzu replyed. &quot;Why now?.. and not lastnight?&quot; Yuin shook his head, &quot;MYOB.&quot; Puzuzu laughed.... &quot;Bah forget you.. Hell, I guess I could use the help.&quot; Yuin lifted an eyebrow, &quot;NO. You NEED the help... OK? Listen... NEED.. NEED..&quot; Puzuzu said, &quot;I get the point, Yuinepharieguasg.&quot; Yuin frowned, &quot;Bah.&quot; He chuckled afterwards.<br>
<br>
Puzuzu pulled the beer from his hand... &quot;I guess you know Hydrokronik better right?&quot; Yuin nodded.. She walked up to the top of the deck and attempted to open the beer bottle... She couldn't... Why? Tugging it away in her robe she saved it. *Later will be great.. Just one more day with a freak staring down my back... I wonder if he is staring down my back right now?* Giggling to herself she turned around. Almost screaming... There he was, Yuin was staring at her with no expression on his face. *Holy shit.* A shiver went down her spine. She walked over to the edge of the boat next to the high elven wizard. &quot;Do you have a spare fishing pole on you sir?&quot; He gruffed at her then turned around seeing Yuin staring at him. Then giving a feared face he handed her his, &quot;Don't have to return it... It's all yours.&quot; He ran into the backroom.<br>
<br>
*Hmmm. Maybe this Yuin guy will be a big help to me.. I'm just a stupid wimpy necromancer while he's this Hydrokronik's mirror image... COOL.*<br>
<br>
She heard footsteps coming up behind her... Yuin had a fishing pole.. He threw the line into the water. &quot;I'm bored. Might as well hang with the only necromancer on board.&quot; Puzuzu shrugged. <p><table><tr><td><img src="http://user.netomia.com/puzuzu/reap.jpg" alt="Reaper"></td><td><p><b>I walk in the black ashes of the graveyard... the full moon is like white in black.<br>The reaper has sliced my soul, that black hellish feeling has returned.. <br>Decaying and eating away at my spirit and soul.
