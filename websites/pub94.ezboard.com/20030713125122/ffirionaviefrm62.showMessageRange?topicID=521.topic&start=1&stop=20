Well, the trial is over.  The Supreme Court said that the Law Schools method was fine but the standard 1/5th of your points for your ethnicity as the general university used is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
Any comments?  Personally I applaud their decision.  While I think it is a very worthwhile effort to get diversity in schools (and therefore in our higher up job markets) I do not believe that giving it to anyone based on their pigment will successfully do that.  Since the law school individually examines each student it is not solely on the race but on the person as well.  I applaud the law schools efforts.<br>
<br>
Now for what I find disgusting ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Commenting on the court’s upholdng of race-conscious policies in the law school case, Democratic presidential contender Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said in a statement, “The Supreme Court arrived at that conclusion by only the slimmest of margins. It is frightening that it fell to a single justice to make the difference between protection of the most basic principles of affirmative action and the utter abandonment of 50 years of progress on civil rights in education.”<br>
<br>
  Kerry also looked ahead to a potential Supreme Court vacancy. “These cases make it all too clear: An important part of our nation’s future hangs in the balance at the Supreme Court, and if that balance is upset — if George Bush is allowed to tip the scales by appointing an extremist to the court — then we could see the clock rolled back to a time of more separate and horribly unequal access to education in America.”<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I do not believe that 50 years of civil rights work was ever at stake.  This is a political bullshit statement by someone just attacking his rivals.  A chance to try and strike a low blow ... this is why American politics make me sick. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
Obviously, Race is a factor in life, so totally ignoring it would be naive.  But I applaud the rejection of the points-type system because I think those tend to overweight Race.  Even if it is only worth a small amount, when two candidates are otherwise equal that extra few points becomes a tie-breaker, effectively favoring one over the other.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, open ended systems are going to be more open to future suits, simply because they can not transparently explain how the decisions are made in a simple manner.  But the alternative, which is to use a math formula a la points, is an inferior method in all ways.<br>
<br>
My general take on Affirmative Action in general is that often they completely miss the point.  Affirmative Action is supposed to provide EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.  To be honest, University, Graduate Schools, and Employment are too LATE in the process to provide that.  Equal Opportunity programs really should target much younger children.<br>
<br>
And because Equal OPPORTUINTY can not be easily measured and reported on, what they seem to settle on is a policy of enforcing EQUAL RESULTS, which is a wholly different animal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3060<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/03 1:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=521.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Michigan Affirmative Action.</span><hr size=1> Affirmative action is a Trojan Horse.<br>
<br>
It pretends it's there to help minority students.  In reality, it helps corporations.<br>
<br>
Corporations like / need to have a balanced workforce (from a racial perspective), so affirmative action gives them a more balanced pool of collegiates to look at.<br>
<br>
The college students who would be helped by affirmative action don't really need the help more than anyone else.  <br>
<br>
The hispanic &amp; asian primary school students who are learning English as a second language, they could use some help.<br>
<br>
The black primary school students who are in low income areas with crappy and/or dangerous schools, they could use some help.<br>
<br>
The way to put minorities on equal footing with non-minorities is to address the problem where it begins, not tackle the symptoms of it 10 years down the road.  <br>
<br>
In this &quot;No kid left behind&quot; crap, the schools that are doing well get more funding, and the schools doing poorly receive less.  We have all this standardized testing stuff here in Washington, schools that perform well get more funding, schools that perform poorly get less.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure in someone's head, that's a good way to motivate schools to work harder at teaching their kids or something.  In reality it just diverts even more funding away from the schools that need it.  <br>
<br>
You don't need to take race into account <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>at all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to help fix this problem, you just need to use some common sense and some compassion.  Unfortunately both of those are in short supply in politics.<br>

<br>
Sure, you'll hear black politicians trashing standardized testing, saying that asking a student how to divide 12 cupcakes among 4 children is racist because black kids can't afford cupcakes or some crap, but you don't hear them trashing the rap industry for presenting the image that you don't need an education to succeed, all you need is your badass crib &amp; a gun or whatever.<br>
<br>
I'm half black.  My dad &amp; his siblings are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> generation removed from poor black farmers in Alabama.  When he was young an apple was honestly a treat for him because they couldn't afford much fresh fruit.  So what happened to by dad &amp; his siblings?  Did they live a life of oppression in this white man's world?<br>
<br>
Um... no.  They worked their asses off in school and made something of themselves.  My dad is a VP at his company.  One of his brothers was a college football coach &amp; now athletic director.  One of his brothers is an engineer.  One of his brothers is a police sargeant (sp).  One of his brothers owns an auto-repair shop.  One of his brothers works at the phone company.  His sister became a stay at home mom to better raise her kids.<br>
<br>
None of them got into drugs.  None of them ran with gangs.  Money didn't fall from the sky, they worked their way into success.  My dad joined RoTC to help pay for his schooling (and later fought in vietnam).  I think some of his siblings did the same, others earned scholarships, others just worked their way through school.<br>
<br>
The point is, my grandma had 7 kids, all of them black.  She and my grandpa were poor and uneducated.  My grandfather was a self-taught auto-mechanic, and did such good work that he  attracted a wealthy clientele that wanted dings repaired in their fancy foreign cars etc, and that help put food on the table.  Sadly, he was murdered by one of his friends.  That didn't stop my grandma from raising their kids well, and it didn't stop the kids from being successful.  There is no affirmative action program in the world that can provide people with an attitude towards becoming successful.  That needs to come from within the culture, and right now black culture is doing a lousy job of getting that message out to it's children.<br>
<br>
And blacks can blame whites until the end of time for where they are right now, but it's not going to change anything.  <br>

If it was focused on the basis of economics, statistically speaking, it would still focus on minorities for the most part, but it addresses the underlying cause of what is keeping minorities down. And yes, racial discrimination still exists and the effects of slavery and discimination toward blacks that were commonplace until the 1960's still have an effect on people today. I am a minority female (hispanic) and my husband is white. Based on his experiences as a white male, he just can't see how there is still a problem with discimination. Is he a racist? Heck no. He bases his view on his own personal experiences. Do I see where there is still a problem with racial discrimination? Yes. <br>
<br>
I don't know where to find it, but I remember about a year ago, one of the news programs here conducted a study on current hiring practices and discrimination. They submitted job applications with exactly equal qualifications to companies. The only difference was the names they had put on the applications. On one application, they put a common &quot;white sounding&quot; name, i.e. Barbara Miller, and on the other they put a &quot;black sounding&quot; name like Lacrishia Jackson or something to that effect. (I'm sure you get the idea). Anyway, the applications with the black sounding names were rejected and they didn't attempt to call the person for an interview. With the white sounding names, they attempted to call that person in for the interview. Was this a shock to any minorities? Heck no. It confirmed what we knew all along.<br>
With my personal experiences, back in the late 80's, I would call around looking for jobs. Although Spanish is my first language, I don't have a hint of an accent now. Over the phone, I &quot;sound&quot; white. I told them my qualifications over the phone and they would sound very excited to interview me. I would get dressed up really nice and professional and walk in feeling confident. The interviewer would take one look at me, and I KNEW right then and there they weren't going to hire me.

Basically, my point is, racial discrimination is not dead, it's alive and well. Syll has the right idea though with minorities empowering themselves through economic successes. It's just harder in this society to achieve for the minority, but it can be done <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/03 8:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=521.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/DavidStrange/vamp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Michigan Affirmative Action.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Basically, my point is, racial discrimination is not dead, it's alive and well.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Depends on where you are also.  If you live in Harrison, Arkansas Hell yes there is racial discrimination.  If you live in Bakersfield California since there are more Mexicans than there are whites you would be hard press to find discrimination on the scale that would be considered racial discrimination.<br>
<br>
I hear all these reports about racial discrimination in the work place and I call your bullshit statements for what they are.  How do I know that?  I see all the time where people sue for racial discrimination.  It's a disease.  Oh I didn't get the job, it must be because I'm black or I am Mexican.  What the hell, have you ever thought maybe you didn't impress the person in charge of hiring, or maybe someone better might have applied also?<br>
<br>
As for your last statement about it being harder to make it in society, I'll call that bullshit also.  If you want to rephrase it to say that the poor have a harder time making in society I'll agree with you.  But just because someone is a minority doesn't mean they are poor, nor does it mean that they have to try harder.<br>
<br>
You want an example, most of the Asian Americans I know do very well in society.  But yet they are a minority?  Explain that. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

The definition of affirmative action is this...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Main Entry: affirmative action<br>
Function: noun<br>
Date: 1965<br>
: an active effort to improve the employment or educational opportunities of members of minority groups and women<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I just happen to think that you can meet that goal, as defined, w/o taking race or gender into consideration.<br>
<br>
When you directly take those things into account, you automatically generate the same kind of unfairness that you're trying to alleviate.  Not only that, but you foster feelings of animosity on the part of men &amp; whites against those other groups, rather than bringing them together.<br>
<br>
Let's take hispanics as an example.  There is a noticable gap between the educational performance of hispanics -vs- that of white students.  A very large portion of this gap is due to language barrier... English is a second language for a lot of these students.  You can address the issue by putting funding out there for good ESL programs to help bring the students on par with those who are native speakers.  The manner in which you have addressed the problem is now blind to race (it's focused on non-native english speakers), and white students aren't put in the position of feeling that any unfairness has been perpetrated on them.<br>
<br>
When it comes to college entrance, most colleges do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> discriminate on the basis of gender or race, except in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>favor</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of minorities.  Why?  Because diversity on campus is considered a preferable trait for a college.  They <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>want</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> minority students.  Affirmative action at this level is more or less in place to address the issue of there not being proportionately as many minority applicants of equal skill as white students.  But addressing it at the college level is thus the wrong place to be dealing with it, because you will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have that problem.  You need to address it where it starts (in primary school), and in a manner that's blind to race in the first place (even if the effects of your program end up benefitting a minority group more).<br>

<br>
I can say that the discrimination against <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>women</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> stares you in the face.  It's there in the pay scale (that women earn, on avg, 70% of what a man w/ the same skills/education in the same job earns).  It's there in the hiring.  It's there in the promotions (companies are very hesitant to promote women very high because they're afraid they'll decide to have a family and quit and they'll be stuck paying for their pregnancy etc).<br>
<br>

You call a lot of &quot;bullshit&quot; on statements about racial discrimination, but you don't put forth a single shred of evidence that disproves that racism in hiring practices exists, other than &quot;well, it could just be that it was you, and not your race.&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;experiment&quot; that involves sending out resumes with &quot;white&quot; names (Jennifer Smythe)...&quot;black names&quot; (Latisha Williams)...and &quot;hispanic&quot; names (Maria Gutierrez) all with the same resume is done regularly, usually a couple times a year by tv news shows, newspaper reporters, etc...  Every time it's been done, there is a significantly higher response rate to &quot;white&quot; names over &quot;minority&quot; names.<br>
<br>
As for your comment about Asians doing well, the problem there is almost a reverse racism.  Asians are considered the &quot;model minority&quot;, and have the stereotype of &quot;all extremely intelligent, all have a work ethic that values job over family over self, all highly educated.&quot;  It's not a whites vs. everyone else thing, it's really a &quot;cultural view&quot; of what race is.  Asians are not considered lazy and uneducated by &quot;American culture.&quot;  However, the stereotype hits a lot harder on other minorities.<br>
<br>
I worked in the human resources department of a large company.  The people in charge of hiring there were largely fair and good people, giving everyone an equal chance.  But when you're going through a pile of resumes, it was difficult to resist the impulse to associate &quot;Juanita Lopez&quot; with the last Hispanic woman you interviewed, the one who could hardly speak a word of English and couldn't comprehend what the job even entailed.  You shouldn't do that.  And they'd try hard to resist it.  But it happened.  People got shafted because of their names and appearances, despite the best human efforts not to have it happen.  And these were good people.<br>
<br>
There are bad people too.<br>
<br>
My father and 2 colleagues were once responsible for filling three vacancies in their department by interviewing the 4 top candidates.  Two white males, one white female, and one black male.  After the interviews, one of my father's colleagues, leaned back in his chair and said, &quot;I guess we know who's not getting this job.  We have enough damn *slur deleted* out working on the factory floor to not be hiring them into management.&quot;  This wasn't some old redneck in the deep south saying this shit.  This was a 30 year old family man in suburban Chicago.  It's not *usually* so blatant, but these people exist.<br>
<br>
Yes, poverty hits all people equally, but racism in hiring exists and it's pretty damn pervasive, adding a little extra difficulty for many minority job applicants.<br>
