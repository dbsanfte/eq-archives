<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     A slight drizzle permeates the humid air of Cabilis, giving a slick luster to the scales of its bustling inhabitants. The damp is no stranger here, and seems to hang in the air always, a reminder of Thule's constant presence among the brood of fear, the Iksar.  In a quiet corner of the city, not far from the temple of terror, stands a half-completed stone house, and inside, a pale-eyed trooper in banded mail speaks with a small audience.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&quot;Hail, and my greetings to those of you gathered here.  For those of you who know me...&quot;  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     The trooper nods to a group nearby; three males and three females.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;It is a pleasure to see you, as always, and you will not need the explanation I am about to give. But, for those of you who do not know me, thule forbid...allow me to explain the plans, ideas, and background for what is Skathris Ven'Sho.&quot;<br>
(ooc)<br>
Skathris Ven'Sho is a potential Iksar-Only guild, formed from the ideas of several attempted other guilds and some ideas of my own and my friends'.  This is the charter for the forming of the guild, though inevitably some amendments may be made as the guild grows or ages.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What the guild is, and why it exists:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
In the current age, under the rule of the great Emperor Vekin, the New Sebilis empire flourishes.  Broods grow larger each hatching year, there is food and supplies a'plenty, and aside from a few fools, none suffer all that badly.  Peace, of course, is good for business, so the Kloks prosper under the current Haggle Baron, and even the reports of the annoying skinless have seemed to decline recently.  This is all well and good, but for one thing: the Empire is growing lazy in these days of wealth.  Those who have the courage to stray from the walls of Cabilis know that declining reports only hide the fact that the skinless are slaughtering those who would report them, and the terrors and bloodshed once subdued has begun to rise again.  Of course, the empire is aware of this, and has all intentions to stop it.  But between the construction of the city and the overabundance of broodlings to watch over, the officials and arms, the castes of the empire, are too few to properly tend to the matters at hand.  But those who will tend to this are not these arms.  They are the Claws of the Empire; the Skathris Ven'Sho.  The Skathris seek to do that which the empire cannot do or does not do fast enough for their likes.   The skinless must be dealt with. The outlands must be retaken.  And the looming threats of wurms and worse must be put to rest.  The Empire is mighty, but can and will be mightier, and only with the swift and tactful methods of Skathris Ven'Sho can this happen.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Skinless and Outland policies</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
What's been seen in more than a few upstart Iksar guilds on this server is the policy that non-iksar are permitted into the guild if they roleplay as an Iksar's slave, and other such loopholes and clauses.  While these may have the best interests, this has generally served as a poor excuse to let non-iksar into what claims to be an all-iksar guild. Skathris Ven'Sho is a true all-iksar guild, and that means just that--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Iksar.  There will be no skinless bearing the skathris tag, under any circumstances, be they &quot;Evil&quot; or &quot;Good&quot;.  Note that there is a very slim chance of this disincluding Vah'Shir, depending on the Iksar's IC view of the cats when Luclin goes live.  The Skathris Ven'Sho have the same views as the general empire, because, well, they're Iksar, and part of the general empire :P.  Attitudes toward Non-Iksar should show that.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Officers and Positions</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I know you were all waiting for this... Here goes...<br>
CHANCELLOR (leader)<br>
(Kelisk)<br>
The Figurehead of the guild in general and the final decision on important issues, the Chancellor serves as the essential Leader of the guild.  He/she is the ultimate authority over guild matters.<br>
COUNCIL OF THE FOUR CLAWS (officers)<br>
(Not officially filled yet)<br>
The council consists of the four primary advisors to the Chancellor, and each Skathris of the council also carries the responsibility of overseeing a specific guild function.  For example, the Skathris of Initiation would carry out and supervise most of the recruitment process. The four seats of the council are as follows: <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Claw of War</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->--oversees all raid, guildwar, and other militaristic functions. Also serves as councilor for the Warriors and Shadow Knights of the guild.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Claw of Judicion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->--oversees all guild-to-guild (non-war) relations, both IC and OOC, and relations between the guild and non-iksar. Also decides and judges the punishment or reward of any guild member who has performed an unexpected task, be it traitorous or valorous.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Claw of Initiation</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->--Oversees guild recruitment.  This claw is granted any means necessary to ensure that potential members are of the highest quality and reports to the chancellor any unusual circumstances regarding a potential member or members.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Claw of Trade</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> This Claw oversees all fundraising, auctioning, and treasury matters for the guild.  All purchases using guild money or items should be brought to the attention of the Chancellor for approval.<br>
OTHER POSITIONS (May or may not be officers)<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Baron of Craft (officer)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> A master of a certain craft or crafts may be appointed a Baron of Craft--these barons will be funded by the guild to craft necessary items and materials for members.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Sub-Claw (non-officer)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> A member of the Council of Four Claws  has the option of appointing a sub-claw to assist in his or her duties.  The sub-claw does not have the same priveleges as the claw, but holds some.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     General Populace (non-officer)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The main body of the guild-all members discluding the special positions above.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     RECRUITMENT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
While it always helps <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     some</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be friends with a member, it's definitely not necessary.  Keep in mind that this is an all-iksar guild, and a roleplaying guild.  We are not one of the &quot;Okay with RP, but won't care one way or the other&quot; types.  A potential member must meet and roleplay with as much of the guild as realistically possible; grouping with one of our members once or twice doesn't give the general guild all that good of an opinion on a candidate.  This includes all level ranges-a level 50 candidate should do what he or she can to get to know the level 20's (just an example). Generally, a candidate will be looked on more favorably if more of the guild knows them and, more importantly of course, if more of the guild <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     likes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> them.  After this &quot;getting to know you&quot; period, a candidate may petition to the Claw of Initiation or the Chancellor to be voted upon for inductment.  This petition should have the support of one or more members.  The voting will be held privately by the guild either during a meeting or in a private forum in the message board. <br>
Note that this will likely be amended once a stable guild message board is up and running.  Candidates will most likely need to post a story or message on the board as well. All levels are welcome, if they can prove themselves worthy.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     RAID POLICIES AND LOOT RULES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This section of the charter will remain unwritten until there is enough in-guild support and appropriate levels to host or hold a raid.  Generally, I as the chancellor encourage master-looting or split cash/rolling on rare drops, but this is by no means a requirement.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     GUILD WARS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Skathris is open to challenge, being the supreme guild, of course.  Through the defeat of their enemies they can earn a higher seat by Thule's side.  Skathris Ven'Sho is open to guildwar within reason-meaning that while we will by no means accept war with a guild whose general populace is ridiculously more powerful than ours (we are supreme, but not foolish), we will gladly accept the challenge of a decent and honorable guild of similar power.  Wars are strictly in-character and will be held as such, and that includes the necessity for a real reason to hold war.  While Skathris Ven'Sho definitely does not much like the Skinless and the traitorous Forsaken and outcast Iksar, they will not condone meaningless war beyond duels and such without a very good reason. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     That concludes the first drafting of the guild charter for Skathris Ven'Sho.  Post to this thread with any questions, comments, or suggestions, or E-Mail me (kelisk) privately at BSEH42@hotmail.com. Ingame, for more information, speak with me, Voskor, Vhalisk, or Zildrax.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Wait your turn, o dancing mountain of fat. Your pathetic collection of hovels that you call a city will be crushed beneath our feet in due course. In the meantime, I have no particular desire to travel so far afield just to see more of your putrescent quivering piles of scaleless flesh interfering with my view. There are enough of you on Kunark to make me sick quite effectively already. Why Thule tolerates some of you to even claim to worship Him must be a matter of amusement only the gods can comprehend.<br>

I don't carry a fife, but I'll be happy to introduce you to the sharp end of my pike should we happen to run afoul.<br>
