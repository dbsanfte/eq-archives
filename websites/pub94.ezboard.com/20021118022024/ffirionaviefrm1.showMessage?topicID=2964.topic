Why is it wrong for someone to do StormHammer Trading?  If I have a high level character on another server and want to transfer my stuff over why does everyone get into a big stink over it?  Why does it matter to you how I have my fun?  I pay for this game too.  If it is against VIs policy to do this then I understand why it is frowned upon but I still maintain my opinion that it isn't that bad.  <br>
<br>
I honestly wish I had the money to transfer all my loot from my monk over to FV.  Raptors don't seem to be dropping enough cash.  <br>

If you want to play on FV why not PLAY on FV not play one a bit of your old server a bit on stormhammer. Transfering a charater completly.. I still havent made my mind on that i sort of okay if you are you charater hugly time invested.<br>

Failing, granted, but trying.<br>
<br>
This is the RP server. <br>
So you transfer over a lvl 55+ and all his crap, and on FV you are known from Adam and have what reputation?<br>
<br>
Granted, you'll have your choice of uber raiding guilds to choose from. <br>
<br>
But there are still a few of us here who really get peeved at that behavior. Some of us are still trying to RP, and really don't care to deal with your l337 gear hitting our Bazaar and screwing with the already tweaked economy.<br>
<br>
Tell me... what In Character RP reason have you come up with for suddenly appearing on Norrath with great gear and fully advanced in rank? Locked away in a temple somewhere? Well, that would kinda nixes the great gear and advanced ranks theory. I know! Maybe you were trapped on a plane and just recently escaped after fighting day in and day out with Marr for all of eternity. Go you.<br>

This is not just the &quot;No No-Drop Server&quot;, this is the &quot;RP Preferred Server&quot;. You should ask yourself, &quot;Why do I want to transfer all of my gear and twink out a character on FV?&quot; If it is to get around the No-Drop rules, you will probably but heads with a lot of people here. Most people that play on this server at least attempt to role play and come up with background stories for their characters. For some, it is less than others, but usually RP is considered a good thing here.<br>
<br>
Another thing is that many players come here for a &quot;fresh start&quot;. They are tired of the d00dz and phat lewtz and all the other stuff that goes on in blue servers. Many of the people here are EQers that found the grinding and hunting for lewt boring and are searching for more substance in the game. Many people actually take the time here to do tradeskills, participate in server events, hold language fairs and races and do other things that don't necessarily translate into property or XP gain for their character. Transferring gear over doesn't really make sense in this regard. So you want to give your character a huge advantage and zip him/her through the first 50 levels to get to the high end game? For what? The high end game here is much less advanced than other servers. Why not just transfer your stuff to another blue server, why come to the &quot;RP preferred server&quot;?<br>
<br>
The other reason why I dislike gear transfers is because of this - earning a piece of equipment is important on this server, especially much of the high end gear. Wearing a Mithril Helm says - &quot;hey, I've put in my time, raided with a good guild and look what I have now - I'm the first person on the server with a Mithril Helm. Even though we wiped on Aary 4 times, we still made it through and cleared NToV and this is my reward - I am very proud of it.&quot; In my opinion, if that was me, and the next day I saw some level 1 Cleric in Butcherblock with a Mithril Helm, I would feel very angry because I worked hard to get my Helm and here is someone who used a loophole in the rules to get a piece of gear here that they didn't earn.<br>
<br>
BTW: don't use that &quot;I want to enjoy the game by doing what I enjoy - what's wrong with that? It doesn't hurt you.&quot; argument. It's always a bunch of BS. If I enjoy training the newbies in front of Cabilis with Burynai does that make it OK just because I am enjoying it? Everything you do here makes an effect on other people, just because you fail to recognize it doesn't make it less true.<br>
<br>
If you want to come here to RP, or for a fresh start, or even if you like the friendly community, we will welcome you with open arms. If you just want to come here because there are very few No-Drop items or whatever, then I'd think twice if I were you. <p><div align=center>

I came here for the lower server population and the very few no drop items.  I hate working hard questing for something and then when I get something better I can't even sell it or give it to a guildie.  I also like being able to buy items and not waste countless hours camping for them.<br>
<br>
We may have all been screwed out of some ST loot but there still is a chance in hell of aquiring a primal weapon or a gnome mask.  I am sorry that this is a roleplaying server and that it bothers you people come here for other reasons then to roleplay.  I pay the same amount you do to play.  If I respect your ability to have an enjoyable experience roleplaying why can't you respect my wanting to come here so I can actually get a decent camp once and awhile and go into ToV without 400+ people in there on the average night.<br>
<br>
I know I didn't earn the loot here but it doesn't mean that I didn't put in 100+ days played to earn the loot.<br>
<br>
I understand that many don't feel the way I do but I think there are lots of people who secretly feel the way I do and just don't say anything because they don't want to be branded a loot whore.<br>

I haven't and probably won't be doing that transfer but it doesn't change the way I feel.  I am honestly sorry that it bothers people I didn't come here to roleplay but that is the least of my worries.  You not wanting me to bring stuff here because it hurts the economy, well I can kind of understand that but when weighed against my enjoyment it isn't that big of a deal.  Things will eventually be pharmed to #### here and why should people in the big guilds be the only ones that have access to it.<br>
<br>
I think it is nice that people bring VP loot over.  You know how much time it takes to get the VP key?  I spent at least 50+ hours getting it for the crap loot the zone yields.<br>
<br>
The main factor of why I am not going to do it is because it is against the rules and I respect the rules of VI.<br>

What will get you banned is bringing over and selling shit from legends. Thats what nexen did. Many do not roleplay here. Many do. the main difference here is those that do and those that dont group and get along fine. I dont roleplay either but when grouped with some one who does I will try my best to play along. What ever you do if someone wont rezz you for roleplay reasons that is why for the most part.

You are doing your very best to alienate a large chunk of the server and then when any try to answer your question you counter with &quot;my fun is more important than anyone else's&quot; type arguements.<br>
<br>
You say you won't do the Stormhammer shuffle because it is against the rules, good.  Now, don't decry those who find it repugnant for reasons other than just because it is against the rules.<br>
<br>
Sayin that you don't roleplay is fine.  Insisting that no one else ever should roleplay around you or interact with you in a roleplay manner is &quot;pissing on OUR livingroom floor&quot;.  It is telling us YOU matter more than anyone else who has come to this ROLEPLAY preferred server to... gasp... roleplay because we... gasp.. prefer to roleplay and want... gasp.. others to roleplay where... gasp... roleplaying is preferred.  <br>
<br>
If you prefer not to roleplay, go play your &quot;I got to be uber-er than you&quot; game some place where roleplay is not preferred.  <br>
<br>
If you can accept that people do prefer to roleplay on the roleplaying preferred server, and want to live within the community rather than saying it is full of shit for preferring to roleplay, then you might find yourself a bit more welcome.<br>
<br>
Personally, I couldn't care less if you roleplay or not.  It's your loss, not mine.<br>

If you don't like those things, not because they're against VI's rules, but because they do bad things to the game, then there's some basis for discussion.

I DO have problems with people that say I can't be on FV because I don't want to roleplay.  You play on FV for your reasons and I play on it for mine.  We both respect each other and we will get along fine.  Just because I would like to have all the stuff I used to have on my other server makes me a bad person?  I said I would like to.  I will not because it is illegal.  I have no problems with anyone that does do it though.  It doesn't bother me.  I don't have this &quot;I must be Uber&quot; then u attitude like you think.  Why does everyone that wants their old loot trasferred have to be that way.  I simply want the things I put so much damn effort into aquiring.  Don't label me a loot whore.  You don't even know me.<br>
<br>
When did I say &quot;it is full of shit&quot;?  I just said I plan on FV for my reasons and you play on it for yours.<br>
<br>
Bjond: I would not ebay myself and I didn't.  I still have a nice 60 monk with good gear in the 3-4th top guild on Prexus.  I am sure he could fetch a fair amount of money if I wanted to sell him but instead I gave the account to my friend who plays my old cleric.  I don't have any problem with people who buy ebayed gear or selling it. I however would not do any of these things simply because it is illegal.  Were it legal I would be.<br>
<br>
Would I turn around and sell items awarded to me from my guild?  Never, If I was to leave EQ I would either give my account to a RL friend or to a guildie.  Infact I usually give my unused items to other guildies or noobs sometimes.<br>
<br>
Basically, no I wouldn't do any of those things but I don't have problems with people that do.  Only exception would be if your guild awarded you a very nice item.  I think that they should be left in the guild and they shouldn't be sold, but if you busted your butt for it and want to sell it for RL cash and don't mind breaking VI's agreement then go ahead.<br>
<br>
I know that you all think it ruins the server and I understand that I just don't agree.  The more fungi tunics that are floating around and the more great loot that gets brought here just makes our guilds stronger.<br>
<br>
_______<br>
<br>
I don't expect any of you to agree with me.  I just ask that you don't go treating me like crap because I think differently then you.  I will not ebay or SH trade because it is illegal.<br>
I just posted because I wanted to find out why so many people are against it.  <br>
<br>
Being illegal is a good reason.  Not wanting to destroy the server economy may be another good reason to some.  Not doing it because it is a roleplaying server means nothing to me because I don't roleplay.  If you think it is going to affect your ability to roleplay because my character has some loot from my previous character then I am sorry I am hurting your roleplaying ability.  =)<br>
<br>
The only harm I can see happening to the server is possibly ruining the economy  which I can understand if that upsets you.  I just don't agree it hurts the economy.  I think good loot should be available to all and not just uber guilds.   Eventually these items will be pharmed and it won't make that much of a difference.  If you think differently then fine.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, I am not going to do it so don't treat me like crap because of my opinion.<br>

<br>
This is where you are wrong. It does hurt the economy. FV has been around no place near as long as any other server. A vast vast majority of this server doesnt have the kind of cash to buy any of the &quot;uber&quot; loot that would come over from a server thats been around since EQ came out. You look at these folks that bring a item over from SH and TRY to sell it for 150,000pp and dont, because no one has that kind of money not would they spend it. <br>
<br>
The majority of players here on FV left the &quot;blue&quot; servers because they all went to shit. Its not worth playing on them. We cant police who comes into FV, though some of us wish we could, so we could keep people that dont wish to RP and are here because of low population and the like. We want FV to stay the way it is. A very low number of lewt power gamers who ruined EQ for the majority of it. <br>
<br>
We dont like, want or need anyone transfering items or money from the others servers because thats what ruined those servers. It became about the loot and not about the players. <br>
<br>
So please, for us and yourself, if you want to play on this server and act like its a blue one, then leave and dont come back, because we dont want FV becoming a blue server. <p>Warden Wildrunner

Which is bullshit in the highest form to me.<br>
<br>
You don't like to role play. That's okay. But your tone is that of Role players suck. Even if that's not what you mean, that's the tone people get from your posts. Most of my guild is not the best role players. We are for the most part refugees from blue servers who wanted to come here for a fresh start, and to play higher end characters that we had never really gotten the chance to do before. I in no way have ever seen my guild taken to task for not being role players. I have seen individual members ripped for being a-holes, but that's an entirely different thing.<br>
<br>
I think that of all the people who have brought up the whole SH thing, you are about the only one who has  made a legitimate effort at discussing the issue, as oppossed to going NYAH NYAH, I'm selling uber gear here that the rest of you have never had, so SCREW YOU ALL!! Trust me, you could get along fine here not roleplaying, but just being polite and trying to make friends and fit in, uber geared or not, because for one thing MOST roleplayers would never inspect you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Most rp'rs have a thing about that, it being discourteous and all. It's not about having the gear, so much as how YOU handle having it.<br>
<br>
So, in the end, if you come hear with your monk, or druid, or mage, or whatever, just come, enjoy the show, try and have fun with people having fun.<br>
