Even if hating my god is seen acceptable by VI.<br>
<br>
Slaying him could/should (depending on ones views, mine is obviously should, and big time) bring a curse of some kind (ie loss of spells, harm touch...).<br>
<br>
Maybe in time i will try to complete my epic, which could lead me in the hate plane. But attempting to slay the Prince of Hate is not for me (/wave phat loot), at least not with my current history. There would need to be a MAJOR RP reason for me to do so or join such an attempt, definitively not phat loot.<br>

They hate deceit, lies, betrayal and cowardice of any sort. They wouldn't just kill Cazic-Thule to betray him, but they might do it to show him that they have become so strong that they do not need a deity anymore. Still, it's unlikely they'd feel that way. At least not for a VERY long time. They have the utmost respect and reverance for their god. But I don't think they'd have a problem with raiding his plane in order to prove or show their strength to their Lord. Seeing as Cazic-Thule just seems to give them a big hug when they get there, yet all his minions try and kill them. <br>

Or they could be upset with the God (Which could make for a GREAT story) because some tragedy happened.<br>

Or did they worship the entire pantheon at different times of the year?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Some of both.<br>
<br>
In principle, everyone pays homage to all of the gods, all of the time, but in practice, most people would have a &quot;favorite god&quot; (usually the one your parents worshiped), and they would rarely pay homage to any of the other gods except under certain circumstances.  As you say, different times of the year, there would be a festival for a particular god, and then everybody would worship that god for a bit.  The Festival of Demeter, for example, corresponds with harvest-time, if I remember correctly.<br>
<br>
Also, which god you worship might depend on what you were doing.  Sailors usually worshiped Poseidon, but people who were about to go on a sea voyage would also pay homage to Poseidon.  That wasn't considered betraying their &quot;regular&quot; god; it was just how things were done.<br>
<br>
Naturally, some people who more dedicated to a particular god than most.  You wouldn't too often find a priest of Aphrodite worshiping Diana, for example, though that's not to say it never happened.<br>
<br>
It may be worth mentioning that modern-day Hinduism works much the same way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugmog.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gmog</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 6:25:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1174.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should Evil RP Guilds focus on killing GOOD deities?</span><hr size=1> Ok couldn't resist one more post on this thread. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
First to answer the question asked..... it would have to be Erolissi Marr..... Queen of Love.... what better head to bring to the Father <br>
<br>
Second I wish to clarify myself from earlier.<br>
<br>
We are in a world where Gods do defiantly exist and theoretically we are able to kill their physical manifestations.... VI's explanation as to why Evils would kill their deities is fundamentally flawed... we would have to believe that they see their creations as equals to themselves, granting them the right to kill one of their own.... the Greeks and Romans believed even to have the audacity to boast oneself even being equal to the gods would invoke their wrath.<br>
<br>
We are to believe that the Evil gods encourage this deceit to the very fact that they grant their very clerics the spells to help defeat them.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying to skip the items and not raid the planes.... just I will not be and I have a hard time personally buying into VI's explanation.<br>

<br>
I would join in a heartbeat an evil RP guild that focused on Bertoxxulous worshippers.... I'm playing a Gnome Necromancer of the Dark Reflection..... we are a distant ally of the Bloodsabres, and our goals are the same.... to spread the will of the Plaguebringer. <br>
<br>
The only problem is.... the server population is low, so I doubt that enough people will bother to role play Bertoxxulous worshippers, much less being organized enough to form a viable guild. <br>
<br>
So in the end.... as an isolated Bertox follower, I have no option but to resort to allying myself with mostly Teir'Dals who follow Innoruuk. Most of them dont even have a clue what Bertoxxulous stands for. <br>
<br>
I do predict that Bertoxxulous-following characters *will* be much more prominent once Verant released the long rumored Plane of Decay (or wherever Bertox may live in)..... it's been long rumored that a portal to the Plane of Decay was supposed to open up during the Plague of the Karanas event. Alas, it did not happen. <br>
<br>
By giving Bertox his own Plane, Verant will end up advertising him as one of the stronger evil deities to contend with..... which gives him more clout in Norrath. <br>
<br>
I doubt I will ever willingly participate in raiding his abode tho. There is no strong role playing justification for a follower to stab Bertox in the back. <br>

Anyways, I'm sure they're out there, but I haven't ran into anyone claiming Bertox as their god on FV that wasn't a gnome.  I was thinking of giving it a try next time I choose a human Sk, if I get the chance.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I serve Innoruuk right now, but there's something ridiculous about Innoruuk that I can't get over.  Given the choice I would much rather choose Cazic-Thule.

Elroisli marr... maybe if somones loved one were to die, they would strike back at Elrolisi for revenge.<br>

Mithaniel marr, would be last.. however good he is, he has a trait that a few of the evil's respect.<br>
<br>
Solusek Ro, some upstart wishing to take his place.<br>
<br>
Deitys like Brell and Rallos may have there followers wage war on them, but the deity Brell is fairly un-concerned with events in norrath so i cannot see a major intent for people to kill him.<br>

Tribunal, is an planer prison, mayhap somone will try to break out an previouse avatar from there halls, other than that they are to neutral.<br>

Karana, The bloodsabres would take Karana, Rodcet Nife for sure... not many else would be to concerned with them.<br>

In my opinion Neriak needs to 'Move' further away from freeport... bah! worthless location.<br>

When I started on day 1, I hoped that we could unite all Bertoxxulous worshippers in one guild, and even better, have enough evil gnomes to support an entire guild. <br>
Unfortunately, things were not to be as I had hoped. When the server went live and there was alot of gnomes around, quite a few evil ones too, plus there was some Plaguebringers of other races that made their presence known on this board as well. (Roddy and Rhalax...something comes to mind) <br>
I even joined the Regents of Rust, an evil gnome guild, but the members dropped like flies, and soon we were only three active left. This, combined with the fact that Roddy dissappeared and Rhalax-something stopped playing for some time, made me look around for other evil guilds. And then I stopped for a month or two...:) <br>
<br>
Well, my point is, I think we need to accept that Bertoxxulous worshippers are not that many, and we will have to mingle with the other evil guys and gals around. :0) <br>
<br>
(Perhaps we could infiltrate a common evil guild, and make a Bertoxxulous faction within that guild?)<br>
<br>
<br>
Ohh, and it is good to see that Roddy haven't left, but just get reincarnated! :) <p><b>Tanheuser Finkelstein</b><br>

Takish Hiz was originally the Elven capitol, before there were any dark elves.  I don't know which oracle you're talking about, but it's likely the &quot;Oracles of Takish&quot; were high elves, not dark elves. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>
