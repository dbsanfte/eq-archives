<br>
I cannot leave without some goodbyes. <br>
<br>
I was accused of making more drama than I solved, or something.. but allow this bard one last hurrah, huh?<br>
<br>
Larraque: you are a good person. You are liked. I liked you and will miss you. Keep these idiots laughing. And when I want to hear your weird robotic woman voice I have your phone number.<br>
<br>
Caillou: you were my closest friend on the game. I hope you don't lose my email. I want to keep in touch.<br>
<br>
Mixxi: You brought me into the family. I don't know what happened after my last post, but I'd like to think that you stood by me to the end. Good luck with the kids. You are one of the good people.<br>
<br>
Gneen: You probably will never see this, but along with Caillou I'll probably never forget you. You retired a while back, but the hole was never filled. Good luck in all you do.<br>
<br>
Namae: You were Kuladen's measuring stick. Everything he did, he did in your shadow. I guess its like the wind beneath his wings: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You were always cold there in my shadow....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kanina: You are one of the greatest RPers I ever ran into. If Kuladen needed a foil, a nemesis, you were there.. and you never broke character. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Sabbik: My first EQ friend. I'll look for you out in the Real world, huh bud?<br>
<br>
Snumpkin: My partner in crime. Probably the only other person who I felt understood my inability to settle down.<br>
<br>
Sarhea: You have a rough exterior, but you have a large heart. Thank you for everything.<br>
<br>
Titaisia: You were my role model. When I couldn't remember the difference between a lull and a mez, you always happily answered my questions.<br>
<br>
Shabba: you had that damn sword Kuladen wanted. /salute a true bard<br>
<br>
Dominion/Apep: You made the first Kuladen a part of history. It created the spark that became the bard. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Meledi: You are my rock. I cannot believe how much I relied on you. Thanks for putting up with me.<br>
<br>
Roose: You always made me smile.. keep Rasmus out of trouble, eh? I want my number one RL fan to stay safe and grow up strong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Siffo: My original partner in crime. We stood up to that nasty ole' Brutin, huh? Good times...<br>
<br>
Tuppen: Again, I don't know what happened. But I imagine you standing by me till the end. A truer friend I could not ask for. I am very sorry if I hurt you.<br>
<br>
Isharra: We butted heads more than not, but I think its because we were so alike. I guess more alike than I thought. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Dalion: You were my silly inspiration. I remember hearing of your bunny exploits very early on, and YOU BUNNY BUTCHERING BITCH created the board Kuladen.<br>
<br>
Elyta/Katryna: You kept me on my toes.. I loved it. Go ahead and tell everyone Kuladen's real name is Eugene Quincey Barkhead IV. Heh. It was fun to have someone have a little power over the bard.<br>
<br>
Didi: You alone tempted me to the dark side. I'm sorry Kooladen didn't pan out.<br>
<br>
Leedor: You were another excellent foil. The stern paladin who loved to smack down the bard. Thanks for the RP<br>
<br>
Natasa: My number one fan. I don't know how many people I pissed off in game and out when they claimed to be my number one fan and I pointed to you. /hug Natasa<br>
<br>
Tinwin: The gnomish paladin pirate. Hilarious. Someone for Kuladen to have fun with. Showed me to not be constraned by class. <br>
<br>
God there are so many people. I don't want to leave anyone out. But i know I will.<br>
<br>
Kheldo: You alone made me snort up my drink. I have never meet a funnier character. You'll definately be missed. Well aside from:<br>
<br>
Pegleggy Pete: You also will be missed. What a hilarious creation.<br>
<br>
Elsbet: You shared the greatest adventure of my EQ life, and the realization of one of Kuladen's two life goals. He met his god. Thank you for making it with him.<br>
<br>
Jaxy/Eviah: How did we always get into the same groups?! I know how.. luck on my part. Good luck in Real life.<br>
<br>
Lith: I love the sig, and the artwork. It brought a face to my nutty adventures. I appreciate it very much, and keep up the great work.<br>
<br>
Kaileena: I am sorry.. truly sorry. I hung around as long as I could I guess. Namae has been given access to Kuladen and Jochel (my super secret beastlord alt) to hand out prizes. You can have whatever money is in the bank account (not much I'm afraid).<br>
<br>
Syll - The only bard Kuladen wanted to be like. Well, ok, he just wanted your illusion shoulders. But thanks for being a friend.<br>
<br>
Eli - I got to see you return, and bring life back to Saga. Have fun in the game, bud. <br>
<br>
Who am I forgetting? I hear the music playing. I have a few special ones that come at the end...<br>
<br>
Everyone I've missed... I only missed you because this is really sad RL and I don't want to do it any more. The tears have stopped and my eyes hurt because I don't have any more tears. <br>
<br>
The final few:<br>
<br>
Magiith: I meant every word I said. You are a great person. Prove me right, bud. Keep on trying.<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
Walkingwolf: I dragged a good person into this, and for that, I deeply apologize. I hope you can forgive me. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
The door to the tavern closed, as the last patron left. Kuladen sat on stage, his feet dangling over the edge. Always in motion, they kicked forward and back as the wood elf stared at them, smiling at a memory. He felt a hand on his shoulder, and turned to see the callused hand of Hamin. <br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->It's time, elf.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
<br>
Nodding, Kuladen stood, and removed his breastplate. Red metal clanged to the floor, and was soon followed by blue greaves. His costume fell off him in peices, and the wood elf only paused to brush the orange hair out of his face and the tears from his eyes. <br>
<br>
Hamin looked on, at a respectful distance. Head lowered, his beard absorbed most of the tears, in case that blasted elf happened to look his way. He needn't worry, however.<br>
<br>
Hopping off the stage, Kuladen took in the tavern one last time. It was here that a shy bard fresh out of college poked his head in, after failing to pass himself off as a gnome.<br>
<br>
Smiling, he could the the ghosts of the past. Kuladen with Siffo, Bippin, and others on stage singing to Bridh. A crush turned his head to a ghost of himself smashing a glass, and a loving hand bandaging his. He turned in time to see a small girl carrying a long dead goblin, and ghosts of many people sprung into action. <br>
<br>
Smiling, Kuladen picked up his lute. Slinging it onto his back, he walked to the bar, and signed a note that Hamin handed him. A release order for all the children in the warehouse in Freeport, after the final edition of his newsletter, of course.<br>
<br>
Clearing his throat, Hamin stood in the doorway. <br>
<br>
Only a single candle burned, but the two needed very little light.<br>
<br>
Hesitantly, the elf moved towards the door, and stopped. <br>
<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'Hamin. I don't want to'<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>. He sniffed out, tears beginning anew. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'I'll miss all my friends. And.. and they need me.... and...'<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Kuladen paused, and spared one more glance at the tavern. '</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->And I need them.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>' <br>
<br>
With a sob his shoulders slumped, and he lowered his head. Hamin reached out a hand, the other holding the door open. Kuladen walked slowly out, his lute his only posession, the clothes on his back his only garments. <br>
<br>
Sparing one last glance, he smiled, sniffed away the tears, and left the tavern.<br>

((PoJae is only reminded of one thing at your ending Kuladen.  And that is this , which will remind me of you every time i reread that book.))<br>
<br>
Roads go ever ever on,<br>
     Over rock and under tree,<br>
By caves where never sun has shone,<br>
     By streams that never find the sea;<br>
Over snow by winter sown,<br>
     And through the merry flowers of June,<br>
Over grass and over stone,<br>
     And under the mountains in the moon.<br>
<br>
Roads go ever ever on<br>
     Under cload and under star,<br>
Yet feet that wandering have gone<br>
     Turn at last to home afar.<br>
Eyes that fire and sword have seen<br>
     And horror in the halls of stone<br>
Look at last on meadows green<br>
     And trees and hills they long have known.<br>
<br>
((J.R.R. Tolkien , <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Hobbit</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->))<br>

May you always look on meadows green and upon the trees and hills you have known Kuladen.  God's speed, and you have my utmost respect.  <br>
