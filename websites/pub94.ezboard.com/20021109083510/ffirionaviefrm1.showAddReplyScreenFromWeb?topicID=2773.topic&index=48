I do agree though, shrouds are non-replaceable and would be one of the best reasons for leaving ST in its current state, and the same goes for Gnome Illusion Masks. As you said there are weapons better then Scepters out there to be gotten, so not as crucial.<br>

<br>
While I would lose out on ever getting a gnome illusion mask, I'm actually fine w/ the people getting there first getting the best rewards (-vs- when my slow levelling ass makes it over there).<br>
<br>
However, the script has shown all signs of being broken currently.  I would really hope that the sleeper is left asleep until <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> after</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the new ST patch goes in, so that not only can we see what the new ST is like pre-awakening, but can also maybe enjoy some cool stuff that goes along with a functional script.<br>

<br>
It is crucial.  Of those 4 better weapons, 3 of them are off mobs that this server hasn't done.  1 of them is off of a mob that has been killed maybe twice.<br>
<br>
It's like removing Burnout IV and saying it is okay because Burnout V is still in the game.<br>
<br>
Okay, so maybe Ancient spells are uber.  They still drop in other places than ST.  Ask people on SH if they think it is worth it, because with just a few minutes I've already found boards/posts on guilds on SH that say ancient spells don't drop in ST.  So either they don't drop, or they drop so rarely that people haven't even seen any yet.<br>

Ill comment on what was written and then go to the soapbox and finnish off those comments as a rebuttle.<br>
<br>
There are a few reasons to wake the sleeper. And some of them where touched on here, and some where not.<br>
<br>
When the time comes we will make it a server event.  Some of us dont RP on a regular basis but you can be assured that all in Reso will RP if you initiate it.  The guild is very outgoing and generous to the community not only with guilds needing tanks to kill KD in Cobalt Scar and Ragefire in Sky Fire but also with tactics on killing luclin Boss mobs.  We dont hide behind false walls and tell you things that we discuss on our guild forum in the opposite.<br>
<br>
Resolution cant be called greedy as we have held open raids for epic drops for server members.  We have contributed to the server in many ways and we have not flaunted the high end.<br>
<br>
Fact is.  99% of everyone who plays EQ will NEVER see ST.  They will never get a key.  However if they played 5 years thier chances are increased.  This isnt about denying the server gear or even the mid level guilds.  This is about progression and sadly some minor paybacks as was mentioned earlier and ill touch on in a few paragraphs.<br>
<br>
As a fact I have discussed trades with 1 guild and waiting to talk to the leader of another for Primals for thier primary tanks providing the tanks agree the weapon stays with the guild.  You could ask why doesnt everyone deserve a primal or the experience.. Well they do and that is the fault of VI for creating a 99th level warder that is unkillable so they dont have to finnish a storyline.  FV will always get new members and each new member is entitled to this experience.  When does the sleeper awake?  <br>
<br>
Now to the posts.<br>
<br>
Which other server other than test has the warder sleeping on it?<br>
<br>
Jarkell.  The new tomb is every reason to awaken him.. We are at a end with the tomb. Should we hang up out accounts for a year and let everyone else who dreams of getting a key work to one just to find out they needed to take 3 months off and need 3 more months?   We have raced to the end with a guild that has all but collapsed in on itself (fire and fury).  They are now months out from killing 4th warder.  Someone is going to wake the sleeper. The new weapons process Avatar as well so they will be the same with exception of the AC and by time you are killing warders youll be at 1450 like me so it wont mean anything.<br>
<br>
Viren. Greed is based on wanting more not denying others unless its getting more through denying and we wouldnt be getting more of anything from ST. If you think RPing is KSing then you are on the wrong server.  RPing that would be killing the paladin then the mob or waiting till the mob wore the paladin down then you get both of thier gear. And giving up gear is rediculous as everyone who has these items was there and 'earned' them.  Warder loot can be 0 to many per warder.. We were shafted our first trip down but it was made up by the last raid there, and if waking the sleeper makes the zone harder to get stuff then everyoen should go to Ebay and buy thier stuff its alot easier there and even easier than joining a raid much less joining a raid that is a little harder.   Being punished by us is laughable.  If we wanted to wake the sleeper we had him dead to rights last time.  I only heard of BoW when i came here and knew of various people in that guild.  Basically FnF has no say in what we do.  If they want a robe for thier monk i suggest getting one.  Uh yeah and before Karayfym (sp) takes off with the stock.  Your last post.  If you honstly feel that FV is only unique cause of the sleeper then you should sell your account as well.  There are 100 more reasons why it is and if you can only think of one then thats plain sad.<br>
<br>
For the community. Take note of who is argueing the points here.  There are about 45 posts.  A few from people outside Resolution, AS and FnF.  The ones against are the two guilds other than resolution.  AS is against it cause they havent had the opportunity to do warders.. FnF is against it cause they are in a Heavy recruitment / restructureing process which would mean getting more gear for new recruits and how to justifty no primal for the newmembers.  <br>
<br>
Fact is AS never wanted to be part of the community based on thier posts prior.  They bought characters  which some of you opposed (mourn Benth who was in resolution until he had to pay for college so he sold his toon for tuition /cheer, and im glad someone bought it).  Thier site condoned swearing and if you were offended they were not for you.  All this was good as they were honest about it.  <br>
<br>
FnF plowed over many of your raids.  They posted self stroking grats on the kudos forums to appear the head guild in charge while all along they were suffering a competition for mobs by a guild who would not let them walk on them.  <br>
<br>
And ill post more on them in the soapbox.<br>
<br>
Reasons? Yes we have many many reasons.. Will FnF or AS wake sleeper when they are done and if they are able to? YES.. without a doubt they will so you are wasting your time petitioning this.  They will wake him no doubt and if they say otherwise just scroll back in time and read thier posts on the subject and others to get a feel for what thier goals are.<br>
<br>
BTW I heard there is a better tunic in VT.  Though im not sure never having been there yet.<br>

Sorry, all of this goes right out the window if you wake the sleeper.  Like I said, if you think AS FCFSing Ragefire was bad, waking sleeper is analogous to killing Ragefire everytime he spawned just so other guilds can't get epics.  If it's done out of greed it's uninformed, though I think that may be the case.  It gives a limited edge, like I've said, over other guilds.  What it does do is make the zone a HUGE TIMESINK and not much fun for anyone who does it.  League of Shadows, Ebon Storm, Dreadstorm, etc., etc. I'm sure would love to have the zone be decent when they get there, and if you want to punish AS, well, we'll be done with ST either way eventually, and then you can take credit for making the gaming experience of 200-300 other players that much worse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

False, a lot more than 1% of Torv has seen ST, closer to 20-25%, and that number grows everyday.  If you plan on playing on FV for awhile, there is a VERY good chance you will see ST.  Again, wouldn't you like it to be decent?<br>

Ah, great, so you're trying to justify screwing over the server by making the chief opponents of waking the sleeper look bad....<br>
<br>
Like I said, waking the sleeper would be the paramount of disregard for the server, the script is BROKEN.  Hello, as in it doesn't work?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes we have many many reasons.. Will FnF or AS wake sleeper when they are done and if they are able to?

<br>
AS would never wake the Sleeper, you can check through any posts I've made on this topic, and you won't find anything otherwise.  After I saw what it did to the Torv server, I realized that it was just a plain shitty and vindictive thing to do.  Ask Stabbington in-game how fun the broken script is....  Would FnF wake the Sleeper?  I don't know..but none of their members, to my knowledge, have woken the sleeper, like Reso, so I don't think they really understand the consequences.  It doesn't slow down competition, it just makes them, and all following guilds have a lot less fun in the zone that they are forced to use to progress.  And if you think you can do end-game encounters (AoW, Emperor, etc.) without a ton of primal, you're clueless.<br>
<br>
<br>
So here's my question, Coinfist:<br>
<br>
How do you justify ruining a zone for the rest of the server? <p>--Lacus<br>Grandmaster<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> a developer at the Fanfaire verified that post-sleeper ST will go live..<br>

ST before awakening will remain the same.<br>
<br>
Also, warders are farmed primarily for primal. The new version of primal drops off the normal MOBs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (a lot more than priceless does pre-awakening)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, so getting to warders doesn't really matter, if you have primal farming in mind. <br>

<br>
Why are you saying it will be rare now to see primal drop?  When only a month ago you were saying it would be common?  Most are talking about farming primals and you are saying its common as summoned water.  Only a few are even thinking remotley at a chance to get a shroud &lt;/points at Lactus&gt; this is a personal argument and not very valid since you are claiming to champion the server after months of pulling yourself and your guild away from it with RP this /rude.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sorry, all of this goes right out the window if you wake the sleeper.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Suppose the real positive thing here is we are not appealing to you.  And a try to break up the post into single sentences is pretty lame and shows you have no real argument unelss you are going to break it into single words.<br>
<br>
If your so positive with the upgrades then why are you even investing time now in ST?  You speak of luclin like there is no reason to do it so why are you concerned?<br>
<br>
Im not sure I understand your position now and maybe you can clarify it for me as well.  Over a month ago when AS was growing you were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> opposed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to RPing you basically said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to the server and everyone you are claiming to represent.  You come from a guild that released the sleeper.  You claim the new ST has more primal available but now you say it doesnt. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This last part sounds like monk greed, with no shrouds and all.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->There were many who disliked the actions of AS and you think you will be able to use this as a catapult into popular redemption?  and not to mention keeping the sleeper sleeping. Doubtful.  There is alot more hard work ahead that agreeing with someone if you want to have respect on this server.<br>
<br>
Heres your answer to your question and when you reply take a look at your post in quotes above.<br>
<br>
How do I justify ruining a zone? I ask you how will it be ruined except for your shroud?  <br>
<br>
All this harder or not is hearsay.  Or at least it comes from you and as you can see by the quote up top you change you mind to fit your need at the time.  So with that said your quote of my sentence stating you all will wake the sleeper still stands.  <br>
<br>
Give me proof of your good nature.<br>
