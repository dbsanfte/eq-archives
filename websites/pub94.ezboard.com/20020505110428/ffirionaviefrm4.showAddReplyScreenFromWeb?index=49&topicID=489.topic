That was me, and every time I see someone corrupting this server or exploiting Legends I will call them out again. Unlike some, I actually care about this server.<br>
<br>
Restoria said: &quot;Who was it that TOOK OVER a plane from a smaller guild who was attempting it under the guise of helping them? (Note: AFTER we helped them back onto their feet, no less.)&quot;<br>
<br>
Ask Edea about that. We did not take over. We CR'd their entire group of people when we came in, and we ASKED if we could come in first. We stated that we wanted the broken golem and nothing else, would clear to it, finish it, they could have all the loot from mobs we killed prior to that, then we would leave. They instead evac'd out after we CR'd them, opting not to take the free loot, but even tho the zone was then empty we did exactly as we said, and had been granted permission to do, cleared to the golem, killed it, and left. The zone was mostly populated at that time. Why they evac'd instead of taking the free loot I do not know, but we were in and out in like 30 mins, just as we said we'd be, and even tho they were gone, our word meant enough to us that we kept it.<br>
<br>
Restoria said: &quot;I'm still amazed that THEY didnt flame you for that. They had every right to, and chose not to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Flame us for what? Entering after granted permission? CR'ing their entire remaining group? Oiffering them free loot on the way to the golem? Or keeping our word and leaving after the golem was dead, even when no one was left in the zone? Odd things to flame someone for, but whatever toots your horn. Obviously, seeing as you weren't there, you really don't have a clue.<br>

There's nothing I can do about it; it's an exploit, and an easy one to get by the GMs if you have half a brain -- and anytime you have such an easy-to-perform exploit, those weak in honor or lacking self-esteem who wish to prop themselves up in that area will use the exploit.<br>
<br>
However, when I see it happen, absolutely I will shun the exploiters like the plague and denigrate them vociferously and often, letting as many people know about their behavior as I possibly can. And for those who associate with these people knowingly, I will most assuredly treat you the same, because that shows you too care nothing about our server.<br>

Seems to me there was ALOT of miscommunication about what happened in fear then. Especially when tons of DA were none to pleased about how Reso went in there. And speaking of honor, how does reso justify the Lodi kill taken from DA.. and then of course giving them the loot (assuming you gave them all the loot).<br>
<br>
Opps! We KS a giant turtle. Sorry our bad. Honor isn't something you can choose to have when it suits you or your guild.<br>

<br>
Replies such as the one you have just given to me are usually done to be so vague as to make it seem as if you have something extremly deep and thoughtful behind your words, when in fact, you're saying nothing but trying to look smart doing it.  Your first responce speaks of the game as it could be played on any server and makes no special mention of FV or its ruleset which instantly disqualifies it from having anything resembling a point to anything I, or anyone else, had to say.  Your second is just mind-numbing fluff.  To put it plainly, you're trying to flame me and doing a horrible job.<br>
<br>
FV was created for RPers.  Period.  I am not an RP Nazi, but I am against people coming to FV with no intention of playing a character. The great thing about how the server stands now is that basically everyone is friendly.  People seem to want to be here to enjoy the atmosphere of family and fun.  One of the things I love so much is that loot is not a concern.<br>
<br>
So let me make this clear from my standpoint.  I do not care about uber-loot or the distribution of it.  I do not care if I re-roll and meet up with a level 5 warrior in full ToV gear, so long as he is adding to the positive atmosphere by being a character.  I do however care about lame-ass, wanna-be power-gamers coming into FV because they can finally be king of the hill, if only because the real powergamers wouldn't waste their time coming here.  Who wants to be king of the anthill?<br>
<br>
Selling &quot;uber-loot&quot; will not be the cause of FVs decline.  It seems to me most of the people who are getting upset are those who already HAVE uber-gear.  The cry &quot;They didn't earn it&quot; looks like &quot;It's not fair because now everyone will be as uber as me and I had to 'work' really hard for mine&quot; because of the attitude behind all the posts.  The respect for a character on FV does not, in my opinion, seem to be based on ones equipment AT ALL!!  Who watches Mr Uber-guild-member_02 run by in the Nexus and go &quot;Wow, he's so cool!  He has PoH armor!!!  I want to just as cool as him!&quot;  Such thinking is for blue servers.<br>
<br>
What would be bad is a flood of d00ds coming over for no reason other than so they can get buy the great no-drop loot here.  Coming to FV to abuse the unique rules = bad.<br>
<br>
But I don't see that happening, as someone who has that much of a desire for loot will be playing on a server that CARES about loot... not FV.  It's not too hard to pop on a blue server, play 24 hours a day, and find your way into an uber-guild.  No need to come here and buy it.  As I said, king of the anthill.  So what I see as being both plausable and bad is the people who just can't hack it on blues coming over here.<br>
<br>
You want to try talking down to me, go ahead.  But I, along with everyone else with half the brain required to see through your third-grade attempts at looking smart, would appreciate it if you accually make a point and some attempt to stand behind it.  That goes for anyone else who can't do anything but fling BS back and forth.  You're just making yourself look equally foolish as the side you're crying about. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A> at: 4/6/02 9:59:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/7/02 12:02:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> ROFL,<br>

This is an old arguement and its been argued by people with stronger points. Thats why I am probably coming off as dismissive. If your up for it troll these boards and you'll find plenty of discussions about it. I have as much desire to revive this arguement as I would any arguements about TLC.<br>

If I am coming across as a poor flamer, well thats probably because I dont usually flame folks. If I flamed you, well I guess that makes you special. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We had a druidess in zone, she saw him pop on tracking, she left to go to GD to pick up the first of the groups. While she was gone getting others, DA spotted Lodi and, seeing no one else in zone, assumed it was theirs. (An understandable mistake, obviously.)<br>
<br>
So, our people ported in, plenty enough to kill Lodi. Did DA have enough to kill him then? I don't know, possibly, possibly not, that is one of those unanswerable questions. Note that I was not there for this one, I heard on guild chat, and it seemed to me that in the intertests of future good will we should just let them have it, even tho we had spotted it first and arrived with the force to kill him possibly first as well. But the people there were like 'We saw him first, we got the force here to kill him first, why should we let him go, we all just left our camps, blah blah'. However, after some convincing on my part and on the part of others, and because the mistake was certainly an understandable one, we gave them the loot.<br>
<br>
And how exactly, then, was this a dishonorable act? We saw him first, we quite possibly had the force to kill him there first, and even though we did kill him, we gave them the loot, no prob. Seems like we acted extraordinarily fairly here, all things considered. But I guess everyone has their own point of view.<br>

<br>
I came to FV because I was sick of all the shouting, babbling, oneup-manship, and other blabber on the other servers.  PvP servers are filled with people who get off on feeling bigger because they're twink is greater than your twink.  Blue servers are too populated and full of beggers, shouters, trainers, etc.<br>
<br>
FV is nice and peaceful.  The main thing that convinced me to join here was no zone-wide shouts and no auctions in non city zones.  That alone makes this server far superior to any other server.  In addition, I figured people that liked to role-play were, on the average, more friendly and intelligent then the average monkey.. I mean, &quot;d00d players&quot; on the other servers.<br>
<br>
I also want to play the high end game, because I find that that's the enjoyable part of the game.  If I was truly a dark elf wizard, then I wouldn't have fun chatting with people or going to weddings or consipring on how to take out Another_Useless_Highelf_00.  I'd want to blow stuff up.  Like dragons and giants and big scary monsters.  So, that's what I do.  <br>
<br>
I joined Fire and Fury because we take out big stuff, and I like doing that.  <br>
<br>
(I was intending to tie this to your post somehow..)<br>
<br>
What I also like here is that I don't see every level 5 player running around in level 50+ armor.  In my opinion that trivializes the game.  It annoyed me on Tallon Zek when every single player you ran in to had gear that dropped in level 50+ zones and had an MR of 200+ and killed you in 2 seconds.  It became pointless to do anything when you'd always just run into a twink that could take you down easily.  On (established) blue servers, the market is so saturated that your standard level 1 bard is running around in full lambent or singing steel, your standard level 1 warrior has a lammy and a wurmslayer, etc etc.  I think that trivializes the game.  It doesn't kill my enjoyment of it, but it lessens the enjoyment for me some.<br>
<br>
I'm not speaking for the others in Fire and Fury who are debating the topic of loot and such, but I think I can understand where they're coming from.  <br>
<br>
Anyway I didn't come here to be king of anything, let alone an anthill.  I don't dislike the idea of distribution of planar gear becuase I won't look as good in comparison to others.  I don't like the idea of distribution of planar gear to those who can't go to planes because it would make this server about the same as the other servers I've been on.  The arguments that others in Fire and Fury are making is that people who buy planar gear aren't earning their equipment.  If everyone can go shell out a few thousand plat (which is trivial to get) to buy planar armor, there's no real point for the level 46 restriction to go there.  You just let your Local_Uber_Guild_00 go there and wait for them to flood the marketplace.<br>

If you want to think of it from a role-playing/in character perspective, then it does make sense for good items to bring with them a notion of status.  I.e:<br>
<br>
Galtron walks into the bar with a grim face and orders an ale.  <br>
A novice adventurer looks upon Galtron and whispers to his friend: &quot;By Tunare!  That is the great warrior Galtron.  And look at that breastplate he has donned.  It is rumored he had to kill the great Dragon Trakenon himself for such a prize!  And that sword.  Rumor has it that it was wielded by a horrid snakeman in the Temple of Ssraeshza, the legendary enslavers of the Iksar race.  This is a powerful and great man indeed, my friend&quot;<br>
<br>
(by the way I made up the name &quot;Galtron&quot; so I'm not referring to anyone, and I'm not trying to imply that Trakanon or Ssra mobs are &quot;uber&quot; or anything)<br>
<br>
You have to take that with a grain of salt, but you have to take all of Everquest with a grain of salt if you're trying to roleplay.  <br>
<br>
At any rate, if I was roleplaying in D&amp;D and I was a level 3 warrior in leather armor with a long sword, and then a warrior walked in with plate armor, some ornate shield, a fiery sword, etc I'd automatically give him a little respect and awe.  I'd look at my crappy long sword with dried orc blood on it and think: &quot;Someday I will be a champion of the realms like he is&quot;.   Or if I was a wizard and cast detect magic and a robed figure lit up like a Christmas tree -)<br>

<br>
We had a similar incident with DA and Lodi. We popped into the zone with our group to gank him and we very quickly received a tell from some DA explaining that they were building up the forces to take him and were wondering if we were here to take a shot at him (Lodi).<br>
<br>
We quickly realized that DA was setting up and explained we were here to take a shot at Lodi but now realize that DA was here first and deserved the oppourunity to take Lodi down.<br>
<br>
Pretty simple. Pretty reasonable. Absolutely no grey area.<br>
<br>
Now I dont know exactly what happened that day between DA and Reso but I would find it difficult to believe no one in DA sent a tell to someone in the Reso raiding party trying to reason with them. Maybe it really was a mistake. Maybe it was just a few folks in Reso that jumped the gun because they really believed they were right. But once again, just like the fear incident, there were alot of folks in DA that were left with a bad taste in their mouths over it. <br>
<br>
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt though Cori. I mean I have had the pleasure of playing with a lot of reso and I would like to think the people I got to know wouldnt go out and intentionally try to screw another guild over. But if Reso is as honorable as you believe it is I would suggest you make very clear to your leadership that mistakes / miscommunications like the Fear / Lodi incidents don't happen again. People will start to talk.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Sorry, didnt really answer your question did I?<br>
<br>
This might be considered dishonorable because <br>
<br>
a) Poor communication can lead to misunderstanding which can be interpreted as dishonor. For example the majority of tells/chat I received about these incidente were, &quot;Reso came in and took Lodi from us!&quot; or &quot;We agreed to let Reso have a chance at the mob they wanted in fear, but we were supposed to clear the stuff to there. They just came in and took over!&quot;<br>
<br>
b) Your team(s) did engage Lodi and looted Lodi. Since there was a dispute over who deserved the chance to take Lodi there are some folks out there that question wether all the loot was turned over or just some of it. &quot;They came in and took him from us, how do we know they turned everything over?&quot;<br>
<br>
See what I mean about people talking? Its really easy to paint someone or another group as &quot;the bad guys&quot; isn't it?<br>

But poor communication isn't in any way dishonorable, it is simply what it is, poor communication. And that does lead to people making mistakes. Probably our druidess when she saw him pop should have told DA that we were taking him, but she didn't.  But in the long run, the end result was A) they were offered free loot (they had one cleric there, it's not like they COULD have cleared to the golem, we had to do it) and turned it down for whatever reason, and B) they got the loot. (And it was all the loot, and if I find out different, I will be very pissed off at whoever held something back.)<br>
<br>
But if ya wanna talk about lame-ass things people do, that don't involve any miscommunication, HERE is an example of utter and complete black-and-white lack of decency. Me and Lysanthes and Nothsa were on the middle garg ledge in VL tonight, there for about six hours. During that time, there were people doing upper spiders and people down below, and we had no probs, just went about our business. Then Qixx comes in and says we should move downstairs, and if we don't, he's just gonna train stuff thru us. In other words, a threat to train us in an attempt to force us to move where we have been FINE for SIX HOURS. And did he ever! 10 mobs, 20? I don't know, but we definitely had to zone after the first batch or two he pulled onto us. (He didn't get anyone but my pet spider killed, fortunately.)<br>
<br>
No ambiguities there, no miscommunications. One person in your guild said they were intending on going to Legends to use it to transfer stuff from another server to this one. And now another one intentionally and blatantly trains people. This leads me to conclude two  things: 1) Either your vetting procedure for applicants sucks or you actually seek these kind of people out, and 2) your leader lacks the balls to actually enforce any standards of decency.<br>

<br>
We were almost going to camp didnt worry about it.<br>
First was Qixx pulling past us, then we managed to deal with the trained pull. Then again he did it with another 3 or 4, and Sinjo came shortly with his own train.<br>
<br>
They all were in the same group. That clearcut effort to train us outta the way. Ledge group probably cant kill enough at the upper camp and needed that middle gargs but theres no need to triple train us to get us out of our camp spot for 6hours just so they can have more mobs to keel for xp.<br>
<br>
So what if your camp spot is uptop and lack of mobs to kill per cycle because you cant pull from our middle gargs camp spot. That justify you to train us out?<br>
<br>
Pretty much a simple tell would do, and compromise be reached. A tell like *Shift your camp downstairs or I will train pass you* Think thats going to work?<br>

<br>
the response was &quot;weve been here for 6 hours&quot;<br>
<br>
my response &quot;ok well im gonna pull the unclaimed mobs below you&quot;<br>
<br>
and i will every single time.<br>
<br>
im friends with lysanthes and nothsa, and im sorry you guys didnt hear the full story about what happened. I will give you a tell next time to try to work something out rather than that ass of a guildmate you call coriolis. Im sure we could have reasonably worked it out if i had not given him the tell first.<br>

I gave my spot up in the group so that nothsa could have a group after the incident.<br>

Nothing like a group with a pair of pullers like that to keep the ol exp bar heading in the right direction. <br>

Sorry if the pulling caused any grief, I know it was not intentional, we were just trying to speed up the exp flow a little with a few extra mobs.<br>

<br>
I dont know what happened in Velks, but I hope you guys get it worked out. One thing I do know though is that the more animosity and tension that builds up between folks the more likely they will do stupid things. Once people get it in their heads that another group is &quot;the enemy&quot;, &quot;the bad guys&quot; or &quot;dishonorable&quot; the more likely they will treat that group as such.<br>
<br>
Self full filling prophecy and all that sort of stuff.<br>
<br>
Our guilds rarely interact now. We seem to be staying out of each others way and generally just don't bother each other except on these boards. Thats going to change as both guilds start migrating towards the same encounters (until PoP is released anyway). HoT is gonna be ugly if we can't learn to play in the same zone with each other so instead of folks stirring up stuff and causing tension between the guilds on these boards I would like to suggest this...<br>
<br>
If someone in your guild has an issue with someone in my guild they discuss it with your leadership and if the leadership feels its necessary they send bako an e-mail and vice versa for coinfist. These boards are really not the place to work out disagreements because the discussions quickly degenerate into ugly name calling and finger pointing. That turns into tension and hard feelings in the game and then people start acting on those feelings and go and do stupid stuff.<br>
<br>
As for someone going to legends and coming back I have this to say. How in the world are you coming to the conclusion that this action is dishonourable? Seems to me that if someone was willing to go through all that trouble, jump through all the hoops and rules verant put out (and they did go through the rules) then thats their choice. You may not approve of their actions but just because YOU disapprove doesn't make it &quot;dishonourable&quot;. Especially since they did nothing illegal and broke no rules. <br>
<br>
If your arguement is that they are upsetting the balance and sanctity of this server well I got a newsflash for ya. The balance and sanctity of this server went out the window the second folks discovered and started using the alignment bug. The balance and sanctity of this server was flushed down the toilet when we saw level 10 folks with planar gear.<br>
<br>
If you ask me those two issues will do more damage to this server than a few folks bringing over items from legends.<br>
