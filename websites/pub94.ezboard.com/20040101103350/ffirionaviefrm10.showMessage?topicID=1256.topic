I flee not what is behind me, nor seek that which lay before.<br>
<br>
I simply ride.<br>
<br>
My long black braid falls hard against my back before flying again behind me, whipped by the strong winds that fill the hollows within me with freedom, feeding the fire in my heart and my hands as I urge Devaki foreward, carrying us faster with every hoofbeat.  I cling with one hand wrapped into his dark mane, both of us sleek not by sweat, but by the spray of the wide ocean stretching below and around us.  Still, it is of no use.  The golden chain that binds me hangs heavier still about my soul, and I think again of earth, then nudge my steed toward the shore.<br>
<br>
I dispell the cloud of air supporting us as I dismount, sending Devaki to return to home as I remove his simple bridle.  I never asked my mother whence hailed the steed that had served her mother, and I believe also her mother before.  She may have intended to share the tale when came my time to assume the full inheritance of fata', but of all her mysteries I may never discover, the origins of a steed were never the ones that made mist want to rise to my eyes.<br>
<br>
I look about quickly, and determine this patch of woods should be secluded enough from both the sisters who walk this island, and those who come to help them serve their goddess in battle, perhaps granting them the glorious honor of martyrdom.  Theirs is a politic dance of scheming and bloodshed of which I want no part, empty spirals of loves and hates vying to prove dominance in a world that was never mine, nor have I ever desired.  Feeling a need for connection to the earth, I retrieve my shovel and turn over a portion of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Krypsa, miri pisliskurja, time to make camp.&quot;<br>
<br>
She rises formed of earth and prepares my blankets before taking a point from which watch over my safety while I sleep.  I miss the comforts of home, the close walls of the vardo snuggled with pillows and blankets to hold in the warmth after long nights of prastonata around the fire.  I had once thought to see if perhaps there would be room for me at one of the camps that dot Antonica, but these People are not my natsia, and I knew it would only make me grow more restless to stay so long in one place.  My father once snapped that I was too bravi'os even to travel within our own tasque, and as he returned to the family after he had bonded me to my Master, perhaps it truly was for me that he and my mother travelled alone.<br>
<br>
I settle into my blankets but cannot sleep, as thoughts turned toward my Master both unsettle and inflame me in unruly maelstroms I cannot yet control.  He has great power, greater than even my father knew, though Ta-Ta must have seen the humble kindness else he would not have apprenticed me.  His is a gentle generosity I cherish, and I tell myself I endeavor so greatly to excel in my studies, to please him, as simple repayment for the tutelage he gives me.  I tell myself this, suppressing the glint of his sharp eyes in my memory and the fire that grows...<br>
<br>
I arise, and re-pack my things myself before grasping my shovel and turning Krypsa back into the earth, smoothing it.  I flick the bridle into the air and mount Devaki as he appears.  My Master gave me tasks to perform in Neriak, and that means I should be instead be spending the night in the room that an unnamed member of the Indigo Brotherhood arranged for me to keep in the inn that fills their courtyard.  The dim and noisy caves have always been an odd home for me, though the secret sparks and eerie lights that lurk behind the dark facade strike an echo within, yet there is no time to ponder what may or may not yet be.  I am bound by bakht to misli le vai'datha, travel the many paths, and it is not for me to choose.<br>
<br>
I ride. <p><p align="center"><a href="http://elfwood.lysator.liu.se/loth/s/a/sandraleigh/ewdichotomy.jpg.html"><img border="0" src="http://www.theirlanguage.com/graphics/vondra.png"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vondradevaidatha>Vondra de Vaidatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/03 1:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I read.</span><hr size=1> I set my satchel down upon the stand beside my bed, its drawers still turned toward the wall.  I keep nothing in them so it is no deterrent from them being opened, merely an indicator for when the attempt is made.  There are no such signs in the strands of straw left at its base, and I struggle with a moment of disappointment.  Either I have ceased to be a worthy object of fascination for the cave-city's choros and spies, or I have lost my touch for detecting them.  Whichever the case, it is of no import, and the likely answer is that it should by now be well known that I have neither possessions nor secrets worth stealing.<br>
<br>
I scarce have time to tuck away my shawl when there is a knock at the door.  Once opened, the doorway reveals the sharp, appealing features of a young priest I recognize from the matriarchal sect within the temple.  Upon seeing no discernable reaction to his presence, he speaks with overly-casual tones, marked by their formality.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vendui Gypsy, usstan have heard word dos has returned.  Usstan have also heard of the legendary seership dossta women possess, and desire to know what dossta eyes see for ussa.  Dos will do so, and dos will be paid.&quot;<br>
<br>
I listen as he speaks with the usual directness inherent within this city's tongue, though noting a subtle lack of the disdainful dismissiveness the priests normally display in their transactions.  Oh, the attempts are certainly there, but this is clearly a test, and I am certain that part of this test is whether I will be aware of it.  Very well, I hold no fear of this man, and his priesthood is not jostumal to me, though neither are they allies.  I have been careful to forge my relationships with the various factions well within their view, though not within their halls until an invitation was made.<br>
<br>
I make my own invitation by stepping back and allowing the priest to enter.  I allow him to seat himself upon the only chair and take my own place on the edge of my bed, retrieving my cards from my satchel before clearing it from the stand.  As I shuffle, I address him, distracting with words while I focus my sight of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you are aware sime pale'cido from my people, sime no taibhsear, merely a bakh-kulath'mai.  However, I will read for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do not translate the words of my people, in part to test him in return, and in part because those of his drow sect rarely translate their own dialect unless pressed, even to other dark elves.  He does not ask, though I can discern by his annoyance that while he can gather the general intent of my words, he is too proud to admit he does not understand them fully.<br>
<br>
I finish shuffling and draw three cards for him, and only three.  I speak aloud not fully to him, but to allow him to listen as I speak with bakht itself, seeking reassurance that I read it correctly.<br>
<br>
&quot;In your past I see tranquility, a pause in safety despite surroundings of great struggle, turmoil.  You took respite from the chaos around you to regather your strength, your convictions. You withdrew from the material world in order to find your spiritual guidance.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do not have to look at him to know he is not taking this reading seriously, as his past is quite easy to guess due to his vocation and background.  He was born to a merchant family that is well-known, and gave up his place in it as third-born male to seek out and serve the matriarchal orders of the drow.  As I have been introduced and allied to the merchants as a fellow tradeswoman, there is no reason I should not already know these things.  Paying his skepticism no heed, I continue.<br>
<br>
&quot;In your present, you are shrouded and pained, suffering for your loss and wishing for what may have been.  You are stabbed deep within for regret over choices you would now remake, near-crippled by your sadness and grief.&quot;<br>
<br>
I sense the blood begin to drain from his face, and though I am speaking more plainly than is my wont while reading for others, I do not tell him all I see.  I do not tell him I am aware his second-older brother has recently been killed, nor that I also see within him the opportunity to see his eldest brother also gone and weave his way back into the inheritance, nor that I also see great potential for him within the sect he now inhabits.  After all, they would not have sent a man unless they felt he showed promise, though he seems unaware of what he may yet earn within them.  But no, these truths, I keep to myself.  He came to test me, not for aid, and by no means am I kal'enedral to aid him in his angst, nor to place myself in harm's way for revealing I may know too much.<br>
<br>
&quot;And my future, Gypsy, what see you ahead?&quot;<br>
<br>
His attempts at casual tones are still present, but he has dropped the dialectual affectations of speech learned while among his sect.  I do not smile, do not look up, simply continue to speak and see.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see before you a path of power and riches, grasped firmly, tightly against you.  Neriak surrounds you, yet is behind you while you hold strong to your goals.&quot;<br>
<br>
I also see that he clutches at the path of power and riches too tightly, and the city is behind him because his back is to it, a dangerous position for such a city to take up.  If he continues on his path, his greed and ambition will cause him to forsake any responsibilities or alliances even among the caste to which he was born and the sect to which he has pledged himself.  He will do them damage only barely before he will place himself in harm's closest reach.<br>
<br>
I look up as I return my cards to deck, deck to case, and case to satchel.  I appear to have passed his test, and he appears to have failed mine.  Betrayal and shifting loyalties lurk behind the carefully returned sheen of his eyes as he rises to pay me and depart.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dos are quite gifted, here is dossta reward.  Bella'dos.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gestena,&quot; I thank him, opening and then closing again the door before unwrapping the tiny bundle I received.  I find a single, polished platinum piece wrapped in a note.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You may yet be an asset to the Temple of Innoruuk, but have yet to prove yourself.  When you have shown aspects more pleasing, perhaps you may be allowed to offer your service to earn our favor.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And that is all, yet I consider it a fair payment in trade.  They have let me know they are observing me closely without undue malice, and I have returned a fledgling viper to their breast.  <br>
<br>
I feel a twinge again, a tugging along one of my vai'datha, and perhaps I ought to retrieve my cards and see if they may aid me in piercing the dense fog that is my own future.  I return to my bed, focus inward, shuffle my cards, then open my eyes and read. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vondradevaidatha>Vondra de Vaidatha</A> at: 12/25/03 11:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vondradevaidatha>Vondra de Vaidatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/03 12:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I risk.</span><hr size=1> I lay stil-clothed upon the spread that covers my bed, my arm curled beneath the pillow on which I rest my cheek.  I try to calm my thoughts, but they will not settle.  I try to slow my breath, but it will not comply.  Too much swirls around me, and I have no choice but to rise again, straighten my gown, and depart from the abergo.<br>
<br>
I nod to the guard outside as I pass, feigning a coy smile in response to the narrow-eyed one he steals toward me.  I have little doubt but that were I homely, I would not have been afforded so close an attention and opportunity by the guard nor their allies within the warrior caste.  I use this fondness to slip past the docks overlooking the underground river, pause to summon a light film of air to keep me dry, then plunge myself into its depths.<br>
<br>
I find swimming through these currents soothing, so close a blending of water and earth, yet it is not for relaxation I have come.  I swirl the waters around and through me, becoming one with them to obscure myself from view.  I was once offered sometime employment by the proprietor of the Blind Fish to don one of my more revealing gowns and take up a long-term swim at a point just outside the tavern's view of the waters, but I prefer to hold that position without being observed by those inside, sadulli from discovery.  Only thus may I acheive my objectives.<br>
<br>
I remain within the waters for but a short while before the appointed time arrives, and I observe the Leatherfoot spy carefully make his way toward the window before me.  He pauses for but a moment before turning again to place an encrypted message into a hidden drop-point beneath the docks where they will remain until another of the agents may sneak through to obtain them.  Sometimes they lay there for days or weeks, but always are they retrieved.<br>
<br>
If I had not followed this spy many times before, I may not have noticed that he remained long enough at the window to watch the female within throw a few of her darts.  She throws aptly and keenly, but does not strike the center with any of the three that leave her hands.  I have watched her for some time, and I know the patterns she creates upon the board at the appointed time are carefully placed, as she has seldom failed to strike bulls-eye when she so chooses.  I observe for a few more rounds, fixing the patterns in my mind before swimming to retrieve the encoded messages from their hole.  I have not yet deciphered the code, but I shall have plenty of time to study them again whilst I make my short journey.<br>
<br>
I emerge again from the waters, allowing the guard a glimpse as I lean down to brush the skirt of my gown, keeping his mind occupied from nosy krethes on my times within these waters.  I may have been tasked by his order to investigate the dealings of the halflings within their own city, but I have not so vowed to alert them to the dealings within Neriak itself.  I make my way back out from the city, calling in the earth to obscure me again before departing.  Members of the Outer Guard have caught word of my dealings with Rivervale, and I have been told they lack the clearance necessary for them to be informed I was acting in subversion.  Regardless, such matters are beneath my concern, I merely remember to be careful when within the dark forest.<br>
<br>
Devaki carries me to the Leatherfoot camp while I steal as much study as I may of the encryption before carefully rolling them back into their appointed foldings and dismount to deliver them.  I also share briefly what I have learned regarding the location of spies that have made their way into the woods near Rivervale, and then depart before I may be further observed.  I let Devaki take me to a hidden corner of the woods where I again make camp, no longer having the patience to return to Neriak right away.<br>
<br>
I wonder briefly how far this dance of deception may carry my hokano baro, for how long I may play the elves off the halflings just enough to prevent either of them from gaining an upper hand, or to lose need of my services.  Still, it is wonder, not worry, as it is my place to position myself into opportunity, not to become personally involved in the affairs of the gorgio.  Little is expected of a bravi'i, unkempt gypsy even when she is thought to be tamed, and I rely on these perceptions to aid me should this path turn sour.  I simply misli miros vai'datha, and if these paths cause me to take risks then, by no other choice, I risk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vondradevaidatha>Vondra de Vaidatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/5/03 2:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1256.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.theirlanguage.com/graphics/vondra-color.png width=59 height=153></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I rest.</span><hr size=1> I allow Krypsa to place but one more log within the small stone circle before requesting she take up her post to stand guard.  I pause then, asking of the earth to confirm no feet fall upon it nearby, asking of the wind that no breaths fly through it within a short distance of my camp.  Above all at this moment I require privacy, privacy and rest.  I call forth the flame within me to spark without, and my campfire is ablaze.<br>
<br>
I sit for some time at the fire, watching the flames lick at the air, forming patterns and after-images that echo into visions in my mind.  But now, as before with my cards, these visions bring forth not glimpses at the future, but memories of the past.  I remember long rides through the plains, playing as a child in the rear of the vardo while my parents held each other closely in front.  I remember long nights around the fire, my little feet slowly growing more nimble and true while attempting to imitate the graceful, passionate dancing of my mother, my father's violin playing her onward.  I remember quiet times, the careful times within the vardo as my mother taught me the secrets, the talents, the knowings I should one day need to carry forward in her stead, another link in the long chain that binds the rom together into one People, however scattered we yet may be.<br>
<br>
I remember all these things until they stab at me, tearing deep into my heart with the cherished torments of longing, of yearning, of passionate desires for a journey's end I know I shall never see.  It is only in times such as these my heart feels truly one with my people, my feet feel truly filled with their dance.  Finally, when my mind becomes empty but for the fire that fills my soul, I leap upwards, throw my hair free, and dance.<br>
<br>
My steps turn and move me as my feet find their own measure, keeping rhythm to a music audible only to the ears of my people.  It is no performance, there are no painted flesh or coin-edged scarves I use for gage pleasures.  It is tradition, it is ritual, it is the stories and soul of all storvandre, smavandre and even clachans, of all my people whether they travel far, close, or not at all for generations.  There is a single thread that binds us, that tugs at us, that pulls us all forward from the comfortable sedentary life of inclusion, and when this thread is plucked our music is formed, never to be denied.<br>
<br>
I step and turn, gesture and weave, my hair flying behind me and my long skirt kicked and flicked with sharp, fluid movements.  My eyes see only the fire without and the fire within, glazed over with the mists that guide my people's destinies and keep control of our bakht ever just outside our grasp.  Sadulli under Krypsa's watchful guard I dance until the moon sets, the chill of the air encroaching toward the fire for a full hour before my steps cease and I collapse into a spent heap, gasping for breath and consciousness.<br>
<br>
My attendant moves forward and places a blanket over me, breaking off a soft piece of earth from her form to place under my head before returning to her post.  I send an image of gratitude toward her as I allow the fire without to warm me, and the fire within to cool.  I have renewed my link and duties to my people, pale'cido from them though I am, and again I feel as though one made almost-whole.<br>
<br>
