<br>
------------------------------------- <br>
First off you can only learn languages through /say and through /groupsay. Any other method, like /emote /guild /tell will not work to further your skill. Furthermore, /groupsay will only work if you're both in the same zone. And of course, /say only works if you're within hearing distance. <br>
<br>
Okay, first off these are the rules of learning: <br>
<br>
You do NOT need to put skill points into a language for you to learn it. It helps, but you dont' have to do it. <br>
<br>
You can only reach maximum level of proficiency in a language determined by the following formula: (current level * 5) + 5 and it maxxes out at 100. <br>
<br>
In addition, you can only learn one point per hour per zone in language skills. Meaning that if you learned one point in human you can't learn anymore in any other language until you zone or an hour has ellapsed. (I'm still not 100% positive on this last point though, the whole only one point per any language, just not A language) <br>
<br>
Players can teach others +1 point above their current level. So for example, if your skill in human is 50 you could raise someone else's skill in human to 51. Then they could raise yours to 51, then you raise theirs to 52, etc... that way you could both become masters in a language without spending insane amounts of points in it :P <br>
<br>
About emotes... Emotes are kinda tricky. They require a language check in order for you to be able to emote in them. So you have to switch to the language you want to emote in. But the success of how the emote gets translated or not is dependent on the person watching/listening to you. The cutoff here is apparently 50 skill points (I think this is listed as &quot;average&quot; in your skills box), so if you have this mininum understanding of the language you can decipher the /emotes quite easily, and don't get the &quot;SoandSo make an unintelligible gesture&quot; message. <br>
<br>
Well that's about it I think. Also your language options from your guildmaster increase based on your level. I don't have a list, and it changes based on your race I think.<br>
<br>
As far as speaking languages here's the low down: <br>
<br>
Whatever you say will be spoken in the current language you have selected, depending on your skill this message will be scrambled (or not) by your compentence/incompetence in the language. Then this message is sent to the players around you, and undergo another series of scramblings based on THEIR competence/incompetence in the language. <br>
<br>
So if you are a master in Dwarf, you can speak and understand perfectly, but only if the person who's talking back to you is speaking correctly (ie, is also very skilled in Dwarf) AND is actually speaking Dwarf. You'll be able to tell if they are speaking dwarf or even if they are skilled in it, because it will say &quot;Soandso says, in Dwarvish, &quot;Hi how are you?&quot; or some similar utterance. <br>
<br>
One thing to note is that the game does not automatically switch languages based on who you're talking to. So even if you're a master in every language you are only saying that one thing in your current langauge. So, for example, if you spoke Dwarf, only those with good Dwarf understanding would get your message clearly. And their reply would have to be in dwarf for you to understand it. The game doesn't autmatically choose the best language skill you two share and use that for communication. That is up to you two to figure out and decide. <br>
<br>
Another thing, the scrambler that makes understanding languages works by going through the string of text you've sent and randomly changing letters/characters in this string based on your skill level. So, since this is a random process, repeating things several times will usually lead to different scrambling combinations, and the other person will be able to fill in the blanks if you will and understand what you're saying. Also the situation and context may help someone understand what you're saying regardless of their skill level in that language. It just takes some work  <br>
<br>
Finally, yes, there is the /language command. <br>
You can get the language list by typing: /language help <br>
<br>
This list as previously mentioned does change as you learn more languages but in the end after you learn all the languages it should remain static  Human is always option number 1 though, and Lizardman seems to be near the end of it. So setting up a /language help hotkey could be useful if you're constantly learning new languages. <br>
<br>
As for what language to learn, I've decided to master all the native languages of the different races I can morph into through the illusion line of spells. But currently I'm working on Mastering all the evil aligned player languages (ie, all languages for which the race has the option of becoming of evil alingment) as these are the type of people I'll be grouping with and therefore understanding them is of the greatest importance to me. <br>
<br>
Currently, I'm master in human, lizardman, Dark Evish and working on Ogre and Troll. Plus there's 10 other languages I'm feeble or better in. <br>
<br>
Anyways, hope this helps.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukentassolgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/26/01 11:11:27 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.personal.psu.edu/students/b/t/btk120/MOKONA.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Explain language training to me...</span><hr size=1> Other tricks:<br>
<br>
You get more languages as you increase in levels.<br>
<br>
To actually train languages by listening, the check is PER LINE, not PER CHARACTER.  I stress that for you modem users. =)<br>
<br>
You can learn one point for ANY language per hour per zone.  Once you get one point, that's it until you zone or a real hour passes.  (The amount of spam idiots have sent me is mind-boggling once I say I got my point)<br>
<br>
Erudites and other high-intellience races/classes can learn simply by listening (especially if the other person repeats themselves incessantly)<br>

In other words,filter out group speech while they speak there. You'll learn without overloading from the resultant barrage of gibberish.<br>
