Yeah when we entered the war on terrorism (note entered not started) even our allies were in awe of the advances we have made since they had last seen us in action.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to go into the REAL reasons why the Persian Gulf war was fought but what Heagan said was right.<br>
<br>
Go and talk to someone from the war ... their own army was defecting because they didn't want to be a part of it.  Hussein is a very sick man but then again so are a lot of leaders.<br>
<br>
Oh and as for the references to good ole Dubbya as most democrats love to call him ... go relisten to most of the Democratic party (i.e. specifically Joseph Lieberman) right after 9/11.  The guy was begging for us to take out Hussein and really I have to say I agree with him. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Beguiler of the 58th Jewel</I><BR>

<br>
Ok, a VERY quick update for those who are not actually analyzing what they are reading or have some sort of selective hearing:<br>
<br>
ANY war between the US and Iraq has NOTHING to do with its leader's morals or politics. It has NOTHING to do with Ideaology. It is 100% about economic domination of the Caspian Sea and the Middle East.<br>
<br>
THAT is why it will be another Vietnam.<br>
<br>
Open your eyes and LOOK at the friends of the Bushes, LOOK at who paid to put them in office. Oil men, Energy men, and Miners. Saddam Hussein won't play ball with them and because of that, they want him gone.<br>
<br>
The George Bushes are NOT coming at this from ANY moral high ground. If that were the case, the war would have been won the FIRST TIME. This is not unconditional war like we had against Hitler and Saddam Hussein is NOT Hitler. We slacked off because we and our allies knew that what we were doing was NOT for the right reasons and was NOT for the betterment of anyone... It was only about the Oil Profits of a VERY SMALL number of white men and arab sheiks.<br>
<br>
We stopped attacking Iraq the MOMENT that kuwait's oil fields were secure and Saudi Arabia had vowed to pick up the slack in oil production that a boycott of Iraq would entail.<br>
<br>
Once again: This is about Oil<br>
<br>
A very soon to be obsolete resource.<br>
<br>
There are LOTS of reasons to kill Saddam Hussein... our government does not espouse any of these reasons.<br>
<br>
THAT is why going to war now is wrong.<br>
<br>
If they were going after Saddam because he murdered 15 million Kurds, i'd enlist today, but I am NOT joining the Army of the Exxon States of America, nor am I accepting a position in the Enron Navy.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself the litmus test question:<br>
<br>
If relations were neutral (not even favorable) with Iraq, on whose side would the fall on the Fundamentalism Issue?<br>
<br>
Ours.<br>
<br>
WE supplied the Iraqi airforce when we first tried to end Theocracy in the middle east.<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein was our ALLY. George HW Bush's big beef with Hussein came because of Economics, not Ideaology.<br>
<br>
No offense to the Heagans and Ermoks of the world, but you really need to read the news for your OWN comprehension and not rely on the ramblings of some corporate stooge pundits for your understanding and enlightenment.<br>
<br>
As far as George W Bush not catching Osama Bin Laden... ask yourself this: Why would he want to? The threat of Osama Bin Laden is the only thing between George W Bush and a particularly nasty impeachment.<br>
<br>
Reagan would have fucking killed Hussein. He would have dressed him up in a clown suit and marched him around Baghdad.<br>
Eisenhower would have killed Hussein.<br>
All of them for the right reasons.<br>
<br>
Those men were good Republicans and good presidents.<br>
<br>
The Bushes weren't and aren't.<br>
<br>
Fuck them and fuck their war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulacus1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lacus1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/6/02 1:30:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I give it 6 pages</span><hr size=1> The VAST majority of the media would just LOVE to find ANYTHING negative about Bush, they aren't &quot;corporate stooge pundits&quot;.

If you can find REAL EVIDENCE that we're taking out Hussein for oil, you might have some grounds to talk on.  Until then, your political ideology is just making you sound like a complete and utter moron.<br>
<br>
And about bin Laden...<br>
<br>
You act like Bush could catch him if he wanted to.  Why don't you go try and tell me how far you get.  He's probably dead already.<br>

<br>
Or do you subscribe to Kantian ideology?<br>
<br>
Anyone who has looked at the Persian Gulf war will say yes it was fought over oil.<br>
<br>
But blanket anti Republicanism by the very same people who said the same things months before is quite lame.<br>
<br>
As for the war on terrorism ... I think there (well practicaly know) are other motives for it but ... it was needed.  For a long long time we have stood by and done jack shit whenever terrorists have attacked.  Our closest thing to a retaliation was for some god awful reason singing a single missile to try and kill Bin laden ... yeah right.<br>
<br>
By the way this is just what we know.  If you truly think that the public the media even the non upper ranking soldiers in the Armed Forces know 90% of what's going on you are a fool.<br>
<br>
Our government does A LOT behind our back.  Personally I vote for people I think will do the right job whether republican or democrat but you know what I don't second guess them.  If I did I would be moving to Switzerland or somewhere like that.  But seriously bitching about how bad people are accomplishes nothing  vote ... yes vote you can make a difference.<br>
<br>
Nothing worse than someone who doesn't vote yet bitches about political decisions (note Im not saying everyone out there doesn't vote just trying to encourage it since a lot of people don't).<br>
<br>
But as a final point blanket finger poiting is a lot of bullshit in our political system hell Lyndon Johnson gets the finger pointed at him for a war that was set up by *gasp everyone's favorite president who did .... um let's see not much* JFK.<br>
<br>
People ask the question about why the North with their superior factory potential and economy were kept at bay as long as they were by the South but not many people look at the fact that the previous president (a southerner) moved a huge cache of weaponry to the south prior to his leaving office.<br>
<br>
Basically the point is look at everything before you start talking out your ass about politics.  As much as I dislike most of what Bill Clinton did while he was in office when I talk to people normally I am defending him moreso than trashing him just because of unjustified accusations.<br>

He's an stupid, cruel man who tortures and murders innocent people. He got what wasn't coming to him, and he stole the White House. To<br>
hold onto it he's agreed to maintain a constant state of &quot;war&quot; despite their being a declaration of it and commit atrocities far beyond anything that has been committed on the US.<br>
<br>
He's never had to keep his word. Not only that but he funds homicide dictators in countries all over the world<br>
and suspicions abound about his foreknowledge of terrorism in the U.S. <br>
<br>
If Nixon had survived Watergate and continued as president you bet we would have being doing the same thing right now. Bush is no better than Nixon. If anything, lying and bugging the Democrats was righteous compared to what Bush has done and continues to do.<br>
<br>
What the hell are any of you doing, saying we should buy into this so-called threat to humanity? Why shouldn't Bush be forced out of office? You can and you will make him do what you tell him to do, or call in the UN to restore democracy.<br>
<br>
How dare you imply that the United States has succeeded thus far?<br>
<br>
Do you live in fear that you can be arrested and executed for terrorism without lawyer or trial? Hell yes! Your liberty is being stolen in ways you never thought possible. <br>
<br>
I can't believe the uniformed masses who claim freedom of speech isn't being jeaporadized. Those freedoms are your right, the right of everyone! People worked, sweated and died for you to have the freedom you are in danger of losing. If an illegal govenment decides this includes stomping the piss out of Saddam Hussein then STAND UP AND OPPOSE THEM!<br>
<br>
Iraq may not be better but rights are taken slowly and don't let your right to criticise, oppose injustice and question authority go first!  The front lines of the battle for freedom may be in your neighbourhood even more than in any foreign land.<br>
<br>
I'd say move to Canada but we do have problems here too. I sure as hell wouldn't mind having you here.

First ... drop the damned election bs.  People say he won People say he lost blah blah blah will go on FOREVER.  Unless people just shut the fuck up and say hey he is in office and thats the way it is.<br>
<br>
You think that he has agreed to maintain a constant state of war ... okay so he coconspired to have the World Trade Towers blown up ... yeah shut the fuck up again please.  There was no war before that happened now was there?<br>
<br>
Yeah America is fucked up we pay off other countries that do some sick shit.  Don't ask me why I can't tell you but Bush isn't the first nor will he be the last president to do so.  Go check up Clinton or any other presidents record.  Hell the American government has been paying nations that sell drugs to not produce the crop just because its been that hard to stop it from incoming ... this isn't Bush alone although he is not innocent.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of this ... okay you may find it okay to fly planes into buildings and kill people but the majority of people don't.  Mmm'kay ?  You got that?  Yes there is a threat to humanity.  It has been happening for the past 40+ years between Palestine and Israel with both sides being completely and utterly stupid about it but you know something it is spilling over now.  So yeah the world has a different reactions.  <br>
<br>
Let's see Nixon ... poor guy should have been in a mental hospital for being constantly afraid.  But he broke the law and he lost his job for it and his name is forever marred ... more than what most criminals pay for crimes much worse than ... *gasp* spying on election plans.<br>
<br>
As for the US being successful?  I think there has been progress am I still afraid that something will happen .. well yes I always will be until people start being rational.<br>
<br>
Am I afraid that I am going to get arrested and executed ... nah not unless I go and start fighting on the side of the enemy outside of the United States ... sorry your nice little comparison to Johnny Walker doesn't pan out so once again please shut the fuck up.  Get real wake up and realize that ... you should shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
As for Iraq no I don't think we should be over there ... but as demeaning as the peace agreement was if he crosses the line we slap his ass back down ... a lax enforcement is not an enforcement.<br>

Too bad Sliver won't post his good old American soldier asking if you want a cup of shut the fuck up because it does fit.  Quit talking out your ass. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Beguiler of the 58th Jewel</I><BR>

Two:  Why go after Iraq?  Because we can.  Afganistan didn't work, we didn't get our man, and we need a big high profile success, so get Hussain.  Is he a great guy?  Of course not.  He's not the worst either.  But he's sitting on Oil, the American people see him as an enemy, and he's someone we can kill.  PR move, quite frankly, with a touch of oil control, not bad.  Actually seems pretty stupid to me, how many world wars started there?  But c'est la vie.<br>
<br>
Three:  Yes, Bush lost the election.  No we can't do anything about it.  But he's still a terrible president (How many vacations has the man taken while we're at war?).  He does however have a lot of intelligent people working with him, wether you agree with his politics or not.    <br>
<br>
And Four:  War is always about power.  If it were for humanitarian reasons, we wouldn't be killing people.  But remember this always... just because we're fighting against an evil, doesn't mean we're good guys.  I mean heck, the Afganistani Warlords who opposed the Taliban and thus were our friends aren't good people, they had women being raped in the streets.  Both sides are evil.  In war, in the end, it's all power struggles.<br>
