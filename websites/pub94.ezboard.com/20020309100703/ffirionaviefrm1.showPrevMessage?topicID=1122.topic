I saw. I chatted with several capable role players in my first full weekend since I returned to EQ. Grouped with a few players, not one showed himself or herself to be a l33t d00d phat lewt type. Have been impressed so far with the level of RP effort on the server. <br><br>Other than the fact that I raised myself to level 5 in one weekend (not hard to do for someone with past EQ experience)... I started really doing some character development for my necromancer Moandor. Basically, Moandor is an ass. He is discordant evil, selfish and conceited. He is of the &quot;bow down to me you worms&quot; variety. He is a necro by profession, a loner by definition. And he knows he will rarely make friends. But this is really how I want him to role play, as a pompous arrogant jerk. Playing on FV is part of the challenge. Playing an evil character is even more of a challenge. Role playing an evil worm (and sticking with it despite the fact that I will prolly never get a smile or a hug from the likes of sexy wood elf hotties) is the biggest challenge of all. <br><br>I draw the line between gameplay and roleplay. When I'm playing in a group, Moandor's huge ego has to take a back seat to make sure that fellow players are not endangered. And yes, he has even died trying to save the rest of the party.... as in &quot;Everyone run to zone!!! Let the kodiak chase me, I'm already dead, just run!!!&quot; <br><br>But during socializing hour, when there is no combat going on, I play him to the hilt. I just had a great time bickering with a great role playing Ogre, letting him know that he's just a big smelly intruder to Neriak. Of course, he thought that I was just a pompous deluded necromancer loner who will one day come back begging for Ogre friends like him. Hah!!  There was a lot of glaring and snarling and snickering between our characters. What puzzed me is that his tiny pea brain allowed him to speak the superior Teir'Dal language so fluently. Oh well.... <br><br>So far I like it here in FV server. I did notice (as mentioned already) that everyone really is genuinely poor or broke and cash strapped in the server... and finding money is really a struggle, especially for starting characters like mine. Every freakin silver or copper counts. I almost starved to death during level 4, because I bought my spells, but had no coppers left for muffins! I literally had to kill some Nektulos wolves just to get some meat and feed myself. Talk about challenging! LOL <br><br>So if you happen to run into an arrogant sneering elitist DE necromancer named Moandor in the server... don't sweat it. I'm just role playing. Simply sacrifice your first born to me and it's all good. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 9:04:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm not a jerk, I just play one in FV</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Sarhea looks at this &quot;Moandor&quot;, blandly.  </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br><br>&quot;friendly sort, huh?

What I've discovered thus far is that RPing tends to feed on itself. AKA I will meet someone who doesn't initally emphasize RP in their playing, however as soon as I start spouting my '...duty to Tunare and my love Dyshira...' routine and other various colorful (but useless from a XPing/uber standpoint) dialog, they can't help but respond in kind.<br><br>In other words, YOU (yes you!) can make Firiona Vie great! Just keep on trying.. There is more than one way to enjoy the game, and everyone has their style, so lets mix it up and see what happens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukentassolgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eats Halflings</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 9:46:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.personal.psu.edu/students/b/t/btk120/MOKONA.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> One catch:</span><hr size=1> Just never insult my cooking and we'll get along fine. <p>--Antoin Nolouj &lt;League of Shadows&gt;<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udaeja.showPublicProfile?language=EN>daeja</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://liquid2k.com/daeja/gem2_839.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 10:03:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One catch:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;What puzzed me is that his tiny pea brain allowed him to speak the superior Teir'Dal language so fluently.

He's a terrible incurable racist; anyone who isn't Iksar is a &quot;softskin THING&quot; not worthy of licking the mud off his boots. Our whole guild is actually based on that Iksar-above-all concept.

But if I compromised my character's IC views for the sake of accomodating other players, it'd make FV that much less of a roleplaying server for me. The best I can do is not actively hunt them down and try to force a confrontation/duel (which is what my character would oftentimes LIKE to do, damn softskins have no business on Kunark <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), on the excuse that, &quot;Well, as long as it's not getting in my way or shooting its mouth off, there's no point in bothering with it.

All kinds of anti-social behaviour ensues.  That doesn't sound like you in the least, the very fact that you are drawing a distincition proves that, but I thought I would point it out.  It is the reason for the following advice.<br><br>Advice: With new people, when you are going to RP, send them a private tell explaining you are RPing.  I know, it really should not be necessary on an RP server, but them are the breaks.  Fortunately, you don't have to do it all the time with your regular friends.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Assuming a twisted little gnomish necro with delusions of adequecy ever makes friends....<br><br>Thanks lots for being one of those people willing to both RP and make concessions to grouping dynamics.

I normally try to 'feel out' other RPers first before I continue.  Normally if you can distinguish players who ARE willing to role play along, it's usually a given that they realize you are simply RPing an evil character, as opposed to acting like a player who is a bona fide jerk. <br><br>Although my character is elitist in nature, not to mention that Discordant Evil necromancers tend to be an insular type of people.... IMHO it's not so limiting being a Dark Elf, as we do have many perceived allies whom we tolerate (if not admire). <br><br>It does seem far more difficult to do this with an evil RPing Iksar.... the Iksars have it hard, because they are called on to roleplay insular xenophobes who mistrust almost anyone with soft skin.... which is more than 90% of the population of EQ servers. I can see how this makes things more difficult for them in terms of game play. I sympathize with the Iksar RPers here, I know they really have it tough. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 5:23:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm not a jerk, I just play one in FV</span><hr size=1> Hmm, the point about Neutrals raises an interesting little idea that's been in the back of my mind for a while now.<br><br>Entirely ooc, I am Lawful Neutral as an enchanter and I think I pull that off reasonably well, even without the &quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot;.  I've never been too impressed with my own racial history as a High Elf and I would have no problem, in theory, with joining and getting to know some Tier'dal.  Might even lead me into relationships with some of the other dark races.  But I don't speak Tier'dal really well (damn, keep meaning to work on that) and it's just never happened.  Starspun is a fairly good-oriented guild (with acknowledgement to Syll, our resident bad girl) and that's probably part of the reason why also.  But this is a character direction I'd be interested in exploring eventually.<br><br>So, if there are any evil types out there with a decent command of Human, Elvish, or (unlikely) Dwarvish, feel free to get in touch with me.  I'm currently season 27 and closing on clarity.  Soon, very soon.

Soon after I started my schooling my brother, unknown to me, hopped on the boat to Antonica and was reportedly captured by the Tier'Dal, presumably to be sold into slavery. The guilt I feel at letting him fall into their foul clutches is unbearable. It has become my life's work to find and rescue him. <br><br>I headed to Antonica before my early training was complete(level 5) to look for him. I spent a lot of time prowling through in dark elf form through the dank, dark streets of Neriak, searching for clues to his whereabouts. When my search turned up nothing, I turned my frustrations on the dark elf guards, killing them over and over near the entrance to Lavastorm. The Neriak citizens now hate me on site, regardless of my disguise, so I doubt I'll ever enter that horrible city again. <br><br>My training has continued at a slow pace, mostly because I am constantly wandering, hoping to hear word of my brother. I'm now in my 23rd season and still have heard nothing of Sekali, though I have donned the dark elf disguise many times and joined their ranks for adventuring and to learn their snarling, gutteral language. There have been many awkward moments after my disguise has faded while grouping with their kind, but no matter. I remain steadfast in my quest, and will continue to hunt for word of him.<br><br>If you see a high elf lad, with white hair and dark eyes, who answers to the name of Sekali, give him my love, and tell him I am coming for him...<br><br>Halus <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 235<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 10:18:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm not a jerk, I just play one in FV</span><hr size=1> ((No, I'm the fool.
