I whistled a merry tune to myself, scurrying about on nimble elven feet.  I came upon a wretched orc and I lunged at him, sabre in hand, crying &quot;At thee, Sir Orc!&quot;  And I proceeded to attack him since, well, he is an orc.  And then this prissy pale high elf comes out of nowhere and starts throwing a fit because I stole her mob.<br><br>*break character*<br><br>Hello, kiddies.  There are a million godzillion people playing on this server right now!  The other night, there were over 300 people in Greater Faydark alone.  Obviously, a zone with that many trees and critters wasn't created to handle 300 people without spitzing out.  Which is why there is so much ghosting, LDing, random lag spikes... You can see a mob that seems to be sitting there all by itself, run up to it, and then have it poof in the opposite direction!  <br><br>Plus, there are 300 little elves with sticks trying to attack a limited number of bats and bees.  Two people are BOUND to hit the same mob at the same time... but that isn't what this is about, really.<br><br>This is about you CRYBABIES calling &quot;wolf&quot; everytime you press your auto attack button!  &quot;She KSed me!&quot;  &quot;Stop KSing me!&quot;  &quot;You KSed me!&quot;  &quot;Everyone here is a KSer!&quot;  &quot;How many KSers are on this server?&quot;  WE'RE ALL KSers, deal with it, freaks.  Not only is this server primarily for roleplay, no one is seriously going out of their way to hunt you down and steal your pulls.<br><br>For those crybabies out there who are looking to reform your whining ways:  try sending a TELL to the person and asking (IN A GENTLE MANNER) why they took your pull.  They will usually apologize and offer an explanation.  Unless they are crybabies like you... then they will accuse YOU of accusing them of KSing, how dare you!<br><br>So, please, quitcherbitchin'!<br><br>*in character*<br><br>She seemed rather rude so I just plugged my ears, whistled, and walked on.  I'm going to write a song now, about people like this.

If you were in a battle with some evil creature in reality and someone came up and assisted you in killing it you would be overjoyed.  Sadly, roleplaying is just a platform for some people to act like those that treated them so poorly in other situations.  It is good to see that now roleplayers have their own server they can be abusive and childish just as the &quot;d00ds&quot; they once complained about.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujantisconstanceeorle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jantis ConstanceEorle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/01 12:04:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.warghoul.com/images/CoSS/jantis_head_ez.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: KSing?</span><hr size=1> I agree with the first post, although I think instead of sending a tell, people just need to give a two month grace period just to get over it.  Tells are not necessary... just accept you lost the kill and go on.  Now, if someone is harrassing you... and it's bound to happen... where they repeatedly come up to creatures you are fighting and steal them, then I would encourage you to petition them.  You can only test that by moving elsewhere and if they follow you to several spots it would be considered harrassment.  Otherwise, suck it up and go look for another creature.<br><br>I completely disagree with the second post.  Verant has impletmented this game in such a way that you have to do a degree of hunting to get money and gain levels.  Roleplaying is 100% seperate from playing the game, and if they didn't want to share in the experiences of the gain (ie, gaining levels, getting items, etc), they would just go play a MUD.  Don't use their desire and/or frustration to gain experience as a hypocricy against roleplaying or a justification for someone else to kill steal.  Unless you are grouped in EverQuest, only one person gets credit for the kill.  <br><br>What bothers me are the numbers of people that try to justify kill stealing under the guise that they are roleplaying and 'fighting the hordes'... whether the first person was already engaging the mob or not.  This is a HUGE problem with the design of EverQuest, but it exists whether we like it or not.  If someone wants to fight the hordes then I suggest they get in a group with the other heros to compensate for the game's shortcomings.  Otherwise, they will find themselves talking to a guide and getting flagged for harrassment.  They can't turn a blind eye to the game's shortcoming to justify that they are just roleplaying.  Kill stealing does exist, even on a roleplaying server, because EverQuest allows it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujennamayfair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jenna Mayfair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/01 3:28:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: KSing?</span><hr size=1> Hmm...If I am running for a kill, as I did so many times today, and someone hits it right before I do, and cast a spell on it from afar, I do turn and go to something else because I hadn't hot the creature yet and it wasn't mine, no matter how frusterating that can get when it happens a lot.  Now if I have just attacked something and someone else attacks, I will watch them.  Perhaps they attacked it first and I did not see it?  If the do not move away, I go and find something else.  Now, if I am fighting something, and have been doing so long enough that the creature has about half its life and then someone comes up and attacks it, I do send a tell.  I do not harass, I just simply ask &quot;Why did you attack the bear I was fighting?&quot;  Usually they reply and apologize, and sometimes offer the loot, which I never accept.  I say it's ok if they apologize.  If they do not reply I just shrug it off.  Only once did I get a reply that I shouldn't whine and that they will kill whatever they want, no matter if it was engaged or not.  This was in the Neriak newbie area and that person was reported since they admitted to KSing.<br><br>Also, if I found that I have attacked something that was already being fought, I send a tell with my apologies and run off to find other kill.

Norrath is already crowded enough, we don't need huge buttheaded egos getting in our way!  That makes me angry (rar). <br><br>Another curious point about alleged &quot;KSing&quot; is that often times, the person in question is a dwarf or a gnome.  Now, this is very difficult because the issue can not be resolved.  I don't know whether they accidentaly engaged my mob or, I hope this is NEVER the case, they attacked my mob and squished it simply because they couldn't understand me if I yelled at them!  <br><br>Whenever you start a newbie server, KSing is bound to occur.  But I have never seen so many whiners.  Do these people want attention or sympathy?  Because all they are ignoring is a giant spot on my ignore list!<br><br>Oh, and WHILE I'm ranting... I just want to step on my soapbox and shout my head off at the RolePlay Nazis.  If you will note, the tag next to Firiona Vie says &quot;Roleplaying Preferred&quot;.  So you enter GFay, and Xxxxxx auctions, 'OOC - Who here is from Tunare?'.  It's an innocent question; they were merely trying to find familiar companions to hook up with.
