Long.</span><hr size=1> When I first learned that the Role-play Server was going to become a reality, I was overjoyed.  Here at last I would be able to find other role-players easily and role-playing would be the norm, as opposed to the exception.  The rules set appeared to be carefully crafted to dissuade the average “achiever” type player as well, and hopefully the ones who did come would be of the normal, pleasant variety of person as opposed to the aggressive sort with whom I had met with unfortunate results a time or two in the past.<br>
<br>
So, I went about my business, crafting three separate characters, pondering which would be the most fun to play on a role-play server, while at the same time, looking for the seeds of the server community.  And so I found myself stumbling across Jaxy’s post in another forum and was led here.  I pitched in and did my bit, I thought, to help the board.  I greeted people who had been here for the days before I arrived and welcomed those who came after me.  Then something awful happened.  The people began to talk about the enemy more and more and began to discuss the methods that should be used to fight them.  I find this disturbing, because I don’t want to have enemies.  At least not the kind that have set their sights on me as a player and not as a character in a game.  Well, this talk has grown to the point where I can’t bear it any longer.  <br>
<br>
I’ve played on Sullon Zek for awhile now and been a frequent poster over at the Sullon Zek Tavern.  I love message boards and communicating with other people from around the world, all with the tapping of a few keys and the click of a button.  The SZT is a good old-fashioned flame board.  People pretty much just rip into each other at the slightest provocation. It gets dirty and personal, just as the play on the server does.  There are no rules, there is no decency and there is most certainly no respect for anyone with differing ideas.  There, I participate according to local custom.  I had hoped that this board would be different.  Unfortunately, and much to my dismay, I’ve encountered a type of “rule-player” which I had hoped would remain on the other servers. Foolish, I know to hope that this server would not attract the zealots and fanatics, but I had high hopes and pardoned myself of my naivete, even as I realized I was doing it, because it felt good to have hope again. It felt good to believe that soon other “nice” people would surround me.  Back “home”, the role-playing guilds were torn apart by aggressive, self motivated individuals who ended up destroying everything that had been built because they never really learned how to “play nice” with others.  They never learned to share.  They felt that the role-playing world needed to center on their goals, their needs, their rules and their “vision” of what “true” role-playing was.  They would set themselves upon some sort of mission to spread the word of their character’s deeds or whatnot, but when it came time to step out of the limelight, they couldn’t bring themselves to give up their fix. They couldn’t bear the thought that someone might have other ideas or other goals, or god forbid, might have a different play-style.  They were petty and selfish and for the life of me, I couldn’t understand why.  I mean, they were role-players. Doesn’t that sort of imply a certain respect for other people?  Ahh. No, it most certainly does not, as I have come to know, much to my chagrin.  <br>
<br>
This discovery began when one day I found myself on Sullon Zek and as I participated in the goings on there, it finally clicked for me.  The people back on my old server, who were “RP at all cost” and were so aggressive, were doods!  Yes, they were roleplaying doods!  Now I’m sure some will scoff at this and say “not me, no way, I’m just fighting for what is right!” Well, perhaps you are.  However, I disagree that “winning” at the cost of our decency as players is worth the price.  Most role-players have always known that they are cut from a different cloth than other players.  In most circumstances, this includes a higher tolerance for others and a willingness to behave and play nice.  That is how I feel about myself at least and it’s how I see most of the people who have decided to move to FV.  <br>
<br>
I’ve seen several threats on this board directed at those who are not role-players, yet want to be a part of the Firiona Vie community.  These threats involve things like verbal harassment, blacklisting, killstealing and, the most cowardly and vile, using bogus /petitions citing the Play Nice Policy at random to drive other players off their camps, even if the person doesn’t want the camp to begin with.  Simply petitioning against any non role-player they see and then lying to the guide and saying “This evil non role-player won’t share this camp with me”.  I’m certain as soon as the guide leaves the person will go on their way thinking they’ve done God’s work against the vile dOOds.<br>
<br>
This I will not abide, nor will I be party to it. It is the type of petty childish behavior that I am coming to Firiona Vie to escape.  I can’t express how disappointed it makes me to see my fellow “role-players” set themselves on such a mean spirited mission as this. <br>
<br>
So, it is with regrets that I’m going to be taking a break from this board.  I don’t want this meta game nonsense to further dampen my spirits and I won’t allow my role playing brothers to infect me any further with negativity, hate or resentment.  It’s difficult enough to get through the gaming world without feeling those emotions.  It certainly doesn’t help to surround yourself with a pack of screeching harpies who cry out “OPPRESSION! DOODS MUST DIE! PURITY!”  So, I am opting out until the server goes live and establishes itself.  I can assure you that Firiona Vie can be a wonderful place for Roleplay, even with the inclusion of some players who come for the rules set, or whatever.  <br>
<br>
I choose to see the positive for the next few weeks.  I will do this by walking in wide-eyed wonder through Norrath, interacting and playing with a whole new batch of new friends.  Some of the people on this board I was really impressed with and was looking forward to meeting them in game.  I still hope to do so.  I’ll be back eventually and perhaps by then our board will have calmed down and people will see that there is no devil right around the corner.  Just another nice person that is slightly different than the face that greets you in the mirror. <br>
<br>
For those of you with the patience to read this whole thing, you have my thanks and apologies for the length.  A post like this over at SZT would receive some fairly predictable responses. For those here who might as well be at SZT, then please, be my guest to flame me to high heaven.  <br>

I myself have stopped putting comments in the &quot;powergamers vs roleplayers&quot; threads, and have removed myself from the argument. I personally see no reason to involve myself in what is a pointless debate, as it will only bring me down, as it clearly has a lot of other people. But I'd just like to make this one point, because its very close to my personal own philosophy.<br>
<br>
Intolerance, ignorance and arrogance are the three grest destroyers of human achievement and life. Throughout history tales can be found of great injustices done because people thought they had more right to something than other people, because they could/would not understand others, and because they thought they were better than other people. Wars have been thought over land, which if shared, could have fed and housed everyone, but instead ended up being destroyed. Man has killed man, when, if they had taken the time to listen and understand each other they could have been great friends. Great evil has been wrought under the rule of those who dared to think they knew what was best.<br>
<br>
This is not an insult, just a warning.<br>
If people heeded it a little more, we would live in a world where violence, suffering and injustice were much less common.<br>

 - I hate to tell you this Bludge, but if some people chose to not interact with people that outright refuse to RP, they are perfectly within their right. Those people come knowing its an RP server and outright state their goals and aims are the stereotypical blue servers that people are coming here to get away from.<br>
<br>
As to some of these alleged threads, thats all they are...allegations at best. Like I told LazyDog when he said the same thing. Its a shame you feel threatened, especially since I play according to the rules. Imagine how you would feel if I actually did threaten.<br>
<br>

I have always considered Role-Players more tolerant and generally better people in game myself.  It's why I would never join anything but a Role-Playing guild on other servers, and I never Role-Played in my life before EQ, much less knew how to do it.  I do agree, and feel that everything will calm down after a while.  I do not think all the non-roleplayers will leave, or that all the anti-non roleplayers will leave either, but that those who protest so loud at the moment will realize that their harsh and unkind words do nothing but perhaps make themselves look ill.<br>

If you look at those posts again, though, in more detail you might be surprised at the number of rational, reasonable comments there are peppered amongst the vitriol.  Indeed there are whole threads popping up, including this one, wishing to see an end to the hostility.<br>
<br>
The FV server provides a unique opportunity for those of us who wish to roleplay to do so with like-minded individuals.  I shall be there - though I might skip on the first few weeks to let it all settle down a bit - and I think that, in time, FV will provide a unique RP experience and community.<br>
<br>
Yes, there are power-gaming dudes, and yes, there are witch-hunting RP crusaders, but in this, as in much of life, most people are somewhere in between.<br>

<br>
Like others who have posted to this thread, I think the 'rolplaying leet' (hahaha i am sure that phrase is sure to bother someone) are actaully a minority who are very vocal.<br>
<br>
I want to roleplay.  Just as i dont want my experience ruined by someone shouting d00d speak, i dont want my experience ruined by people telling me that I am roleplaying the wrong way because I dont type something the way they want to see it.<br>
<br>
If I dont like how people act here, I will avoid them.  Not blacklist, train, or anything to make their life miserable.  I assume that very few people who want to make a life here are going to try to actively disrupt others. Anyone trying to disrupt others in any form should be petitioned. Powergaming and Roleplaying are not opposites and I hope people from both sides realize that both can be done quite easily, especially in a game where levelling isnt much of a challenge after 2+ years.<br>
<br>
In any case, I will look and hang out with the people who have a similar outlook as me. I have been waiting for a place like this to roleplay for two years and so far this community seems great (and the server isnt even really up yet!). Its a big world out there with a lot of potential.  I look forward to meeting good people and also look forward to meeting RP styles that may differ from mine.  <br>
<br>
Treat each other like decent human beings and respect the ways others may play the game and hopefully, they will respect the way you want to play the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udeffhead01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deffhead01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/01 11:01:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> Personally, I think you are totally overreacting.

But so far I haven't seen any evidence of the type of things your citing. As one of the players directly referenced, tho not by name, I can assure you, it's a complete misinterpretation. But why let reality get in the way of a good straw man.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see anyone here who wants anything more than three things:<br>
<br>
1) No IDIOT names. No &quot;Milken Cookees&quot; etc.<br>
<br>
2) No OOC stuff like sports scores, lyrics to &quot;And then I got High&quot; etc. in public channels -- your /group /guild is your own business.<br>
<br>
3) For people who self identify as non-roleplayers to consider the fact that we only have this one server and that perhaps it would be more appropriate for them to be on one of the 97% of servers that aren't set aside for roleplaying.<br>
<br>
Are these really extremist views for a roleplaying server? <p>Numtini Lightheart <br>

Yeah, some very rude things have been said and suggested as normal behavior on FV, but the server isn't live, many of the suggestions are bannable, and the people suggesting them are in the minority even here.  Make a character and have some fun.  Pick a character that feels free to mock those who use the word 'thou' in normal conversation.  Meet some new friends.  Mutter a lot.  Stand at the gates of freeport and preach the coming of the cheese lord.  In short, do your own thing and ignore those who think thier way is the only way for whatever reason.<br>

<br>
Roleplaying, like anything else, is going to be something that we all have widely varying opinions on.  I plan to be tolerant of how other people roleplay.  Not all of us are going to have the same opiniions on how classes and characters should be played.  If someone wants to play a barbarian warrior as a Conan type instead of having the traditional Scottish accent, who am I to say that he is wrong?<br>
<br>
Some people, if they encountered someone standing at the gates of Freeport preaching the coming of the cheese lord, would complain that the person is not roleplaying their character correctly.  But I think that will be a small minority.  Myself, I'm buying the guy some cheese and preparing to maybe hear a wondrous story. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Like Lazydog said, your always welcome on our boards. <br>
Bludge is a reasonable,cool person. People like Veneros don't get it, Veneros thought bludge was quote &quot;Kissing arse&quot;. He said exactly that in our small chat session. Bludge has no intention of joining our guild, he was simply being fair and kind, Bludge is a roleplayer (and a damned good one i would bet). <br>
I've said it more then once on our guild boards, like in real life, the loudest people are the most annoying.<br>
