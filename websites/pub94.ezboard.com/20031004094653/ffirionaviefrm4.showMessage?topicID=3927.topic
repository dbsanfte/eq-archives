Now I know that most of you are not Australians and given that I’m using my handy mini Australian dictionary, your dictionary may possibly contain something entirely different, such as:<br>
<br>
Idea <br>
<br>
1.  Any product of mental activity sanctioned by TTP**<br>
2.  A scheme, intention, or plan that’s not very much different then conventional and approved thinking<br>
3.  The thought of something not too outrageous or controversial<br>
4.  A belief or opinion that’s not different then ours**<br>
5.  A vague notion<br>
6.  A persons approved* conception of something<br>
7.  Aim or purpose that won't interfere with or supercede ours**<br>
8.  Approved* Philosophy <br>

<br>
If this is true then I apologize.  However, having visited the United States of American and several other &quot;forward thinking&quot; countries and having at my fingertips one of the greatest sources of information ever compiled and disseminated by humankind in its entire history on this planet, I am unconvinced.  I cannot find a single reference to this marvel of literary science hereafter referred to as Dictionary X. Does it exist? <br>
<br>
Surely it must given that recently its adoption by the FV board moderators and the acceptance by the FV community of that adoption has resulted in the locking down and restriction of free thought.  How many threads locked this week? 5? 6?<br>
<br>
Why were they locked?  I propose that they were locked because<br>
<br>
a) The topic of discussion was controversial and was painful to the lockers because it required them to mind-move outside their usual comfort zones and perhaps acknowledge that deep inside, padded and restrained by TTP red-tape, was a real, unique, individual but unpleasant (at least to the TTP) thought.<br>
<br>
b) laziness - it takes time and patience to mod properly and having a fast moving controversial thread cuts down on &quot;fun stuff&quot; time.<br>
<br>
Well in response to that, I say, Try having a unique thought, analyse it, refine it, catalogue it, throw it away or adopt it.  <br>
<br>
Don't live your life absorbing shrink-wrapped processed 30 year old ideas. Otherwise your not living your own life, your living somebody else’s.  Use your brain, take an idea and rip it apart and see if its really something to adopt.  If not then formulate your own idea.  It may not make you popular and might very well make you unpopular but at least you'll be you.  <br>
<br>
Most of all, don't use your shrink-wrapped processed 30 year old idea to squash my analysed, refined, new unique idea that I just formulated this morning or yesterday or last year.  Especially if you’re a moderator.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if you feel its easier to just lock a topic then deal with it because you want more time for yourself, then you shouldn't be a moderator.  Moderate properly or not at all.<br>
<br>
To sum it all up, better a honest racist, honest sexist, or honest homophobe then a dishonest conformist.<br>

b) The original posters asked if the threads could be locked (among others)<br>

Of the 6 topics locked recently:<br>
<br>
* 2 were locked and are currently in the soapbox.  None of which contain ANY personal attacks or conflict. Challenging conformist idea's.<br>
<br>
* 1 was locked, containing namecalling, conflict, personal attacks.  Should have been locked or deleted before it got past 10 pages.  Contains extreme language, personal attacks, sexually explicit suggestions beginning with the first post.  Still in Soapbox.  Not challenging conformist idea's.<br>

* 1 was locked, minor personal attacks, minor profanity, below accepted levels of the soapbox.  3 requests from persons to have it locked on the last page due to its boring nature.  Challenging conformist idea's.<br>
<br>
So Irexes, we have 6 posts.  One is extreme but doesn't contain taboo topics (homosexuality, racism, feminism etc) and is allowed to go to 13+ pages.<br>
<br>
The other 5 range from minor to medium in offensive nature, contain taboo topics and are locked almost as soon as they are created.  The reason there are 5 is because people were not finished discussing the topic when each was locked and felt compelled to create new threads.  There was interest in the topic and information to be presented, discussed and debated over but that wasn't allowed to occur.  Wouldn't you call that a violation of the freedom of speech?.<br>
<br>
As for my being able to say what I have, out of the 3 responses, 2 were aggressive or disapproving and one was ? <br>

Good way to put it Jae, but being I've had a battle of wit(less) with this person before, I will be the first to say, the only thing this person sees is that they are right, and all others are wrong.  I find it quite amusing that you can think so high of yourself that you could never possibly be wrong... but thats another story for another time...<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the mods are doing a great job, and making sure that the board doesn't run-amuk.  They have to live within the confines of the rules set before them, and I believe they do that better than some of the mods we had in the past.  Its just like being a GM in a video game, you have rules you must follow and make sure that they are enforced, if not, you would have total anarchy.<br>
<br>
So, before you start trying to point out the flaws in others, remember, when you point a finger, 3 more point right back at you...<br>
<br>
They give freely of their time to make sure the board rules are enforced and that all who come here can come to an enviornment that is in a controlled state and is not a lawless society of bullshit and inappropriate behavior...<br>
<br>
Hats off to ya mods, keep it up...<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;">3 of which were about Giovanni's Sig and were moved to soapbox.<br>
2 of which were about Giovanni's Sig and slid down off the front page.<br>
1 of which I couldn't find on the first three pages of the soapbox (Going back to the 12th)<br>
<br>
So we have 5 threads locked about Giovanni's Sig, and one that was mysteriously difficult to find, presumably about Giovanni's sig. Or possibly was about the rules of the soapbox and is stickied, which may have confused Ikonoclastia. <br>
<br>
Rather than look at the real issue they were locked, Ikonoclastia just decided to start a thread about excessive thread locking and the new communist moderation regime. Indeed. One of the big reasons the threads get locked is that they turn into nasty amounts of mudslinging and namecalling. But <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> can't see that. Who could possibly believe the words of one, who doesn't even play on this server anymore, could even be valid in the new shaping of the forum?<br>

Hell. I also believe that Ikonoclastia didn't even read any other threads in the soapbox, other than the ones that were locked. The little lock symbox often attracts people to threads, curious about their contents and what was so juicy that caused them to be locked.  <br>

The issue is not homosexual related at all, the issue is that its terribly offensive.  The homosexual element is being exploited by the owner as a defense to prevent his pic being banned.  After the decades of being spammed by pro-homosexual propaganda, most of use are too afraid to think for ourselves and instead rely on our conditioning and Giovanni is relying on that too.

By unique, I mean a thought thats not given to you to adopt but rather one which you decide to adopt because you personally agree with it.  An example would be &quot;all terrorists are evil&quot; which is a generally accepted idea not of our own making but rather of the governments.  If the U.S government was deposed today and they decided to challenge the newly installed U.S government they would be labeled terrorists due to the fact they would have to use small harrassing tactics rather then attrition.  Would that automatically make them evil.  So the understanding that all terrorists are not necessarily evil would make you somewhat unique.<br>

You said that being a false conservative was worse than being an honest rascist , my statement that hithler was an honest rascist is to show you how you're statement was inoorrect because I do not seriously think you can find one person who thinks Hitler was better than a lying conservative.  Honest rascist he was, honest person he wasn't , but that's not what I was talking about was it.  Stop using inane counter points that have no bearing on the arguement at hand.<br>
<br>
All you do is spout out randomly, you have no focus, and are 99% incorrect.  Hitler was honest about his rascism , the german public of the period needed a scapegoat badly , the jewish people ended up the target , Hitler was loudly anti-semetic, even before ellection.<br>

See! what a load of bullshit, my posts are never intelligent.  And I am not CONSTRUCTIVELY critical , because I believe your entire point to be a lost cause , inherantly wrong pertaining to the situation, and I do not believe they can be constructed into a pile of dog shit much less a point.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>By unique, I mean a thought thats not given to you to adopt but rather one which you decide to adopt because you personally agree with it. An example would be &quot;all terrorists are evil&quot; which is a generally accepted idea not of our own making but rather of the governments. If the U.S government was deposed today and they decided to challenge the newly installed U.S government they would be labeled terrorists due to the fact they would have to use small harrassing tactics rather then attrition. Would that automatically make them evil. So the understanding that all terrorists are not necessarily evil would make you somewhat unique.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Newsflash...You are one of many, you may agree with something , so do others, therefor ceasing the uniqueness.  Because it becomes a collective idea.  Terrorists by definition spread terror, I'd call that evil.  You mean rebels, and or freedom fighters, Totally different thing Ikon.  Get your points right before you use them.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes you did K. Why do you think they were all the same topic over and over again. Because people wanted to talk about them. Wouldn't that be the opposite of dead horse?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's a dead horse topic, irregardless of the fact people wish to talk about them , nothing new can be added, there will be no solution they degrade and degrade to the point of having to lock them anyways, locking dead horse topics is a pre-emptive tactic.  By the way, all those threads were open at the same time almost, just spin off posts.  Please get your points correct before using them.<br>

<br>
Pro? I am sure you mean anti.  Because pro-homosexual ad campaigns are not decades old, nor until recently were people &quot;spammed&quot; with them.  Yet again, please correct your information and points before using them.<br>

That may be the only thing you've said in the last 48 hours that made any sense whatsoever.  Congratulations.<br>
