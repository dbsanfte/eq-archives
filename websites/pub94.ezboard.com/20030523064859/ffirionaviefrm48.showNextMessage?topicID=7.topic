Sadly, he died in Rivervale after a long journey with some friends. His dear friend Caillou locked away his gear for his children. However, that was not the end of the story. Dinar returned some time later in the body of a Barbarian Warrior. His friends were delighted! They raided Blackburrow. They raided The Warrens. They raided Crushbone. Good times were had by all. <br>
<br>
Then he died. Again.<br>
<br>
This is where the story gets interesting. It seems the gods have a private joke they are playing on him. Constantly putting him in new bodies. He was reincarnated as a Human Paladin of Rodcet Nife working deep cover infiltrating the Bloodsabres. He was discovered and executed. He had several more incarnations after that. Wood Elf Ranger. Half Elf Druid. Iksar SK. Troll Warrior. DE Mage. Gnome Paladin. Halfling Rogue. Ogre Shaman. Sometimes he was male, sometimes female. It was madness and he just wanted it to end!<br>
<br>
In what was to be his final incarnation as a Human Paladin of Karana, he came across a young Vah Shir Beastlord dying just inside the mouth of the Paludal Caverns. The young cat-man had been grievously injured by the fiends that lived deep inside. Dinar, now known as Rugar, did what he could for this poor being, but his healing skill wasn't enough. He prayed for two days and three nights for the strength to heal Lotan. He even offered up his soul to save his young charge. The goodly gods were touched by this gesture and took pity on this poor mortal soul they had toyed with. Several of these gods came to him in a vision offering a deal. If he was serious about offering his soul, then they would help. He assured them he was very serious.<br>
<br>
&quot;My soul has been used as a toy for so many years, I came to expect that I would never know peace. Now that I have finally found it, I realize what I should have long ago. It is all for nothing if I allow this poor man to die. I will have failed my own tests.&quot;<br>
<br>
A silent look passed among the gods and a decision was made.<br>
<br>
&quot;WE CANNOT SAVE HIS SOUL, IT HAS BEEN CORRUPTED BY THE PLAGUES OF BERTOXXOLOUS. BUT WE CAN SAVE HIS BODY. WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO TAKE CONTROL OF IT AND KNOW PEACE UNTIL YOUR DEATH.&quot;<br>
<br>
This wasn't quite what Dinar had expected, but it was better than nothing. He could have the gods out of his life for good, and live like he had never been able to before. As the gods had said, Lotan's soul was beyond saving. Why should he pass up this opportunity?<br>
<br>
He finally agreed and their souls were switched. He looked at his former body as it lay on the ground in front of him. Turning a sickly yellow color as the sould consuming parasites of the Creeping Crud slowly took control and devoured it. He looked at his new body. It's pristine white fur and black stripes reminded him that life was beautiful and worth living. He smiled a thanks to the gods for their mercy and turned for home. His new home, Shar Vahl.<br>
<br>
Thus, Dinar the Dwarven Warrior evolved to become Lotan, the Vah Shir Beastlord. <p>[UWS]Carnage-=TPF=-<br>
