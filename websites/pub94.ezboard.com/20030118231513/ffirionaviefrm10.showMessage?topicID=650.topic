His long, straight, black hair covered his face as he put his armored hands together to pray. &quot;I am of the most high, evil. For it is within the darkness OF me... I shall find my strength. There is no love. Love is the lie that passes the lips of those who want, but know not what they truly want. There is no true &quot;good&quot;. For he who calls himself good, is a liar. I am the darkness of Innoruuk. I serve the darkness of Innoruuk. I am hate. Hate is my soul. Hate is my strength. Amen.&quot; Daon gestured his hands into the unholy symbol, known only to the Disciples of Hate. He blinked only once. A brief moment of insecurity he quickly pushed out of his mind.<br>
<br>
 Daon's father opened the door to the unholy room, hidden underneath the city of Freeport. Daon, not disturbed by the sudden appearance, slowly lifted his young, clean shaven face to look at his father. He was a Shadow Knight. As was Daon's mother. Every generation of his family was loyal to Innoruuk. His father's face never showed any emotion but anger or sick joy at others suffering. Unlike Daon, who never showed any emotion at all. He was always still as a statue. Tall and dark. Many women considered him handsome even angelic, but the dark aura about him always frightened away the women, who did not serve Innoruuk. The women who did not know of his family's true religion. At times this irked Daon. Most of the women of The Dismal Rage didn't pay attention to him. But Daon did not give it too much thought. Self pity was not in his nature.<br>
<br>
 &quot;The Knights of Marr, discovered the bodies of those you slain earlier, Daon&quot; His father said. &quot;They do not know it was you, but you will need to be careful. They send adventurers to hunt the tunnels. Be alert when you use the tunnels again to leave the city. Your mother wishes to speak to you.&quot;<br>
 As suddenly as he appeared, Daon's father left. There was little, if any, show of affection in Daon's family life. The only &quot;truly&quot; emotional one was Daon's mother. A woman as cold as she was beautiful, but she always had a smile on her full lips. The smile matched the twinkle in her eyes, but the smile wasn't for her liking someone. She smiled because she knew she could kill almost anyone. In more ways than physical, even. She was known as one of the few, if any, human women to manipulate Dark Elf men, as easily as human men.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Come in&quot; Daon's mother said when he knocked. She was dressed in a beautiful set of decorated, black leather armor. She wore it for the feel of the leather on her skin, more than for protection. The leather had once been human skin. &quot;I want you to assist some Teir'Dal &quot;friends&quot; of mine, on one of their hunts in the West Commons.&quot; She watched Daon for a reaction. He was a loner by nature. Anything that disturbed someone, no matter how minor, amused her. She fed on people's emotions like a succubus. Daon made no movement. He stood tall and straight like a statue. His face, framed by his raven, black hair, showed no emotion. Not even his blue eyes. Daon's mother scowled. She never could, in all Daon's nineteen years, get a reaction out of him. As a young child, he never flinched, even when yelled at and punished. The Teir'Dal she knew, were more jumpy than her son. She liked that, but hated it at the same time. She never liked anyone being immune to her manipulations, no matter how subtle her manipulations were.<br>
 <br>
 &quot;...Anything else?&quot; was all Daon said. Simply. With his calm, slightly deep voice. His voice wasn't the deep, gruff voice of most barbarians or bragging warriors in bars. It was a calm, precise, masculine voice that could either charm most people. Or frighten most people, if he spoke to them from the shadows of the city tunnels, before he killed them.<br>

He wasn't sure how the walls were illuminated, but where the light shown, there were ample shadows to hide in. The Shadowknight title wasn't just a name. The best Shadowknight used the dark to hide in, then to pounce upon their targets. Daon was especially good at that.<br>
<br>
  There were voices, echoing ahead in the tunnels. Daon stopped to listen. Two, no, four voices. Beautiful accents. Not human, but Teir'Dal. The Dark Elven language. Even the men of their race had beautiful voices. But many did not notice. Most people who heard them, were their current victims of torture. Their victims never had time to appreciate the dark elves's melodious tones, over the sound of their own screaming. If the victims were lucky, the dark elves who captured them were male. If the victims were male, most of what was done to them was typical, physical torture. The cutting of skin, muscle, and bone. Followed by death, typically. If the victims were female, they were lucky if they were not raped before, or even during the torture. Daon did not approve of rape. Even for a murderer in service to Innoruuk, there were some boundaries that should not be crossed, in Daon's opinion. In that aspect, Daon was perhaps, &quot;almost&quot; similar to the Knights Above. Which is what Daon's family called the Palladins of Marr.<br>
<br>
  Daon quietly moved ahead. His black armor made no sound. The armor was designed so the metal plates did not grind together. His blood red cloak covering him, almost like a shroud, Daon quietly moved up to the scene ahead him.<br>
<br>
  It seemed one of the so called &quot;adventurers&quot; sent to find Daon was captured by the Teir'Dal. The human male was huddled in a corner, grunting like a wounded animal. He wasn't pleading. He had more strength than that. But he had lost the battle to one of the four Teir'Dal who fought him. The adventurer's armor was split open in numerous places. Blood was flowing out of his body like a damaged wine barrel. He had no hands. Most of the blood was spurting from where his opponent had cut his hands off. The adventurer was defiant. Unable to speak from the pain. He still defied the Teir'Dal with his stare. A refusal to die in his eyes, mixed with the mind racking pain. He kept the defiance in his eyes, even as the life left them.<br>
<br>
  One of the Teir'Dal was a woman, who turned to look Daon in the eyes. It seemed as if she knew he was there, but didn't acknowledge him until the adventurer was dead. The Teir'Dal's physical beauty, in general, matched their haunting voices. The women of the Teir'Dal were especially beautiful. This Teir'Dal woman, had a cruel smile on her face. She wore a chain around her neck. Attached to the chain were two hooks. Impaled on the hooks were two, bloody, severed hands.<br>

Some character concepts were fun at first, then became boring. Other character concepts were good ones, that could have lasted. But some real life friends occasionally play on FV, too. They play characters that MY old character (iksar)...well, I just couldn't see him working with them. No matter what story line I used. It just seemed like a betrayal of the character. So i &quot;retired&quot; that character. And created Daon Wolf. Daon is a very dark character, BUT I can see him working with many other characters of different origins. I can't tell you too much, yet. It would give away the character. The story line will explain more. But it may take time. Let's just say, Daon is still a very low level at the moment. I don't have lots of time to always play. So he will slowly level. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If i had envisioned Daon earlier, I would be in my forty's or possibly 50th level by now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Oh well. Thanks for the comment. The rest of the story is occasionally gory and will have some disturbing elements in it. I WON'T make the story a gore festival, so don't worry. But with evil characters , especially shadowknight ones, I don't see how there wouldn't be some disturbing moments. I hope you don't get too offended by the material.

The men tensed and held their weapons ready. The woman just stood there. The arrogant smile on her face. The blood from the served hands, made into a macabre necklace, dripped blood down the front of her shapely body. Daon, as with any other man, knew the temptations of lust, but kept his eyes from showing it. He didn't need to make his face into a mask, hiding his attraction to the dark elf woman's body. It was simply Daon's nature to not be emotional. Perhaps it was his upbringing. Perhaps it was just his nature. Daon seldom gave it little thought.<br>
<br>
     &quot;....Make up your minds.&quot; Daon said. Slowly, calmly. His voice drawing out the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;minds&quot; a little. Just a little. Enough to make it sound almost like a low, subtle growl. &quot;...Either you are going to kill me...or you are the Teir'Dal, I am to accompany to the West Commonland.&quot; Daon wasn't afraid of them all attacking him at once. They were like him, he knew now. &quot;Choosen ones&quot;. There were great powers at work in the universe. Powers of Order and Discord. More and more often, people were born as &quot;Choosen Ones&quot;. <br>
<br>
     Immortal in a sense. They could die, but they were always reborn to a location their soul was familiar with. &quot;Choosen Ones&quot;, whether considered evil or good, could make an impact on events in the world. Not always. But &quot;Choosen Ones&quot; had more of a chance than most mortals. There was one special rule among them. No &quot;Choosen One&quot; could directly harm another, unless challenged and the challenge accepted. In some areas, no one was safe. But the tunnels of Freeport was a &quot;normal&quot; location, as far as the Powers of Order and Discord were concerned. The Teir'Dal could not attack him here, if Daon did not wish to fight. And not all of them at once.<br>
<br>
     The Teir'Dal woman said his name. She was a friend of his mother. She commented on his stealth, but said she could still feel his presence. She was skilled, Daon knew. Daon was no novice to moving quietly and unseen. He would have to be careful around these Teir'Dal. They knew what they were doing. The woman told Daon to pick up the body and carry it with them. Better to leave no evidence, besides the blood. Daon stood there quietly, for a moment. His eyes staring calmly into the Dark Elf woman's. Then he walked away from the group, towards the darker tunnels of the Freeport sewers, to find the hidden exit. He didn't say a word to them or acknowledge their complaints when he left them with the body. He would wait for them at the hidden exit. Daon saw no need to baby the Dark Elves. He could hear their complaints echoing down the tunnels as he waited. The Teir'Dal didn't seem to like having to do their own work, after telling someone else to do it. Daon smiled inwardly, though his face was as passive as ever. His amusement was disturbed by the sound of movement behind him. Someone found the hidden tunnel from the outside.

Is it fangs and gloomy eyes? Or is it a darkness of the soul? Can a person be born evil? What some people call &quot;elemental evil&quot;? An evil of nature? Someone or something, that is meant to be the opposite of someone. Some babies, yet unborn in the womb, hear music their parents play for them. Daon, when still within his mother's womb, heard nothing but the screaming of his mother's victims. Does a yet unborn child &quot;see&quot; or &quot;know&quot; what a parent can see or know? If that is true, then Daon &quot;saw&quot; as well as heard the atrocities his mother committed, while she still carried him. There were times his mother, once called Iannia, flaunted her pregnancy while her victims were helpless before her. Her face, alive with passion and beautiful, smiled upon a young girl once. The girl was tied by stakes to the cold ground, her body was slowly being eviscerated while she was still alive and aware. As Iannia cut her with a hook shaped knife and ate parts of her. Promising the girl, in a soft, soothing voice, that if she quit screaming and vomiting blood, long enough to watch Iannia eat the girl's own flesh, that she would stop the pain and restore the girl to normal. There is great evil in the world. Iannia is just one of them. There were even worse things Daon may have &quot;seen&quot;, through his mother's eyes, as an unborn child. Things his mother and her friends did to childr...no. There are things even this storyteller cannot tell. Some stories should not be told. Many people claim to be evil as a way of boosting their self esteem, hoping others fear them. Many people claim to be evil, because they are &quot;naughty&quot; or &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;misunderstood&quot;. Or because they have killed others. Death is a mercy. They don't understand. To them evil is just a title. True evil goes beyond the word and past insanity.<br>
<br>
     Daon is evil. He is not as evil as his mother. He is not a torturer. Although he knows how. His is a killer, in service to a dark god. But there is much more horrible evil in the world than Daon. The knight in armor, screaming at Daon, believes him to be the epitome of all that is evil. If only he knew...<br>
<br>
     &quot;Murderer!&quot; The knight in silver armor screamed . &quot;Five people are dead! Their bodies chopped by YOUR sword and SHRIVELED by your black magic! I saw you in Qeynos that night! I saw what you DID to them! You cut them down without hesitation,and feed on their life force like the monster you are! I was helpless to stop you then, but I have tracked you down to this city and I will stop you now!&quot;  Daon stood there quietly. His Blood red cape covering most of his body. It may have been the darkness of the tunnels, but it seemed Daon was covered in shadows, compared to the Paladin's &quot;light&quot;. His forehead slightly furrowed, as he &quot;politely&quot;, calmly listened to the enraged knight. Daon seemed to be studying him. A question seemed to be forming on his lips, he was just trying to find the &quot;correct&quot; words to say.<br>
&quot;Why...do all you Paladins talk like drunk Bards... in a romance story?&quot; Daon's hand slowly gripped the handle of his bastard sword, beneath the slightly flowing folds of his crimson cape.<br>

The knight was quicker than Daon thought. Twisting to the right, the knight brought the shield on his left arm up, blocking in a brief explosion of sparks. He then countered with a quick upward arc of his sword, right at Daon's face. Daon, barely able to parry in time, took a step back to help himself against the strength of the knight's sword strike. Daon let the knight take the offensive. Trying to &quot;feel&quot; his opponent's fighting strategy. The knight, taking a step and then twisting his torso into each attack in a rapid pace, growled with each strike against Daon's &quot;persistant&quot; sword. Which Daon managed to bring up in a defensive position each time. Daon's face was grim with determination and his eyes showed an inner fire of hate. Hate, building with each parry. The life of a Shadowknight was one of constant inner conflict. For the Dismal Rage, their hatred was their strength. Hatred gave them the ability to use their dark magic, to it's fullest potential. But this hatred could get in the way of planning and strategy. A potentally lethal flaw, against a more skilled opponent. <br>
<br>
     Daon suddenly noticed, the Paladin wasn't using any of his own magic. He was fighting like a warrior. Pure skill and strength to beat an opponent down. Daon inwardly chastised himself for acting like a similar fool. That was when Daon missed a parry against the Paladin, and the knight's sword cleaved into Daon's left shoulder and into the bone, spraying Daon's face with his own blood. Daon grunted in pain and then Daon's sword arm glowed green with dark magic. The Paladin arched his back and cried out in agony at the ceiling of the tunnels, as his body was poisoned by Daon's necromancy. The Paladin quickly lowered his gaze, his eyes glowing white with his own magic, at the Shadowknight. Daon's world went black with blindness. Before he could react, he felt the Paladin's sword slice thru his armor and into his chest, then his stomach.<br>
<br>
     Elsewhere, on the other side of Antonica. In a forest shelter called Surefall; Myna the half elf stretched on her bed. Enjoying the feel of the morning sunlight on her naked body. She arched her back like a cat, then leaned over to wake her lover. &quot;Don't bother waking him.&quot; Said a man standing in the front of her room, the door closed behind him. &quot;He won't need to help you with what I have in mind.&quot; Myna sat up in the bed, not afraid of the uninvited &quot;guest&quot; in her room. She was angry  that he obviously snuck in. To stare at her body in her sleep, no doubt. She stood up, letting him get a good look at her slender yet volumptious form. &quot;Well this is all you'll ever get. So enjoy the moment.&quot; She said with a dangerous glare in her eyes. &quot;You will walk out that door blinded and castrated before you ever place your hands on THIS body.&quot; She held up her arms as if to show off her body...and the daggers she held in each hand. The &quot;guest&quot; stepped back against the door, holding his hands up in a peaceful gesture. He stuttered for a moment then regained his composure. &quot;I meant a mission! A ...job!&quot; He haden't meant for his words to come out like it sounded when he first spoke. It HAD been on his mind of course. Just looking at her! Clothed or unclothed, gods above! He wanted her! Just one hour...He quickly explained the situation, nervously looking back and forth at Myna's two daggers. His son had become a Paladin and saw what could only had been a Shadowknight, slaughter two young soldiers on duty in the sewers of Qeynos. Then two beggers who got in his way. The Shadowknight then made his way to the surface, thru secret tunnels. He was leaving the area, glancing back towards the front gate guards to make certain he was unseen, when a priest stopped him. After having some unknown conversation with the priest, the Shadowknight suddenly drew his sword and stabbed the priest completely through. Then quickly ran away. When the &quot;guest's&quot; son called for the city Paladins to give chase, they were horrified, but said the Shadowknight was but one of many evils in Qeynos. They must focus on the corrupt guards, to keep the city safe. They helped the young paladin with his training and sent him on a quest to find and stop the Shadowknight. Myna's &quot;guest&quot; wasn't happy with this, since his son was the Paladin sent on the quest. &quot;You're a Ranger!&quot; he said. &quot;You can track down the Shadowknight and kill him before my son finds him! You're skilled! You could kill him!&quot; The &quot;guest's&quot; face was animated by the idea of Myna fulfilling the quest before his son was ever in danger. When he mentioned the amount of money he would give, Myna's eyes lit up with interest.<br>
<br>
     Daon quickly summoned up all the dark power at his command. Concentrating past the pain of each new wound the Paladin gave him, holding in his stomach with his right hand; Daon pulled part of the knight's life force out of him and into Daon himself. His wounds healing with the stolen life essence and still blind, Daon slammed his back against a wall of the tunnel. The Paladin's attacks did not stop, but at least Daon could tell where the next attack would come from. Gritting his teeth against the pain of each new wound, Daon was able to block a few attacks by pure luck. Eyes blinking and hurting, Daon's sight suddenly returned. With a vicious snarl, more animal-like than human, Daon sent a bolt of pure, dark magic at the knight. The Paladin's blood began to boil in side his veins. The Paladin's scream was quickly cut off by Daon's sword, stabbing between his ribs. Daon twisted the blade and two rows of ribs, stretched wide inside the already mangled flesh, cracked. Daon suddenly, savagely pulled the blade out. Steped in and swung his blade low and to the side, slicing open the Paladin's bowls. Entrails dropped to the floor with a sickening splash. The Paladin's body glowed. The knight stood up as his bowels seemed to defy gravity and place themselves back in him. The wound almost completely healed. Daon glared in fustration. Paladins did not die easy.<br>

Their swords colliding, sparks flew. Daon cut high and sliced the Paladin's right cheek wide open, baring teeth and gums. More magic flew from the Paladin and the wound healed almost completely. Daon's necromantic magic kept draining the Paladin of life, to heal his own wounds. He slowly retreated back down the tunnel and into a more open space beneath the city. Daon and the Paladin now fought in a shallow pool of water, in a large circular room. Focusing once again his will, Daon literally stepped in his own shadow and disappeared. He instantly reappeared on the other side of the room, only to have the Paladin quickly charge him. <br>
     Parrying another blow from the Paladin, sparks flying in his face, Daons arms grew tired. The Paladin was physically stronger and at least equal in skill. Daon's poison magic infected the Paladin and he focused on keeping the blood boiling within his enemy. Despite the agony the knight was obviously in, the Paladin's magic and willpower kept him fighting. Daon knew he wouldn't win. The Paladin slammed his battered shield against Daon's head, stunning him. The knight's chipped sword sliced down and severed Daon's right hand. A roar of pure pain and rage echoed down the Freeport tunnels.<br>
<br>
    Daon grabbed the Paladin by his face and hatred erupted from the Shadowknight in a form of pure power. Red death magic flowed from Daon's hands and dissolved half of the Paladin's face in a crimson mist. The Paladin's scream was garbled from having only part of a mouth. Daon felt drained. The pain from having his hand severed and from all his hatred flowing out into a Harm Touch, left him feeling tired. Physically and well as within. For a moment, just a moment, he felt pity for the knight trying to scream with only half a face. He must have been more tired than he thought. <br>
<br>
   The Paladin's magic began to heal his face. Choking and sobbing in misery and frustration, his own hate and rage building in his eyes, the Paladin advanced. Summoning shadows to entangle the Paladin and slow him down, Daon staggered away from the unrelenting knight. Calling Daon a coward and a fool, the Paladin struggled to catch up. Fighting against the bonds of shadow restraining him. &quot;Come and get me, holy man!&quot; Daon spat.  Gaining enough distance from the Paladin, Daon searched in a pocket of his coat with his remaining hand. He tried to ignore the madding, dizzying pain. Tried to ignore his blood spraying out and the strength going with it. Daon scattered bone chips on the ground. Within seconds, a complete set of bones formed from the fragments. Assembling into an unholy abomination. A skeletal servent that existed only to please it's master. Calling on more of the dark power, Daon enhanced the servents power, and drained more of the Paladin's life force to stop the bleeding of the stump where his hand was. Feeling some strength return but still dizzy from the pain, Daon ran ahead and found a familiar set of stairs. Hearing the sound of the Paladin fighting the undead slave, Daon ran up the stairs and turned around a corner.<br>
      He knew he couldn't hide. He still bled a trail. Easy for anyone to pick up. Daon moved farther down the upstairs tunnel, feet splashing in the sewer water, to an apparent dead end. The tunnel ended with a drop at least twenty feet down to a deep pool of water. The water passing his feet forming a small waterfall into the pit below. He saw something in the water. He remembered the way correctly. Daon began casting a spell.<br>
     The Paladin, shaking off the bonds of shadow and using the last of his magic to heal the poison and agony of his own blood boiling, quickly destroyed the undead slave.  He quickly followed the blood trail up a set of stairs to find Daon at the end of a tunnel. A tunnel that led to nothing but a drop below. Flowing sewer water ran past both their feet and off the end of the tunnel. Magic flowed around the Shadowknight and then...nothing. The Shadowknight was still there. No teleporting through shadows. The Shadowknight, defiance still in his eyes, turned around to face the drop as the Paladin charged, and jumped off.<br>
<br>
     Hearing a loud splash, the Paladin knew then, there was a large pool at the bottom. Anything more shallow, would have resulted in the sound of the Shadowknight's collision echoing thoughout the tunnels.<br>
      Daon was sinking like a man in armor would sink. Barely keeping conscious, he striped the armor off, one piece at a time. Keeping an eye on the shadow he saw earlier. <br>
     The Paladin saw that the Shadowknight wasn't coming up.  He dropped his shield,took off the heavest parts of his armor, and leaped in. Daon had to go up for air. With most of his armor off, he was able to swim to the surface long enough to see the Paladin's splash. Taking a deep breath, Daon dived down. The Paladin was already taking powerful strokes towards Daon, despite the injuries he still suffered. The Paladin's face was reformed, but the skin had not regrown. With that appearance, the Paladin was almost as imposing as the horrors swimming up behind him from the shadows. Pale, shriveled skin. Milk white eyes and lips stretched back to reveal teeth in a horrible grin. Fingertips worn down to the bone, sharpened like claws. Tattered and decayed clothes. The Drowned Men of Freeport. Undead who haunted the deep of the city sewers, quickly swarmed around the Paladin. Bony fingers pierced exposed skin. Yellowed teeth bit and tore at the neck and face. Daon could hear and feel the Paladin's underwater scream as he was pulled back from him. The water quickly turning red. The look of pure horror in the Paladin's eyes, as he reached out a bitten and bloody hand. Fingers had been chewed off. Reaching towards Daon. Not to drag him down but reaching for help. His eyes wide and pleading. Daon felt haunted at that moment. A strange feeling for a Shadowknight. He did not understand it, so he shrugged it off. The Paladin had completely disappeared into the darkness of the red water.<br>
<br>
     Daon swam back up to gain another breath and dived back down to retrieve his armor. The pain of his arm was gone. He felt nothing but a numbness. All over. Everywhere. He was very tired.<br>
      After finding pieces of armor and taking them to a shallow side, bit by bit, Daon only had one piece left to reclaim. It had drifted towards the shadows, where the Drowned Men floated. Daon was unafraid of them. The last spell he cast made him invisible to undead.<br>

His mind delerious with pain, staggering from exhaustion and his wounds, Daon clutched his severed hand tight to his chest. Unaware of himself doing so. He used the walls of the tunnels for support with every step. The Teir'Dal had seen the last part of the fight between Daon and the Paladin. They slowly followed behind Daon, amusement on their faces. Watching to see if he made his way back to safety or died in the tunnels. They were one thing Daon's feverish mind was aware of. Like &quot;sophisticated&quot; pack animals, they could either crowd around him and watch his death, or possibly show loyalty to another follower of Innoruuk and send for help. There was never any real way of knowing what they would do. Those who truly lived in the ways of the Dark Father, were capable of anything. Not all of them lived by a &quot;code&quot;.<br>
<br>
     Daon made his way to the main room of the Dismal Rage guildleaders and merchants. It was the first room to pass by for anyone searching the tunnels. Who better to protect the Dismal Rage than some of their most powerful teachers? The merchants themselves, were all experienced fighters in their own right. Daon fell out of the shadows of the tunnel and collapsed near the feet of a Necromancer trainer.<br>
<br>
   Daon awoke hours later, in one of his family's rooms. In a far away corner of the territory of the Dismal Rage, beneath Freeport.  His wounds healed but the pain of his right arm lingered. He felt his right hand, reattached by magic, occasionally twitching in a bowl of blood. The bowl wasn't filled with water stained with blood, the bowl was actually filled with blood. Who's, he did not know. Nor did he care. The pain was still there. The hand was restored, but the pain would last for hours until the magic process was complete. When suffering incredible pain, the mind loses some ability to think clearly. Emotions tend to be at their peak. Daon lifted his blood covered hand to look at what may have been lost forever, then placed his hand back into the bowl. Daon's eyes were always calm and looked cold when fighting and killing. With the pain infecting his mind, Daon had a feral snarl on his face. His eyes intense with violent potential. He sat in the room alone, no light but one candle in the corner, briefly illuminating his features with the unsteady flame. Daon was in pain and he wanted all of Norrath to scream because of it.<br>
<br>
     &quot;The TeirDal said Daon won the fight with the knight by using a clever tactic.&quot; Daon's father said in a low tone. He and Daon's mother were in a nearby room, surrounded by several lit candles. Daon's father paced the room while Daon's mother lounged on a pile of furs. Incense filled the air. &quot;Then he was not strong enough to win.&quot; Daon's mother mused, more to herself than to her husband. &quot; Although strategy is a good thing, he was weaker than the Paladin.&quot; She leaned back against the pile of furs and relaxed her still young body. She knew being ruthless and sexual was an attraction her husband could not ignore. &quot;Perhaps we should kill him as we did his sister. She was unable to learn any good skills and therefore was useless. Daon has been exceptional.&quot; She caressed her bottom lip with her index finger. &quot;Until now.&quot; Daon's father unbuckled his sword belt and approached his wife. &quot;No. We wait until after my group assaults the Hall of Truth in a few days. That will give me time to think of his value to the Dismal Rage. If he is of no use, I will kill him myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
     In the darkness of the room Daon was in, his mind was assaulted by the pain of his healing hand. The rage that all Shadowknights have, building up in response to that pain. His deep blue eyes, the only thing now illuminated by the candle light, staring straight ahead. His eyes intelligent and focused with an inhuman clarity, despite the condition of his mind. His every sense, sharpened to a painful, above normal accuracy.<br>
<br>
     Daon's mother and father made their plans. Their son, the killer in the dark, was listening.<br>

He stood there, staring at the door. The pain in his arm was gone, the hand completely reattached. Daon's face was a calm, expressionless mask. His thoughts were orderly and precise. His emotions were a choppy, sea of hatred.<br>
<br>
      His family will kill him, he knew, if Daon did not prove his usefulness to the Dismal Rage. He could kill them. It may be easy. It may not. The image of his father's eyes opening up just in time to see Daon swinging a greatsword pleased Daon. His mother would obviously be awake after father was dead. Even unarmored and weaponless, she would be dangerous. She had always been the more powerful of Daon's parents, though Daon's father did not know this.<br>
      <br>
       &quot;Never let the enemy know your full potential&quot; she told Daon one night. While casually hacking off a young Bard's legs, as the Bard tried to crawl away. Screaming with each cut of the large greatsword Daon's mother wielded. Hands shaking, the bard looked like a turtle, slowly attempting to run from a predator. The Bard stopped screaming when Daon's mother finished chopping off both his arms. The Bard's mouth was wide open in a final, silent scream as his eyes rolled up into his head. The Bard suddenly vomited blood, after Daon thought he was already dead, shuddered, then was still. Daon slowly followed beside his mother throught out the slow murder. While looking down at the body, Daon's face was as statue-like as ever. Daon was six years old.<br>
<br>
      His mother could cast a spell on Daon, by the time he moved into position to attack his mother. Shadows to slow him down and possibly even burn the blood inside his veins. Enough time to grab a weapon of her own. If he succeeded, what then? The Dismal Rage might not look at the situation as survival of the fittest. They would &quot;forget&quot; Daon's passing though. His parents were higher in rank than him. Daon starred at the door. His right hand gripping the handle of the greatsword. He felt a sense of power holding any weapon. Then he felt like a common thug.<br>
<br>
     Any idiot can just attack. Not all Shadowknights had honor. Daon choose to. He could prove his worth, not to his family, but to the Dismal Rage. Using one of the &quot;gifts&quot; of being a &quot;Choosen One&quot;, Daon sent a psychic message to the Teir'Dal woman he meet earlier. Daon was going hunting.<br>
<br>
      In Surefall Glade, Myna was oiling her swords, when she heard a visitor approach her door. She opened the door before the man could knock. The &quot;guest&quot; from earlier had arrived. He had a empty look in his eyes. She could have stabbed him right then, and Myna doubted he would notice.<br>
<br>
     &quot;My son is dead. He is not coming back. His soul is tired from the horror he endured.&quot; The man shook his head. &quot;My son is gone.&quot; Myna was trying to come up with a proper phrase to say at moments like this. A phrase meant to comfort but usually sounded hollow to her ears. The man handed her a bag full of coins, surprising Myna. She had been glancing at the ceiling, trying to think of something to say. &quot;Kill him.&quot; The man said simply. There was nothing simple about the look on his face. Quiet, tight lipped hatred was easy to read on his features. It seemed, to Myna, that Innoruuk, deity of Hatred, won no matter what. Myna didn't need to ask whom, that was simple to guess. &quot;His name is Daon, right?&quot; Myna asked. &quot;Your son heard the priest say his name, before the Shadowknight killed him...right?&quot; The man nodded his head and walked away into the night. <br>
<br>
     Myna finished putting on her armor, placed both her long swords into her belt sheaths with a click, then walked out her house and into the night air.<br>
