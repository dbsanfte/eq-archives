<br>
Now, now, ladies.  Withdraw the claws.  Let's not get catty.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The best way for the Sisters image to be cleaned up, as it were, would be for you to completely remove yourself from any mention of them.<br>

I've no issue with them now that you're not associated with them, and I have heard good things from several guildmembers who've roleplayed with them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Or, perhaps the Sisters could show an increase in their maturity.  Were you there, Sarhea?  Did you participate in guild discussions with the Sisters of Myth?  I did.  Vivienne is and was not the problem.<br>
<br>
There were many problems with the guild, but Vivienne, being the leader, was an easy scapegoat.  I am not saying she was totally blameless, either.  I'll not go in to those problems here, as they're no one's business.<br>
<br>
Waiting to speak until you know the facts isn't a bad thing.  That's a GOOD thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You, on, the other hand, are again, a boil on the backside of this community.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This, ladies and gentlemen, is what we refer to as a blatant personal attack.  The question is, will Sarhea get bapped for it, or will the mods let it go because she's one of the &quot;in crowd&quot;?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lastly, again, Kudos to Roose for trying to pull together something that was a great RP idea, that just got fucked by someone with no real concept of the bounderies between rp and ooc <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Having spent roughly half my life on this server around Vivienne, I can attest that this statement is pretty much a load of crap.  Not the Roose part, but the part about &quot;no real concept of the boundaries between RP and OOC.&quot;<br>
<br>
PoVivienne knows these boundaries, but just like EVERYONE on this server, there is some overlap.  Those who say there is none are either lying or delusional.<br>
<br>
Part of what makes RP so compelling is that is can hit us emotionally.  When Jaranna left the Circle of Sisters, PoJaranna was just as sad as Jaranna was.  Why?  Because these ladies were (and still are) my friends, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in the guild.  If there was no OOC involvement there, I could have left on a whim and felt nothing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some people CAN be that emotionally detatched.  But these are not people that I would want to be around.  There is no good RP without emotion.  And you can't fake that.<br>
<br>
But, yes.  Kudos to Roose for working her ass off to keep the Sisters of Myth alive.  She's grown up a lot recently and proven she's worthy of the surname she holds so dearly.<br>
<br>

<br>
You're right. The only time Vivienne posts here is when someone else brings her up. <br>
<br>
Most of her posts take a very defensive stance, one for which no one can blame her. However.... is it not a fairly educated assumption that the way someone composes themselves when in defense has some reflection on their character? <br>
<br>
I do have a clue as to what she's like normally. Everything that she writes gives us a clue as to what she's like. And it is my opinion that most every argument i've seen in here from her doesn't hold water. While Sarhea has given straight out good examples as to how back-and-forth Vivienne is and what type of person she is.<br>
<br>
[quote] But, perhaps you will once again post 7 month old quotes to try to prove your point, but since you DON'T have a clue about me at all, I guess that is all you can do.[/quote]<br>
<br>
But in response to the above quote: everyone has a clue about you, you twit. The obvious hostility in the post you just made gives us a clue! <br>
<br>
 I've never put my nose in until this point. I hope after reading this she realises what type of impression she gives the community that doesn't give a rat about the problems Sarhea and her have! Or any of the other problems with people such as Shintou.<br>
<br>
I never base my opinion on Rumors. I base them on what I see and read in these boards and in the game. The fact that my guild was ordered to cease interaction with Sisters of Myth when she was in charge of it is a hint. The way she responds to any given situation is abhorable. I don't honestly understand how people can interact with her without holding the fear of her somehow wildly blowing their comments out of proportion. The fear of her getting offended would be my problem. I don't understand it, and i don't care for it. I don't like her responses. This board is open to the public and she should know very well that everything she's said here will never die.<br>
<br>
So yeah I was serious.<br>

<br>
Ummmm... me obviously hostile? Dear boy, do try NOT to be a hypocrite, it doesn’t look good on you. I wouldn’t even have been here if I wasn’t bashed unjustly yet again, just minding my own business. But, when I counter the arguement, in jumps your friend WITHOUT any provocation.<br>
<br>
Funny, now that I think about it, that is ALWAYS the case. I have yet to jump in and attack (personally or otherwise) Sarhea or one of her cohorts when they make some comment that doesn’t involve me at all... I am perfectly content to leave them be, but as soon as I make some comment, one that doesn’t involve her whatsoever, she is all over me once again. Why is that? I do not know... personal grudge, I guess. She does seem to feel the need to hound me time after time after time again. Quite scary actually, to tell the truth.<br>
<br>
I have been polite, not a swear, rude comment or personal attack from me whatsoever, but there she is and here you are, also attacking me and about something that does NOT concern either of you... Maybe you should pull your blinders off, dear, for you seem to be quite biased.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, saying that things “hint” at something during your arguement doesn’t lend great support to your side, especially since the only time I post here is usually when I am ticked right off by a snide comment from one of your “friends” - so, you see one side of me, the angry side, that is a great way to form a full view of somebody, wow... genious. However, during all of this, I decided not to get angry, and instead have fun with it.<br>
<br>
Also, I would like to point out that anybody can cut quotes from other places, cropping them in ways to manipulate what is said so that the whole story is not told, but just their side of it. That isn’t rocket science, having worked in the print media industry for 10 years taught me that.<br>
<br>
Ummm... do you need a hug too? You seem to be very angry about something <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh... and Oligith, dear... yellow and pink would not do you at all... honestly, hun, trust me on this. I would think a nice deep green would be best, accenting your blond hair and your paler skin. Canary yellow is just too close to the colour tone of your skin.<br>
<br>
Oh, and you are right, Jaranna, dear, I should not have mentioned Braellar, my bad . He just has such a lovely way with words, quite funny actually, normally he is so quiet and nice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, my apologies to all others who must read all this, I didn’t mean to hijack the post, just that people some to keep wanting to talk about me... I just guess that I am a popular girl  When they pipe down, so shall I <br>
<br>
By the way, I will say that you are all right about Roose, she is a wonderful leader of the Sisters, I am quite proud of her and the work she is doing. I am honored that she wears the Lileath name. <p>Vivienne Lileath<br>

[Fri Dec 06 04:34:07 2002] You tell your party, 'is there a problem?'<br>

(No one was laughing. It was more sarcasm.)<br>

[Fri Dec 06 04:35:38 2002] You have been removed from the group.<br>
<br>
The group was not asked, i was simply removed because this individual couldn't maintain an illusion of superiority with 4th grader antics when the focus of it's attention wasn't stooping to the same level of immaturity.<br>

[Fri Dec 06 04:44:11 2002] You told faizah, 'did you have a problem with me?'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:46:24 2002] Faizah tells you,in Elvish, 'of course not, I didn't realize what was going on until after you left the group, you're a ok necro in my book )'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:46:33 2002] Faizah tells you,in Elvish, 'she's a little silly, hate to see things like that happen ('<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:46:40 2002] You told Faizah, 'i didn't leave the group!'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:46:43 2002] You told Faizah, 'i was booted!'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:47:48 2002] Faizah tells you,in Elvish, 'ah, well I'm leaving the group now as well....good luck on your journeys, hope I can still call you friend'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:47:57 2002] You told Faizah, 'you can indeed'<br>
<br>
As you can see, they were all astounded at her actions, and had no problem with me. Surely, I'm such an evil terrible person, that must be why they like me so much. Heh.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:47:13 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'I did nothing...from the first moment u enterd and i made a comment about us needing ur pet u shot back with extreme attitude'<br>
<br>
(Refer back to the top of the log, to see this extreme attitude it refers to, dont see it? Yeah I didn't think it was extreme atttiude either)<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:47:28 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'extreme attitude was telling you that i needed mana first?'<br>

[Fri Dec 06 04:48:17 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'Chaos LOL now that is funny...I am THE most organized group person there is'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:48:47 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'you're textbook. nothing special. you'r the kind of person who lives on stirring up trouble. like you just did'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:48:51 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'u just didnt like thta fact that a girl was askign u to do wsomething '<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:48:55 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'sexist pig'<br>
<br>
(oh please. I knew from word 1 that this person was not a female.)<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:49:08 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'there was no trouble until u went all wierd'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:49:10 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'i've been in tells with everyone else in the group, none of them have a problem with me, all of them agree you're a nutcase, wonder why your enchanter is leaving?'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:49:40 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'they can think whatever they like..ur an instigator and just a plain bad bad man'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:50:07 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'you have so far accused me of only the things you're doing yourself'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:50:26 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'u got snotty with me for no reason..and i dont have to take that'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:50:35 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'it's simple projection. you hate yourself, so you take all the things you hate about yourself, and convince yourself other people are doing them'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:50:46 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'very common in people like yourself who have transsexual tendencies'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:51:26 2002] Tinysugar tells you,in Elvish, 'how in gods name u got that from what happened i have no clue what so ever'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 04:51:44 2002] You told Tinysugar, 'you're a basic case'<br>
<br>
<br>
I saw some friends of mine there, so i hastily ran off with them to get away from the wierdo.<br>
So I discussed this with my next group:<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:05:42 2002] You tell your party, 'i am so glad you guys showed up'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:05:49 2002] Valkyrie tells the group,in Elvish, 'lol, was it that bad?'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:05:54 2002] You tell your party, 'yes the druid was a freak!<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:06:01 2002] Valkyrie tells the group,in Elvish, 'Tinysugar?'<br>
<br>
(Here we see that apparently the it has a reputation)<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:06:08 2002] Valkyrie tells the group,in Elvish, 'she's a moron'<br>
<br>
And a poor one at that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Now let me show you the aftermath of that mess. Yes, even after it tried convincing you that I was such an evil terrible person, (And what good would that serve? None, it would just add to the chaos that it feeds on.) it began trying to recruit its friends to harass me. Harassing me is no simple task.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:38:56 2002] Leawen tells you, 'hao'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:39:07 2002] You told Leawen, 'elvish, dark elvish, or gnomish'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:39:17 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'hello'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:39:23 2002] You told Leawen, 'hi'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:39:33 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'someone said you were talking trash on tinysugar?'<br>
<br>
That statement alone tells me all I cared to hear about Leawen's personality.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:40:08 2002] You told Leawen, 'from your use of the term &quot;talking trash&quot; i can tell you're about as mature as tinysugar'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:40:39 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'hah and you about as mature as a lump of bread for not trying to solve the situation like a mature adult'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:40:49 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'Talk so we can solve problems'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:40:49 2002] You told Leawen, 'well, why ask me, and not the person you heard i was &quot;talking trash&quot; from? surely if they had any idea what they were talking about, they'd be able to answer that for you'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:41:40 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'you know what little dicks like you do not concern me i try and solve a problem rationaly and you start to put me down hah you dont realize who i am'<br>
<br>
Yep. Just like Tinysugar. Right down to the letter. He gets just as upset about a calm reasonable question as it does. Only he takes it another step further. When he realizes he doesn't have a point worth making he throws a level in my face. That's more pitiful than it is impressive.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:41:46 2002] You told Leawen, 'and how do you suggest the problem be solved? i already solved the problem, i stuckl the psycho on ignore and moved on, you're just trying to come up with an excuse to start an argument'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:42:03 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'im lvl 65 druid of tunare i have more athourety on this server then you realize'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:42:24 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'she aint psycho and i would apricate if you didnt call her that'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:42:41 2002] You told Leawen, 'i dont care what level you are. you have no authority, and if you think you do, you're very sadly disillusioned. this is a game.'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:43:15 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'HAH welcome to my ignor and welcome to never being able to get into a end game guild'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:43:30 2002] You told Leawen, 'keep telling yourself that. from what i hear fnf is a zerg guild'<br>
<br>
I know nothing about their guild. But the statement served its purpose, as you'll see explained shortly.<br>
<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:43:48 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'HAH'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:43:50 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'no'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:44:33 2002] You told Leawen, 'well that proved my theory that you were too interested in how i'd respond to your petty threat to put me on your ignore list like you claimed, which also proves you to be a liar'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:44:51 2002] Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'you are now on mine'<br>
[Fri Dec 06 05:44:57 2002] You told Leawen, 'now you can take your imaginary authority, and your misconceptions about tinysugar, and stick them where the sun doesn't shine'<br>
<br>
Tinysugar accomplished its goal, it created all the chaos it could, and wasted a good deal of time. But I don't mind. If anything productive comes of this, even if its true personality being ousted, it will have been worth the time and effort, because for every person that gets word, that's one less person left that it can harass. I hope that this experience has been an enlightening one for you, hopefully it will save you the stress of finding out what type of person tinysugar is on your own time. Should you have any other questions feel free to ask, or if you'd like me to clarify anything for you.<br>

Sar hun - i do remember, though i just found that ignoring you in general was a workable solution rather than piss everyone off.. so far i think it's working, ohh be asured i still hold the same hatefull feelings towards you.. but it's to neer Xmas for me to all you the 'B' word.<br>
     I have no desire to talk to you ingame - and i was sure you had the same feelings, though if you do send me a tell i will guarantee i will give you a fair conversation and do my best to keep my cool, then again i dont see that situation happening anytime soon.<br>
<br>
I have spoken to Roose on a few occasions, i think she is a very nice girl who enjoys to roleplay and i do hope you give her all a chance.<br>

Hello Wimbus,<br>
<br>
  I do appreciate you sending me the logs and speaking with me calmly in <br>
game.  Based on the evidence presented here, I am not very pleased with <br>
Tinysugar.  Regardless of the way she interpreted your answers, she should <br>
have shown some common courtesy and restraint.<br>
<br>
  The one basic rule in the Winds of Destiny is to honour the guild by your <br>
words and actions.  I shall be speaking with Tiny in order that this sort of <br>
thing should not happen again.  I'm sorry for Leawen's comments, but he is <br>
no guildie of mine.  Should any Winds member harrass you in anyway, please <br>
let me know and I will discipline them severely.  Reputations are hard to <br>
come by, and I am proud of mine.<br>
<br>
  Take care in game, and know that if you are in any sort of difficulty <br>
please send me a /tell in game.<br>
<br>

WTF is a Wimbus</span><hr size=1> [quote]Leawen tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'im lvl 65 druid of tunare i have more athourety on this server then you realize'[/quote]<br>
<br>
This is exactly what I was referring to earlier.  Leawen's so full of himself it's pathetic.  I don't have a log, but here's the story.<br>
<br>
Vivienne and I are sitting in Maiden's Eye medding between gorangas when Leawen comes up and sits down starting to talk crap.  We hadn't talked to him at all.  he just ran up and started harassing us.  Then this crap:<br>
<br>
&quot;Before you say anything, yes, I am red to you, and this scimitar in my hand is the druid epic, and the DoT on it alone can kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not an exact quote mind you, but close enough.  Then Jaranna decided to ask him if he'd like a ruler so he could tell us exactly how long his &quot;equipment&quot; was.  Completely IC.<br>
<br>
That was when he started going OOC with the insults.  After a while I got tired of remaining rational and followed suit.  Before that time, I had no OOC problem with him.  It was purely an IC hatred.  Now, I just ignore him.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
PoLeawen is simply a young boy who thinks that his character gives him license to be an ass.<br>
<br>
Given my past experiences with Leawen, and to a lesser extent PoTinysugar's past characters, I may have to change my initial opinion of Wimbus, not that he cares, really.  However, this doesn't explain Xerrik's encounter with him.  Maybe Wimbus is an ass, but in this case, he wasn't the problem. <p>Jaranna Lileath<br>

WTF is a Wimbus</span><hr size=1> Bah. Wimbus. Good idea to keep those logs up. You were obviously in the right with this first problem. Maybe you were just in a bad mood from it when you were talking with me. I don't know. <br>
<br>
Myself i'm not making many comments in here for a while because i always end up pissing someone off (yeah i flame people). Or i end up in the middle of something i shouldn't be.<br>
<br>
(such as this Vivienne thing, and yes I still hold that this is the image she portrays to me. I wont be making any more comments, she's defended herself quite well, I've realised how childish the whole thing is and am letting it die  (where i'm involved) so maybe everyone can move on. my comments just didn't add any help.)<br>
<br>
Did you keep the log of our little mishap? You should post it.<br>
<br>
because i don't bother keeping logs, too much hassle with parsing and stuff like that. *maybe I should*.<br>
<br>

WTF is a Wimbus</span><hr size=1> Well, im actually happy you kept logs cause it helped refresh my memory...about my comment to Danial..LOL that was an inside joke between me and him you only caught part of it..and u missed what he said in your logs..because u couldnt understand the language he was speaking...Also if you go back up to my very first post on this thread...Everything I said is exactly as you show it on your logs...This may sound silly but you really had to be there in that moment of time to get a sense of the situation...Also Wimbus you left out alot!...we had alot more text then that sweets...I can see i'm gonna have to keep logs...biggest thing you forget to post is how after i booted you from the group...how it was you who began with the crossdressing comments...you forget to put that though..how strange...and other people seen it cause you said it outloud...you could have asked me why i booted you...though i probally would have just said &quot;cause i can&quot; that was the mood i was in...either way you didn't you just went right into the name calling...was I rash in booting you?? I dont think i was..but my interpretations of your comments are just that MINE...you also forgot to add alot your tells to me...as for Valkyrie I have never met that person IC or OOC...as for Faziah leaving the group..she told us she was leaving before you were invited...that was her last pull...ask her if ya wish...as for damandar...he sat with me and Danial while me and u were exchanging words...actually the entire group stayed with me..even after i left the group..they asked me to join them again...Damandar repeatidly told me to ignore the comments of the snobbish gnome and to hunt with them again...As for leawen, I did not ask him to talk to you or make this post on this board...as for the e-mail u got fro molsone...I was never talked to and mention of him recievign the logs and speaking with you was never brought to me...But i will be speaking to him to make sure if he needs to discipline me in ayway it is done....As for this whole matter Im glad you had your say i wouldnt want it any other way...I have to give you credit you are good at what you do..what it is exactly that you do im not quite sure...you know your pyschology for sure..good at manipulation..I simply tell it as i see it and felt it..and i wont be deleting Tinysugar I like my class and race and dont want to start a new one...though id suggest everyone get to know me a little in game before adding me to /ignore <p>Tinysugar Cakes<br>
