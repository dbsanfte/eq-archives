Remember, the TLC only exists on this server. Those larvae are L1 on *all* servers, which means they are not meant to be rare. That Vah Shir are cut off from some of their pursuits on THIS server is simply because there is no consideration of the TLC taken into account when designing new zones and new quests, so obviously we are going to have bugs/problems because of that.<br>
<br>
Face it, we are all of us on this server together a fraction of 1 percent of EQ's revenue stream. We are, ourselves, trivial. If every single one of us cancelled our accounts, they'd still be making 99.75% of the money they make now. In fact, they could turn this server into a normal server and probably make MORE money if we did that.<br>
<br>
Now that I think about it, this means that they probably won't remove TLC here to fix the bugs that exist now and crop up later because if they make it suck enough and we leave then they can divert this server's resources elsewhere and make a few extra bucks. When the population drops low enough they may just forcibly move us to standard servers and do that anyway. But definitely, no question about it, they aren't going to be devoting man hours to fixing bugs that affect such a trivial part of the population when there are probably thousands or tens of thousands of man hours still needed to fix the bugs that affect *everyone*. And by then there will be a new expansion, more bugs (especially here), and on it goes.<br>
<br>
Best bet, recruit folks to come to this server. I try to do that, here and there (but subtly, without seeming desperate), because I truly believe that if the population continues its slide we'll be moved elsewhere to allow them to better utilize resources.<br>
<br>
And you are completely wrong that I dislike the TLC because I wish to go farm some greens. I dislike it ONLY because it is buggy and it is unsupported, and I don't see how anyone rational can argue with the fact that it IS buggy and unsupported. <br>
<br>
I also disagree that you'd see farmers everywhere without it. The only 'proof' anyone has come up with for that is a comparison to normal servers, where people have disposa-chars and don't worry about reputations and far larger populations (and even there, in more than 3 years of playing, I have only had a grand total of TWO problems with farmers). That's apples and oranges. We don't have enough people to see people everywhere, for ANY reason, much less activities apt to destroy their reputations which, on a small server with one character per account, would obviously be a pretty bad idea.<br>
<br>
So the TLC pros: less farming. Well, presumably so, although there is no proof that that would be the case. That's about it for the pros, one unsubstantiated theory based on an apples-and-oranges comparison. <br>
<br>
The cons: buggy quests that are undoable or nearly undoable, for those they are intended for. No support for fixing of any related bugs. Unrealism - the mighty wizard, despite his years of mastery and massive intellect, just can't seem to figure out how to kill some things without destroying what they have despite having full access to all of his weaker spells. Reliance on the always-diminishing lower-level population of the server for completion of some quests. Lack of logic - some quests are obviously intended that YOU do them, not hire some gang of flunkies to do it. Increased reliance on spoiler sites (which is ironically the very thing that the TLC *was* intended to cut down on).<br>
<br>
I can't help but look at the pro and cons and see the cons as being FAR bigger in scope than one unproven and untested theory.<br>
<br>
But, like I said, they have no real incentive to remove the TLC. As long as we're willing to pay money to endure the inevitable bugs then they will take our money. If the population drops too low because enough people DON'T want to pay money to play on a server with an unsupported rule in the ruleset then they'll probably just move us elsewhere and make this hardware a new blue server.<br>

<br>
I don't want to get into this argument, which is getting old and boring, but if people wish to continue to debate the pros and cons of TLC (and I do read at least, in search of new opinions and new input on what it's doing since the new release) I wish everyone could please restrain themselves to debate on the basis of what it does to play and not how realistic it is.  Arguing realism is a crutch for people who have run out of other ways to prove their point.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has ever said &quot;Anyone seen my corpse?&quot; should get realistic about the realism in this game, and just enjoy it for what it is.  Let's debate rules and such on the basis of what makes the game the most fun, please.  That is what we're all here for isn't it?<br>

<br>
Now, you COULD leave it at that, but it really wouldn't be worth it.  This is a quest which evolves as you increase in skill.  First come the Xakra teeth.  Then the grimling claws.  Then the whosamawhats (forget at the moment) and finally the Owlbear feathers.<br>
<br>
This is much along the same lines as the pottery quest for the Vah Shir.  Important to note is the fact that those darts of which you speak are equippable by Vah Shir ONLY.  Therefore, if you're not a Vah Shir (dunno if you are or not) they're worthless to ya.  <br>
<br>
if you ARE a Vah Shir, then you really don't want to be messing around with them anyhow.  Each upgrade to the dart-making tool increases the quality and range of the darts.  You don't need a skill above 46 to complete the quest... just keep running through handing him his tool back (don't say it) and then taking the returned tool and the attachment and combining them in your fletching kit.<br>
<br>
You're right.  It doesn't make much sense to have darts like these that can't be made.  However, when you keep in mind that they're a stepping stone, for lower level Vah Shir Tarruuns, to a more powerful weapon, then it makes sense that you just continue through the quest.<br>
<br>
I've completed it.  Now I'm just waiting until I'm high enough to get Owlbear feathers so that I can find out when those darts triv. <p>Denoi<BR>

Secondly, is is a nice exchange for 'No Drop' tag being removed.<br>
<br>
As for the 'non-role playing' argument.  Hows this:  The 'gods' of reward deem Trival combat not worth of such rewards and wisk away the desired item before the player can loot it.  Or.... Your skill and ability is so 'effective' that it destroyes the item.  Whether you 'choose' to accept either RP explaination is a moot issue. What is fact is that the TLC can simply be explained in a 'RP' themology, and thus is not 'anti-RP'.  Just because you don't like something does not mean it is always OOC or 'anti-RP'.<br>
<br>
I agree that the TLC can be a pain, however, like the other rule sets of the server, it is just another challenge in the game.  It is not like the TLC was implemented after the server was started. <br>
