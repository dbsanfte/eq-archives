<br>
Those posts have turned into flames, and arguments, and different opinions and views of people who will never view everything the same.<br>
<br>
It is getting old, lame, and gay.<br>
<br>
We can do this till the end of time.<br>
<br>
Fire and Fury has alot of people who don't see them so kindly.<br>
<br>
People will post here negative about them, Bako, Gore or some other member will post all nicely to defend their guild.<br>
<br>
Dash that With Starspun guild being their best friends (hence ankles and moderators guild) everything is defended or deleted or locked by a moderator.<br>
<br>
People will post with big balls saying im paranoid, an idiot, or disgruntled ex member.<br>
<br>
Doubt it.  I'm not saying anything new, just taking tidbits from one post and another and combining them all here<br>
<br>
Basically this board has come down to two sides<br>
FaF &amp; Starspun (moderators) and those people vs The people who don't like Faf and have good reasons.<br>
<br>
Go ahead, debate im pissed off, lalala, not true, this is a message board about a server that no one here owns or runs, so flame, and post comments, i'll still exist in server as will all of you. <br>
<br>
Go ahead, say I don't life Fire and Fury.  While they arent exactly on my christmas card list i don't go around /rude when I see them or training them, or any other rude event that i could conjour in game.<br>
<br>
Bottom line comes down to the whole situation is pointless. <br>
<br>
You will post opinion, Bako will post here like a innocent &quot;what did you just say Im so innocent i had no idea this happens in guild&quot; followed by Starspun members (moderators too btw) then more FaF members saying yeah, wtf you talking about.<br>
<br>
Blatantly, its getting gay.<br>
<br>
Notice a FaF member made cracks bout going back asking your mom to teach you manners, if i made a crack about someones mom, it'd get locked.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, favortism, damn carries everywhere FaF goes doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Oh btw draiza, yah i'm pointing you out, don't waste your key strokes on my thread.<br>
<br>
Anything you say won't do nothing but make me laugh and dance circles around the level of intelligence you have.<br>
<br>
Hmm...wait your still a Fire and Fury friend, didn't you and your cousin take the site down the original one?<br>
<br>
Oh wait, thats right you're FaF real life friend, and played it all on your cousin, damn sorry forgot bout that.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, this post isn't here to bring you out yapping like a soccer mom at PTA meeting, its meerly here to combine the facts and put em in one nice little post.<br>
<br>
Hell its 4:30 am on Tuesday, I say by 4:30 pm bako makes a post and whines and moderators considering moving or locking it.<br>

Although I always sound like an asshole i'm really not, i do SoW everyone I can and help those that needed.<br>
<br>
As we all know eq is played by humans, or at least our characters our. <br>
<br>
With humans come a nature that carries a chemistry, perspective, and objective with idealogy.<br>
<br>
Sometimes one group of humans (i.e. a guild) do not always stand strong as idealogy, chemistry (attiue comes with chemsitry) and our perspective on things don't combine and mix to the liking of all.<br>
<br>
That may not have been the reason i was removed, but certainly had a hand in many of the actions that have taken place over the past few weeks.<br>
<br>
In life you really only have two options, make a friend, or don't.<br>
<br>
You can't make an enemy, someone has to give you a reason.<br>
<br>
I bear no enemies in EQ, its a game, enemy requires emotional attachment of a stronger passion than just dislike.<br>
<br>
Theres never a reason to hate someone in EQ, just don't go near em and use /ignore if you have to.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to push on as someones enemy or make Fire and Fury look bad.<br>
<br>
They are a capable guild who can prove themselves if they need to, which i don't see why they should, too any amount of people, just like any other guild has that right.<br>
<br>
Again, what we do here in our flames is just draw out more drama than any show TLC can dream of.<br>
<br>
And for what? a 10.54 /mo obsession (i have internet tax its 10.54 for me)<br>
<br>
Get real, either make a friend or dont<br>
<br>
I probably don't have everyone on server for a friend, that's fine.<br>
<br>
But no one is my enemy.<br>

<br>
Belika, was your reference to manners and momma directed at my post?<br>
<br>
If it was you are completely wrong about its intent.  It was a blanket post, not related to guilds, directed at all who lack manners.  Period.<br>
<br>
So I hope you guys dont try to drag a responsible and very appropriate post such as mine into this rift between you all.  There are a lot of us on this server that dont really give gip a rip about the silly guild politics you are all wrestling with.  Many of us came to this server to get away from such things.<br>
<br>
I for one did.  I dont plan to guild soon.  I wont guild untill i have many friends who form one or many friends who are in one already.  I am making friends.  I am making RP enemies, who enjoy RP and we look for each other to duel and /rude each other in fun.  I am treating all other Evil and Evil/neutrals as guild mates basically, giving them what i can and assisting them when I can.<br>
<br>
I think my gaming experience is better for it and I dont have the spam, at all, on my screen.  I like it.<br>
<br>
So I hope you werent referring to my post, but if you were I hope this helps to clear it up.<br>

<br>
   The way I ready Bako's posts, was that he was still friends with a lot of the people who left Fire and fury, whether they left for their own reasons, or otherwise, and didn't want to see people inside or outside the guild ending up with hurt feelings over the whole thing.<br>
<br>
   That's just the way I read it, and the reason I deleted my response from the thread.  If I had to sum it up (my response), it was &quot;I met Belika in game and found him displeasing, and that's why I don't like him&quot;.  But I didn't see any real value in posting that, cuz while I dislike you, I'm not so egotistical to think that everyone should feel the same way, etc.<br>
<br>
   I *do* think you're trying to play Martyr to some degree.  I think your in-game behavior set you up for people not wanting to be in the same guild as you, and whether intentional or not, you're sending out the message that &quot;Fire and Fury have some issues and that's why you left&quot;, and you can't really blame people who like Fire and Fury, board moderator or not, for /assisting them in some fashion or another.<br>
<br>
   I don't have a clue about loot distribution, or hoarding, or ebaying, or whatever with F and F, and can't really comment on it.  What I can comment on is wizards of immense power teleporting across the vastness of time and space just to fetch a couple asp venom sacks for a lowly bard.  I can comment on dragonslaying warriors who still have sense of humor enough to crack a few thong jokes.<br>
<br>
   And.. I can comment on a barbarian shaman from the frozen wastes north of Qeynos, who upon meeting me called me a &quot;fucking ninjalooting bitch&quot; for looting scythes of some rotting specters corpses that the shaman's own guildmates told me I was welcome to, and told me to get the hell out of the zone before he petitioned the gods above to have me removed from the game.<br>
<br>
   So you're more than welcome to state that there's a bias, and that because several of the moderators are in Starspun, that friends of starspun get treated better on the boards, and vice versa for the enemies, but I don't see how moving flame ridden posts about in-game stuff from &quot;off-topic&quot; to &quot;Soapbox&quot; qualifies as favoritism.  The thread wasn't locked, it was just moved to a forum more appropriate for non-stop bitch sessions.  If all your threads were getting locked or something, I might see your point.<br>
<br>
   Likewise, I don't see why if the board mods are taking the time from their schedules to moderate these forums, they should be expected not to post.  If one of the board mods disagrees with you, or your opinion... so what?  Get over it, etc.<br>

In other words, when the threads deteriorate from being of interest to anyone on the server, except the people screaming back and forth at one another, at which point they can just as easily carry on the heated discussion over e-mail because no one else cares.<br>

   I caused a train in there ONCE, and only once, and it was 6 hours before you showed up.  I shadowstepped down the gorge not knowing what was in the gorge, and trained some stuff on the way out.  I killed Biacicia, and disrupted Akane's levelling.  It was an accident, and one for which I apologized to both, and offered to mana slave for a while or whatever.  <br>

   I caused *ZERO* other trains, and had already told Akane that if by some twist of fate I somehow DID manage to aggro one of the phantoms who were unable to see through my invisibility, I would just die so I wouldn't train them (I had no idea anyone was down there originally or I wouldn't have even trained the first time).<br>
<br>
   Subsequent trains were being caused by travellers running down the highpass ramp.  They were aggroing the graveyard knights that spawned in the stone towers, but running past because they had spirit of the wolf on.  When they crossed the stone bridge, the graveyard knights would run down one side of the gorge, and up the other, picking up graveyard phantoms along the way.  The phantoms would then run all the way down the ramp, and loop back through the bottom of the gorge.  <br>
<br>
   If you had been paying five fucking seconds worth of attention you, like every other damn person in the gorge, could have easily seen the pattern, instead of assuming that my walking around invisible was somehow aggroing monsters onto you.<br>
<br>
   As far as the looting, after the train happened, I stuck around to help drag some corpses for several FaF members that got killed by someone else's train.  Dragging them over to Akane left a large cluster of FaF folks standing around chatting, etc.  I'd noticed that several phantom corpses were rotting, and asked a few (Kritical and Wingly), if they minded if I looted.  They said just to make sure they looted the corpse first, especially in big fights where a corpse might become lootable but they hadn't had a chance to get to it yet.  I had assumed that they were speaking for both groups, since everyone was in the same guild.  <br>
<br>
   About 3 hours later, you showed up, and told me to &quot;go the hell away before I train you&quot;.  I told you the phantoms didn't see invisible, and I was conning everything just in case one did, to which you gave no reply.  I assumed that was your pissy-ass way of saying &quot;whatever&quot;.<br>
<br>
   My apologies that Wingly &amp; Kritical weren't speaking for your group, but this wasn't something voiced to me until you and Akane started swearing like sailors.  You could've just said &quot;Hey, we know you have invisibility and things look safe, but things can still happen and we really don't want to get trained again&quot;, and I would've gladly left the area.  Instead you just started calling me a bitch, threatening to petition, calling me a thief trying to steal your items, etc.<br>
 <br>
   So anyways, my apologies that my not psychically knowing that high 30's monsters had been added to a normally safe spot of a gorge, and accidentally training someone that was NOT you, and making the mistake of assuming that just because Fire and Fury had some nice, sociable people in it that everyone was (until they kicked your ass out).<br>
<br>
    Please accept my dearest apologies, because you must know that in my heart of hearts, I am certainly NOT wishing that I *HAD* trained the holy hell out of you and your bitchy gnome friend's double-account asses knowing full well that I could've easily told GMs that I was just trying to deliver mail and had no idea I was aggroing stuff below the ramp and gotten away with delevelling your bitchy, whiny, punk ass characters down a notch or two, instead of just milling around over on the west side, invisible, picking up some unwanted trash that to a character of my level was worth a lot.<br>

It's very easy to start yer own board, Belika, if you'd like, e-mail me and I'll walk you through the process.<br>
<br>
Freedom of speech is a lame argument on a privately run board. Really. <p><center><a href="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/index.htm"><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar1.gif"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=147.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=147.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=147.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=147.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=147.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
