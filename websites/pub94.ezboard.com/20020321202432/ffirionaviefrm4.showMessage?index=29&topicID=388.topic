 Try reading the full post before you post a reply moron. No one killed anything for me. I am a rogue I can sneak/hide. Have you ever been to Guk? Do you know what sneak/hide does? I unlike you know that I can not PP a magic item. I was checking the spawn because I had one other option at hand. Had you read all the posts here then maybe things would be clear. <br>
<br>
  I usually dont flame people either, but when you post stupid shit that does not apply to what happened because you were to lazy or stupid to read all the posts in a thread well, then, you deserve what you get. Assinine? Let me tell you what assinine is.... It is uninformed idiots posting on on subject they did not bother to read.<br>

<br>
 Look where I came from if people are cool to you then you are cool them. Otherwise fook them.<br>
<br>
 You have to realize that what YOU have determined the right way to respond to people is not the only way to respond. Just because someone becomes &quot;aggressive&quot; (as you put it) does not automatically mean they are guilty or wrong. If you look back at the post and re-read them carefully with an open mind I think you will see. If you notice the first reply told me I was wrong but it was done with respect. The second post calls me a name that in this game is (to me) worse then ninja looter. So please try to have an open mind and read the first reply and then my reply to his post. <br>

Barbarians are not kos in upper guk so that shouldnt have been a problem (exept for spider). You make it sound like some sort of acomplishment. Any noob with a map can basicly walk thier happy ass to lower guk and stand inside the zone to LORE BEG (I like that Bjond thanks for the new word). And I did read your entire post and found it lacking in coherant thought for the most part. Your just like the newbies that beg platinum from anyone over lvl 4. Then get pissed off when they dont get it. The only differance beetween you and them is that you were stupid enough to post your displeasure on the board.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also no matter how much you try to justify it. Walking up to the assasin while sneak/hideing in Lower guk at lvl 17 is just idiotic. And im sorry going there to &quot;talk&quot; to the people that you already insulted isn't a valid reason. It just goes to solidify the point of veiw of everyone here that you are a moron. The reason you went there isn't the issue though (no matter how assinine it was) its the fact that your dumb ass actually somthing that stupid that is funny. If I were you i would just accept that you did somthing stupid and move on.<br>

<br>
I read it to be offering potential insight into what might have been on the minds of those you were dealing with.  I did not read it as an attack on you in any way all.<br>
<br>
You read it differently I gather, and your response seemed defensive.  I didn't think there was any reason to be defensive because you weren't &quot;called out&quot; (perhaps later you were but I believe that those are more a reaction to your response to bjond.  If you hadn't gone there you would've found better natured responses, IMO).  That you decided you had been called out makes me wonder why you were so defensive.  Further it makes me wonder if, unintentionally something in your approach with the group with the mask put them off and a price tag got added.  Text is a strange way to interact and tone and inflection can be troublesome and cause miscommunications.<br>
<br>
Without digging back through all the details (which I won't), my general impression has been that you have been overly sensitive and defensive.  And when I meet people who are overly defensive I tend to wonder why that are behaving that way.<br>
