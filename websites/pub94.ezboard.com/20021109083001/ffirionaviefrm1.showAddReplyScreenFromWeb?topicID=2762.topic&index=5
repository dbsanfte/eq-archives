<br>
Back when Hate first opened they had a huge Dark elf invasion in Kithicore and Rivervale. A lot of people werent happy when they logged on and were killed in the &quot;safehaven&quot; of Rivervale by Dark elf invaders. Several times in some cases before they were wise enough to turn off EQ.<br>
<br>
The design of the newbie lands and bind points dont make for a very efficient means to allow an &quot;Invasion&quot; without pissing off whom ever is bound there. No matter how much advance notice you give, someone will miss the news. Hell people dont even read patch info. How many times have you had some illiterate asking in game about a change on patch day that was clearly discussed by the patch message?<br>
<br>
The solution is to talk all you want about conquering the world and understanding that in the scope of the game it wont happen.<br>
<br>
The history is there, just remember you cant make it do anything in the future. Use it to create your story realizing that while you make the story it cant effect the future in any meaningful way except within the realm of the scope of your character. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 932<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/20/02 1:50:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Actually, I was thinking more about ..</span><hr size=1> ..

<br>
I think that guy who put that big 'war of the gods' picture together was really on to something.  Even if he wasn't all right, so what?  It's still great fiction, and there's definitely more to come.<br>
<br>
Also, Enedlithien hit it on the head when she said that the EQ writers have to unravel the story slowly to give players the chance to participate in it.  If some new quest appears which is some new piece of the big picture it'll take a while for players to do it and catch on.  After that they might take the next step with the story.<br>
<br>
As for the game being too static, it's for the previous reason that we need to be a bit patient.  However, you can just go along with some part of the story line or make one up, and go with it.  Iksar can go ahead and battle for control of Norrath.  Empires weren't built in a day.  It could be that you'll wake up one day and find an Iksar camp on Faydwer.  Who knows?<br>
<br>
The point is there is a story.  It just unravels slowly. <p><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=169421">Trevian</A><br>

<br>
This was taken from the pages of the EQ RPG published by White Wolf last month. So apparently half elves aren't sterile.<br>
<br>
But a few points must be considered here. VI has done a terrible job of presenting material for players to make back stories. Are dark elves inherently evil or is cultural? How do young gnomes get recruited into necromancy? What code, if any, do paladins follow? Normally I wouldn't even attempt to build a character in a pen and paper RPG on the scant information a new player can find about Norrath.<br>
<br>
How much do you officialy know about your race? How much did you know the first day you started playing? Do you know who governs your toon's hometown? Do you know how to find out? Your toon's race's lifespan? When did your toon reach adulthood? So many basics have been left out.<br>
<br>
I also have to agree, EQs stories have come to a standstill. Or at least that's partially correct. New zones might add to the story, but I doubt Sony will do anything to move any of the old stories along. <br>
<br>
It wouldn't be impossible to have the militia take over North Freeport. Move all the NPCs connected to the temple to an outpost somewhere (a change to Ro, or add a zone off of Ro). Anyone who was bound in North Freeport would now be bound where ever the temple was moved to. Yes, this would take a little work, but that is what the game is supposed to be like.<br>
<br>
If VI had been changing their world more often, we would have gotten used to it by now, and learned to look out for potenial political changes. This would have added a new dimension to the game.<br>

<br>
Thank you for getting me thinking about something. The Spurned, aka all casters save necros, can worship Innoruuk, but may not. Necros MUST.<br>
<br>
The 1st light site that has alot of info., talks about how the Shissar(Sp?) taught magery to the Teir'dal. They were the first casters among thier ilk.<br>
<br>
Now the current King and Queen are ones who took up the name Thex, but are not of that blood. Some say the Queen was taught necromancy by Innoruuk, hence the must worship thing. Innoruuk is the source of necromatic power for the Teir'dal. <br>
<br>
Now supposedly the spurned are called that because after necromancy arose they were cast down from the place of primary power.The necros made a power bid and won basically.<br>
<br>
If you note the asian flavor of the lodge of the dead this holds yet another rumor, that the art of necromancy was put into the culture by Dragons.<br>
<br>
You should read the history of Mayong Mistmoor on the site, its good.<br>
<br>
I don't think Innoruuk created dark elves in the proper use of the word. When you create one its says their race REGARDS him as the father. I think the Teir'dals corruption was  an evolution, from magery to necromancy and Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Perhaps Innoruuk was the first God of the elven people, but when they came up from the earth they were seduced by the surface world and Tunare. Maybe this angered Innoruuk and produced the warring cultures you see today. Some that stayed with Him, and the ones that left.<br>
<br>
I know the history says he tortured the first elven king and queen twisting them to his image etc. I think however that is a metaphor that speaks to what the art and worship has done to the people over time.<br>
<br>
I know this is off to a degree and certainly incomplete, but I think I am on to something. I know my character in game believes this, that the creation story is a myth and metaphorical.<br>
<br>
Anyway thats something to think about., heck I never knew what all those rays coming out of snake heads meant in 3rd gate and on the doors of najena for example. Its the Shissar, the masters of magic who taught the dark elves magery.<br>
<br>
Outside of the game we must attribute meaning to life and decide what to believe and whatnot. I think its a good idea for Teir'dal , for example, to develope contrasting ideas on framework of the game history.<br>

The whole thing depends on whether or not the Shissar did indeed join the Combine Empire, or if the Combine were even around before the Shissar were vanquished (Kunark's and the rest of Norrath's history are told in different measurings of time--Norrath in standard years, Kunark in Iksar years [A.G. being the latest ere, &quot;After Green&quot;]).  If they didn't, then there's no reason to think that the Dark Elves learned it from them.  <br>
<br>
I've always believed that the Dark Elves learned it through their own dealings and experimentations.  I know that the Iksar learned all of the Arcane magics from old Shissar texts (Yes, they know Magery, Enchantry and Wizardry-those are just considered heretical arts by the Empire, and so are only practiced by the forsaken or in secret).  But the Tier'Dal, Trolls, Ogres, and Humans could just as easily have stumbled across it as they did the other schools of magic. <p><center><b>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</b></center><br><center>Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</center><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953"><i>Inspect Kelisk?</i></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 12:19:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.atlantic.net/~tukka/glowhand.jpg height=44 width=44></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was the original poster</span><hr size=1> Kreelos makes a lot of good points, and its partially for these reasons that I don't think that Verant has built a really solid foundation on which for us to create characters to roleplay.<br>
<br>
Some very basic facts about the nature of Norrath's races and Norrath itself have been omitted.  In addition to the things he mentioned, there is nothing that I've read in any EQ history or lore that explains the nature of death in Norrath, and why and how people come back to life always after being slain, and how and why NPCs respawn, and how to reconcile the respawning of NPCs and PCs with historic deaths (like Ganak's death.)  Why do some people die and are never seen again, while others die and come back in a few minutes, while others die to be trapped in some other form (undead, ect.)<br>
<br>
If you want a look at a backstory that is coherant, consistent and well written, that does a good job (as far as I can tell, without having actually played the game) of covering all the bases, look at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com">Shadowbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
I think that on top of these missing facts, the static nature of the world does not help one bit either.  But a static world is okay, what I don't like is the fact that there are so many quests and named NPCs.  The way things are presented to you when you are doing a quest makes it sound like the quest has never been done before, and that when it is done, it shall never have to be done again, and in some cases quests are presented to you as if they will have some monumental, lasting significance.  Of course the reality is that this is not the case at all.  All of your deeds will wiped clean and forgotten within 20 minutes to 1 week of their having been done.<br>
<br>
To me, this is very non-conducive to the roleplay atmosphere of a game.  If makes me feel as if any interaction I have with the game environment and NPCs is pointless, and it promotes the mentality (even among roleplayers) that these quests and deeds are merely about the gameplay challenge of completing them and the reward (usually in the form of an item) you get for completing them.<br>
<br>
And I think that the way people treat and interact with the NPC representations of the &quot;game world&quot; will inevitably reflect on the way their interact with fellow players... as players rather than roleplayers or characters in a living world.<br>
<br>
With an effort, you can buck the trend, create your own backstory, overlook the lack of basic facts that you may have about your character's race, or the nature of the world itself and try to play around them, and roleplay... but for myself (and most others) it seems more effort than its worth.  Other games I have planed (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.gemstone.net">GemStone III</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for one) made it a lot easier for me to get into character and stay in character.<br>
<br>
This is the measure I use to determine whether or not the cohesiveness and continuity and details of a game's backstory is worth anything to a roleplayer.  The fact that histories and stories exist, even in volumes, does not matter.  It doesn't even matter if those stories are very interesting to read.  What matters is how conducive the world is to roleplaying, and whether or not it encourages it, and makes it easy for someone who isn't a diehard roleplayer or someone who is new to roleplaying, because a diehard roleplayer can roleplay anywhere there's other roleplayers. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

<br>
I rather like the idea of people using the raw materials to build a character perspective. <br>
<br>
I do NOT and never have, liked the idea that we(Teir'dal) were created evil and thats just how it is. I want a reason to hate, a reason to be twisted, greater than I just can't help it.<br>
<br>
Some of the history implies that the Teir'dal left the combine empire, and turned on the others because they other races, non dark, could not tolerate the 'evil' crafts like necromancy.<br>
<br>
In any case, what I create out of the mess of verants history will be to liven things up, and to give my characters a unique perspective. I think the official story of any game should never assert THIS is the exact truth when speaking towards mystical things, gods or magics. It adds so much when there are rumors, or information that you have interpet and use. I like gradual disclosure and plot twists, in my 'history'.<br>
<br>
That being said its all for fun, You will see these things popping up in my characters, history/past, on the bard for a day board.<br>
<br>
Its alot of fun, at least to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/22/02 6:06:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Shissar were never around at the time of the Combine Empire. Remember the Combine Empire formed after the first war of the gods which ended with the banishment of all of Rallos Zek's armies which included the Shissar. In the waking vengeance of the gods, Luclin appeared and gave the Shissar and offering where they were spared destruction. They now sit in their temple nestled in the Grey. What remained thereafter were twisted and left dulled much like the ogres. They are what are referred to as the Lizard Men of Norrath. You'll note that all Iksar start with Lizard man as a language, and their masters were the Shissar.<br>
<br>
As to the Teir'Dal inheriting magic from the Shissar. Take a note where the spires sit, which of course were the creations of the Shissar which were how Rallos Zek was so easily able to transport his armies across norrath. One of those spires sits in Greater Faydark which was also the former home of Carthael. it's remains sit underneath Felwith at the end of the War of the Broken Crown. Portents of this can be traced back to Tserrina's Tower. Remember also the Erudites learned Necromancy from the Teir'Dal, through Miragul who learned it from Tserrina. When the Teir'Dal entered into the Combine Empire, magic was then spread throughout the unified races to those whom could understand of it.<br>
<br>
As to Sony and RP...Sony doesn't care. Did anyone read the post on <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fbattleforgedfrm1">pub95.ezboard.com/fbattleforgedfrm1</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> yet? You'll notice some former VI/SOE staff post in there as well. Why do you think it is that so many of the older people have left? That is exactly why. Sony does not care. There is nothing worse then a company being in charge of a business that they have no concept of whatsoever.<br>
<br>
If they did, EQ would be the game it was meant to be. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 1067<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/22/02 9:57:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Elves</span><hr size=1> Tunare created the Elves. She is the mother of all, espically her children, the Elves. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk took the Elvish King and Queen, Twisted them over a long ass peroid of time, and sent them back. They were the First Tier'dal, those two corrupted others and soon more Tier'dal started poping up, the Tier'dal move over to Fay where as the original Elves stay in the Forest that is now the Desert of Ro..<br>
The Tier'dal build a city there, named Carthage. (I think thats the name). They rule over there for a while.. where as the Woodelves run into some trouble. Soluseck Ro got bored so he burned their forest down to ashes, hence the Desert of Ro.<br>
<br>
The Woodelves Fled, attacked the Tier'dal port city, which is now Freeport, wacked that city, took some boats, sailed across the Sea, and beat down the Tier'dal who were busy fighting against themselves and took over the Captial known as Carthage, now known as Felwithe.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk saved his corrupted children by opening a passage underground. They traveled underground for a while, reapearing in what is now known Neriak.<br>
<br>
This is where the Tier'dal started becomming blue.<br>
<br>
So Tunare Made the Elves, Innoruuk corrupted em. I think the funniest part of this story is that the Woodelves ended up being the evil and the Tier'dal just got whaled on.<br>
<br>
Kinda neat. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif" WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="110"></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
