<br>
I didn't expect that we'd have people come here that weren't interested in Roleplaying at all, to tell the truth. I had high hopes that everyone would Roleplay, and that the storyline in the game would be furthered.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER<br>
<br>
This STILL is the best server for roleplay in the game. I've learned so much more from the people here, Banegrivm included, about the storyline, and how to heighten my Roleplay and get better at it. ALOT of the people here do truely roleplay, and they understand enought not to take it IRL.<br>
<br>
Their is nothing more fun to me in this game to log on, have a huge battle against a Woodelven Ranger, Log off and brag to him how my char owned him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , or vice versa over dinner or somethin.<br>
<br>
So yeah, the Server is ok.<br>

<br>
RP is thinning out overall. It is much easier to play the game then to RP it (perhaps more interresting also due to the game design, read this game should be named EverLoot), so many are RPing less then before.<br>
We are becoming a blue server with low population and a very nice no NO DROP rule. Very convenient for raiding and hmmmm, Loot.<br>
/agree Zarziss, i think we only see a better side of toons because we have a lower population but this will change<br>
<br>
However,<br>
It is (in my opinion) by far the best server out there.<br>

<br>
FV is still great, mainly because of the community , low population, 1 chr limit, but it does seem to have gone a little down hill on the rp from when it started (not intending to be all doom and gloom there is still a lot of rp if you look for it, just when we all started in the begining it was EVERYWHERE)<br>
<br>
For me the patch removing alignments and allowing all zone shouts/auctions impaired the atmosphere as did (although they are good as well) the channels and language changes.<br>
<br>
to quote an old addage 'if it aint broke dont fix it' but thats what they did , not because it was broke but becuase it wasnt as popular as theyd liked.<br>
<br>
Now im the first to admit i dont rp much, i would like to but its rare i get the time or the feel of being immersed in it from constant ooc tells etc, not a rant either but sometimes i wish i could turn tells off (not go afk and keep playing as theyd still be there) and get the immersive experience it was to begin with with the grping/lack of channels/language restrictions and everyone rping<br>
<br>
hmmm bit of a ramble to sum up FV is still great! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=268072>Blayze Meduenin</a> Human cleric of Erollisi Marr of the 52nd prayer, League of Honour (Firiona Vie)<br>Smithing 248, Jewelcraft 200, Fletching 200, Pottery 200, Baking 200, Brewing 200, Fishing 200, Tailoring 188</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaillougna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/15/02 2:04:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1199.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: My 2 cps</span><hr size=1> I have only been playing since Dec, but started on a blue.  I switched to FV in April and haven't looked back (except to occassionally offer to a friend who has never seen blue to take him there &amp; twink him a bit... I wan't past 23, but got a nice about of stuff and money dumped on a character there).  <br>
<br>
Even though I wasn't here long before the nerfing patch, I miss the tougher language learning, the limited shout and auction (though I have auction off anyway), and the alignment.  I don't think they needed to keep the alignment restrictions and think giving pure choice to the player and character is good, but... they didn't have to take away the alignments for the appearance sake /cry.  <br>
<br>
I have been hit by TLC and I still think it is a good thing.  I do like that there is a reason built in to associate with a younger crowd even if it is for a mercenary reason.  Give a young one a quest and offer a prize (other than money) and faction (with you and your guild) increase at it's conclusion.<br>
<br>
Lack of No Drop... I was more frustrated by No Drop on my old server than I have ever been by TLC here.  Just like chosing to join forces with whom you think is right, so too should you be able to give goods to someone as you deem appropriate.<br>
<br>
Maturity... this server does tend to have a more mature, creative set.  Whether or not it is the majority, it is the set with whom I wish to associate.  I have been impressed by the bright minds here.  This board is like a higher subset of the server, populated by the cream of the cream.<br>
<br>
The encrochment of blue.... *sigh*.  All I can do is sigh.  I have no words to describe my sadness.<br>

I actually came to this server with a friend from my last cause we wanted to see what it was like, I only logged onto my old server twice since then. I had just came back from a long break from EQ and many of my friends there had left or where considering leaving. <br>
<br>
TLC was a bit of a challenge, but having researched my epic turned it into a long quest which I started back in my 20s. Nothing more fun then camping (solo)  the Blazing Elementals and Effretti in SolA while there where still Lightblue just to beat TLC.<br>
<br>
I will openly admit I dont roleplay all the time when playing, but when aproached by someone roleplaying its always nice to be able to have a good time RPing without worrying about people thinking you are nuts.<br>
<br>
Overall the population of this server is pretty good, nice, mature, courteus people. Though you will run into people now and again that you dont agree with or dislike, its going to happen anyplace, its just human, we are all different.<br>
<br>
Always a pleasure chatting with people, escpecially fellow magicians, any magicians out there with any questions feel free to toss me a tell, always a pleasure to help out when I can.<br>

Mainly lower levels, true, but the'yll get up here.<br>

Personally, I think it should have been RP mandatory in the first place, and screw anyone who isn't willing to do that.  But that's me. <p>-----------------------------<BR><A HREF='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438' target=new>Rhatha Sha`Naya</A> and Swiftclaw <BR>
