With her ears and whiskers flat back, she slinked behind the closest boulder she could find - making sure to keep out of smell's reach. One. Two. Three. Three mutts she counted just on the outside of the den. But mutts were like Elves. They bred faster than anything she knew of, which meant there were many, many more inside. She'd have to be careful.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aroorooroo!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahnmei's fur bristled violently at the howl of warning. It saw her! She wasn't ready! She dug her feet into the dirt to spring back and away to safety. Too late for her. The alert was sounded and gnolls were coming at her from all directions. Too late indeed.<br>
<br>
Fade to black...<br>
<br>
A glimmer of light...<br>
<br>
Ahnmei opened an eye. She couldn't feel it, but the other was too caked with matted fur, mud, and blood to open. In the fuzziness that was her sight, all she could make out were swaying treetops slowly drifting by. She barely felt the soft grass that brushed against her fur. A low, rumbling growl that sounded unlike her own scratched her throat. Her pounding headache and nausea sent her reeling into the dark again.<br>
<br>
Waking into a nightmare...<br>
<br>
A loud cry of pain echoed throughout the apartment, which prompted a hasty rush of feet towards the sound. Ahnmei wept bitterly as the caregiver tried to comfort her. The Shir couldn't stand the pain; so much heat radiated from her body; her wounds screamed for soothing. Something thick filled her mouth and nose before her eyes rolled back into her head. The darkness embraced her again.<br>
<br>
Passing fancies...<br>
<br>
Images of Momma's smile, faint sounds of her laugh - pleasant passages of family time warmed Ahnmei's dreams. Momma brought her snout close to her daughter's and licked her nose playfully. Her tail wrapped around her waist as she danced with her kit. Momma pulled away as she waved and smiled. &quot;Bye bye, baby. Bye bye.&quot; She waved happily as Ahnmei tried to reach for her. &quot;Don't go, Momma! Please, Momma. Stay! Momma, don't leave me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahnmei woke with a start; both eyes open now. She shielded her swollen forehead from the blinding light of the moon. The treetops drifted by again, but the foliage was different. No grass brushed her fur either; this time it was weeds and small rocks. She tried to turn her head to see who was pulling her, but when she did, a sharp spike of heat raced down her side. She'd not try that again, by Vah! Still too weak, and still in pain, she could feel sleep coming back to visit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ahnmei>Ahnmei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 11:54:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=912.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Blessed by Spirits</span><hr size=1> “Ahnmei, dear, can you hear me?”<br>
<br>
Her eyelids slowly flickered open. “Mmmhmm. Wha…what happened?” She sat up cautiously, immediately placing her paw above her left eye, which was still tender and throbbing with warm soreness. The hazy black circle around her vision crept away as her sights centered on a massive fluff of gray fur. <br>
<br>
“It’s alright, dear. There, there. Easy now.” The elder Shir gave her the once over before handing her a cup of hot, medicinal tea. “You had quite a nasty run in with some gnolls. Again. I’m surprised you lived because…” His voice became distant as vivid images of growling, foaming-at-the-mouth dogs snapped and bit at her, mimicking in her mind the tale she was hearing. Just how did she manage to escape, she wondered. By the Spirits of Vah, there had been so many… <br>
<br>
She sipped her tea, trying to regain some composure to focus on what was being said. “You were lucky, gal. Had it not been for the Ranger passing through the burrow on his way to Halas, you’d have surely died.” He brushed some white flakes from the pale fur around her nose. “Drink it all. It should clear up the rest of your rabies.”<br>
<br>
Ahnmei’s lips curled around her cup into a quivering snarl. “Well that’s just great. Now I owe debt to a bloody Tunarian, tree hugging, Elf. He should’ve just let me go mad and die!” <br>
<br>
The elder chuckled quietly at the ruffled, young feline. “You must’ve gotten a much harder knock on that noggin of yours than I thought if you can’t tell an Elf from a Human. Now just calm yourself before you have another fit.” Ahnmei’s demeanor softened somewhat as she mumbled under her breath “Probably still a tree hugger. Trees are for scratching one’s back and sharpening claws. Everybody knows that.” She rolled her eyes and sipped up the last of her tea before lying back to have her dried wounds fussed over.  <br>
<br>
The elder drew in a deep breath as the now quiet Ahnmei flinched under his careful touch. His eyebrows pointed down into a sharp V. “Why were you even so far from home? If you want to kill dogs, there are plenty in the Moors.” <br>
<br>
Ahnmei’s voice was barely a whisper, “I thought they were weaker down there.” <br>
<br>
“Well it’s obvious they aren’t.” He sighed and kissed her head tenderly. “I know you want revenge, dear. I do, too, but you’re going to get yourself killed one day. This time, your mother’s spirit smiled upon you. Next time, and I know there will be a next time, she may not be there to help.”<br>
<br>
Ahnmei had heard similar speeches already, although before, she wasn’t nearly as hurt as this. Still, she disregarded the lecture just as she had all the others. It was her choice to hate mutts. It was her choice to kill them on sight. It was her choice to miss her mother so badly that she’d rather die than see another barking creature walk Norrath. Her mother didn’t have any choices, which was why Ahnmei’s heart filled with a deep seeded fury. They had to pay for their murder, and pay they would. Not even her mother’s paranormal plea for her daughter’s safety could keep the young Shir from seeking justice.<br>
<br>
When her wounds were freshly dressed, Ahnmei nuzzled under the covers to doze off. Her heavy eyelids blocked out the light and his voice began to trail off again. “Rest up all you can. You’ll need it. If you’re that adamant about your…mission, you’ll at least need some excelled training, new armors (now that your old ones are in shreds), and something better than a sharp stick. Thank Vah your mother’s spirit is active so she can watch over you and tell me what’s happening. I don’t know what I’d do if I lost you, too…” <br>
<br>
With a defiant snort and a weak “Love you, Papa”, Ahnmei was out for the count.<br>

Glad to see you're up and about, puss. You sure look a whole lot better. Hey, are you busy this afternoon? We have to meet some very important people later.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ahnmei blinked at her father. What was he up to now? Meet people? He didn't mention anything about meeting anybody until now. &quot;I don't have any plans, Papa.&quot; She cocked her head sideways and gave him a curious glance. &quot;Who are we meeting with?&quot; <br>
<br>
His broad grin faded just a bit, a touch of worry seeped into his eyes. His quick flash of a false smile didn't hide the fact that she saw it. &quot;We...well, it's a surprise. Just be ready to go after lunch. And look your best!&quot; He threw on his cloak and hurried out the door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ahnmei>Ahnmei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/25/03 8:33:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=912.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.knology.net/~ahnmei/Vahicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Finis</span><hr size=1> Had Ahnmei known that she’d be presented to King Raja Kerrath, she would’ve ran away as soon as her father had left the house earlier that day! What was he thinking? Why was she even here? The butterflies in her belly where flying in tight circles so fast it almost made her sick. As they spoke quietly near the throne, she stroked the fur on her tail; a bad habit she acquired as a small child - for when she was nervous or scared. <br>
<br>
Ahnmei’s father bowed before the King before approaching his bewildered daughter, who was busy trying to make a bald spot on her tail’s tip. She gave King Raja a clumsy curtsey as her father pulled her elbow to take her away. <br>
<br>
He was leading her down a richly decorated hallway in the Palace when she stopped in her tracks. “Papa!” she hissed. “What was that all about? What’s going on?” She was almost in tears with confusion. “It’s obvious you two were discussing something about me, because you two kept looking at me. Tell me!” She stomped a defiant foot on the plush carpet. <br>
<br>
His furry eyebrows arched then fell as he let out a deep, growling sigh. “I can’t just now, puss. Have a little faith in your Papa. Please…come with me.” Ahnmei’s maw clamped shut tightly; she was obviously very disturbed, but trusted her father. He placed a graying paw on her back as he led her further down the hallway, down past the Scribe Shop, and into the Spiritist’s Quarters. <br>
<br>
“Ahh, Mr. Jin Mir’ Sher, and you must be Ahnmei. Please, come in.” Spiritist Cholsa greeted the pair with a warm smile as she welcomed them. Ahnmei wrinkled her nose at the assault of pungent incense, but remained silent as she sat down next to her father. <br>
<br>
Two older Vah Shir males introduced themselves as a Spiritist Grawleh and Rahleh. Grawleh, appearing to be the Eldest and most respected of the three, took Ahnmei by the paws, coaxing her to stand up. He walked around her in a tight circle, looking her up and down. Ahnmei’s tail automatically went into her paws again as she cast a worried look towards her father. <br>
<br>
Spiritist Grawleh stopped his encirclement to look Ahnmei in the face. “Your father has requested our aid. Do you have any idea why?” <br>
<br>
“N…no, sir.” <br>
<br>
“He says you’re unruly, that you don’t heed warnings from your dead mother and from himself about your safety. He says that you are on a personal mission, but are not properly suited to fulfill it. He says he can’t control your actions any more. Is this true?” <br>
<br>
Ahnmei glared at her father for a second, then cast her eyes to the floor. Her ears flicked with embarrassment. “Yes, sir. It’s all true, I guess, ‘cept I was doing just fine until the other day…”<br>
<br>
Grawleh cut her off, “By the King’s orders and your father’s, from this moment forward, you now belong to the Dar Khura sect. Are you aware of what that entails?” <br>
<br>
Ahnmei’s eyes grew big with curiosity. “Does that mean I have to learn silly magics, and light candles and stuff when I could be out hunting mutts?”<br>
<br>
The whole room tensed as Grawleh’s fur bristled. He bared his fangs to the young Vah Shir, getting dangerously close to her face. “Don’t you EVER say such a thing again! Do you think your mother’s spiritual presence is silly? Do you think being able to heal yourself after near death from a fight is silly? Do you think helping others is silly?” Ahnmei shook her head slowly and gulped hard. “You belong to this House. You will study the arts of the Dar Khura to the BEST of your abilities alongside the King’s son, and you will join his Pride Pack to learn some humility and responsibility. You will only be allowed to live at home with your father as long as you behave and follow the rules. This is my word, your father’s word, and most importantly, the King’s word!” <br>
<br>
The young Vah Shir sobbed quietly and nodded her head. How could her father do this to her? Did he not love her? She was thoroughly cross with him. He sensed her frustration and stood to leave after whispering an emotional “Goodbye and good luck.” <br>
<br>
It was at the time of his departure when a heavily plate-clad Vah Shir entered the Quarter. He was introduced to her as Sekayn, leader and champion of the Pride known as the Chosen of Vah. <br>
<br>
This marked the beginning of Ahnmei’s new life as a Chosen Dar Khura. <br>
