And I must say that my attitude has been changed some, I've become a bit more moderate, and if Verant isn't willing to enforce their own rules, and the game has a history of certain types of EULA violations being allowable, then I'm willing to bend a bit.  I hope this doesn't compromise my sense of integrity thereby. <br>
<br>
Heagan makes some darn good points in this thread, and so does Fuvi, others have made good points in other threads, on several sides of the arguments about  EULA violations.<br>
<br>
And I'm still a noob, only been in EQ since October, and I learn new things everyday, both in the game and about the game. <br>
<br>
I try to not give up on people, even if I take a break sometimes.  People can and will continually surprise you, in both directions.  I form opinions and I dare to make judgements, but I can also be effectively argued with, talked to, and often I can learn things that I didn't know before. <br>
<br>
I'm not so open minded that my brains fall out on the sidewalk, but sometimes I do have to be reminded to open the window a bit and peak out again when I fall into a set pattern of behavior and thought.  No one, not me, no one, is so awful that they can't be redeemed, can't grow, learn, change, or adapt. <br>
<br>
It's not always worth your trouble to work with someone, no.  You have to have enough investment sometimes that you're willing to continue to deal with something.  <br>
<br>
I'm here, in the game, and on these boards, because I enjoy playing a game.  I like keeping good company with folk, I like role-playing a bit, getting experience and seeing stuff, and I am unabashedly a fashion junkie in addition to getting excited when I get to wear a piece of loot I've never even heard of, never mind seen before. <br>
I'm certainly not here to make money, lol, and this place isn't organized enough for me to care about competition as a thing in itself.  When I want competition, I go play a competitive game, and kick someone's ass on the chessboard, or in a boardgame or, or with cards. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm now officially rambling, so I'll stop.  Just a few random thoughts from the mind of Ayida's player. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uastutus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>astutus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/02 10:10:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1248.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Where's the Beef?</span><hr size=1> Integrity simply means holding fast to a moral/ethical code. Just because you don't agree with someone's ethical code doesn't mean the person with whom you disagree has more or less integrity. &quot;You keep using that word (integrity); I do not think it means what you think it means&quot;<br>
<br>
In fact, I'm not even sure what to argue here because integrity seems to show up in every sentence. I think what you are saying is that there are people in AS (but not the whole guild) who think ebaying is wrong but stay anyway to get phat lewtz. It seems likely, however, that the moral code of any such person dictates that the &quot;good&quot; of getting more loot outweighs the &quot;evil&quot; of an ebayed character. So these people do not lack integrity, they just happen to have a different moral code than you.<br>
<br>
All criminals are cowards?<br>
1) Law X requires women to walk 10 feet behind their husband<br>
2) Independant thinking Jane, a person, breaks law X<br>
3) A person that breaks a law is a criminal<br>
--<br>
4) Jane is a criminal<br>
5) All criminals are cowards<br>
--<br>
6) Independant thinking Jane is a coward &lt;-- bog?<br>
<br>
Now if you want to argue about the right/wrongness of ebaying characters then by all means go ahead, but so far the only argument I've seen you put forward about ebay being wrong is that .. well.. rereading now I'm not even sure - here's what you said <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes, buying and selling characters for $$ is wrong, EULA or not. It's called having integrity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I suppose what you means it that buying/selling characters = lack of integrity, but we've already been over that.<br>
<br>
And I do have one final question (and forgive the newbiesh-ness of this question, I'm new to this server), but am I to understand that FnF and Reso don't account share/play other chars/etc.? I mean no disrespect to either guild, simply that they would be the first two 'uber guilds' I'd heard of that didn't.<br>

<br>
I had fun playing a game and continue to do so.  Would I have had more fun if FaF was more aggresive pursuing new targets?  Yes, that's why I brought up my concerns.  If this was a single player game it would be easy to tailor it to my personal preferences, it's not and to enjoy a game vastly more complex that any single player game ever will be there is a compromise of less control over playstyle.  If I thought I'd have more fun playing Civilization III I would do that instead of logging on Everquest.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Besides, to faf's credit they have never willingly, knowingly invited a character to guild that was a result of a cash transaction. <br>
<br>
So cash is your only concern?  If Fuvi was suddenly polite and modest or was simply seen asking Kzan or Caparelli for KEI in the Bazaar you could be fairly certain I'm not playing Fuvi anymore.  If I handled the exchange through emails you would never know that I got 1000 dollars for my toon.  Would you condemn Fuvi II for taking over my account or would you accept him as part of the high end community because he's just a friend of mine that I gave the account to when I quit?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Yes, buying and selling characters for $$ is wrong, EULA or not. It's called having integrity. Credibility. <br>
<br>
Eldraed spent at a guess atleast 1500h (/played 62 days, 12h can you check this Eldraed III?) meaning if he got the 500 dollars he made 33 cents an hour on top of  presumably enjoying the game of Everquest over the course of 6 months.  He actually offered 3 toons in a package deal, 2 on former servers so the played time is actually much higher and pay rate much lower.<br>
<br>
If he played the game with the intention of making money he was unsuccessful by any reasonable standard, using the California minimum wage Eldraed would be worth over $10 000 assuming my guess at play time is accurate.<br>
<br>
People tend to warp things because the fundamental thought process, which I perpetuate by calling the seller Eldraed, is that the toon the CD Key unlocks is somehow a living and vital thing.  This moral wrong you rant about is fundamentally no different from me selling someone my saved Diablo game with a fully equipped character and Insane Level unlocked.  Someone can now play the highest level of Diablo with a character well equipped for it without actually going through the at times tedious and definately time consuming task of getting to that point.<br>
<br>
The fact that you had interactions with George who first played Eldraed and now those interactions would be with Steve somehow finds a way to apparently deeply concern you.  For people who didn't have interactions with George and now will definately not have interactions with Steve because of what they know to be being so concerned is even more baffling.<br>
<br>
Integrity, I got that.  A set of opinions that I stand behind consistently as a loose but accurate definition.  Aamorn covers the point well, we could rant about my integrity again, but that would just get the thread deleted.<br>
<br>
Credibility, got that too.  I'm not posting to get brownie points with AS, I don't need them, they want me in the guild to nuke things, I'm quite sure that no guild wants me as a PR spokesman.  I'm taking an unpopular stance because I believe it's the correct one, if it atleast moderates people from being directly rude to Eldraed III in game the time wasn't entirely wasted, if it actually gets people re-thinking things that's the basic goal, very nice post Ayida.  Without a conceivable reason to post things I didn't believe about EBay players it's the reasonable conclusion that what I posted is what I believe whether you share those beliefs or not.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; AS turns a blind eye for the sake of achievement.<br>
<br>
They accepted a naked SK into the guild with 50 or so AA points, if you think that's the key to achievement you are BADLY mistaken.  He's maybe 10th on the tank order based on what I know of the guild roster and they sure didn't gobble him up for his amazing DPS, he did bring the 3rd ST Key into the guild but problem is that only gets Eldraed into ST, which saves having to Key a necro for corpse summon, certainly a benefit but nothing all that noteworthy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; What's another word for achievement without integrity? Cheating. <br>
<br>
Again how is this cheating, if you accept I could turn my info over to someone in FaF, but that if I turn that info over to someone in AS that AS would be cheating I fail to clearly see your line in the sand, let me kick some more sand over your line, if I guild AS and then turn over my info is this OK?  What if I'm guilded for a month?  If it's because it's against the written and unenforced EULA, so is a lot of account sharing that takes place that you are well aware of Heagan.<br>
<br>
Your concern that the achievement will take place with Steve playing Eldraed, even though he didn't level Eldraed up, along with 20 or 30 other Awakened Souls and possibly guests means that they really didn't kill Vindicator, they exploited him just the same as if Vindi didn't fight back is simply absurd.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; What ever else is going on behind those closed doors we can only imagine, but for the sake of arguement, the only offense we can legitimately point the finger at, where AS is in the wrong, is this.<br>
<br>
There was a quote about making vague and misleading accusations, again that could get the thread deleted though.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Analogy : Al Capone was thrown in jail for tax evasion. He was a criminal with an incredible lack of integrity or credibility except with who was on the wrong side of his guns. He was a coward, as all criminals are at heart.<br>
<br>
Someone tried to compare an email to tampering with the brakes on a car, you're trying to compare the control of an online character to one of the most notorious gangsters in history.  I think both of you try to plant completely unrelated images in the readers mind in order to make a point in place of logical argument.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; AS members who aren't making a stand right now to clean up their guild have cowardly hearts. They forsake integrity for personal gain. They need to make the right choices now before they bring a world of shit down on themselves, and moreover bring about the true unbridled frustrations of the rest of this community.<br>
<br>
It's more defeatism, ennui or laissez faire than cowardice.  They know that people are mostly just gonna post Preach on Brother Heagan because AS = Evil so they don't take a stand, a stand that would for the overwhelming majority be against you Heagan.  I can be rather stubborn so I still post.<br>
<br>
If they believe that EBay characters shouldn't be in the guild they would be forsaking integrity, nothing in your posts I can see will convince anyone of the evil of EBay, you present no arguments against it, you simply give those who already agree with you a chance to say Amen.  <br>
<br>
Personal gain is not a factor, the additional mobs they will be able to kill with Eldraed will not outweigh the amount of loot that Eldraed will be given (already equipped from guild bank, let alone future drops) so it's actually a negative gain for individual members.<br>
<br>
The right choice in a game is always fun, if they can't have fun because the person playing Eldraed didn't level him and instead got to that point with $$, then yes they should leave AS, I don't expect serverside lag from all the /guildremoves going off though.<br>
<br>
The true unbridled frustration would be against George, someone who violated their ethical standards and the frustration of not being able to censor the individual in any way, he might still read the boards meaning he will atleast know he doesn't have your approval.  Attacking Steve for his purchase or other AS members for being guilded with Steve will probably just get you on an ignore list.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; I called Reso's hand on this, among other issues, and they saw I was right. They cleaned up alot and now are not the most reviled guild on FV, altho they aren't very pleased with me about it.<br>
<br>
Resolution violated unenforced rules by circumventing the rules on alignment.  If you think there are people who can't sleep nights because of this travesty on the server I would think you are mistaken.  I still think FaF held down the title as most reviled guild thanks to my posts attacking Banegrivm and taking a hard line stance that we aren't EVIL just because we play more than you do and of course for the training OFF the bridge and the PL in Cazic Thule.  Note that server specific issues will always raise more ire in the community than generic EQ issues.  The server as a whole doesn't even know who the first Myrmidon was let alone much if any of the soap opera surrounding him and although might be amused by some of the stories or perhaps saddened it will never genuinely concern them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Now we're giving AS a chance to clean house. They can make the right decisions and hate me later like Reso did, or suffer the consequences. Personally I would prefer the former, for the sake of every person involved, which is in essence, the entire server. <br>
<br>
Yes, if this issue boils enough AS could get a major PR boost by /guildremoving Eldraed, but they probably have more integrity than betraying a friend who was told he could join them and was certainly a factor in his decision to spend the money and seeing as PL'ing a new toon for Steve isn't a whole lot of fun removing him isn't the right decision by the standards of fun which a few people probably play for.<br>
<br>
I've been playing on the server since Day 1, since Day 14 as a Wizard, I've played a lot and still haven't even met 10 percent of the server.  If you think that I can affect every person on the server with what I decide to do with my toon you are severly mistaken, a toon which George stated was done with levelling who is in guild of friends of similar level is unlikely to interact much with the rest of the server.  How Eldraed's /guildstatus is for the sake of the entire server simply eludes me.<br>
<br>
If it really bothers you don't read threads here and fix in your mind that George reclaimed the account by having password changed and sent to original email address, it's a lie, well atleast it is at the moment, but if you happen to see Eldread in Nexus you can continue to enjoy the game seeing as you think that's really George playing the game who you never met and not Steve playing the game who you never met either, whatever it takes to let you have fun playing a game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usinnaji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sinnaji</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/21/02 12:33:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1248.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Get over it</span><hr size=1> This topic has come up time and again.

Edit: tired when I wrote this pissed off that someone else is complaining again.  But in all respects  to a good percentage of peoplethe end game is about the challenge of taking down a mob, zone, or winning a tourney or some sort and loot.  If no loot dropped from any high-end raid for the next month, you would see many people straying off from the raiding.  Aswell, there are people out there who couldn't care less about loot, and the challenge of raiding.  I do not doubt you are one of those people.

There's a lot of other qualitative stuff, but that's pretty much it for things you can actually measure.  Hmm, let me clarify this.  The end game is all about GETTING loot rather than HAVING it.<br>
<br>
Anyone can buy up a character on ebay with the best gear imaginable.  What do you have?  Well, you've managed about 5 minutes of pleasure spending money and now you have a character that has nowhere to go and nothing to do because it's already all topped out.  Game over.<br>
<br>
Contrast this with leveling up yourself and you have 60 levels of fun grouping and then months and months of fun raiding.  At the end, what you have in your hand is the same as what the ebayer has.  What you have in your memory, the ebayer will never understand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukolanistormynytes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KolaniStormynytes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/21/02 3:47:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1248.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ebay and integrity</span><hr size=1> There's a wurmy, 50kpp, and a Lodi Shell on playerauctions right now.

1) Everyone violates the EULA, so there is no possible judge and jury for EULA violations. Everyone should just do what they feel is right and allow others to do the same.<br>
<br>
2) It is not hurting you so stop condeming them.<br>
<br>
Now, these sound so nice and open minded who would not agree with them? I just happen to disagree with them. Lets say that we are talking about people who evade taxes, not like Enron, but just a single person. They claim more dependents, deductions, turn vacations into business trips. We wll know the ways. Now apply rules 1 and 2 to the situation. After all who is it hurting? They are not stealing from you and everyone cheats on their taxes.<br>
<br>
The problem is it does hurt you. Smaller revenues lead to tax increases down the road. Also, the IRS starts to assume that everyone cheats because all they see are cheats. Now when you get audited you will get that assumption applied to you, even if you are 100% honest.<br>
<br>
So how do ebayers hurt the general community? In my opinion there are direct hurts such as someone who does not know the class, does not know the community culture, does not understand local mores. A good solid player, however, can overcome these pretty easily. I understand that and can even accept that some people belive this enough to tolerate ebayers. <br>
<br>
My bigger problem is with the fact that people who buy and use ebay characters tend (note: tend does not mean 100%, it means many, but not all) to be the type of people who scoff at other rules. They tend to be the type who do not respect camps, believe that might makes right, demean and scoff at others who they believe are weaker than them. They tend to have the attitude that money can buy them the right to do what ever they want. So everytime a great high level player ebays his/her character we lose twice. The first time when the player leaves and the second time when a ebay-type person assumes the controls. <br>

I have a mind of my own, I can make my own judgements about players and guilds.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what your problem is but here are some things I have learned from dealings with two of the top guilds now.<br>
<br>
Uber DEFINATELY comes with a price. Now this price may<br>
be <br>
<br>
a) long hours at the keyboard<br>
b) having uber friends or multiple accounts and less time at the keyboard<br>
c) it may be $999.99 on Ebay. <br>
d) using exploits, cheats, etc...<br>
<br>
The point is, how you 'earn' your uberness depends on you but it always comes with a price. Now you may think the only 'fair' way to earn uberness is example 'a'. That is your opinion and you are welcome to it. But where exactly do you draw the line for integrity? How is someone who uses thier RL wealth to own 2-3 accounts and comps and PL thier toons up any better then someone who buys a made toon on Ebay? Is every use of RL cash to better your character immoral? Is it ok for someone to give me a Fungi tunic but if I buy one off Ebay is that wrong? What's the difference integrity wise if I did'nt 'earn' it?<br>
<br>
Playing with a lot of high end toons I have learned many of them take 'short cuts' to the top. Guess what? That is why they are at the top! That's how they got there before you and I. I don't hold anything against them, but that is definately the reason in a lot of cases. <br>
<br>
Of the big three guilds on FV I know of examples of all of them taking advantage of things you may consider questionable. You think AS is the only guild that cares about 'phat lewts' ? Wake up. These guilds are willing to make some sacrifices for success and that's what makes them successful. <br>
<br>
There is always a price for uberness, but it is up to each individual to determine what they are willing to pay. <br>

<br>
In otherwords, YOU being an ebay person does NOT demean me. This is a video game and in many ways, i'm only competing with myself (and maybe my work and class schedule). To think that one persons expediture of money somehow actually has some permanent affect on your psyche is to give other people far too much power.<br>
<br>
Heagan, I respect what you say, but I think you are giving other people too much input into your enjoyment of the game.<br>
<br>
Take some pride in what YOU do and don't worry so much about what other people are doing. No person is so full of integrity and honor that they can lash about randomly at any perceived dishonor or impropriety.<br>
<br>
As for the endgame... if you think the endgame is just about loot... you are in for QUITE a shock when you get there. The truth of the matter is that once you get to a certain point, almost every gear upgrade is a microfractional additional benefit. The effort put out to get that upgrade is rarely worth the benefit... however it IS worth the fun factor.<br>
<br>
The point of it is: you have a character who is well equipped and powerful... and you want to do something difficult but fun. This is why you hear so many people on high-visibility guild sites complaining about play balance. What they are REALLY talking about is how fun the encounter is. <p>Nakath<BR>

<br>
When you start saying that it's ok to break *some* rules, the line between right and wrong become fuzzy. Where do you draw the line?<br>
<br>
Powerleveling and twinking are not violations of the EULA.<br>
eBaying and account sharing are violations of the EULA.<br>
The EULA is what we are all expected to follow. <br>
We have to agree to is everytime we log on.<br>
<br>
A person that levels 1-60 without violating the EULA has every right to feel cheapened when he has to deal with someone that 'bought' his level 60 character. It actually comes to affect the honest player when that player loses a roll on an item against an eBayer that shouldn't have been there in the first place.<br>
<br>
One way has honor and inegrity. The other does not.<br>
<br>
I love listening to people come up with their excuses for doing it too... like their excuse makes it OK... Whatever... you're just trying to convince yourself. I still think you're scum. <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#5151CC"><b>Wikkin Osirus</b></font><br><font face="Tahoma"
