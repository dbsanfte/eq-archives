Maybe even better than you think. We know how it feels to cross Norrath from East to West, from North to South, looking for a friendly soul who will listen to your story. Who would comfort you when you are sad, share your joy after a successful hunt and who would gladly join you in any battle you choose to fight, any adventure you have decided to quest, any dream you would like to have come true for you.<br>
You may always have known we are out there somewhere. During all those sleepless nights you were lying awake by the fire looking at the flames and imagining another fire, warm and bright, burning at a fireplace at a House you could call your own. A house filled with laughter, joy and love - and with the smell of freshly baked pies and a nice cup of tea, or perhaps prodigious amounts of ale too. <br>
We know you’re out there somewhere. We have been waiting for you. Our rangers tried to track you down. Our mages sent their Elementals to find you. Our wizards and enchanters have been studying all the old Grimoires looking for a way to name you and summon you. <br>
Our shamen have consulted the spirits. The time has come for us to meet. Follow the path you can see, enlightened by the magic light we’ve created especially to guide your journey home. It will take your tired feet straight to our wide-open door. Please, do come. We are but a heartbeat away… <br>

It had been a long day. A long day of fighting trying to do his part in holding the forces that attempted to overcome Faydark at bay. The thought of surrender never entered his mind but in quiet moments with himself he often wondered if any progress was being made. &quot;This is not a battle that one should embark on alone&quot; he thought. This reminded him of a conversation he had overheard earlier in the day. Two travelers spoke of the a group, The Ring of Mystic Souls. They told admirable stories of honor and dedication in the fight against darkness that so often plagues Norrath. Such stories if true certainly warrented further investigation. You can never have too many friends or family when facing forces dedicated with chaos and destruction. Alone you would fare no better than one man standing in the ocean attempting to change the way the tide flows. Yes this group definitely is worth further study. Smiling in anticipaton Luine got to his feet and entered the city in search of a place to rest for the night and wondering what the days ahead might hold. <br>
<br>
ooc: Greetings, I was intrigued by your message and visited your web site and I think that we might have lots in common! I am looking for a group of friendly people to join and play with, roleplay with etc. I am however a bit young after re-rolling as a Paladin but am growing fast. I was not sure if you had a minimum level requirement or what level most members of your guild were and was intersted in learning more. Hope to speak to someone soon!!<br>

Our level range is currently (I believe) 4 or 5 to 59  -so you see we have a range.<br>

The majority however are somewhere between 30-52<br>

Felwithe- Kabach said he saw the young paladin in Felwithe. He has to be  around someplace. As one of the gatekeepers she was used to travelling fast and she knew how to find the ones she was supposed to take care after. So she found Luine almost at once. Smiling, she approached him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Luine, Kabach told me you were looking for the opportunity to talk to one of us. So here I am to answer all your questions and, if you decide to join us, make you our apprentice and help you in any way I am able to. You look tired- let me take you to our Guildhouse. The others have heard the news you were coming and are waiting impatiently to meet you. Come with me&quot;- with a little gesture of her hand Ennisser took both of them to a place where the fire was burining at the fireplace and Kabach was helping himself to another helping of berry-pie...&quot;<br>

OOC: One of our rules says you have to leave a message on our boards, in our Entrance Hall telling us a little about yourself and declaring your will to join our ranks. As soon as you do it you will get an official invitation to join our ranks. Also, feel free to cantact any of us in Norrath. I will be looking for you and waiting for your message- the place for you has been already prepared. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kabach>Kabach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Dark One</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/3/03 6:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=572.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looking for Luine.</span><hr size=1> /stealthy bump <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showPrevMessage?topicID=572.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showNextMessage?topicID=572.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=572.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.threadControl?topicID=572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=572.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47>Guilds and Associations</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
