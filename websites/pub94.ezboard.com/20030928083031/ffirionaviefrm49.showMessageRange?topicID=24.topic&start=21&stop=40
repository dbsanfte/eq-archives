<br>
If they made them no-drop though, you'd be screwed because many of them are affected by TLC when you get high level.<br>
<br>
But with keys from super high end encounters, I think it's safe to assume that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>intent</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is most likely that anyone who wants access to the plane needs to be in a group that completes one of the access quests.  It's like saying &quot;In order to prove yourself worthy to hunt in this kickass place, you need to do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>X</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, but that seems a fair and logical assumption.  <br>

Oh yeah I'm not HoH tagged even though I helped complete the quest and I helped do stuff ... so are my accomplishments in going route number 2 being ignored?  Guess I better go get access.  If you have noticed (which I am sure you have someone at least) we haven't been raiding in PoP any.  Ask an officer why or something.  When we do who is to say we will not kill the crystal dragon?  Until then why is it so wrong for a group of people to go in and do a quest that was put in by Sony to get access?<br>
<br>
Should each group have to do the quest 6 times to key 1 group?  Kind of lame sounding isn't it? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Zsuzsa"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 2023<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/02 2:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh I feel like a pride part 3 post about right now</span><hr size=1> Personally, I think they should just make anything flagged as a &quot;key&quot; set to ignore_TLC and then keep the flags (no-drop, lore, etc) identical to other servers.<br>

Say I train for a marathon. I want to gain the &quot;cool_uber_tshirt_of_participation&quot;. So, I run daily for 6 months and then punish myself with a 26 mile run. During the run I almost give up several times, but recover and slog on. I cross the finish line with a wild burst of exhileration. I HAVE DONE IT. I get my shirt and go home to sleep for 2 days. In the meantime my neighbor hops in his car, drives to the finish line and buys a tshirt. Now does this cheapen my accomplishment? Only if the tshirt was the goal. In reality I did something very hardthat few people will ever accomplish. In addition I have forced myself beyond what I thought I could do.<br>
<br>
I only cheapen the accomplisment if all I can dwell on is the fact that my fat, couch potato of a neighbor also has a tshirt. Then it just become about me and my lack of self worth. The fact remains that I did it and no one can take that away.<br>

Sony has only made one no drop and left the other tradable. There have been TWO patches since Sony was made aware of this. There has been at least 2 mini raids in these zones and several 1 group experience jaunts. Clearly this key is meant to be trabable since sony has done jack and shit about it.<br>
<br>
Now the HoH key is very similar. Key is attainable via a simple (but annoying quest) that is managable by one group and even solo'able by some more talented folks. All the pieces for the HoH quest are tradable, I have purchased some peices for the quest in the bazarr and will probably sell my extras. One of those peices being one of the three souls! (I can't wait to auction, &quot;want to sell my soul!&quot;).<br>
<br>
If these HoH keys are indeed intended to be no drop then I have zero issue with that. I just gotta wonder why Sony didn't fix all the keys when they fixed PoV on this server. I gotta wonder why Sony would ignore the petition about the other PoP zone (whose name I can't recall for the life of me atm) that was brought to thier attention.<br>
<br>
The only thing I actually regret about this incident is that it has stirred up shit between FnF and Reso again. Things were getting better and even though there are still folks holding grudges I thought we were moving in the right direction. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220314" target="top">Kzan Verto</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Giver of da Juice<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Member of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Kzan.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beornnfv>BeornnFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Born to Kill...

But here's my take.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's an exploit involving items that are usually no drop but because Verant forgot about FV ruleset they aren't no drop here.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This reminds me of how the Mark of Execution was once no drop. A certain guild did the trial once, and pass around the mark so other could complete the quest thus by-passing the hardest part. I then found it odd how a few days later this Mark of Execution became no drop. Perhaps someone from this guild decided to petition it after they had already taken advantage of the exploit and keyed all their members.<br>
<br>
Without the flag from the quest involving the Mark of Execution, you cannot gain entrance to the Plane of Valor, and thus not gain entrance to Halls of Honor by killing Aerin`Dar. If I were to guess, I'd say maybe half the members of said guild have the Mark of Execution thus making them even eligible to be in Halls of Honor.<br>
<br>
One more thing. Rollen you speak of pride and how we've lessened your achievements, I don't see how you can call yourself prideworthy when you had to ask for the assistance of Dreadstorm to help you kill Aerin`Dar. When Resolution can take him by themselves, then that perhaps would be prideworthy, but until you do I see no reason to be flaming anyone. This is not a slight against Dreadstorm, for you know I have the utmost respect for you.<br>
<br>
Do we plan on killing Aerin`Dar? Of course, it would be silly not to. Killing Aerin`Dar is a great accomplishment, one that I will not deny my members from having.<br>
<br>
With the changing of leadership of both Resolution and Fire and Fury, I was hoping for a better relationship between the two guilds. Unfortunately, Rollen is to caught up in what we are doing to realize the great achievements that he and his guild has accomplished. But if Rollen believes this is the best way to handle a situation, I guess I will be reconsidering my future actions as well.<br>
<br>
I am not one to speak out. I prefer to sit back, listen and watch. This will most likely be the only time I comment on this here. Anything else can be taken up in game.<br>

Better example would be if you train every day for a marathon.  Completing the marathon in a fast enough time qualifies you to enter the olympics.<br>
<br>
You beat the marathon, and are awarded a trophy, and are allowed to be an Olympic competitor in the coming summer.<br>
<br>
You give the trophy to your friend, and he licks it, and now the olympic committee says he can be an olympic competitor too.<br>
<br>
And then that friend hands the trophy to someone else, who licks it, and suddenly they're in the olympics as well.<br>
<br>
Anyone who tells you there isn't an underlying level of competition going on between the high end guilds is lying to you.  And taking advantage of a no-drop key to gain access for large portions of a guild to a zone when only a small portion of the guild actually earned the access is essentially cheating (from a competetive standpoint).<br>
<br>
It's akin to qualifying for wimbledon, only to discover that half the people you're competing against didn't qualify, they just bribed the judges.  It's a whole different situation than &quot;taking away form your earlier accomplishments&quot;, etc.<br>

We had done FIVE successful trials and had almost the entire guild in POJ waiting to do the trials. Yes we got some extra people flagged, but we also continued to do the trials. FnF did not have a single character who had completed a trial that borrowed a mark of execution for their own consumption only, but then without knowledge to the person they borrowed it from got a dozen or so FnF members flagged. Yippee! Now a simple quest doable by a single person that just needs to have a little luck on the drops resulted in the ability for one person to become flagged for HOH, but FnF has decided to sploit it and start getting everybody flagged. If it took an entire guild's effort to do the quest I wouldn't care, but it didn't. Sleepers tomb keys took an entire guild effort. See the difference?<br>
<br>
<br>
Please also note that Resolution was the first FV to take down a firstbrood dragon on the server, but FnF was the first to exploit the tradeable feature for keys on our server. Maybe we were keeping up with the Joneses since many FnF members were running around the bazarr holding conversations in front of Reso members like this. FnFmember00_1 says &quot;Hey FnFmember00_2 nice primal velium warsword looks just like mine hehehehe lets go to the next crowded zone and have this same conversation and impress upon people how uber we are!&quot;<br>

When SOE puts 2 ways in for a reason should I have to wait until my guild wants to kill the dragon when there is another legit method? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Zsuzsa"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kzanverto>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 1200<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/02 4:25 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh I feel like a pride part 3 post about right now</span><hr size=1> Put forth the effort.<br>

Rollen, words to live by. Yet you admit you flaggged extra people to get the keyed for PoV. Then you petition to have the key nerfed. I ask you to have those folks petition the GM to have their PoV flag removed immediatley so they can put forth the effort and gain access to that zone properly. <br>
<br>
I have petitioned Sony for clarification on this whole key issue. I have nothing to hide from them and hardly consider this an exploit. I consider what a certain high level Reso member did who used a pathing bug to farm an unusually large amount of xp in the grey an exploit.<br>
<br>
In my petition (via e-mail) I have explained the situationt to them and if this is not what they intended I have asked them to remove flags from people who didnt gain entry to the zone properly. I also have asked them to reveiw ALL flags for PoP to ensure they are working as intended.<br>
<br>
Put your money where your mouth is Rollen, compile a list of all those in Reso that gained entry to PoV improperly and petition to have their flags removed. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220314" target="top">Kzan Verto</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Giver of da Juice<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Member of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Kzan.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lunnaao>Lunna AO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Evil Kitten From Hell</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/02 4:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh I feel like a pride part 3 post about right now</span><hr size=1> &quot;Should each group have to do the quest 6 times to key 1 group?

<br>
Yes duh that's why the quest is a lot more easy than killing the dragon it's suposed to take longer to do the quest if your guild can't kill the dragon that's the same for all other flag plane acces (terris,grummus)<br>
<br>
Btw don't know when you petitoned but the gm know and the watch it they also going to change it soon like they did with tribunal trial, oh and you can tell your member to stop dueling themself in hon to let corpse there in case they remove flag it's kinda silly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mistressoftherose>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 631<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/02 4:34 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://noirdaila.homestead.com/files/ZDoll.JPG width=83 height=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh I feel like a pride part 3 post about right now</span><hr size=1> Do the quest and tell me its so easy please.

My question is why should a &quot;group&quot; quest have to be done each time for a group?  Just like the trials there should you have to do the trials one time for each member?   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Zsuzsa"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kzanverto>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 1201<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/02 4:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh I feel like a pride part 3 post about right now</span><hr size=1> Not online so don't know whats going on.

<br>
So lets see if Reso is gonna put forth the effort and get thier PoV keys properly. Have your guildmates that didnt earn the pov flag petition to have it removed.<br>
<br>
Petition the GM's to get your HoH flags removed  to since you obviously couldnt muster a raid force large enough to do the dragon without exploiting to get into PoV to begin with. You needed all your PoV keys, earned and exploited PLUS a small force from Dreadstorm to get your HoH keys. Where's the honor in that when you cheated to kill the dragon?<br>

What's the deal on PoV flags? Is there another step besides doing that trivial trial thing where your three wizards nuke four waves of crap to process two people per trial? I haven't had the patience to stand in line yet. <p><CENTER>

It just sounds like someone getting pissed because they have a huge steak dinner in front of them and thier little brother swiped a pea off their plate and ate it. You might be annoyed, but you still got the steak just waiting to be eaten.<br>

Actually Reso is almost fully in HOH at this point.  So yes we could start pharming it now if we wished.  <br>
<br>
And I love all these ppl from FNF saying how Reso didn't do the trials.  I was sitting there at the parchment camp in POJ as I watched group after group of FNF run by talk to mavuin/run back upstairs to the tribunal then return 3 minutes later and get flagged.  What a joke to complain abut us when we had everyone sitting near the tribunal waiting on line to go through the trials.  So lets not make it seem like only we did it.  A MAJORITY of FNF used the xploit to get into POV while a MAJORITY of RESO did not.  And how do I know this is fact from one of your own members asking me about the mark and then telling me if we did what you guys were doing to get in.  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah a group of friends from DS were invited to come with us to kill Aerin'dair I believe there was one group of them.<br>
So we're bad for having a group of friends join us to kill a mob, but you guys are ok for Inviting in 90% of AS who you (CONTINUALLY Flamed while they were an independent guild) just so you could keep pace.<br>
OH wait I forget did FNF invite in AS members, or did AS just take over the FNF name?<br>

<br>
The hypocrisy of this all just amazes me. Rollen bitched about a mixed group getting their PoV flags that was actually doing it LEGIT, even though his own guild wasn't.<br>
<br>
He bitches about people &quot;exploiting&quot; to get into HoH when his own guild &quot;exploited&quot; to get the keys to go after the dragon. They needed everyone who had PoV keys that were earned, exploited and some help from Dreadstorm to do it and at in the end there was what, five people standing?<br>
<br>
There was no way Reso could have done that dragon and get keyed for HoH without cheating by keying those &quot;extra&quot; people for PoV and yet they claim great victory over an honorable battle.<br>
<br>
Rollen, prove me wrong. Deny any of this. Redeem yourself and restore you honor by petitioning to have your guilds HoH flags removed and the PoV for your &quot;extra&quot; guildmates flags removed. Live by your own words and put forth the effort. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220314"
