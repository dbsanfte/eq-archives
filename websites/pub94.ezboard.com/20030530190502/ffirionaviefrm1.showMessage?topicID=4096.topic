The post is not mine rather one of my fellow beasts. <br>
<br>
Ok.. so how many of you know what Beastlords do anyway ? I find that most people are generally surprised about beastlords when i group with them.. having no idea what they can or cant do. <br>
<br>
People dont even know what buffs to ask from a beastlord.. because they dont know what they can do. Going to take a little time here to tell the Lanys community a little about beastlords, because there might be times when you SPECIFICALLY need one for your group.. but you just dont know it. Wont talk about soloing , but the class is pretty strong there too. <br>
<br>
When luclin first came out, beastlords were not finished. People leveled them up, then looked at the spells they got, and decided they sucked. Right now, people either dont know what they can do.. or still think they suck ( like people used to pick on rangers, but rangers are one of the most powerful classes in game , getting toward the end game ). <br>
<br>
Anyway... <br>
<br>
1. WHAT IS A BEASTLORD, ANYWAY ? <br>
<br>
A beastlord is a Monk / Shaman hybrid. Beastlords Get dual wield ( and have access to double attack as a PoP AA skill at level 61, although they dont get it before that ). A beastlord by himself / herself (without pet) is comparable in melee damage output to a bard.. slightly higher but right around there. <br>
<br>
Beastlords dress like monks ( in leather, or all / all gear ) but without the weight restrictions. Fully buffed, my non uber Beastlord has about 1090 or so AC at level 60. he has about 4500-4900 HP depending on who has the new buffs, fully buffed. <br>
<br>
Beastlords also have the BLOCK skill, and evade damage similar to a monk ( not quite as well ). A beastlord is not a tank any more than a ranger is, but both classes can make due if they have exceptional equipment, or the mobs dont hit all that hard. I can tank mobs in mavuin hall just fine, in the deep, etc ( due to ac above 1000 and my damage avoidance via block, riposite etc). <br>
<br>
Beastlords also get shaman buffs. A beastlord buffing wise is similar ( not exactly but similar ) in buffing to a shaman about 10 levels below him. At level 60, A beastlord has the level 49 shaman Stamina and Dexterity spells, Has a decent strength spell, Can add 250 hp to you with Talisman of Altuna ( tuna for old school players ). At level 60 beastlords also get Alacrity, which is 40 percent haste buff . <br>
<br>
Beastlords also get a couple nice Beast only buffs which i will talk about in a second. <br>
<br>
2. WHAT CAN A BEASTLORD OFFER MY GROUP ? <br>
<br>
1. DPS ( damage per second ). I have been parsing my dps regularly lately, and i think some people would be surprised at exactly how much DPS a beast can put out ( adding in his / her pet.. you will never see a BL without one unless they have been forbidden, which really shouldnt happen ). <br>
<br>
A beastlord + his pet can put out damage very close to a monk.. and monks are the highest melee damage in the game from the front. Everyone knows rogues are the highest melee damage overall ( not counting archery which is absolutely UBER but has line of sight issues etc sometimes as balance ). <br>
<br>
If you are looking for a damage dealer, you could do worse than picking a Beastlord because of some of the other things that come with them... <br>
<br>
2. beastlords can slow mobs. At level 50 they get a 30 percent slow, and at level 60 they have access to a 50 percent slow ( spell now sold in PoK, called sha's advantage .. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). The beastlord epic has duplicate effects basically of the ranger one ( which everyone is familiar with ), in that it offers the BST 40 percent self haste, and procs a 55 percent slow / dot ). <br>
<br>
If your group is short on damage output but you need mobs slowed, you can grab a beastlord. The slow isnt as good as ench or shaman slow, but if your group has just an enchanter as CC + slower, a beast can help cut down on damage by slowing like a shaman would in that situation, and provide decent dps while doing so in the form of their pet on the main mob. <br>
<br>
3. Beastlords have a couple of BEAST ONLY buffs which are very nice.. that people dont know about. <br>
<br>
1. The spiritual brawn line <br>
<br>
1. Spiritual Brawn-- adds 75 HP and 10 Attack ( level 44) <br>
2. Spiritual Strength --Adds 150 hp and 25 Attack ( level 60) <br>
3. Spiritual Vigor -- Adds 225 hp and 40 attack (level 62) <br>
<br>
Stacking issues... doesnt stack with brells ( which is more hp but no attack ) or with ranger HP buff line ( which is less hp but more attack ). They are the compromise between ranger HP buffs and Paladin ones. The level 62 spell is group cast as well. They stack with every other HP buff except the ranger / paladin one.. and any HP buff that provides attack is a good thing. <br>
<br>
2. The Spiritual Light line ( beast clarity ) <br>
<br>
1. Spiritual Light 3hp / 3 mana per tic regen ( level 44) <br>
2. Spiritual Radience 5 hp / 5 man per tic regen ( level 52) <br>
3. Spiritual Purity 7 hp / 7 mana per tic regen (level 59) <br>
4. Spiritual Dominion 9 hp / 9 mana per tic regen (level 64) <br>
<br>
These stack with ALL other mana regen buffs except the mana skin line that necros and wizards use( How ever, Forceshield spell (61+ upgrade to manaskin line) fully stacks with spiritual line), with the mod rod change / fix / nerf, extra mana regen is good, and your Beastlord can provide it ( while still giving the group good dps ). For reference.. Clarity is 7 per tic mana only regen, C2 is 12 per tick, and KEI is 14 per tic. A level 60 Beast is stacking &quot; Clarity&quot; on TOP of your KEI , with 7 hp per tic regen throwm in for free. This mana regen also stacks with bard song , Caster self only mana regen like cleric / mage / druid has etc etc. Again only stacking issue is manaskin line. <br>
<br>
<br>
4. Beastlords off ( as said above ) Shaman buffs if there is not a shaman present. A level 60 Beastlord can add : <br>
<br>
1. 40 percent haste <br>
2. 40 Stamina points ( extra hp buff basically) <br>
3. 40 dex buff ( more procs etc ) <br>
4. 34 Strength <br>
5. 250 HP buff ( in addition to the BL only buff above in the spirit brawn line ) <br>
6. Fire / Cold / Magic / Poison / Disease resist spells <br>
7. Regen ( chloroplast.. + 10 per tic regen ) <br>
8. + 18 AC buff <br>
9. Good magic dispells ( nullify magic ) <br>
<br>
All in addition to the BL only stuff listed above ( and in addition to providing very close to monk DPS when meleeing damage is added with pet ). <br>
<br>
Lets talk about the pet for just a second. A Level 60 Beastlords pet : <br>
<br>
1. Quads for 68 max per hit <br>
2. Bashes for 26 <br>
3. Procs a nuke that the BL puts on it <br>
4. Depending on proc can stun a mob for up to 2 seconds per proc <br>
5. Will /shield their master when the player is low on hp <br>
<br>
The proc is up to the Beast, and we have one for all resists ( fire / cold / poison / disease / magic ), so we can attack what the mob is hopefully weak against. The procs do a decent amount of damage when they hit ( for example, the rare BL pet proc spirit of flame, levelo 56 does 142 points of fire damage every proc ). <br>
<br>
Over half of a beastlords damage ( usually the pet out dps 's the beastlord himself unless he / she has better than epic weapons ), which is why if you are with a beastlord and ask them to put their pet away, they will complain, and gnash teeth. BL pets have a quite a few Hitpoints as well. Beastlords can use these pets to great effect to &quot;pet park&quot; adds, because beastlord pet only heals are EXTREMELY efficient. At level 60 a beast can heal his pet for 1250 points of damage for 300 mana. <br>
<br>
3. WHAT DOES A BEASTLORD BRING TO A RAID ? <br>
<br>
Well, since the parent class is there ( shaman ) for buffs, a beastlords raid role is much reduced. You still get access to the two BL buffs i stated above ( the BL hp buff and the BL clarity buff ). Of the two, the clarity buff is much more important, since it also provides a little extra regen, and stackable mana regen for taking down some boss mob. If you have a Beast on a raid, and tell him / her not to use their pet.. have a good reason because you probably just lost about half the beastlords DPS. <br>
<br>
Beastlords are a cog on a raid like everyone else. They can provide a decent HP buff with attack ( again less atk but more hp than a rangers, less raw hp than brells ). Not sure how many people would want that honestly but a 62 BL buff is better than brells from all but a 65 paladin ( since its the same HP as brells from a &lt;65 paladin, AND has 40 atk ). The extra mana regen from having a beast there is very nice with the mod nerf, but not &quot; necessary &quot;. Beast still provide decent dps, and another person who can attempt to slow dangerous mobs ( more slowers = better ). <br>
<br>
<br>
4. WHEN DO I WANT A BEASTLORD ? <br>
<br>
When you want extra DPS and mana regen in a group with a shaman but no enchanter. <br>
<br>
When you want extra dps and mana regen and a slower to help the group when you have an enchanter but no shaman. <br>
<br>
Extra dps and stackable mana regen if you are trying something hard and have both an enchanter and a shaman.. the extra mana regen over the course of a tough one group fight might help make the difference.. and again BL provide excellent dps while doing this. <br>
<br>
When you are making a &quot; ghetto group &quot; cause all the shaman and enchanters are busy.. You have someone who can slow the mobs, to aid in root parking ( bl dont get root ) and also someone who can use their pet to park adds, and give you some of those buffs you are addicted to. <br>
<br>
When you have smaller than 6 man groups.. Like shaman, who are the kings of ghetto groups and duos, beastlords perform very well here too. A shaman / BL duo is something to see. <br>
<br>
NOTE: About the below statement on the Pet Pushing, its been found that this isnt the case. That in fact the pet pushes no more than any other melee character. In fact, the Beast Lord alone, if positioned on the other side of the mob from the pet, will keep the mob in place. Sooo, take it with a grain of salt. Rhil Fr'Payne - Morell Thule <br>
<br>
The only other thing i wanna say is, when you are working with a Beastlord as a main tank, please be aware that Beastlord pets push.. A LOT. They generate a TON of push.. about as much as a 60 monk.. mabye more. Good for interupting casting non stunnable mobs.. slightly annoying unless you position the mob properly when fighting in a camp. <br>
<br>
A BL pet WILL push your mob across a room, and into a wall etc. Be aware of where the pet will get pushed to if your MT ing and that problem can be minimized. <br>
<br>
Hope this was informative for those of you out there who didnt know what this class can do. I am not bragging , etc.. Just letting everyone know that .. yes beastlords ARE a viable group member. They have SOMETHING to offer VERY group configuration, from very good DPS, to stackable mana regen, to HP buffs etc. Think of us when you are making your groups.. if you are not grouping with us, your missing out. <br>
<br>
(BL also get some AAs that increase their damage, and provide even more mana regen but the number of AA 'ed BLs on our server is extremely small.. probably 10 or fewer who have lots of the extra goodies ). <br>
<br>
<br>

On raid, 1-3 more slowers can safe your day, their raid buffs are great.<br>
<br>
After PoP, finding a slower was the key to get xp groups going, here we have a slower/haster/mana regen combo that extends our possibilities quite a bit.<br>
If they get agro from slows they have a pet to help them and enough AC and HP to take a serious beating till the agroed Mob gets offtanked.<br>

Also noteworthy: at 61, Infusion of Spirit is an Ethereal Parchment spell, providing 55str 50dex 45sta..... that stacks with everything else.  With furious str, dexterity, stamina, tuna of kragg, and infusion, a bst can potentially provide better stat buffs than focus while using up quite a few more buff slots. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438">Rhatha Sha`Naya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and Swiftclaw<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org"><br>
