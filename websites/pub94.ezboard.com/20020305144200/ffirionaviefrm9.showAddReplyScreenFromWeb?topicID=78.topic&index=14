align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ending World War II</span><hr size=1> a DIRECT QUESTION  ..... Arkitip? So it is your contention that the potential death of over 100000 Allied troops and the possible injure to a million more AND the potential death of Millions of Japanese was preferable to destroying two cities and their population?<br>
<br>
Or do you think that Japan would have just quit with no invasion?<br>
<br>
Rather than read history by prejuidice professors and scholors that can and do revise it as they see fit, read the military history that is logged as reported during the war. As for rivisionist history... Are you aware that Japan teaches it citizens that they didnt start the conflict? That they didnt invade China or Korea. It is all just a big misunderstanding, they just happened to have to fight in those places.<br>
<br>
As for the power and scope of those warheads.... more damage and more people were killed in the firebombing of German cities and Tokyo. The difference is it took more effort to accomplish those bombings.<br>
<br>
The fact is that if the war had gone on those cities and the people in them would have been firebombed because they were considered valid military targets. They had been held out of the bombing because the military wanted to demonstrate the power of the bomb to the Government of Japan.<br>
<br>
And as to our will as a society, I tend to agree, we seem to lack the needed will to do the things that MUST be done to prevent terrorist attacks in the future that will be more costly than the ones to date.  I watch in disgust as our own News services lament about the innocents lost in the bombing rather than the need to destroy the Taliban Government and the Terrorist organization it WILLING chose to protect.<br>
<br>
I do however disagree with the contention that our leaders are more aggressive than the society as a whole... The mob would have us attacking in force in several places and the Government has rejected that.<br>
<br>
How Our President chooses to handle Saudia Arabia will (IMO) determine whether we have any chance of actually fighting this war effectively in the short term. Long term , in war, things change based on events that unfold. Saudia Arabia has chosen to pretend that NONE of their citizens were or are terrorists in any organization bent on bringing the USA down.  The Saudi Government has repeated the line that they see NO evidence to suspect ANY saudi citizen is or was involved in this network. They refuse to do anything about money flow within their country to the organization and refuse to take any action against possible supporters of the organization. In effect they are trying to SAY they support action against terrorism WHILE actively doing nothing to combat it and actively thwarting the effort to fight it. AND they have already stated that no action must ever be taken against the terrorist organizations fighting Isreal.<br>
<br>
As for the contention that the Isrealies are putting the boot to Palastenians.... again check history.... The Jews in Palastine actively sought to INCLUDE the arabs in the land in the formation of a Government. the Neigboring Arab STATES threatened and warned all Arabs in Palastine to Flee before the invasion to crush the state of Isreal. The Arab countries refused since 1948 to allow the so called Palestinians to become citizens of ANY arab State, with the purpose and Goal of creating a mob of people bent on the hatred and destruction of Isreal.<br>
<br>
Isreal REACTS to attacks, they have not recently begun any action EXCEPT in response to attacks from the Palastinians. The Government of Arafat actively seeks out, arrests, tries and puts to death any palestian that is found to have warned Isreal of any pending Terrorist attack. They do NOTHING to discourage such attacks and in some cases the police and security forces arm, train and support the Terrorists.<br>
<br>
The difference between us and the terrorists is that we dont PURPOSEFULLY target non military targets, and we didnt start this conflict we are simply responding (finally) to a threat against our society and our way of life. Another BIG difference is that when it is all over and we have won we wont go around rounding up all the people that disagree with us and murder them.<br>

<br>
first)  At the time, and given the options currently available, and considering the method in which the US was drawn into the war (Pearl Harbor), I think that Truman believed that the bomb was the best method to end the war.<br>
<br>
second)  We were at war with an implacable foe, and by contemporary value judgements it was better that the Japanese die than Americans.<br>
<br>
third)  No one had ever used a nuclear weapon for that use before, and so the long-term effects could not be judged.<br>
<br>
fourth)  Dropping the bomb, while drastic, had the desired effect (to end the war).<br>
<br>
fifth)  We live in the 21st Century, not the 1940's.  As our lifespans have increased we have placed a greater value on life as a whole.  At the time, given the value we as Americans placed on life in general, and given the information available to the individuals in charge of the decision, it was a sound decision.<br>
<br>
sixth)  It was a tough decision.  And fate provide that I am never in the situation where I must weigh the lives of those, whose well-being is entrusted to me, against the lives of those who wish to destroy them.  Regardless of my decision, I would be judged a murderer.<br>
<br>
I hope this puts some perspective on the whole shebang. <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>

EVER<br>
Why? Because there's absolutely no kind of justification for that kind of destruction. It's akin to using a rocket launcher when a 9mm would have done the task.<br>
They can round up all sorts of statistics on how many would have potentially died. That is nearly the same as revisionist history because numbers like that can always be twisted to make them look like whatever the hell you want them to look like. Simple as that. We cannot know how many casualties there would have been at the time, nor today. However, at the time we knew how damn destructive those bombs were, and we REALLY know it today. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/30/01 5:29:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ending World War II</span><hr size=1> I'm not going to justify anything to you, ark.  I don't see the need to do so.<br>
<br>
And I appreciate and respect your belief that there is no good reason to use a nuclear weapon.  While I may not agree with it, it is your right to state and hold that opinion.<br>
<br>
It is my considered opinion (which is different than yours) that while in a state of war with a foe which had demonstrated the willingness to engage in wholesale slaughter and enslavement (the japanese campaigne into mainland china) that destroying two cities in order to force a surrender was preferrable to sending millions to die in order to achieve the same goal.<br>
<br>
Here is my reasoning, with which you will probably not agree, but is still my own opinion:<br>
<br>
I would die to stop a man from killing my child.<br>
I would die to stop a man from killing my neighbor's child.<br>
I would kill 1000 men to stop them from killing my child.<br>
I would kill 1000 men to stop them from killing my neighbor's child.<br>
By extension, I would kill 1,000,000,000 men to keep them from killing 1,000,000 of my neighbor's sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
It's not pretty, it's not neat and it's not particularly nice.  But it's the truth.  And I like to think that you would die to stop a man from killing your child, or to stop him from killing my child.  Maybe not.  That's a personal decision that I can't force.  However, based on my values it was the correct decision and I'll stand by those values to the end.<br>
<br>
As well, I believe the Japanese would not have hesitated to do the same had they had 'the bomb' first.  But as far as the decision to drop the bomb is concerned, I think that's a bit irrelevant. <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>
