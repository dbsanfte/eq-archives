This reminds me of what people used to say in the fifties/sixties/seventies, &quot;Honey, those men in Washington know what's best for us.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be there.&quot;  But politicians are not in Washington simply to achieve their own agendas, which I think Bush and his close supporters are attempting, they are there to represent the people.  But most importantly, is that a citizen has a duty to question the judgments and decisions of their elected officials.  This is important because America only functions best if it is functioning as an open forum of ideas.<br>

I account for it like this:  Bushites, &quot;OH NO! The president's popularity has gone down!  Quick, what do we do?!  I know, lets pass a medication bill, which really won't help anyone but the wealthy old (not the below to slightly above poverty level elderly,) since that is something the Democratic party has been fighting for for some time.  That will give us a foothold into the elderly vote as well as steal yet another campaigning point from the Democrats.&quot;<br>
I would applaud the Republicans for at least attempting to help some elderly Americans if I didn't suspect they were only doing it for purely political motives.  Actions done for the wrong motive aren't worthy of praise, at least to me.<br>

I think one should investigate the 'great economic turn-around of the last third quarter' in more depth.  The percentage increase was only posted for the last quarter, between July to September, because America experienced a fantastic September.  But I would hardly call one good month out of three a fantastic quarter.<br>

SergianFV wrote:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As far as &quot;Reaganomics&quot; goes, Reagan proved that supply-side economics and tax rate cuts work.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Reagan got lucky on some accounts, but overall I would say Reaganomics was and is a failure.<br>
<br>
Reagan escaped with his skin because he had Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman at the time, crushing American and its inflation by raising interest rates to near 20%.  It wasn't Reaganomics or the tax cuts that ended the recession of 1981, it was the Fed cutting interest rates from the terrible levels it was raised to to solve for inflation.<br>
<br>
The problem that we are facing nowadays is that Alan Greenspan hasn't been focusing on curbing 'real' inflation.  Alan Greenspan has busied himself stopping 'wage inflation.'  The inflation rates remained at historical low levels during the 1990's, and Greenspan slowed the economic expansion of the United States to so that industry was not forced to raise the wage level of its employees.  American workers earn the same pay today that they were making in 1990.<br>
<br>
But what does that matter you say?  <br>
<br>
Well, even though President Bush passed his 1.35 trillion dollar tax cuts package, his campaign hasn't helped the majority of Americans.  This is why so many people were up in arms that President Bush was giving tax breaks 'to the wealthiest one-two percent' of America.  <br>
<br>
President Bush passed this tax cut under the guise that it would be helping all of America.  Sure, the income tax for everyone has been reduced, but his campaign has quietly raised the payroll tax for Americans.  <br>
<br>
Payroll taxes, Social Security, and Medicare are FLAT TAXES.  There are no write-offs or deductions, and everyone, from Circle K workers to CEOs, are hit with the same percent.  <br>
<br>
But this payroll tax doesn't really effect the richest percent because they don't usually earn most of their income from wages.  They own capital (money that makes more money), which is not subject to payroll taxation.  Capital gains taxes have been steadily reduced to 15% nowadays.  And since all of this ridiculously low taxed capital gain isn't payroll income, the richest percent pays nothing into Medicare or Social Security.  Social Security is actually a regressive flat tax because only the first 76 thousand dollars of wage income is taxed.  So even rich workers are getting a break over the poorer worker.  <br>
<br>
Payroll taxes account for over a third of the federal income (and most of the surpluses in past years) but Bush has never even suggested cutting these taxes or making it more fair for Americans still making the same wage as in 1990.  Couple all of this with the fact that three million Americans have lost their jobs in the last three years.<br>
<br>
I agree with Ermok, Bush is bleeding America dry.  It is not politically appealing to cut social spending.  It would hurt Bush's chances of re-election if he went around claiming that he wants to cut welfare, social security, education, and etc spending.  So he achieves his goals of cutting government spending but hitting it where it hurts.  He is cutting income tax, especially the capital gains tax, in an attempt to starve the government and force IT to do the cutting of social spending itself.  Bush wants the murder committed, but he doesn't want his fingerprints on the murder weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sergianfv>SergianFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/03 9:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I pose a question</span><hr size=1> Tax cuts had nothing to do with the economic boom of the 80's?  I'd call it colossal ignorance or colossal arrogance to completely discount the economic impact of millions of people keeping and spending the money that they earned.  I won't argue that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts didn't help,  but it's people that drive capitalism, not the Fed.  The Fed can either assist or hinder the economy in this regard, but it doesn't drive it.  People with money to spend (a little or a lot) do that.  Reagan knew it and proved it.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>President Bush passed his 1.35 trillion dollar tax cuts package<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
First off, this is an incorrect nomenclature.  Tax cuts have never <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cost</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the government a thing.  They have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> resulted in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>increased</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> government revenues.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but his campaign has quietly raised the payroll tax for Americans<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If Bush had raised any tax, there would have been nothing quiet about it.  The mainstream media would have hammered him over the head with it.  The only possible bit of traction you may have on this point is the fact that the cap on FICA wages is tied to rises in inflation, which happens every year.  This isn't anything new, and so is irrelevant to the debate.<br>
<br>
The rest of what you say is typical &quot;eat the rich&quot; rot.  We have a tax system that is punitive.  &quot;Progressive&quot; is hardly an accurate term, only in that it progressively punishes you the more successful you become.  But when more than 50% of the total taxes are paid by the wealthiest 4% of the population, there's something wrong.  These are the people that create jobs and create wealth, not some government bureaucrat.  When you reduce the tax burden on everyone, these folks will invariably get to keep a larger &quot;raw dollar&quot; amount than the checkout girl at the supermarket.  But I don't see why this is such a cause for hysterics.<br>
<br>
As for capital gains taxes, when the capital gains tax was lowered in the 90s, it unleashed a flood of capital and, hence, a flood of government revenue as a result.  All those evil rich folk went and got rid of capital that they'd been holding on to because they didn't want to get slammed with the punitive taxes.  But when times are tough (i.e. high capital gains taxes), it's not rich folk that need to sell off capital assets to put their kids through college.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;bleeding America dry&quot; goes, I'm not sure what you consider to be &quot;America.&quot;  Do you mean the government?  If that's the case, you've totally lost sight of what this country is all about.  But in any case, if that's what you consider to be &quot;America,&quot; then so be it.  As I've said above, government revenues have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gone up when taxes have been lowered.  It happened under Kennedy, it happened under Reagan, and it's already starting to happen under Bush.  Go look up the numbers.  You may be shocked and dismayed.<br>

<br>
You allow nationalism and the supposed morality ingrained in conservative rhetoric to outweigh the actual facts.  Just because Bush claims to be a Christian and never misses a chance to insert that does not mean he is infallible as Jesus.  Yet I talk to so many conservatives that give him full credit just for that and never look at his policies.  I consider that ignorant.<br>
<br>
You ignore the fact that Bush drastically changed our nation's foreign policy for the worst.  What the hell is with all this &quot;going back to the 30s&quot; bullshit?  We would NEVER have ordered a pre-emptive military action against another sovereign nation against the will of the UN before now.  Upholding UN resolutions through our own judgment?  Thats not for us to make if we truly believe in the UN.<br>
<br>
You ignore his efforts and the efforts of his party to cut military spending in the areas of hazaard pay, family separation pay, and housing budgets.  <br>
<br>
You also ignore the fact that Bush is doing the right thing.  At least in truth.<br>
<br>
While trying to fight liberals that bring up just concerns about no WMD and terrible economic policies you forget he is doing what he was elected to do: protect the citizens of the United States.  <br>
<br>
He does that by putting our soldiers in a vulnerable position and letting terrorists converge and break like water on rocks against our concentrated might in a hotbed of our modern enemies.  Though a terrorist could do a lot of damage if they did, it is near impossible to attack unarmed, unaware civilians here in America.  Thus it is easier to hop in an old Datsun and fire your AK-47 at kevlar clad, well armed Americans conveniently in Iraq.  Bush's current policy gets them out of hiding and blown to pieces quicker with actually fewer American lives lost.  <br>
<br>
It is what it is.  You just wont hear that explanation of our foreign policy verbatim from a politician.  Its a lot more politically feasible to lie or mislead than it is to tell the truth.  Very few would understand the truth.<br>
<br>
Think about that and use it if you want in your arguments for Bush.  Its a freebie from a liberal.  But at the same time keep in mind everything else going on as afore mentioned.  And make your own judgment.  Thats all I ask. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kebkin>Kebkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/03 4:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I pose a question</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Please explain how all of us can become so much smarter than so many other successful people. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

As I've said many times on this board, a common practice among liberals is their propensity to insult the intelligence of conservatives.  An adage of war, politics, sports, etc. is to never underestimate your opponent.  Fine by me if liberals like to think they are smarter than conservatives.     <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

This is an opinion, many of us feel that the US foreign policy needed revamping in this very way. Who said we should believe in the UN? What successes have they had? And what is in it for us So for many of us these are signs of improvement.<br>
We don't ignore any of the actions of the political party in office, we just do not swallow all the rhetoric of what they mean and how come some people would like us to believe they are being done.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While trying to fight liberals that bring up just concerns about no WMD<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Why is there a concern about not finding WMDs yet? With all the other objectives being met I personally am a bit relieved that the WMDs might have been a paper tiger. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and terrible economic policies<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The economy was tanking when he came into office. It has been the shortest recession every recorded in US history. All the economic indicators are rising and look like they will continue to rise. Explain how this is because of &quot;terrible economic policies&quot;.<br>
I agree with the next paragraph you posted. And much of it is Military SOP or a standard tactic. IE: Wild Weasel flight groups and the concept of re-con in force. Often the idea is to draw the enemy out by providing them with a target they think they can take and then holding them in position long enough to bring greater forces to bear.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Very few would understand the truth.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Some will not accept the truth even when they hear and see it.<br>
<br>
Some other lib stances that are supported by conjecture, opinion, rhetoric, irrelevances and Soto factoids.<br>
<br>
Because Bush did not score as a genius in some IQ test he must an idiot. What historical basis do we have that only geniuses can lead a country wisely?<br>
<br>
Because he is not an excruciatingly articulate speaker he is an idiot incapable of leading our country. Again what historical evidence is this based on. Every time he has a Presidential Speech to nation his poll numbers rise?<br>
<br>
The only reason he has had so many successes in his life is because he belongs to a wealthy family. How did this become a fact? Many people who belong to wealthy families never achieve anything.<br>
<br>
His success are because he is surrounded by very talented people. From all the leadership training I have had that is a sign of a good leader.<br>
<br>
Continually we here about minor objectives not met as a sign that the whole endeavor was a complete failure, disregarding the fact the majority of objectives were met with overwhelming success. IE:<br>
<br>
Bin Laden hasn't been caught yet: Once his political support base and a major portion of his organization was destroyed his importance and relevance diminished greatly. His capture now serves more as PR than as effective deterrence. It may actually be better that he stays loose as a foci to identify, capture and destroy more of his terrorist operations and operatives.<br>
<br>
Saddam Hussein hasn't been caught yet: Once his political support base and a major portion of his organization was destroyed his importance and relevance diminished greatly. His capture now serves more as PR than as effective deterrence. It may actually be better that he stays loose as a foci to identify, capture and destroy more of his operations and operatives.<br>
<br>
Lets look at some of the number claims:<br>
Deficit and Unemployment numbers are always ones libs like to run up the pole. Of course they like to claim the the deficits and unemployment numbers have never been higher. Which is ludicrous, because these numbers are subjective and unless you base them on a span of time rather than a single moment and use percentages of the GNP and population. When you look at the numbers on a relevant basis their claims are just rhetoric.<br>
<br>
These are just a few, mainly because I am getting tired of typing about such things and want to use some of my personal time for something more important, playing. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And make your own judgment. Thats all I ask.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
I have. It may change in the future but it won't be changed by rhetoric or others opinions. It will be by what I perceive is best for my family and the future of my children.<br>

The war was started when Iraq invaded Kuwait, a cease fire was called but there was never an end to the war. When Iraq refused to comply with the cease fire agreements for 12 years the war was resumed. Iraq started the war, no doubt about it.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Actually the recession started during the Bush administration.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
How do you figure? The recession started before Bush came into office, as a matter of fact he was accused of &quot;talking down the economy&quot; because he spoke about it. If you have evidence contrary to this I for one would be interested.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Actually every single new Republican President of the entire century has had a recession his first term.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I would like to know what statistics you are basing this on as most recessions are pretty obvious. Or are you talking about dips in the economy which are common when a new administration takes over because of insecurities in the market? These are not recessions.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Correction- jobless claims are one thing, but the economy is still losing jobs, just at a slower rate.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You are contradicting yourself here but to put it in perspective, the jobless percentage is going down and we are also becoming more efficient. Win-Win!<br>
<br>
Some are ambiguous and the rest are all conservative, welcome to the adult club Whistler, always remember most of us start liberal and that is not a bad thing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any one who is younger than 35 and not a liberal has no heart, any one who is older than 35 and is not a conservative has no brain.&quot;<br>
