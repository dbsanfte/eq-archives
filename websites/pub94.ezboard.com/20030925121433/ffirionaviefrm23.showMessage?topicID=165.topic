He would enter the tavern, him and his sword, all glowing, all aflame, sit quietly in the corner and listen to the singing, the ranting, the raving, the stories, the cheers, the sobs.  He would simply sit there, soaking up the atmosphere and all that came with it.  When approached, he would greet with a gentle smile and little more.  The only time he ever spoke up was when the those of the darkness began ranting maniacally and he simply could not let their comments go.  For the norm, he remained silent, conversing only with his sword through soundless whispers.  An aura of gentle nobility encompassed him, and he kept to himself and his dwarven ale.<br>
<br>
Baka did not choose to do so this time.  He looked tired, weary, but above all else, distinctly irritated.  Instead of slowly making his way towards a table in the corners, he plodded towards a small stool and glanced over the rabble of milling races.  Swinging Xotal through the air and settling his point on the floor, he rested upon the Fiery Avenger, Xotal's own aura subdued and rippling with the everburning flame that ran the length of his blade.  He did not even try to get the attention of the crowd, instead letting the Fiery Avenger explode into a roaring inferno, a huge explosion of flame accompanied by a strained hissing as the weapon began to channel Heaven's own Wrath into it's aura.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I'm tired of this,&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>he said, speaking slowly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;I'm tired of listening to the rabble.  I'm tired of hearing about the triumph of darkness.  I'm tired of hearing about the follies of humans.  I'm tired of 'paladins' proclaiming themselves Emperor, calling themselves the Right Hand of their gods, running empires with an iron fist and calling judgement down on those undeserving of such.  Tired of the Balance.  Tired of the hypocrisy.  Tired of being told what I believe and what I should believe.  Who I should fear.  What I should fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He glanced around, searching the crowd.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;I have remained quiet for long enough.  I am not the Right Hand of Marr, nor am I his Avatar.  I am a Knight, simply a Knight, but know this.  I alone decide my enemies.  If I see you in Felwithe, and I see you fighting a fellow paladin, your life is forfeit.  If I see you in my home, fighting my kin, in North Freeport, or Kelethin, or my allies, your life is forfeit.  I will hunt you down and run you into the ground.  You can keep fighting me, and I will keep coming.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He scanned the crowd further, shifting his stance and resting more on his blade.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;To those of the darkness, I look forward to your day of reckoning.  Bring all the strength you can, you severely underestimate the strength of the Light.  To those who claim to represent the Light, and merely are mirror images of the hatelings, born of nothing but Innoruuk, I have no time for you any longer.  I tire of your ridiculous stance, and of your worthless slaughter of life.  To those wishing to impose themselves as Emperors, Gods, I have no time for you either.  If you choose to impose your will upon a friend of mine, your life is also forfeit.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A wry smile flickers across the paladin's face.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;To those of the Balance, the few of you hypocritical enough to tell me that my beliefs are wrong.  To tell me that I cannot speak my view and to tell me what I must believe.  Do so no longer.  I choose my own path and nothing anyone can say any longer will change that.  Any attempt to forcefully change me will be met with fierce resistance.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He shrugged and swung the inferno upon around his shoulder with ease.  He bowed slightly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;I guess that's all I have to say.  To those of you that chose to listen, heed my words.  Is it worthless posturing?  Probably.  Regardless, be well, all.  If any have issues with my words, I am easy to find when I wish to be found.  Come and talk to me.  To the rest of you.&quot;  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He smiled, genuinely.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  &quot;Enjoy your evening.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>With that, the inferno dimmed and the paladin slipped back into obscurity, leaving a few of the more drunken tavern regulars wondering whether they had been hallucinating.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tunyricllanower@firionavie>Tunyric Llanower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/03 4:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tiredness</span><hr size=1> Its good to see an ally in a place such as this Bakanome. I have often said before the shade came that the only measure of goodness is ones own heart. Us mortals were not meant to be the avatars of our gods. I am Not Tunares Chosen any more than you are Marrs. but why should we bother when a paladin claims a thrown. just keep relations amiacable and he might prove usefull someday. I too tire of hypocrisy even if i find myself speaking it from time to time. Its not for others to say what you should do with your life. I while i am admittadly very vocal in the tavern am not one to use my axe as a conversion tool. I merely speak and hope for a listener, and wake to find myself at war. My point dear baka is no one not Tunare not Erosli not the nameless itself can ask you to do anything else but what you feel is right. Follow your path, not your gods.
