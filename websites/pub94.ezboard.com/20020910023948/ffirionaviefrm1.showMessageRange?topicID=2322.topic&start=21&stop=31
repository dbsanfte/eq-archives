I am from the US with American English as my cradle tongue and I took offense at this one... and all the other stereo typing as well.<br>
<br>
The only time I found the French to be rude when I was in Paris (a few different times) was when the 'murican (person from the US who is a gimboyd tourist) was ruder and then had the audacity to claim the French person as rude.  BaH!  Granted, the French are probably a lot more likely to give you back in kind immediately rather than smiling to your face &amp; calling you an ass later (what I found out about Germans, but could apply to a lot of others).  But, I have a scad of stories about how a French person was being uber nice in the face of 'murican rudeness, so much so I was embarassed &amp; let the 'murican have a piece of my mind (including my father who went on &amp; on &amp; on about how the signs on the exhibits in le Louvre were in French with sheets at the door in all other languages... I asked him what about the National Gallery in DC, were those placards in anything but English.... the fact that he didn't get it was one of the things that greatly lowered him in my eyes).<br>
<br>
I think it is rather dangerous to characterise any race here of all places.  We have a pretty global server, as I keep getting more &amp; more surprised about since the non-native speakers seem to write pretty damn well.  We also have a pretty strong community.  With the racism and stereotyping IC with the whole thing about light &amp; dark, why have in in RL, too?<br>
<br>
Base your assessments for earth languages as Norrathian one on the -sounds- of the language rahter than some 'murican racial/cultural stereotyping.<br>

I lived in Germany for 4 years &amp;, for all intents and purposes, &quot;came of age&quot; while I was there.  I'm jsut sad to say my semi-fluent German is horridly rusty from no use, and my barely-fluent in French has faded to a collection of words and some knowledge of grammar.<br>
<br>
Those of you who converse freely &amp; with great expression in both languages have nothing but respect from me.<br>
<br>
Though it is amusing, at times, to get /tells in French because my character's name is French (&amp; intentionally chosen for the translations).  I know enough to say I don't know much.  Though I still love seeing French and wish I could go back to learning it.<br>

But for role playing purposes.... no sane RP oriental character would actually use a Naginata, because naginatas are the symbolic weapons of the peasant class. <br>

That's right.  Naginata has always been associated with the Japanese ashigaru class.... the poorly-trained peasant militia. <br>
<br>
A self-respecting samurai, or any of the elite classes, would never be caught dead wielding a naginata.  Just like no self-respecting European knight in shining armor would be caught dead wielding a pitchfork (the symbolic weapon of medieval European peasants).<br>

<br>
Yes and no.  <br>
<br>
To me, dragons are not distinctly oriental.  Every culture on Earth has believed in dragons in one way or another.  It's strange to say why.  But one theory as to why dragons exist in the mythology of every single culture on earth?  Simple theory.... because real dragons called dinosaurs roamed the earth at one point.  And that knowledge of large terrible lizards has gone done from ancient cavemen down to early civilizations. <br>
<br>
The Bible mentions terrible reptilian dragons. By all accounts, many scientists say that the Biblical description of the dragons are exactly like Brontosaurus or Apatosaurus. Coincidence? <br>
<br>
The Babylonian temples have heiroglyphs of &quot;animals&quot; that look exactly like dinosaurs. The Babylonians claim that these &quot;animals&quot; were very commonly caught by their explorers and conquering armies who ventured into Africa and then brought them back home to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). The kicker here is that the Babylonians considered them NOT as monsters but as common every day animals.  The same way that a lion was an animal. The same way that the dog is an animal.  They were so commonly sighted that they had catalogued these dinosaur-looking reptiles as ordinary common animals that they saw and captured all the time.  The best possible theory is that surviving dinosaurs were still in numbers as recent as Babylonian times (3000+ years ago) <br>
<br>
In the lush jungles and forests of Asia, including China, you typically can find lizard species that grow into immense sizes.  China is also the home to MANY MANY MANY flying lizard species (also in South America).  Also would be the perfect environment for leftover dinosaurs to survive into modern times (assuming many of them really did survive the Ice Ages).  Thus, there are plenty of reasons why the ancient Chinese would be convinced there were tremendous-sized lizards roaming their lands.... hence the strong belief in dragons. <br>
<br>
P.S.  Shintou...... 99% of Chinese dragon tales are of a benevolent kind.  Chinese dragons are not a good candidate for comparing with megalomaniac evil treasure-hoarding EQ dragons.  Chinese dragons were portrayed as wise, benevolent, bestowing blessings upon mankind, providing rains, answering prayers, etc.  These were not the type you went out and beheaded for phat lewtz. <br>
<br>
Chinese dragons were the &quot;lungs&quot;. I read a couple of books about chinese dragons.  They mentioned altogether roughly 30+ type of chinese dragons.  Of that count, only 2 dragons (lungs) were considered evil malevolent types. <br>
<br>
the T'ien Lung (Celestial Dragon) was the granddaddy of all chinese dragons.... they were of almost demigod type powers, and ruled the heavens and skies and mingled with the gods. <br>
<br>
Japanese dragons are a bit more violent in nature, but not too much more. <br>
<br>
European dragons were always evil.... and during medieval times were pretty much linked to the devil. <br>
<br>
And next time.... maybe I will ramble about vampires of the world. And how almost every ancient culture in the world has a native word for vampire. <br>

<br>
I had similar thoughts on dragons not quite being the Asian-style, at least not the very LIMITED exposure I've had to both EQ and Chinese/Japanese dragons.  For one thing, they don't even look like them...<br>
<br>
And Nagafen has kobolds for servants.  Why not have the highest-end equipment kobolds could make!  Or, it could all be from a common root, Elder Dragon mutating to Dragon influencing the linguistic evolution of Kobold mutating to Elder Teir'Dal mutating to Teir'Dal...<br>
<br>
Given the vast changes that can occur between each linguistic step, I really don't feel like trying to say which would be Japanese.  Not only am I really unqualified for that kind of game-design speculation, I don't hold any real awe for one particular culture over another (RL or EQ) so don't have a personal need to make the time for such a research project!  *whew*<br>
<br>
But I do like to have a historical point-to from time to time, cause it's a great way to throw tons of un-planned-for ideas into the mix. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 796<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/18/02 12:57:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2322.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rei (and: EQ languages in RL)</span><hr size=1> Maladominus, I meant EQ dragons have a Japanese feel to them.<br>
