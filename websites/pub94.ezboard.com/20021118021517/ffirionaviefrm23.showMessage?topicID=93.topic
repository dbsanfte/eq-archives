Why ? Because it has little to do with the poem Kimaya wrote. Oocly, i like the poem. Ic-ly, i cant. And of course, Silenae cannot agree.  /ooc)<br>

Neutral.. what is it. I already said that i cannot fathom it. I truly can. I heard an explanation earlier. Part of it went<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
 I can take the good with the bad and make it work to my advantage, but for me, I don't have to choose sides. The sides come to me and I make the decision of what I want to do. There is no God for me to fear enough to use his name to do what I want to do. There is no God for me to love so much I'd do anything &quot;righteous&quot; for. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Is that neutral ? Or is it opportunistic - choosing whatever seems fitting for said situation ? I would label it such. And the more i think about it, the more i am certain that there are several differnet kinds of people calling themselves 'neutral'.<br>
<br>
There are those like the feline, whom i quoted. Opportunistic is what i would call them. Choosing whom to support on whoever offers them most. There are less nice words to call them, but i wont.<br>
<br>
There are those who simply dont do anything. They watch. They record. They dont act.. those are the true fence sitters. They choose no side, and they truly need none. But they dont do much anyhow.<br>
<br>
And there are those who strive for true balance. Aiding the weaker side, with little care to what gains them most profit. I have met very few of those.<br>
<br>
Which of them are the true neutrals ? Or is this all a delusion the Lord of Hate put in my mind to confuse me ? No, i will never understand 'neutral'. I can describe it. I can label it. But understand.. no.<br>
<br>
To those who call me evil, i am not. I am what i am, and i do what i do. But i do not consider myself evil. That is a label stuck on me by those who dislike what i do. It is them who do the labeling. Meddlign with death is wrong. Animating bones is wrong. Hate is wrong. Fear is wrong. Sacrificing others to appease a god is wrong. Pain is bad. So they call me evil, because all that is something i do. Because it is something i believe in.<br>
<br>
And they call themselves good. They say love is good. Healing is good. Upholding life is good. But i do not agree. Love is a myth dreamt up by Minstrels to seduce innocent young lasses. Healing is fitting only if the subject deserves to be healed. Upholding useless life is wasting the little you have. Waste equals want not.<br>
<br>
Call me and others what you want. I will continue to judge from what i see. Those who despise me for my actions earn my hate. Those who consider me misguided, and try to bring me to a path of love and healing, earn my scorn. And those who watch, waiting for one or the other to fall, so they can swoop in and clean up the mess, will get their own label : opportunistic vultures.<br>
<br>
Good, Evil, Neutral - i have grown sick of those labels stuck on people by those who think everyone needs to have one. I deny wearing mine any longer. I am what i am and what i do.  <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

I don't expect you to thoroughly understand Neutrality. Nor do I expect anybody to grasp my views. After all, as stated before, those were my opinions...not everybody elses, just as your statements are yours. I do think you grasp it more than you think though as you can see the differences there are.  I think there are many gray areas between the three, but the labels are there and won't ever go away for this is not a Utopia. <br>
<br>
I assure you though, a vulture I am not. I can not peck eyes out with a beak, but I can surely scratch them out with my claws. <br>

And if you check what i wrote, you will surely realize that. But i do hope you understand that everyone is taking sides.. at all times. There are no more than two sides to a coin. Any action you take will end up on one of those sides.The only ones which dont, those are the vultures.. those are also not doing anything. They merely watch.<br>
<br>
You say you can side. But when will you ? When won't you. That  makes the difference between those who care, and those who dont. If anyone would ask me what i consider evil - i would name those who ony do things for their personal gain. That, in my eyes is the true sign of evil. Ultimate selfishness and dishonor.<br>
<br>
In the end,  i do agree.. the labels are there, and will remain. But fortunately, i dont have to like it.  And i dont. I wont use the label, in the end. Just as i dont use the other three.. good, bad, neutral. I try to judge people for what they are. But those who act like vultures i will treated alike. It doesnt matter if they use claws, beaks, swords or magic. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

<br>
They don't. You can choose to go antagonize folks, but that responsibility falls on you. Not them. It therefore becomes a reflection of your philosophy, not theirs. And thus the whole point of this discussion is derailed.<br>
<br>
For example, I understand there is some big war going on between the Iksar and the Sarnak down on Kunark. I don't care. I don't oppose either, I don't help either. It isn't my problem. It isn't even my continent... it is theirs. That doesn't make me an enemy or friend of either side.<br>
<br>
Now, one of those folks wants to go attack me, we can be enemies. But then it reflects THEIR active application of belief, not mine. Your argument implies that in such a situation (a war with 2 sides) that everyone is on one or the other - and I just gave you a clear example of how that isn't so.<br>
<br>
&quot;All those who aren't for us are against us!&quot; is the battlecry of the fanatic. It does reflect their views, but it doesn't make them true. It has far more to do with propaganda and inciting action than a dispassionate view of reality.<br>

In said example, it is quite simple, isnt it ? Lets assume you walk past the Iksar. They know you dont work with them. So you might be a spy for the Sarnak. Of course, they could take the time to try and extract knowledge from the Gnome before them. But knowing Iksar, that would be very painful, and knowing Gnomes, it would also be pointless.

And that was the point of this discussion, wasn't it?<br>
<br>
As I keep pointing out... you evil folks are more than welcome to believe anything you want. Including blatantly false stuff that fills your need to justify what you do. It won't make it true - but then again, for some of you, that doesn't matter. It isn't really about truth, is it?<br>
<br>
Perhaps that is an element of neutral philosophy that you just don't get. The way things ARE (reality) is more important that what ought to be (desires). I strive to match my perceptions to reality. I accept that your ability to reason and understand the way things actually are is severely compromised by your philosophy. That doesn't mean I have to jump on the bandwagon and accept the same warped baseline for my understanding of the world.<br>
<br>
Unlike you, I can actually see the lines - I am not blinded by my beliefs. It does make it alot easier to stay the course. And as to those iksar? Well, I prefer to let them speak for themselves, rather than have you do so. Somehow, I don't trust your ability to convey unbiased information about your 'enemies'.<br>

Actually soft skin, you cannot see the way things are. None of you soft skins can, you all have exceptionally warped and twisted views as well as morals. We Iksar have realized what Norrath is, what the reality of it is, and what has to be done for it to change from it's current, endless cycle of pointless death. And, as you said, just because you creatures believe it to be different, does not change the truth. Soft skins are flawed, inferior beings. That is not an insult, it's merely the truth.<br>
 <br>
For us Iksar, it is not a matter of &quot;with us, or against us&quot;. It is a matter of if you are an Iksar or not, and then, if you are a traitor or not. Iksar who do not serve the Empire are killed. All other creatures will eventually be our enemy, even if you are not at the moment, unless you submit to our rule. We would not attack you because you didn't side with us over the Sarnak, we would attack you because you are our enemy, or a more circumstance based reason, such as you were invading our territory. There might be times when we would not kill you, but that depends on circumstance, and know that eventually, one day, we will fight eachother. <br>
<br>
It is not out of hatred or anger we fight you, although Thule knows we have every reason to hate you creatures, we do not. It is a simple matter of duty, and doing what has to be done. Call us Iksar what you like, but to me, it's quite clear that the only true evil are those who oppose us and Cazic-Thule, trying to damn Norrath to the same fate it's been held captive too for centuries. <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/bseh42/images/zilsig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 6/15/02 2:11:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 564<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/15/02 2:50:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neutrality</span><hr size=1> I don't agree with you, scaleyskin...

Your arguments are logical... false because they are based on flawed premises, but at least logical. And while you seem quite assured of the course of future history, I am not so. So I am not offended by the potential of future enmity.<br>
<br>
And if it has to come to it, one day, where you all throw yourselves against the magic and technology of Ak'Anon in some misguided effort to enslave us... so be it. I can always use new luggage, but it would be a real shame.<br>

Then again, it is already a real shame that the dark elves are so cranky that they have to go out and invent enemies where none need exist. So very glad I don't worship a vicious, manipulative, controlling jerk with divine powers.<br>

 <br>
The human philosopher Kamael Khan once said: &quot;If you wish to know about war, ask a warrior. If you wish to know about warfare, ask a historian.&quot; In order to really understand something, one needs distance from it, to see it all at once.<br>
<br>
Silenae, your two-sided &quot;with me or against me&quot; view is typical of warriors. Fighters in any conflict only want two sides, because it's easier that way. Show me who to kill. Don't ask me to think about it. <br>
<br>
You're either for me or against me. <br>
<br>
You condemn stereotypes, and rightly so. Stereotypes are created to reduce the need for thought, yet the &quot;for me or against me&quot; view <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> eliminates</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> any need for thought. As Ellywig pointed out, it also fails to recognize the shades that exist between black and white.<br>
<br>
Life is not that simple. You can force it to be, but you lose a lot of perspective, and a lot of chances to experience it. In the end, that may be the best part of neutrality: the opportunity to experience any part of any given situation. On different days you can be black, white, or any of the shades of gray.<br>
<br>
This does not mean that neutrality has to be selfserving or causeless. It can be selfish and opportunistic, but so can black or white. It can also be selfless, as in the example you gave of those who side with the underdog in any conflict in an attempt to balance things for the sake of balance. <br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
In my case, I'm a Sah'madi, which can be translated in two ways: either as &quot;One Who Brings Hope or Cool Water&quot; or as &quot;One Who Releases.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sah'madi believe Life is a force, an energy that exists in all living things. We believe that, in many beings, this force is trapped, held there beyond the time that it should have been released. We release these energies because they are a threat to the natural order of life. We do not believe in &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, because meanings change over time, depending on who you ask. There is only &quot;existence&quot; and &quot;non-existance&quot;. Material gain does not matter to us. We do look for items that allow us to stay alive, and hopefully in one piece or as close as we can. <br>
<br>
Each of us serves to aid the Ebb and Flow of Life. Though some view Sah'madi as evil, we are not. We are completely impartial. <br>
<br>
The prophet Gan'zhra, who foresaw the coming of the Sah'madi, wrote: &quot;Every end is a new beginning, and in every beginning there is hope; therefore, do the Sah'madi bring hope to the damned*...&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you in some way to gain a new perspective on the places between black and white. <br>

<br>
I half agree with that. But only half. For, that way only eliminates the need for thought, if you add that someone else decides what is 'for' and 'against'. I on the other hand make that choice myself. So i do recognize all shades that exist, but i force them into the simple matrix.. with me, or not with me. And those who's actions have never been judged will end up on either side based on what i percieve them to do.<br>
<br>
It does not mean they are unable to cross the line. But each time they are encountered, they are judged. And every time they are found to be 'against me' will leave a mark. With enough marks, their actions will no longer matter, and they will be judged on their marks alone.<br>
<br>
Shades only exist if you look from far enough. Broken down in single actions, it is black or white. With or against. Not, as many say, good or evil. For good and evil are burdoned with expectations.<br>
<br>
What you call the option of neutrality.. that is something i claim for myself too. I make the decisions as they fall. And sometimes, my actions would fit what commonly is called good, and sometimes, my ctions would fit what commonly is called evil. Yet i still bear the mark of evil, handed out by those who think to classify the world. <br>
<br>
I can only repeat.. i am not evil. I am what i am what i am. I believe in hatred, i follow a path which shows little compassion, and i meddle with the powers of death. I believe that nothing can be achieved without proper sacrifice. I do what is needed to show to the world that true power lies in hatred, not compassion, that love is a myth dreamt up by minstrels who sought to seduce young maidens.<br>
<br>
I still bleed if i am cut. I feel pain and loss. And i feel delight, too. I heed my word, maybe even stronger than those who lay claim to goodness.  Honor is not without meaning to me. But all that does not matter to those who place the label on me. Evil.<br>
<br>
Neutrality can mean many things... yes.. i agree with that. But that does not make it any easier to understand. Everyone, everything can claim to be netural. Even i could claim that label for me. Many of the things described fit me just as well as they fit anyone else. So i still am no closer to understandign those who come to me, claiming 'Do nto worry, i am neutral'. What do they want to tell me ?  <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

<br>
You can be neutral if there is a conflict between two others, especially if none of those are your close friends.<br>
<br>
But you as individual can never be neutral. Because there are too many things you yourself are involved. And your family background, the history of your race, your teachers, your experiences and so on have coined you. As soon as you have a conflict with somebody else, you are yourself. And this is not neutral.<br>
<br>
The only thing you can strive for is balance. A community where all different races, religions and beliefs are equal. To achieve that is very very hard, and you need much tolerance, modesty and patience.<br>
That's what I dream of (I don't dare to say I can be reached some time). But I still keep my identity as a Teir'dal necromancer, follower of Innoruuk. Therefore, I am not neutral, nor can I alone represent balance. <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>

<br>
But anyways, I don't gots conflicts with others either, and the close friends I have are in all sides of the conflicts that do happen.  But I'm also not really neutral...  I'm not indifferent in what happens to peoples, I care VERY MUCH what happens to them.  I HAVE a position on the stupid wars that are going on and it's that they're hurting and killing peoples just for the sake of hurting and killing.<br>
<br>
Okies, so that's called neutral.  And caring about peoples is called &quot;lightbringer&quot; by some and &quot;evil traitor&quot; by others, depending on which prejudices they gots.  Like I said in my poem, I don't care.  But if you're gonna call me neutral, I gots a few words that might help you understand what this &quot;neutrality&quot; is.<br>

But that is not the way the world works. <br>
<br>
There are so many things you creatures never take into consideration. Religion, population, resources, territory, ownership, differences and hatreds. Do you really think that we Iksar could ever co exsist alongside soft skins? We could not, your ways of life completely contradict and undermine ours, we would have no desire to walk among you creatures or to let you walk among us. It would not work. If we were to stop trying to conquer Kunark, do you think that would solve everything? Then we Iksar would only have one city, with limited resources, and we'd eventually all starve.  How would you divide territory? Do you think gods such as Innoruuk would ever allow peace unless they are slain? Do you think we Iksar would abandon Cazic-Thule's will?<br>
<br>
As long as there are seperate nations, they will fight, they will war, and they will conquer. The only way this will ever change is if we Iksar can conquer the world through fear and slay the gods of our enemies. We are the only race capable of ruling Norrath without repeating the cycle. Multiple nations cannot exsist. Cazic-Thule's will cannot be denied.<br>
<br>
But I don't expect this to be understood. You creatures will continue to believe that Norrath is really some peaceful place, and there are a few creatures disrupting that peace, rather then seeing it for what it is.
