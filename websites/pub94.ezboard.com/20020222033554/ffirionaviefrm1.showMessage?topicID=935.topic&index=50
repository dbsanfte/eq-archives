I really only know the monk class, so I can say that that only really prevents farmers from getting to one item.  The fighting baton drops from a level 32 mob.  It typically goes for  500pp.  In EC or North Freeport on other servers, most of the prices I hear  are in the thousands of pp.  Is the loss of a measly 500pp item (not that he'd ever get that much for it on such a weird economy like this server has) going to keep someone who just wants to farm from coming here?  If he's a real pharmer, a real jerk, then he'd be camping the fungi tunic or some of those nice H2H Luclin weapons.  TLC won't keep him from getting those items.  <br>
<br>
How much stuff that is really worth being farmed comes from a mob less than 34?  Some, yes, but not really enough to justify the stress that TLC puts on all of us for quest items.<br>

<br>
Where is the Post from VI saying that the TLC on FV was ONLY to prevent farmers?  <br>
<br>
Again baseless suppositions and rants.   You can go to the EQ Home page and search the Devel board and find where I am getting my 'factual' information regarding the intention of TLC items, such as epic pieces to be 'obtained with the help of lower level players'.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I though Bjord's original argument was that the TLC is broken and makes quests Impossible.  Having failed to prove this claim, Bjord is now attempting to argue semantics and spread 'fear of famers' into the anti-TLC argument.  To quickly address his new 'claim', there is farming without the TLC as well, so removing it will not address the issue of farm, and thus 'Bjord's Farming Argument' does not support removinig the TLC to address farming.<br>
<br>
Just because you are unable to deal with something does not mean that it is broken.   Just because you cannot level race, and get every and any item you want in a second does not mean it is broke.  Just because you cannot simply Level race to 50, then go and clean out all the 'greenie' mobs  for those nice items you want, does not mean that the TLC is broken or bad.<br>
<br>
The TLC, and the other rule sets of FV work just fine.  They  set up a DIFFERENT game where Leveling is the NOT the priority.   Just becase you cannot use your 'Old world server tactics,' does not warrent a change in the TLC.  How about learning to play with in the rules of the searver?    <br>
<br>
Again, anyone have any Hard data why the TLC is Broken or makes the game unplayable?  And again, the basic anti-TLC argument is 'IT'S TOO HARD NOW, CHANGE IT'.<br>

<br>
If the Anti-TLC argument is:<br>
<br>
The TLC is broken and does not work as intended.  It prevents questing and thus warrents removel.<br>
<br>
Where are specific factual examples to support this claim.<br>
a) That the TLC operates outside its intended use.<br>
b) Quests are unsolvable because of the TLC.<br>
c) A &amp; B are sufficent and prolific enough to warrent remove of the TLC.<br>
<br>
My 'Pro-TLC' Argument is that there is not specific factual evidence to meet the above, and thus the 'Anti-TLC' arguement is based  on opinion and dislike of a core rule of the FV server, rather than factual evidence of damage to the intended game play on FV.<br>

It does not make quest completion impossible if you have spoiler and if you have lots of resources (multiple comps/accs, plat, etc).  If TLC was in place on other servers, I would not have be able to solve the quests I did.  I don't mean complete -- I could have done that if someone else had solved them for me.  I mean it's not possible to do many quests from scratch with TLC and without spoilers.<br>
<br>
I did not and do not read VI board's.  I read these boards and pretty much everyone here was writing that TLC was intended to stop farmers.  That's ludicrous, since it doesn't stop farming.  If that's not the intent, then I have a problem with both the intent and the implementation.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I do not level race.  I've got 8 days played and am only 21.  If I level-raced, I'd be about 50 and I wouldn't have bothered mastering all languages.  I do not farm nor do I have a problem with those who do.  I do not have any problem with getting around the TLC myself.  I never said I did.  I've said it several times.  You keep coming back and saying I've got a problem getting around it.  I don't.  I've played 3 characters to post-50, one to 60.  Getting around TLC is no big deal for me even without reading spoilers because I did a lot of these quests back before there were spoilers.<br>
<br>
My problem is that TLC forces people to wait for other servers to solve quests and post spoilers.  It forces people to read these spoilers, weigh the reward and effort, and then work around the TLC instead of playing through the quest.  TLC hurts newbies, many of whom do not want to be spoiled.  It hurts people that don't scrounge for spoilers.  It hurts people that want to figure out quests for themselves.  It hurts those that don't have two accounts and two computers.  It hurts those that don't have a large stack of plat to pay lowbies.<br>
<br>
All of these things mean that TLC is good for people like me and really bad for most others.  I personally do not like an elitist atmosphere, even if it favors me.  That's what TLC fosters and it's the main reason I want it gone.  There are secondary reasons that are nearly important, too, though.  For one, not one single quest was designed with TLC in mind.  It's an afterthought that isn't really supported.  This makes questing doubly hard, since a quest bug here effects such a small number of people that it's not worth VI's time to fix it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uruss386.showPublicProfile?language=EN>russ386</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 11:07:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=935.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm.</span><hr size=1> Denoi and Calare were able to complete quests without spoiler sites, true, but that really doesn't mean that those who are higher level than they are don't deserve to complete the quests.  TLC says to people who want to level, &quot;You're not welcome here&quot;.  &quot;In fact, we have a code in place that makes levels bad.&quot;  Then why not remove levels?  Make all mobs level 1.  VI could probably do it, with a little effort.  I just don't understand why the challenge of TLC is really necessary. It makes FV kind of elitist, in my opinion, like it's only for experts who ONLY care about quests.   I could write more, but it's New Year's Eve and I'm going to go party.  <br>

(Oh, yeah.  Maybe we should move the TLC discussions into their own special section.  Maybe the FV ruleset forum?) <p>Tenzin Dralha <BR>

Only Vah Shir can run those quests, as they're all started by turning in your Acryllia slate, and only Vah Shir can get those slates.<br>
<br>
But I understand your point.  Yes, if you want to run a newly introduced quest in the future, you won't be able to (if it starts by killing something that is lower than your current level allows).  No two ways around that... it's going to be a fact of life on this server.<br>
<br>
However, what is the alternative?  Remove TLC altogether?  The cure would be worse than the symptom.  And while the complaints outnumber the defenders on this board (or so it would appear) I think this is more because people who are satisfied don't put time into rants outlining the fact.  I think the majority of players on this server are like myself:  it makes us work harder, but doesn't make it impossible. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>
