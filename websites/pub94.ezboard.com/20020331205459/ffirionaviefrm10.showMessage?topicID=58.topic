<br>
The Lavastorm Mountain Range was hot as usual, but on this day, the combat on the mountains made the day seem even hotter..<br>
<br>
*Clang! Swipe Clang!*<br>
<br>
Two Fighters, one wielding his sword for the Darkness of Hate and Rage, and the other, his weapon bringing light to those that need..<br>
<br>
*Clang Chang!* And these two fighters weapons clanged against eachother, interlocking, now a battle of strenght ensuing..<br>
A smirk on the lips of the Dark one, slowly he chanted a spell as the two Knights stood locked in combat, a cloud of disease infecting the Knight of the Light, casuing him to grasp at his stomach in pain. <br>
An opening, So the Darkone took it. His sword striking the Paladin across his back, knocking him to the ground. Aother swipe across his side was felt throught the banded armor, sending him rolling across the scorching earth. As he returned to his feet, he noticed that his strenght was gone..<br>
Another spell, to weaken him was cast..<br>
<br>
And then the Shadow Knight took advtange. Quick movements, bringing his blade across the Paladins stomach, and in a spinning motion he doubled this effect, before bringing the blade to its blunt side, and smacked the paladin on his side, bringing him left, right into his blade as he thrusted it foward, the Chainmail turning aside the blade slightly.. but not enought to stop the damage from behind done.<br>
The paladin fell to his knees, the pain overcoming him as his Duelist stood above him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not ready to have you die just yet, Halfelven fool!&quot; And a upwards slice send the paladin off of his feet and up into the sky, falling backwards upon his back.<br>
Another spell saped at his life, taking his lifeblood and giving it to this dark Knight..<br>
<br>
&quot;And now it ends elf. Your suffering will end and you will become a sacrifice to my lord and Father, Innoruuk. Prepare yourself to die, by this Techinque of the Kage No Samurai!*&quot;<br>
<br>
And as he spoke those words, the free hand of the Darkelf lit up in a light flame.. and then he brought it right to the face of the paladin as he called out the cry for the attack..<br>
<br>
&quot;Burning Knuckle!&quot; And the flaming fist stoke the paladin directly in his face, charing and burning him with the powerful magical strike, knocking him out along the ground.<br>
<br>
The Samurai simply stood up, turning his back and smirking, looking to the Druid who was travling with this Young Paladin.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you, Child of Tunare, shall be next.&quot; The Darkone said, walking slowly towards the Druid, who was overcome with fear from the Burtality she saw, backing up.. Afraid?..<br>
<br>
Then it happened..<br>
<br>
&quot;What! I .. I cannot See! What Magic is this!&quot; <br>
<br>
The blindness spell burned his eyes, forcing them shut as he groaped around blindly, the Darkone was totally helpless..<br>
<br>
He could only hear the slashed against his Patchwork armor.<br>
<br>
And he could only feel the pain as he was knocked to the ground..<br>
<br>
And the pain was sharp as that blade found his dark heart, running him throught instantly..<br>
<br>
And behind him.. holding the weapon<br>
Was the paladin, His magics completly healing him from Shintou's crushing attacks..<br>
And the effects of Shintou's spells, worn off of his body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark one. Lesson Number 1. Overconfidence will always lead to your defeat!&quot; And he flung the dying elf off of his weapon, letting him fall in a heap of his own blood along the ground..<br>
<br>
As he died.. only one word eminated from Shintou's lips..<br>
<br>
&quot;Revenge...&quot;<br>
~End~<br>
