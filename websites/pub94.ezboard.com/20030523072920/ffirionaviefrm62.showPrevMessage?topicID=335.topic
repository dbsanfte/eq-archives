As a reason for invading Iraq, the world was given the rationale that this country had nuclear/chemical/biological weaponry.  Few countries other than England, Bulgaria, and Poland bought that argument.<br>
American troops, and 12 years of UN Weapons Inspectors, have yet to produce any evidence of the existence of such materiel.<br>
<br>
North Korea announced today that it *has* nuclear weapons.  For several months before today's news, NK has threatened to fire up a nuclear power plant.  Yet the Bush administration doesn't seem to care about an *actual* rogue nation.  Instead, they chase at the old bugbears that they placed into power, and throw up a smokescreen to confuse the American public.  No &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; have yet been found in Iraq.  They do not exist.  And yet, halfway across the world, we have a Stalin-loving dictator that openly defies international laws, runs a country that can't even provide food and electricity to its own people, and makes public annoucements about how little it cares about the world's opinion.  But this all is OK with the Government Appointed by Florida?  I'm very curious how you conservatives try to justify this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarkellraven>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed of Bristlebane</span><br>  Posts: 2388<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/26/03 5:15:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons of Mass Destruction.</span><hr size=1> Well, I'm obviously not conservative.<br>
<br>
However, to put it simply, Iraq did not pose a serious danger.  North Korea does.  War with North Korea could be dangerous for a variety of reasons, and could lead to either a brutally long war or a brutally short one, involving nuclear missiles.  We're not at war with North Korea because we can't be.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this teaches exactly the lesson we didn't want to teach, namely that to avoid the teranny of the United States, one must defend one's nation with Weapons of Mass Destruction, and have the delievery systems to use them.  Thus, we encourage WMDs as well as make ourselves the big bad guy to be defended against.<br>
<br>
Of course this was part of the reason I was against the Iraqi war, the other being that increased anger towards the United States would lead to a serious upswing in terrorism.  We'll see if I'm right in that fear.  I hope I am not.<br>

<br>
Let's say we find absolutely no WMD in Iraq.  None.  Nada.  Was the conflict still worth it?  Damn right it was.  The Iraqi people are now free of a dictator who was in power way too long.  We'll see how they follow it up with a new government.<br>
<br>
But I believe Iraq had WMDs before the war.  They may be buried.  They might have been evacuated to another country.  Or they might not have had any after all.  Anything is possible.  But I do believe Iraq had them, and, as such, the cease-fire of 1991 was null and void.<br>
<br>
So, why didn't we go for North Korea, too?  Simple.  Fight one conflict at a time.  It was my understanding that North Korea was still talking earnestly with us about the situation.<br>
<br>
But you tell me--is there a U.N. resolution that states that North Korea cannot have any WMD?  It's not a smartass question.  I really don't know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elsbetsquishytoes>elsbet squishytoes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Grey</span><br>  Posts: 797<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/26/03 5:33:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons of Mass Destruction.</span><hr size=1> We're on the same page, Jark.  I'm just trying to figure out the Republicans' side of the argument, because, to me, it holds absolutely no value.  We invaded Iraq, because, erm, it had WMD that we, with our very impressive array of technology and years of surveillance, are not able to produce?  We can pinpoint the location of a supposed leader of Al-Qaeda in a truck in Yemen, yet we can't find the location of Iraq's Top Secret A-Bomb Factory, where we've been a constant presence for over a decade?<br>
<br>
I know we are scared to piss of North Korea, because a fight with China would not be fun for anyone, but I'm just questioning the basic logic behind invading Iraq and not NK.

N Korea already is.  Even if they don't have nukes, Seoul would be devastated within hours of a war -- it's in artillery range.  If the N Koreans do have nukes, then Japan may vanish, too.<br>

<br>
1) To stop the Iraqi from attempting to make or already having BNC WMDs in violation of the UN cease fire agreement. They have had over 12 years of training to hide them well, as so many have said before and should now heed their own words &quot;give them a little time&quot; to find them and ask your self &quot;Did you want Saddam Hussien to have BNC WMDs?&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) Suspected harboring and abetting international terrorist organizations of which proof is being found every day.<br>
<br>
3) To free the Iraqi people from an incredibly cruel and inhumane regime that was a blight on the world. Which no matter what you can say about any thing else is undisputable.<br>
<br>
To say that we shouldn't have gone in because there are other problems in the world is like saying you shouldn't bandage a slash in the leg while you are waiting for major heart surgery. Each one takes a different approach and time table. For all most of us know the War with Iraq may just be part of a larger strategy for North Korea and many other countries. It seems to be having a positive affect on their stance towards negotiating with the US so I would say the planners are much more astute than the detractors can imagine. <br>
<br>
The Anti-Bush and or Anti-American contingent has been crying doom and gloom from the beginning but so far they have been wrong every time. Now the objective is to find any reason to cast some doubt on what so far has been an incredibly successful plan and overall agenda.<br>
<br>
In international affairs most of us don't know but a small portion of what all is going on. Here in the US we have a shrinking group of Al Gore Jr. supporters who are still unhappy that the rules couldn't be bent to allow their choice of president to win the election that will try to find any thing they can to discredit the elected administration. Over seas we have many groups who just do not like the fact that the US is the only Super Power and the preeminent country in world and it is seeing to its interests. They also will try and and find any way they can to discredit America.<br>
<br>
The more things change the more they stay the same.<br>

Al Gore should have been elected. Also please do not label me a conservative. I am actually left of center, but there are times when certain actions need to be taken. <br>
<br>
Now with that said lets look at the WMDs. Hundreds of tons of chemical and biological agents were destroyed during the 12 years of inspections by the UN, but the US position is that Iraq was still hiding more. Even the UN thought there were probably more WMDs because they still wanted to go on with inspections. The US became tired of Iraq's bullshit and told them to come clean or pay the price. Iraq continued with the BS thinking they would be protected by the UN, but they were wrong.<br>
<br>
Now that Iraq has turned into a police action and the real search for WMDs is on all they SLWs are putting pressure on the coalition to come up with WMDs, but considering the UN weapons inspectors are morons the US already found the several tons of uranium underneath Bagdad in UN sealed drums. Now add to this the centrifuges that were found a month or so before the war started and you have proof that Iraq was still trying to make a nuclear bomb. (Centrifuges spin the low quality Uranium at extreme speeds creating significant G forces which causes the heavier isotope U238 to move to one side of the mass and leaves the lighter 232 and 235 in the other which results in a more easily fissionable material)<br>
<br>
I feel it is going to take a great tragedy to get many of you to understand the way the world works. Maybe when NK launches a nuke against Japan or another country will you see why the Bush administration is taking hard and heavy steps, but until a tragedy occurs you will continue to whistle your happy tunes ignoring the true tyranny of the world.<br>

You dont deal with every country the same way.. we tried dealing with Iraq through the peice of shit they call the UN for 10+ years with tons of sanctions etc that they broke continuously.. Iraq then tried to play it out like they were going to change their tune at the end to trick people like you into thinking they were good.  Iraqi scientists say that days before the war started ie. when they knew we were keeping our word to invade they began destroying some and moving others into Syria. <br>
<br>
Moving onto North Korea and Syria: I'm sure we will give them years of chances also to change their tune so dont worry your small little brain okay?<br>

Before the war dubya was saying - &quot;They will use them when we attack&quot;<br>

I mean come on.  Just admit that you were wrong, had no intelligence that they had WMD, and you made up all this crap up to justify the war.<br>

Wrong.  George Bush was elected in accordance with our Constitution.  If you have a problem with that, push for a change of the Electoral College system.<br>
<br>
The Electoral College system was put in place so that a candidate could spend time campaigning only in a few key places in order to win the popular election, and thus the Presidency.  As you can see by the famous red and blue &quot;No Mandate?&quot; map, Al Gore won a few key locations in the popular election, but he still didn't have a majority of the votes.  He was at 49%, but a few percentage points higher than Bush.<br>
<br>
If it were a purely popular election, at that time, Bush and Gore would have had a run-off, and the winner of that election would have been elected President.  The Electoral College system bypasses the run-off phase.<br>
<br>
Whether that is good or bad is for each person to decide.  But to say that George Bush &quot;stole&quot; the election is pure fallacy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brorafv>Brora FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/26/03 6:13:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons of Mass Destruction.</span><hr size=1> Jaranna -<br>

Most of us who believe that Al Gore should have been elected base this not on distaste with the Electoral College, but the very big, fat mess that was Florida.  Disenfranchised voters, hanging chads, dimpled chads, all kinds of fucked up chads, confusing ballots (voting for Buchanan instead of Gore because of the butterfly ballot)...<br>
<br>
There was so much shit that went on in Florida that if the votes had been properly made and counted, Gore likely would have come out the winner.  A difference of only a few votes, and at least so many votes screwed up.  That's why I consider the election stolen, partly by ill luck, and partly by purpose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaranna>Jaranna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 495<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/26/03 6:42:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons of Mass Destruction.</span><hr size=1> To go even further off-topic, I've seen the word &quot;disenfranchised&quot; used to describe the voters in Florida, and I'm not sure why it's used.<br>
<br>
According to Dictionary.com, the definition of disenfranchise (or disinfranchise) is &quot;to deprive of voting rights.&quot;<br>
<br>
I do not believe the people of Florida were at any time deprived of the right to vote.  They voted.  I also do not think that the punchcard ballot, as archaic and fallible as it may be, could be thought to disinfranchise the citizens of Florida.<br>
<br>
I agree with ballots being easy to understand and use, but I do not believe the outcome would have been any different with another ballot.  Of course, I do not live in Florida, so I may be off about that.  It's all a big &quot;what if?&quot; game that people refuse to stop playing.  We can play &quot;What if?&quot; all day and night, and it still doesn't prove anything.<br>
<br>
To put on Bush's shoulders the fault of a crappy polling system is sheer lunacy.<br>
<br>
Besides, it's almost 2004.  It's time to start focusing on the next election rather than focusing on the past.  If Bush really is not meant to be in office, it will show come November 2004. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnicholasfv>GnicholasFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/26/03 10:25:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons of Mass Destruction.</span><hr size=1> The search for WMD was only one of a few reasons cited for liberating Iraq.

What makes you think that NK isn't being discussed? It's a big world outside here, and we can't be everywhere at the same time. I would think that the NK issue is a bit sensitive, what with their big brother and all. I'm not sure that they pose a threat to us anyway.

They were counted in 3 counties ( the only ones Gore wanted counted) 4 times. When that failed to give him the go ahead he and his cronies started trying to recount them in more convient methods for him to win, you know if it sorta kinda maybe looks like someone might have been thinking about me we will count it. Or the arguement that they voted for the wrong person because the ballot was confusing. Excuse me, I used the exact same type of ballot and had zero problem lineing up the number with the hole to punch next to the name.<br>
<br>
If your to STUPID to read a ballot, maybe you shouldnt be voting.<br>
<br>
Bush won the election. To say other wise is sour grapes by the loser. The ballots have been recounted after the fact and guess what.... Bush won then too. The only person that tried to steal the election was Al Gore. When he couldnt win it through the legal ballot system he tried to have a democraticly controlled court make him winner. He failed at that too both at the local level and the supreme court level , the only court that sided with him was 7 democrats at the Florida supreme Court. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/27/03 12:23:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/DavidStrange/vamp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weapons of Mass Destruction.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>North Korea announced today that it *has* nuclear weapons.

North Korea has more to it than just your simple explanation, please do not simplify it so that it fits your idea.  As others have said we could not protect South Korea nor Japan (both of which N.Korea has a hatred for and are our allies).  To say that we don't care is downright spin.<br>

You like to call other people assholes for being smart asses (i.e. what you said to Hazkorn), but you make yourself one here.  I'm sorry Bush haters cannot understand that even though they recounted Gore's select counties they had to change the rules to make it come out in Gore's favor.  <br>
