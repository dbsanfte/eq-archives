align=left class=m><span class=title>   From the other side...</span><hr size=1> LOOK, Bush lost in '00. He's an stupid, cruel man who tortures and murders innocent people. He got what wasn't coming to him, and he stole the White House. To<br>
hold onto it he's agreed to maintain a constant state of &quot;war&quot; despite their being a declaration of it and commit atrocities far beyond anything that has been committed on the US.<br>
<br>
He's never had to keep his word. Not only that but he funds homicide dictators in countries all over the world<br>
and suspicions abound about his foreknowledge of terrorism in the U.S. <br>
<br>
If Nixon had survived Watergate and continued as president you bet we would have being doing the same thing right now. Bush is no better than Nixon. If anything, lying and bugging the Democrats was righteous compared to what Bush has done and continues to do.<br>
<br>
What the hell are any of you doing, saying we should buy into this so-called threat to humanity? Why shouldn't Bush be forced out of office? You can and you will make him do what you tell him to do, or call in the UN to restore democracy.<br>
<br>
How dare you imply that the United States has succeeded thus far?<br>
<br>
Do you live in fear that you can be arrested and executed for terrorism without lawyer or trial? Hell yes! Your liberty is being stolen in ways you never thought possible. <br>
<br>
I can't believe the uniformed masses who claim freedom of speech isn't being jeaporadized. Those freedoms are your right, the right of everyone! People worked, sweated and died for you to have the freedom you are in danger of losing. If an illegal govenment decides this includes stomping the piss out of Saddam Hussein then STAND UP AND OPPOSE THEM!<br>
<br>
Iraq may not be better but rights are taken slowly and don't let your right to criticise, oppose injustice and question authority go first!  The front lines of the battle for freedom may be in your neighbourhood even more than in any foreign land.<br>
<br>
I'd say move to Canada but we do have problems here too. I sure as hell wouldn't mind having you here. It might help prevent the kind of treasonous coup de'tat you had from ever happening here! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 372<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/6/02 1:50:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://noirdaila.homestead.com/files/ZDoll.JPG width=83 height=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: From the other side...</span><hr size=1> Kreelos .. take a step back from the crack pipe okay?<br>
<br>
First ... drop the damned election bs.  People say he won People say he lost blah blah blah will go on FOREVER.  Unless people just shut the fuck up and say hey he is in office and thats the way it is.<br>
<br>
You think that he has agreed to maintain a constant state of war ... okay so he coconspired to have the World Trade Towers blown up ... yeah shut the fuck up again please.  There was no war before that happened now was there?<br>
<br>
Yeah America is fucked up we pay off other countries that do some sick shit.  Don't ask me why I can't tell you but Bush isn't the first nor will he be the last president to do so.  Go check up Clinton or any other presidents record.  Hell the American government has been paying nations that sell drugs to not produce the crop just because its been that hard to stop it from incoming ... this isn't Bush alone although he is not innocent.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of this ... okay you may find it okay to fly planes into buildings and kill people but the majority of people don't.  Mmm'kay ?  You got that?  Yes there is a threat to humanity.  It has been happening for the past 40+ years between Palestine and Israel with both sides being completely and utterly stupid about it but you know something it is spilling over now.  So yeah the world has a different reactions.  <br>
<br>
Let's see Nixon ... poor guy should have been in a mental hospital for being constantly afraid.  But he broke the law and he lost his job for it and his name is forever marred ... more than what most criminals pay for crimes much worse than ... *gasp* spying on election plans.<br>
<br>
As for the US being successful?  I think there has been progress am I still afraid that something will happen .. well yes I always will be until people start being rational.<br>
<br>
Am I afraid that I am going to get arrested and executed ... nah not unless I go and start fighting on the side of the enemy outside of the United States ... sorry your nice little comparison to Johnny Walker doesn't pan out so once again please shut the fuck up.  Get real wake up and realize that ... you should shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
As for Iraq no I don't think we should be over there ... but as demeaning as the peace agreement was if he crosses the line we slap his ass back down ... a lax enforcement is not an enforcement.<br>
<br>
Too bad Sliver won't post his good old American soldier asking if you want a cup of shut the fuck up because it does fit.  Quit talking out your ass. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Beguiler of the 58th Jewel</I><BR>

US foreign policy has always been about increasing our economic power, I'm not saying it's good or bad, that's just how it is.<br>
<br>
Two:  Why go after Iraq?  Because we can.  Afganistan didn't work, we didn't get our man, and we need a big high profile success, so get Hussain.  Is he a great guy?  Of course not.  He's not the worst either.  But he's sitting on Oil, the American people see him as an enemy, and he's someone we can kill.  PR move, quite frankly, with a touch of oil control, not bad.  Actually seems pretty stupid to me, how many world wars started there?  But c'est la vie.<br>
<br>
Three:  Yes, Bush lost the election.  No we can't do anything about it.  But he's still a terrible president (How many vacations has the man taken while we're at war?).  He does however have a lot of intelligent people working with him, wether you agree with his politics or not.    <br>
<br>
And Four:  War is always about power.  If it were for humanitarian reasons, we wouldn't be killing people.  But remember this always... just because we're fighting against an evil, doesn't mean we're good guys.  I mean heck, the Afganistani Warlords who opposed the Taliban and thus were our friends aren't good people, they had women being raped in the streets.  Both sides are evil.  In war, in the end, it's all power struggles.<br>
