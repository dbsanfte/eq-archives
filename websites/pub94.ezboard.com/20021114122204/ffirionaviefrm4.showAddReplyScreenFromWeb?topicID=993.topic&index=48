Suppose you were next in line at the fast food place and suddenly it is your turn to step up to order (mob pops) but the people that have all your money to purchase the food with have not arrived. Does this mean that since you waited in line that all the others in line that have their money should have to wait on you to have yours show up? I dont think so, AS showed up with cash in hand and took delivery of their whopper, dont get mad at them for it, if you would have been ready when the whopper popped then you would have the piece, as it is you came up a few dollars short. Get over it.<br>
..........................................................................................<br>
<br>
And say Verant ruled the world and everyone had to pay to leave there home, and your actually stupid enough to go get some food with no money, when your friends have all your money, cause you know, you always let your friends deal with your finances. Its not like Blayze was taking 24 hours to get his raid group together. He almost had it together, when AS decided to stick it to him. Coulda gave him 10 more minutes, hell maybe 20. Its called common courtesy, AS has none. And don't be mad at Blayze for &quot;Camping&quot; Ragefire, thats the way Verant made the game. And quite frankly AS should leave the server if its not an RP guild. And if they are here because of the &quot;challange&quot; of a TLC server, then I have an even better challange for them. Go play on Sullon Zek on the side of good. Thats even a bigger challange than FV. But I see no use for a guild that does not RP on a RP prefered server where the majority of us RP, what AS does is show new people to our server that its ok to not RP, and put RPers down that way more D00Ds come and everything goes all to hell. There are 40 more serveres why is AS here when the know full well that its an RP(Prefered I know) Server.<br>
<br>
What they did to Blayze AND all the people that got to him for that pick up raid was inconciderate and very rude.<br>
<br>
No I will not put them on my Blacklist, but they are on my Shitball List. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Fact of the matter was he didnt have his shit together when AS showed up, perhaps when I do my epic and camp ragefire he will pop at 8am eastern and since the rest of my guild doesnt log on till about 7pm eastern as long as I sit there then I will still be entitled to the mob right? It doesnt matter if blayze would have been ready for the pull in 5 minutes or 5 hours if someone else was ready first. <br>

Guildie asked me to come and help so I did.  When I first came into the zone, I thought everyone there was working together to kill Rage for one person.  Apparently I was wrong.<br>
<br>
I have not idea what was said between the leaderships of the two parties.  Just from my observation, AS did nothing wrong.  I have no idea who got their first, but they are set up and ready before the other party.  I was in the raid chat, and it did not seem that the group was ready.<br>
<br>
I read from other post that so and so should have got it because they had to work harder.  That does not make any sense whatsoever.  Both players worked to get their epic completed.  Just because one person had an easier time in obtaining the pieces, doesn't make it less worthy.  Welcome to he difference between the guild raids and open raids.  <br>
<br>
People join guilds for this very thing.  The guild will always win out when it is time to mobilize and kill something.  If you wanted to makesure you got the mob when it spawned, then why not make a chat, and everyone who can help be on it when they are on.  When said mob spawns, those people will drop whatever they are doing and go kill it.  Do you think that each individual open raider will drop their exp group, raid with their guild, etc. in order to kill said mob?  I hardly doubt it.  Guess what?  The guild will...<br>
<br>
It would be nice if you could have come out with an agreement, but both parties needed the same piece.  Things like these will happen.  Deal with it.  You will get your epic eventually.<br>

Sadly, it seems apparent that we will go the way of the blue. This incident will blow over in a few days, but the camps are forming and the sides get further and further apart. There can be no doubt that the world will be run along the lines of those who agree with Heagan. It is a sad thing to see. I now know how Shintou felt in January when he accepted the fact that FV was not going to be the RP zone he expected. He was just ahead of the curve.<br>

Secondly, to all you people saying AS was right, you are wrong. They were within their rights, but rude boorish behavior is not right. How many guilds do you honestly believe wouldn't have given him the 5-10 miutes extra? He was there first, initially drew more people faster, just wasn't quite ready when they were. No, the &quot;rules&quot; don't say they have to be polite or considerate, but those are the standards I hold the people I call friends to.<br>

For me the issue was never of entitlement but of courtesy. Courtesy is nice but in the end no one is beholden to it. For me by far the defining issue was that AS had taken down Ragefire the previous 2-3 times. It would have been &quot;nice&quot; if they had let someone else drink at the well. Nice but not required. I listed the work entailed for an open raid as a reason for why Blayze might be deserving of such courtesy. I like to consider myself a realist. I'm not here to whine about the advantages a big guild has over an open raid. They'll still be there after all is said and done.<br>
<br>
I guess its the part of me that likes to root for the underdog. I might like and prefer the neighborhood bookstore, But Barnes and Noble are still going to drive them out of business in the end.<br>
<br>
I'm from a small guild. I like them very much and to leave, for me would feel like a betrayal. I'd also like a chance at my epic. To achieve that I realize I may have to leave but thats a decision I don't want to make. I view open raids as a possible way of sidestepping that decision. I guess I'd like to hope I'd have a decent chance at it. Advantages of a large guild aside am I so wrong for wishing things were different?<br>

<br>
 AS has no clue who they are dealing with here. Blayze is one of the most respected people on Firiona Vie. Mess with him, you mess with a lot of folks.<br>
 Blayze has been working on his epic for some time. He wants Ragefire next, whether or not he has king part doesn't matter a thing. So if there is a list out there he is on top, especially after you guys got/stole the last one. So if you want to earn some respect of the FV community have the decency to work along with us here or you end up like a guild of outcasts (btw there are some nice key classes lvl 60 fully equiped out there, might be interesting to look into for you guys)<br>

I learned a lot over this thread. And Id like to un-learn most of it... I see this stuff go on in the legal and political arenas of the real world all the time. Its called &quot;spining&quot; things. Stuff like:<br>
<br>
1] Attack the accuser.<br>
Its &quot;Defence Lawyer 101&quot; to shift the attention from the accused and the matter at hand to the accuser. Its the &quot;The woman was attacked, hmm? Well what was she wearing? That dress could be contrued as &quot;suggestive&quot; couldnt it? How can we drag her sexual history into this&quot; line of thinking.<br>
<br>
Basically, its an attempt to divert people's attention to something unrelated to the original charge.<br>
<br>
I dont care whether the original poster had any parts of his Epic, because the specifics of his situation arent in question here. This string concerns AS's actions. <br>
<br>
And Im sure AS didnt bother to find out what his situation was, because as they have stated, they dont care. **THAT** is what is important here. If he had all the pieces, they still wouldnt have cared. And still dont, apparently, so those who do have all the pieces can expect similar treatment.<br>
<br>
Something to look forward to. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2] &quot;We obeyed the rules.&quot;<br>
Yeah, and boy, those rules have done a great job of mediating disputes, havent they. <br>
<br>
Co-existing at higher levels is being discussed everywhere on the board, and the general consensus seemed to be that things will be different on FV from the blue servers, due to the respect and courtesy people have for each other here. <br>
<br>
But AS is not a part of &quot;here.&quot; They have openly proclaimed themselves separate from the server and the server community from the very beginning, and continue to do so. As a guild they dont care about you, or your presence here, or anything to do with anyone who is not part of their self-contained oasis of uberness.<br>
<br>
Yes, they obeyed &quot;the rules&quot; technically, the same &quot;rules&quot; that have turned Ragefire on the blue servers into a hellish mess. /mock applause<br>
<br>
Congratulations AS, for finding some solace in the legalese surrounding this.You completely missed the point--but then, youve said all along that you were going to intentionally, so it comes as no surprise.<br>
<br>
What does surprise me are those outside the guild who vocally support them in this. You're saying &quot;Go ahead--act without consideration for anyone around YOU, be completely callous, do what YOU want to do. Thats whats important after all. I support you wholeheartedly in your YOU-ness.&quot; *blinks* <br>
<br>
Makes me wonder about the future of the server. The only way to seriously address a guild like this is to condemn their actions to the extent that people no longer join them... But if even a small number of people are willing to join and/or support them, its a mandate to continue...and sadly, although there is a great deal of frustration and resentment toward them, it doesnt appear to be as universal as it needs to be to convince them to change.<br>
<br>
Gore's post I actually made me sad, because I realized I'll never be able to experience the high end of FV the way it was... By the time I get there, it will have changed.<br>
<br>
It has already.<br>
<br>
PS: At one point I thought a system of reservations could possibly work here, but boy was I wrong... Unfortunately, those who argued that no system was needed due to the respect and consideration between higher level folk also appear to have been mistaken.<br>
<br>
*sad sigh*<br>
<br>
I hear Star Wars is going to be really fabulous for small groups of self-centered arrogant individuals who dont care to participate in the social strata around them in any way. <br>
<br>
And yes, thats a hint.<br>
<br>
And a hope.<br>

<br>
It's my opinion that games should be fun &amp; pleasant, great diversions from all the crap that goes on in RL.  And here they have this stupid quest that by the very nature of the reward (read: ultra powerful), and the nature of the way they make you earn it, generates more bad feelings and bad times than almost anything.<br>
<br>
Had I the power, I'd give the cleric epic great stats and a lame ability, and make 0 mana resurrection an AA ability.  F*** their logic on how imposing a forced rarity on that particular item improves the game.<br>
