<br>
Attitude is alot but it ain't everything. There are bounderies to what people can do like physical health and mental abilities. Attitude can tune down those flaws a bit but not in drastic measures. Some people have less opportunities then other and that is only based on their physical and mental and not even taken there social enviroment into account.<br>
<br>
In Kebkin case he passed certain bounderies that are not so normal for certain people. He was smart enough to get accepted into university. He had the physical stamina to work 40 hours a day and follow a full course. He had the mental focus and capacities to under dose very difficult circumstance to pass his course. He had the physical abilities and mental profile to join the army. He was again smart enought to get his master.<br>
<br>
If Kebkin had astma would he have achieved the same even with his positive attitude? Would he have been where he is now? He would be smart enough to be a software engineer but serious doubt he would have reached this way without external help and only positive attitude.<br>
<br>
Attitude are very important but they can only overcome certain physical and mental problems. Each human is unique and each case if different. So find it unrealistic and blunt to say I have no sympathy for the poor because they only got themselves to blame because you could do it without external help.<br>

<br>
At what tax bracket do I &quot;make it&quot;?<br>
<br>
How much do I have to bring home on my paycheck for happiness?<br>
<br>
Oh, wait. The real world don't work that way.<br>
<br>
Sure. I may be poor but you know what. I am still capable of happiness.<br>
<br>
I may have to work hard to ensure that my family has medical coverage but you know what? We're quite fine without you looking down and feelin oh so bad for it.<br>
<br>
My wife had to be the sole wage earner for 5 months before while I went through physical therapy so I could be able to walk again. Despite my condition I still get out there and work my ass off. Again. I'm doing just fine without any help from the &quot;feel good&quot; bunch.<br>
<br>
Sure, there are some folks who may not have the fortitude to endure and will truly need help. But that is not the job of some faceless bueracracy in some far off locale. It is the job of family, community and local programs, not the burden of the tax payers. <br>
<br>
That only treats the symptoms of a larger problem and breeds dependance on a government instead of relying on your community.<br>

8 years ago, I bought a pair of shoes. I'm still wearing the same pair of shoes. They are black, ordinary shoes. Not designer. No label. Just shoes. And they have holes in the soles. At the same time I bought the shoes, I bought a suit. It is my only suit. I still have it. When I left home for university, I bought a coat to treat myself. Two years ago, someone walked off with my coat in a nightclub, leaving behind their own. The two coats were identical except mine was small and his was large. I was unable to recover my coat. Ever since, I have been wearing a coat which is about 4 inches long at the sleeves. Yes I look stupid in it, but that's okay because I can't afford to go out anywhere anyway.<br>

Actually, I bought unmetered access for my computer. It's only at nights and at weekends, but its cheaper than buying a newspaper everyday and it's my only connection with the outside world. I don't have a tv. can't afford it. About a year ago my mouse broke. A few months ago my cdrom broke. About a month ago my monitor broke. My father bought me a new cdrom for my birthday. I am borrowing my brother's monitor and mouse.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I am in my dad's house. Unfortunately, there's been a hold up with my housing benefit. It meant I couldn't pay my rent. I had been using my inheritence to pay the rent whilst they sorted it out but it has run out. I have had ot move out of the shared flat I was in.<br>
<br>
This is all with the help of the state and with the help of my family. Without my family, I would probably be homeless by now. A lot of people don't have families like I do. Without the state, I wouldn't stand a chance.<br>

I have come from what many would consider a priviliged background and it opened opportunities to me that I may not have otherwise had access to.  I was able to attend an elite college and an elite law school.  My parents encouraged me to study and paid for my undergraduate education and half of my law school education.  I like to think that I am smart enough to have gotten where I am today regardless but that is not necessarily the case.  If I had grown up in a terrible neighborhood with abusive parents, who knows how I would have turned out.<br>
<br>
The reason I bring this up is that it reminds me of conversations I have had with classmates and, to some extent, my girlfriend, where they don't seem to realize that some people (including them) do grow up privileged in this country and have had opportunities where they may not have otherwise had those opportunities.  There have been a few posts where people have mentioned how they have been able to work their way out of a bad situation and kudos to them.  Just realize that not everyone in that situation is able to do so and we should have compassion for folks with fewer opportunities (for instance, disabilities that prohibit them from working).  <br>
<br>
I read a report recently about upward mobility in this country.  While opportunities abound, the fact remains that folks that are born into wealthy backgrounds are very likely to be wealthy themselves and to earn high incomes.  Conversely, folks with low-income parents are likely to earn low incomes as well.  That isn't a huge coincidence.  In order to make it in this country, you need opportunity and desire.  Folks raised in upper-income families are presented with more opportunities.<br>
<br>
I love this country because it does, more than any other country in my opinion, provide opportunities for people to better themselves.  It is heartening to read success stories.  We need to remember though that some folks lack the abilities to get themselves out of situations and we shouldn't judge them for that.<br>

<br>
No, it won't be super easy.  But if something is harder for you, then you work harder.  If you have learning disabilities it is your parents and your schools responsibility to point them out while in k-12.  If your parents refuse to believe that you have a problem they need a serious kick in their ass. <br>
<br>
If you can make it into a University and fall under $25k (net income not gross) a year you are eligible for a full pell grant $2000 a semester and up to $5000 in subsidized loans per semester.  You also receive certain moneys to go to summer school.  All you have to do is keep a 2.0 which if you are not A or B should be able to attain.<br>
<br>
Decius, not a flame towards you but just pointing out things you said.  You said one meal a day?  What is it?  I can buy a bag of rice and make lots of meals.  Or Ramen.  Do I like them?  Not really, but you learn to live on what you can.  I am lucky that for one or two years my grandparents stepped in so I could get on my feet since neither of my parents care.  <br>

It's absurd not to believe that there's real people that just can't make it when, well, they are there. I don't care why they didn't made it. Maybe they are stupid. Maybe they had terrible luck. Maybe they have an undiagnosed mental problem. Who cares? The fact is, while I own a small company now and live reasonably well, next year I can become stupid, have bad luck, become alcoholic, get depressed by a dead son, or need a new heart... why not? we're humans, and humans fail. <br>
<br>
I want a decent second chance, and I want others to have a decent second chance as well (not only people with wealthy families should have one). State spends money painting walls, watering grass, and doing many unimportant things: giving people more chances to prosper is a great benefit to the whole society, and the state just can't forget that. We're not talking only about the moral problem. We're talking about less crime, and better chances for the poor to gain wealth.<br>
<br>
If I lose my company, I want an adequate time to find a job where I can put my technical knowledge to work. No, I don't want to work in a McDonalds as a first option, and no, in my country that salary can't pay my family's bills. I have had much worse jobs than that when needed, but I think the benefit for myself *and* for my country will be larger if I can look for a job for a few months without the pressure of being kicked out of my home. <br>

About sales tax: it is applied here in Spain and in the rest of Europe(I think ). sometimes I hate it and I am sure it slows economy a bit, but companies are not affected that much and it can even help sometimes.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=577826">Echtelion HeavyHand</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If I am diagnosed with cancer I will have to die because there is no way I could afford a doctor.<br>
<br>
In either case explaining this to a child would be most dificult.<br>
<br>
You may sight darwin on this one.. maybe my son or I dont deserve to live because we are not wealthy enough or because we have made &quot;bad choices&quot; in some peoples estimation.<br>

So was your husband Disabled while serving on Active duty?  If so then he would be covered by The VA for all medications required for his disability, also he would be authorized for care at any VA facility. <br>
<br>
Now if his disability happened after he left the service then that is a whole new ball of wax.<br>

<br>
He was disabled durring active duity but was misdiagnosed, We were basicly told they didnt know what was wrong with him after he had contracted an &quot;unknown virus&quot; and they stopped looking for the actual problem and gave him dissability based on the most prevelent symptom of the actual disability (which was not diagnosed untill 3 years after by a civilian doctor.) <br>
<br>
While we have all the civilian documentation up the wazoo that supports the fact that the dissability he had acording to the VA is a Symptom of the actual Disease the VA will not even LOOK at the paper work, we have been in the system on this for years and it keeps taking us in circles that go noplace.<br>
<br>
he was actualy told by one of the doctors &quot;I dont need to see your paper work you dont have that disorder&quot; My husband Begged the doctor to review his civilian tests and diagnosis and the doctor walked out of the room!!<br>
<br>
Most Recently we went in for yet another discussion with yet another gent from the VA and were informed that if we continue to push this my husband will lose every benifit he now gets, Because there is curent trend to remove people from VA dissability who are not diagnosed correctly and curently recieving bennifits for a condition that they do not have (even if what they are recieving for is a Symptom of the problem which was misdiagnosed by the Military in the first place)  which of course would make things even worse than they are now for us.<br>
<br>
Its frusterating, maddening infact. but we have and are &quot;playing by the rules&quot; and will continue to do so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 12:19:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/DavidStrange/vamp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Being Rich?!?</span><hr size=1> Drusila I understand where you are coming from.

<br>
If every year the population increases and by the law of averages all financial classes increase how does the statement “We have more poor now than ever before.” Prove anything? I mean we have more of every class right now than ever before. It is just basic statistics. I mean it can’t be any different, so what the hell does this statement mean?<br>
<br>
Another one that supposedly means something but when looked at doesn’t make sense. “The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.” <br>
<br>
“The rich get richer” again it is basic statistics as there is no upper limit to rich it only stands to reason that wealth is going to increase just as the average wage has increased. Whether or not they increase in the same proportion is irrelevant because this is not a linear equation.<br>
<br>
“the poor get poorer.” How do the poor get poorer? Once you have nothing you can’t have less than nothing. So if you have any thing you are less poor. And if they keep raising the “poverty level” than it must mean that you can have more and still be poor. So the poor are richer now than they were before. Well that means the poor get richer.<br>
<br>
I always wonder at these statements because they never make any sense to me, yet people keep on repeating them as if the were gospel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Totally separate item:<br>
<br>
Drusila, what is the disorder your husband is suffering from? You allude to it in vary vague and nebulous terms. I assume it must be fairly debilitating to disable him so significantly. Who knows, after you tell us some one might have had prior experience with the disease and some information they know of that could help you.<br>

Siffo, It's not that hard to understand if you really want to. This &quot;nonsense&quot; has been real trouble since the beginning of industrialization. Money calls more money, and money is not produced fast enough to compensate that effect. That's why you have to artificially regulate the market with anti-trust laws and tax brackets. If you don't - well, most of a country's money will end up in too few hands and even democracy could be in danger then. <br>
<br>
A practical example: In 1974 the richest 5 percent of American families earned 14.8 percent of total U.S. income; by 1998 their share had risen to 20.7 percent. Now imagine that this becomes a 60 percent in 50 years. You really don't see a problem there? <br>

Wich of those are you facts and wich are your conclussion or assumptions? It's a fact that at this point population is still increasing. I don't know what the law of averages is all about but yes it's probably logical that the more people you have the more people will end up in the different classes. So yes it's normal that you have more poor people the before. But there ends you basic statistics and what people mean by saying that is that there are more poor percentage wise then before. It would be good if the percentage of poor compared towards total population is the same or lowers, but if it raises then it's a problem and proofsa failing system.<br>

The rich get richer is not a basic statistic. The more money you have the more opportununities you have to get more money but it's not a basic statistic that 1 automaticly become 2. To me those 2 sentence don't stand for anything.<br>

<br>
The poverty level is not measured witht he amount of money you have but with what you can do with it. The poverty levels are raised because the value of money decreases and one can't buy the same today with the money from yesterday. It's called inflation. Poverty levels are also increased when certain items are now essential that weren't before. One example would be insurrances, house insurrance and such where optional and one point at this point people had to have them (atleast in my country) it was illogical to keep the poverty level at the same amount while they had to buy more with he same amount and the value of the money stayed same or decreased. You conclussion is not mirrored with reality. I can agree with it when money would keep it value but inflation is a fact that has drastic measures on our society.<br>

Actually if you look at every time the Minimum wage increases, so does the cost of everything else. This is a concept that a lot of folks cant seem to grasp. If it cost company A, X amount of money to make the product, then you raise the cost the cost of Labor, the cost for Company A to make the product increases by the same amount. Company A needs to raise the price of their product to meet the new cost of Labor.<br>
<br>
So when Minimum wage increases within a couple of quarters the Poverty line normally increase the same percentage.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 4:30:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/DavidStrange/vamp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Being Rich?!?</span><hr size=1> Sports stars and other celebrities only get the money that we the consumers give them.
