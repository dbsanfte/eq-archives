I'm fine for a Professor to be active in politics.  What I'm not fine for is to hear that professor's political agenda almost constantly during class time I paid to have.  During a 50 minute class today I kept a tally of how many &quot;political&quot; statements were made that had NOTHING to do with Conservation (the subject we are supposed to be covering).  It came up to 20.  I really didn't want to take this class, but the other geography class I thought would be interesting was full.<br>
<br>
So please, if you are a professor/teacher or ever plan on being one; check your individual ideals/religion/politics at the door and go in and teach what they pay you to teach.<br>
<br>
<br>

Maybe leave an anonymous note on his desk or speak with him privately *after* you've jotted down on a daily basis how many times he's referred to his personal affairs, etc. <br>
<br>
If you ever did decide to do something like that, I suggest you have a back-up plan in case he decides to be an ass since you'd be questioning his authority and teaching ability. Seriously, if you're paying to have an education within a specified course, that's exactly what you should be getting. But you'd need a log or something to back up what you'd be complaining about. <br>

<br>
There is a prevalent and almost majority philosophy amongst modern education theorists that teachers not only have an obligation to impart knowledge but also to ensure that they are teaching these things to good people.<br>
<br>
The rationale is simple: If you are giving knowledge to someone who is not proven to be good or at least capable of acting in the public interest you could be creating a menace by giving this person knowledge. Better that evil people be kept ignorant.<br>
<br>
Your professor likely considers his politics, in one form or another, to be good. Moreover, by bringing them up, he is actively, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>purposefully</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, encouraging those who do not agree with him (his personal evil) to leave the class. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

And yes I am keeping track of what he does.  Today in class we got 5 definitions and an assignment explained to us that took all of 10 minutes.  The rest of the class was his political bashing, and making fun of &quot;working&quot; class people.  Such as statements about how labor day is outdated since the only thing laborer's do is drop your burger on the floor before putting it back on the bun for you.<br>
<br>
If it keeps up there will be 3 letters written by me, one to the chair of his department, one to the president of our school (very progressive minded new president), and one to our school newspaper. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913" target="top">Zsuzsana Dracul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Using this rationale, then US colleges should not allow students from Muslim countries to attend.<br>
<br>
If what Nakath says is true about the education theorists, and I have no reason to doubt his claim, then IMO thats the wrong approach to take.  I always thought that educators were supposed to teach their students how to think for themselves, not blindly follow the &quot;accepted&quot; party-line.  The good ones at least do this.  <br>

<br>
If so, then sending letters off may be a fruitless activity.<br>
<br>
If he were a middle-school teacher or even a high school teacher, I would take issue.<br>
<br>
But to be the devil's advocate:<br>
<br>
Is your average college student capable of recognizing political commentary and forming their own opinion of whether they think it is correct?  I think this is generally true.<br>
<br>
Isn't part of the education process to be exposed to a variety of opinions - even those you don't agree with?<br>
<br>
You stated that it was irrelevant because of the subject matter as it was not religion/politics/philosophy, but politics works its way into lots of different fields.  You mentioned the topic was conservation - which is very political turf.  How can you talk about conservation without getting into politics?<br>
<br>
Ultimately though, the real key here is academic freedom.  Your professor has the ability and right to say what he wants in class.  Universities and colleges use the tenure system to protect this freedom.  Why?  The theory is that you want academic output free from external influence and solely judged on it's merits (peer review in journals as an example).<br>
<br>
As a student, you don't really have a right to dictate what a professor says.  Universities, especially those involved in research, do not solely exist to serve students.<br>
<br>
Now, if you still think he's operating beyond the bounds of what is acceptable, I suggest you talk to a faculty member in another department to get a reality check as to whether a letter writing campaign is even warranted.  They'll be much more in tune with the issues on academic freedom and can advise you better than I could.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that was helpful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caemus>Caemus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 2:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=704.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pisses me off</span><hr size=1>  think the mark of a good teacher is one who can teach the course material without getting into their own views… even in courses like philosophy or political science.

I had a philosophy teacher like that.  Had you not known he was a protestant minister outside of school, you would have never known it by the way he taught his classes.  He could take the opposing view on any world view and make you believe he believed it while ripping your world view to shreds!<br>

Sorry you seemed to have gotten a bad apple there, Zsu.  I would agree with Gasp.  Talk to another faculty member that you can trust (do you have an advisor?) before you begin sending letters.  It could save you some unhappy repercussions.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You mentioned the topic was conservation - which is very political turf. How can you talk about conservation without getting into politics?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree very much with this statement.  Conservation is very much a political hotbed, and it would be somewhat difficult to discuss it without politics creeping in some how.  What I DO wonder though, is what does labor, and &quot;working class&quot; political ideas have to do with conservation?  I think very little.  I am completely in favor of political discussion relating to the topic at hand, it adds a dynamic effect to your teaching model and foster debate and critical thinking amongst your students.  But if you are supposed to be discussion conservation but suddenly begin spouting things about the economy or civil rights... then you are out of line.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What does a professor of Conservation make a year?<br>

I just showed this to my SO, a &quot;working class&quot; kinda guy(factory work), who's only comment was &quot;I bet I make more money than he does, and I bet I'm less pissed about where I am in my life&quot; <br>

<br>
Working class has very little to do with money.  The term working class is a derivative of the &quot;Blue Collar&quot; and &quot;White Collar&quot; job and social class.  Simply put, a &quot;working class&quot; person is someone who actually does some sort of manual labor type job.  Construction, military, warehouse, etc... the opposite, or &quot;white collar&quot; worker is the person who does very little labor intensive work if at all, such as professors, clergy, accountants, attorneys, doctors, etc.<br>
<br>
The money flows both ways... I know construction workers who make more money than attorneys I know.  I know warehouse formen that make more than accountants and some doctors.  I know college professors that make STAGGERING salaries.  <br>
<br>
Even in medieval times there were such a thing as dirt poor nobles and lords, yet they were still considered the social elite, because they were not of the &quot;working class&quot; of laborers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ermok>Ermok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 618<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/30/03 1:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=704.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pisses me off</span><hr size=1> College professors with tenure are very small people.  They know they can say anything and insult anyone and have no fear of reprocussion.  In their small world they are god and they know it.  For a semester/quarter through grades they hold several dozen young people's lives and success in their hands.<br>
<br>
I feel your pain, my geology class professor was going off on BS about how oil was going to run out in five years.  It was clear her PhD in rocks gave her absolutely no further insight other than what she had heard from Green party propaganda.  <br>
<br>
How I handled it at first was not going to class.  I realized that was a poor solution and that I was letting her defeat me.  Thus, I made it my mission to contradic her political bullshit in the most tactful, non-gradethreatening way.  As long as she stayed on the cirriculum I was polite and kept my mouth shut.  Eventually I told her such and for the most part I gained her respect.<br>
<br>
I dont know how much of a pompous ass your prof. is but in my experience I would not speak up until you have a handle on his or her personality.  More than likely you are in a 300 person class and the teacher has to deal with almost 1000 that semester.  You are less than a number to him in that case.  When you get into your major and into smaller classes with more venerable professors they will be more likely to entertain your comments as a human being and not just $60 on their paycheck. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/ermoksig1.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siava>Siava</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.knology.net/~ahnmei/savepoint.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm an Asshat lady. <br>

For the people saying that conservation is political ... it's not like its a discussion on the politics.  It's short 1-2 sentence insults about certain people.  If he said anything about conservation it would be fine, but I didn't pay to hear him bitch about chads.<br>

Oh and even doing this, tenured teachers can be fired.  Just takes more work. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913" target="top">Zsuzsana Dracul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
