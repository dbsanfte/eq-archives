I've read all the posts, but still end up confused...<br>
<br>
Are the evil, called evil because they hate the good?<br>
Are the good, called good because they hate the evil?<br>
Are the neutral, called netural because they're neither good nor evil? /boggle<br>
Looks like an aviak and egg issue.<br>
<br>
I think the following model should make sense...<br>
<br>
Starting with the premise of evil:<br>
I always thought that being evil means doing things that hurt others (whether the others is good, neutral or evil). So an evil can jolly well fight evil too! <br>
The main aim of being evil is to bring as much pain to others as possible.<br>
<br>
Then, there will be good, because if you fight the evil doers, you are good!<br>
<br>
Or you can start with the premise of good:<br>
Means doing things that benefit others, that brings as much well being to others as possible.<br>
<br>
Then, there will be evil, because if you fight the do gooders, you are evil!<br>
<br>
Then what is neutral...hmm...doing things that do not help nor harm anyone? Doing things that harm and help others? Not doing anything? Goof off and eat and drink and be merry? <br>
Ah I think I got it -yes, being neutral is:<br>
Yes, you will fight evil, when necessary, i.e. When you are threatened by the evil...natural survival of the fittest...<br>
whilst the good have a vendetta against the evil.<br>
Now the problem is determining when you are actually threatened by evil...maybe that's why the druids at the circles attack the evils...because the answer is, EVERYONE is threatened by the evil, as the evil do harm to everyone.<br>
<br>
Then what is the difference between good and neutral...the difference is the mindset...the good pursue the evil to benefit others (do good mentality)...the neutral pursue the evil to remove the threat to themselves (survival of the fittest mentality)<br>
<br>
Now the problem is Verant blankets evil by the gods they worship or their races, so you can't control the NPCs reactions. <br>
But as for RP, we can control our own reactions. If you believe that reanimating the dead does not bring pain to the dead...then perhaps necromancers can be not evil. If you believe that the power to suck life does not bring much more agony to your prey than engulfing it in flames, then the method is not more evil than the other.<br>
<br>
Phew...I spent 15 mins thinking about that...had to get it out...I probably won't respond to any more posts in this thread...I hope...this is sucking waay too much of my time...Now THAT is evil...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p style="line-height: 100%"><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=208972"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#009933"><font size="5">c<font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS" color="#009933"><font size="5">aeo</font><font size="3">n</font><font size="5">a</font><font size="3">

Good? Evil? Neutral? Irrelevant labels all. <br>
<br>
Matters not what one thinks. Matters not what one believes. Matters only what shall be. <br>
<br>
Friends tho many you all are to Maladominus, same fate do all of us will share. Same fate. Same truth. <br>
<br>
Truth is what is, what always has been, and what always shall be. What is truth then? What is the only truth that always been, always is, always will be?<br>
<br>
Death is only truth. <br>
<br>
All else falsehoods or half-truths. All else happen only sometimes or half the time.... but never all the time and everytime. <br>
<br>
And what is to become from truth? <br>
<br>
Plague Bringer brings Green Cloud in End Days. Cover Norrath it will. Purify Norrath it shall.  Cleanse the world.  And truth of death finally set mortals free! <br>
<br>
For those who follow truth all along (like the Maladominus), Plague Bringer promise immortal life of undeath eternal. <br>
<br>
A bigger goal can there be?<br>
A higher achievement can be imagined? <br>
<br>
No.  For only Bertoxxulous promise the greatest of greatest. The most promising of promises! <br>
<br>
Defeat this miserable mortality, and set us to freedom living forever, never dead, never living. Forever existing. <br>
<br>
Maladominus cares of friends, Maladominus adore many of you. Follow him now, follow and learn the ways of Bertoxxulous and be saved! With the Maladominus you also be redeemed after the End Days, and enjoy with him the forever life of undeath-after!  From grave you will rise with Maladominus and witness promise of the Plague Bringer yes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Death is far from the only truth, small one. Death is not the end, it is not final. You see, few creatures ever truly die.<br>
<br>
Many who leave thier mortal form become spirits who continue to effect and shape this world. Many are given another form of life after thier first expires. Some cheat death and become undead, forever evading it's grasp. And the actions we take in our life never die, they echo throughout eternity. <br>
<br>
While creatures can be slain, the actions they took remain behind, by slaying them you are merely preventing them from taking any further actions. <br>
<br>
There is much to be had and done in ones life, to merely spend it wallowing in the fact that you are one day going to die is pathetic. One does not need immortality to effect this world. Were that the case, Cazic-Thule would have made us Iksar immortal. <br>
<br>
I've thought about what you said when we first met gnome. And I've waited a long time to tell you what you made me realize. Death does come for us all. But we should not worship it. We Iksar should savor every moment of our lives Cazic-Thule has blessed us with, no matter how painful, and try and accomplish as much as we can, while we can. <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/bseh42/images/zilsig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/20/02 3:34:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/21/02 9:17:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: green cloud?  death?

Your a disgrace to life itself.<br>
<br>
But I'll play your little game then blueskin, if only to see what idiotic answers you spew out. <br>
<br>
Now, your first question...there are many methods to instill fear, however, I'll give you the answer you are looking for. Yes, we will wage war, and yes, we will bring death to our enemies. And so will our enemies wage war upon us, and bring death to us. Are their gods now all intertwined with this &quot;circle&quot; too? <br>
<br>
Your second question, why do people fear me, or rather, my people, as myself and them are not seperate. That varies from creature to creature. Some fear us because of the pain and death we can bring to them, some fear us because of the order we bring to their chaotic world, some fear us because they know we have the power to suceed in our ambitions, and some fear us merely because of our appearance. <br>
<br>
Does that answer your question?<br>

<br>
Day in and Day out, I hear the same things from My so called Dark Bothers. &quot;I'm just using that Cute little busty Woodelven Druid for her SoW, man.&quot;.<br>
<br>
I say, bah. To truely corrupt, you must Kill. You must fight and destroy.<br>
<br>
Give them the Fear. Once they have Fear, then will have HATE.<br>
<br>
Many say you need Love to Hate. Even my Lord Gray. <br>
While I respect my Lords' Viewpoint..<br>
<br>
I hate, and I have never loved a woman in my life. I am not capable of love, for I strive to be the Bane to all Life itself.<br>
<br>
Fear is the True Path of Hate. And Hate is the Path to War. As you bring that Paladin to the Path of War.. you shall see the man Corrupted.<br>
<br>
Then its all about winning the battle against him. This is what Kimaya seeks to stop, which is why she shant engage in such battles.<br>
<br>
Ayamaii, the Monk, was my first ever project. And yes, it turned out well.<br>
<br>
I have many others, and they are progressing Nicely. But A shame for them, I don't care to turn them.<br>
<br>
Because I want to KILL them.<br>
<br>
Yes, that does answer my question Zildrax. Know that your Cazic Thule is no more Powerful then Innoruuk, Rallos Zek, or Bertoxxullos.<br>
<br>
They are all equal. They are all one in the same. As much as you wish to deny it, Zildrax, your heart is as Black and Dark as mine. Do you think you'll get this Empire by playing Happy go Lucky Druid with Kimaya?<br>
<br>
Nay, you must KILL! Crush and destory all! Its what I admire about you Iksar. You truely are Testiments to the Dark Circle, and you are even stronger then myself for the time being. I hate that, and it shall change. One day, After all of the Elves and Lightbringers have been crushed..<br>
<br>
It will be you and me.<br>
<br>
The Iksarian Legions against the Legions of Darkness. ((ACK, thats an Inno Uber guild. Oh well.))<br>
<br>
And we shall see who will put Norrath in a Shroud of Darkness for all time.<br>
<br>
Take the Light away.. and their is only utter and complete Darkness. Everlasting and Perfect. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A>

<br>
Cazic-Thule is more powerful then any of those false gods could comprehend, and when they are destroyed, that shall be realized. He is not a &quot;part&quot; of such pathetic filth.<br>
<br>
Yes, we must kill, blueskin. It is a undeniable fact. The world is full of corrupt beings that must be purged through pain and suffering for the will of Cazic-Thule to be realized. We will forge a world that is no longer plauged by war and hate, or weakness and greed. <br>
<br>
My heart is not anywhere as corrupt as yours, worthless blueskin. You see, we Iksar fight to create somthing, not just to destroy. We kill, because it is nessecary. We spread fear, because it is essential to bringing order. We wage war because from the ashes of our battles shall rise a great new era. We do not fight to destroy, but in order for the world to be reborn, it must be cleansed of the scum who continue to drag it into the abyss.<br>
<br>
You, blueskin, destroy only for the sake of destruction. We Iksar destroy to set the foundation for a new creation.<br>
<br>
The world shall not be brought to &quot;darkness&quot;, blueskin. Once we Iksar are triumphent, once this world is ruled through strict fear, it shall be a shining utopia, it shall enter it greatest era. A world without worthless war or pointless hatred. Yes, a world without the pathetic deities of your precious &quot;circle&quot;, because Cazic-Thule is not a part of that circle. He wishes for the world to be unified through fear, not for it to be destroyed or engulfed in hatred and meaningless death.<br>
<br>
We are nothing alike, and our deity is nothing like those you mention, blueskin. Your kind will fall, and with them, your sick, twisted, and worthless beliefs. <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/bseh42/images/zilsig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/22/02 1:47:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 825<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/02 1:48:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh, But he is</span><hr size=1> Sick and Demented am I? ..<br>

My killing is an Artfield, my Guarden of Death in the Corner of the Faydark.. a Testiment to that Art.<br>
Their is one thing in your little perfect world that shall crumble, however.<br>
<br>
An Empire built on Fear..<br>
<br>
Shall Fall, and you think that WE are the ones that In fight, Scaled one?<br>
<br>
Unless your Minions are weak, your Fear will turn to Hatered.. and the Hatered of the Iksar race shall turn on itself.<br>
<br>
Civil War you shall have. Destruction is Invetable. Accept it.<br>
<br>
You were built for destruction just as much as I was. Awaken from this trance.. and bring down the world with your power. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A>

<br>
Our Empire is built on fear, and it is through fear it is kept efficent and strong, but it is not the only thing that holds us together. We believe in what we do, blueskin, we do not do it out of fear. As I have said before, we are the masters of fear, not victims to it. Just because we use it to maintain order in our own ranks does not mean we are slaves to it and all resent eachother for it. On the contrary, we greatly enjoy the company of our fellow Iksar.<br>
<br>
Yes, blueskin, we use fear, and it does not turn to hatred. I guess the Iksar break your circle. Yes, we fight with eachother from time to time, and in the past, we have falterd. But we learn, we grow, we overcome, and we will not repeat our mistakes. Hatred is indulged by the weak. My people are not weak. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/22/02 2:01:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 828<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/02 2:09:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh, But he is</span><hr size=1> You present the Ultimate challenge.
