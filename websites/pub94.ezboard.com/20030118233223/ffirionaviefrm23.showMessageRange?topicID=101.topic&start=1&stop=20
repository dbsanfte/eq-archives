<br>
You bastard Rangers are NOT like me. Not in the least.<br>
I care not how many people you killed, how you enjoy killing, or how 'evil' you think you are. Because the fact of the matter is, you are just animals. The Lion kills, the Tiger kills, the little wolf kills. These worthless creatons are not evil, and neither are you.<br>
<br>
Chaos.. It is not something that is restricted to Evil people, or Good people, or people on some 'Path to Power'. Chaotic Behavor has been displayed in many, even the Paladin Gavin and the Monk Ayamamii before she died showed the Chaotic Behavor. Does this make one evil?<br>
<br>
Nay. It does not. I am on my Dark Path of Chaos. This is for those that enjoy killing for the sake of evilness. To hurt and be cruel to others. To destroy familes and cause tears and sorry.<br>
<br>
Most of you 'Power Seekers' are just that. Neutralic power seekers. You enjoy fighting, and will kill anything that suits you at the time. I could pay one of you bastards to kill Tunare if I had enought platium. You are people without loyality. My loyality lies with the Pathways of Darkness. Fear, Hate, War, and Death.<br>
You have no loyality execpt to yourselves. So don't get bend out of shape when I kill you like the Elven Ranger that you are. Or Dwarven Rogue that you are, or whatever you are.<br>
<br>
Then the Rarity.. but their are those that enjoy taking Darkness from the world by death. Those like Gavin and Banegrivm, the Paladins of Chaos. They are not like me, execpt for the fact that they fight instead of acting like the Weak Pathetic Kimaya, who only tries to bring peace and offer cookies and various other things that have no value.<br>
<br>
A world of Chaos is just that. A world Dominated by US, the Children of Chaos.The ShadowKnight and the Paladin, locked in combat.. instead of.. people falling for the Peaceful Orderly ways of ..to use her as an example once again.. Kimaya.<br>
<br>
A world of Battle, and fighting.. and killing. Everyone goes in, only one side comes out. Thus is the way of Chaos.<br>
<br>
This does not mean I am your brother in Chaos. Stop acting like it. You know who I am talking about, and I have NOTHING to learn from you, bastard. You'll die.<br>
<br>
Kage no Adakia, The Darkness of Chaos. That is what I shall bring to those that dare stand in my way, or were born looking at me wrong.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>

Evil? Good? Neutral? Yet more words of the weak. Like you always will be. I don't care to argue with you, it's about as good as arguing with a brick wall, only the wall has more sense and intelligence.<br>
<br>
Spout off your preaching, Shintou. Make yourself feel &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;justified&quot; on your quest. You'll fail. You will never reach your goals. You will always be a second rate fool, clinging to ideals and empty words that make you feel above everyone else. Enjoy your pitiful existence. <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=314425" target="_blank">Serci</a><b>, Dark Ranger

There are bastards in Norrath who you could pay to kill their own god.  No loyalty.&quot;  Baka scoffed.  &quot;Only ambition.  Powermongers who care for nothing around them.  On that point he is correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed a little, taking a quick gulp from his dwarven ale.  &quot;The world is ruled by chaos, and yes, I am a harbinger of chaos.  I fight, I destroy, I kill, I maim.  However, when my reign of chaos is over, Norrath shall be held in perfect order.  Perfect harmony.&quot;  Baka glanced towards the shadowknight.  &quot;I fight not because I enjoy the thrill of gutting a person alive, of tearing their insides to shreds with my blade.  I fight to save those who cannot save themselves.  I fight to destroy people such as you, those whose reign of chaos will never end, even if you wanted it to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Staring into his ale, he swirled it around in the glass.  The dark liquid tossed and turned, running up the sides of the glass, splashing around.  &quot;The world is like this ale, Shintou.  It remains in chaos only as long as the hand that holds it moves.  As long as the battle reigns supreme, as long as Norrath shakes under the pressure of clashing metal and violent magics.&quot;  He placed the glass on the table, letting it settle.  &quot;When the battle, the hand is removed from it, it just..  stops.  It stands in harmony, undisturbed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that you said about battle, Shintou?  Everyone goes in, one side comes out?  That's not chaos.  That's life.&quot;  He smiled confidently at Shintou.  &quot;The side that comes out will be MY side, Shintou.  MY side.  After that, even you will be happy, as you won't have to listen to Kimaya any longer.  She will be happy.  I will be happy.  You will be with whatever god it is you worship, if any.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;The hand is removed, the ale is still.  Everyone wins.&quot;<br>
<br>
He drained his ale, and got up to head to the bar for a pitcher.  &quot;Why do you have this vendetta against Kimaya anyway?  She offends you, hmm?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubookwormkitty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bookwormkitty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 7:24:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaos</span><hr size=1> The high elfs eyes widen,&quot;Kill their own god, but, but, that doesn't make sense,&quot; she pauses,&quot;Oh I have heard tales of this sort, the kind willing to slaughter their own gods, The only thing stopping them from killing their own kin is the wrath they will incur, these strange beasts, they speak in an odd dialect, thought to be a code, or perhaps it is because they are incapable of uttering a single grammatically correct phrase in any language,&quot; she shudders,&quot;I would never dream of attacking my god, Solusek Ro, and I hope that I will one day get the chance to incinerate a few of those THINGS,&quot;<br>

Oh, and saying there are those that will kill their own gods, you have little room to talk-unless you actually would keep Innoruuk alive while you destroy everything else? I doubt that. You would destroy your own god just to satisfy the empty hole that you try to fill with mindless insanity.  <p><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=314425" target="_blank">Serci</a></b>, Dark Huntress

Intrigued, she sets her mead down on the bar and hops the long way down from her stool.  After several tries for the mead the long way up on the counter, she sighs, gives up, and wanders over to drag a chair over next to the stage.  She is even more startled by his sudden Gating away, and mutters darkly under her breath.  With a sigh, she grabs a scroll, a slightly battered quill, and a bottle of ink from her pack.  She unstoppers the cork, spreads out the paper, and begins to write.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't believe that the rangers have ever proclaimed to be like you, Shintou, have they?  Not purely for Evil, that is.  Of course they do not, as beings of the Balance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I too am a seeker of Balance.  Evil and Good are opposites, each equally... well...&quot;  She pauses for a moment, seeking the words that would describe this in the common tongue.  She finally gives up and shrugs.  &quot;Well, for lack of a better phrase, they are neither good nor bad.  Both are needed so that the world continues to function.&quot;  She sighs, fiddling with the end of a long copper braid, and attempts to phrase this correctly.  &quot;You are a being of Evil.  Like Good, you are equally needed as a Paladin who fights for good.  If you were to kill that Paladin, and if all Paladins and other beings of Good were to be wiped out, Evil would overwhelm the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, this isn't working.  Hmm...  well, imagine a giant bowl that spins.  It wobbles slightly, sometimes leaning towards the right, sometimes leaning to the left, but always moving.  Sometimes, when Evil prevails, the bowl is tipped.  Just for the sake of argument, imagine the bowl tips to the right.  The spinning slows, the wobbling halts, and all the world is enveloped in the Darkness.  Disease and suffering rules all.  There is no day, no birth, and eventually the Darkness even swallows itself in its search to overwhelm everything.<br>
<br>
&quot;Back to the bowl analogy.  Imagine, this time, that the bowl tips to the left.  Once again, the spinning slows, the wobbling halts, and Light covers everything.  It is always day, birth is eternal, there is no pestilence or hurt.  Plants run rampant in the eternal Summer.  It, in the end, chokes itself in its quest for Good.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, one last time.  Pretend the bowl -stops-.  It is balanced in the middle; there is no wobbling, no tipping.  If Good and Evil were to end their constant struggle against each other, the world fould fall into stasis.  There would be no birth and no death, no night or day but instead eternal twilight.  Everything is frozen in time when Evil and Good stop fighting.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are a being of Evil, and you fight good by hurting and being cruel to cause hurt and suffering.  You rip apart families, you slaughter children, you care for nothing but yourself and your cause.  This is vital for the Balance, for without those like you it would end.<br>
<br>
&quot;Beings of neutrality, such as Rangers and Druids, fight to maintain this Balance.  If Good is tipping the bowl to the side too deeply, we will fight, as Evil beings, until the Balance stablizes and all is once more in constant, steady combat.  Likewise, if all the world were becoming overwhelmed by Evil, we would join the forces of Good.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing matters but this Balance.  Friends, familes, ties...  all are lesser to this.  If the world were overcome by Good, I would now fight beside the Evil beings, even if it meant killing my own friends.&quot;  Sobered by this grim announcement, she settles back into the chair, then leans forward once more to finish the note.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you have every right to be angry at those who fight for the Balance, because no, we cannot be like you.  We are not, and we never will be.  I am loyal to my God and the Balance alone, and no, I would not battle Karana for any amount of wealth.  What I believe states that it does not matter what we own now, since the world could become awashed in the Storm at any moment, wiping the slate clean and restoring the Balance so that it might begin anew.<br>
<br>

She ends her signature with a small flourish, blows on the ink to dry it, and leaves it on the stage in hopes that Shintou will find it.  She stretches out her arms to relax the tightness in them that resulted from the writing, then hops off the chair to attempt climbing back up the stool to get back to her mead. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uamaeliya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amaeliya</A> at: 7/30/02 9:11:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=soulous>Soulous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 9:44:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaos</span><hr size=1> This is amusing, Soulous thinks to himself.

I am not sure I have ever heard such an absurd theory. Seeing as all soft skins are the embodiment of evil in my peoples eyes, by your own standards, you should be killing yourself to help &quot;balance&quot; the world. And yet, you do not. You base this theory on some twisted version of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; that your foul kind dreamed up. I suppose, if your theory is true, it is up to us Iksar to return the &quot;balance&quot;, since the soft skins vile ways have clearly tipped it far too much to the side of anarchy and evil.<br>
<br>
Of course, if I know you creatures, you'll proclaim that you are the only ones who know what the &quot;balance&quot; is. Which means in the end, your just a side fighting for your own usual non sensical, and most likely selfish, soft skin belief, like every other of your kind, contributing to the anarchy that engulfs this world. *shakes his head in dissapointment* <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/bseh42/images/zilsig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/30/02 11:03:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uklash2000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klash2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/31/02 12:54:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaos</span><hr size=1> &lt;The shrouded figure in the corner watches with eyes that glow red like a funeral pyre.

With a yelp of terror, she skitters backwards and, in one fell swoop, manages to knock over her mug of mead, fall off of her stool, and get tangled in the legs of said stool.  With a muttered curse, she momentarily forgets the presence of the Iksar in leiu of more painful experiences - namely, the back of her head.  The yanks off her helmet and touches tentative fingers to her scalp, and pulls them back to see them covered in blood.<br>
<br>
Muttering ferociously - and noting the fact that a) the ground is not littered with partially-eaten &quot;softies&quot;, and b) if Zildrax wanted to eat her, he already would have started - she cast a quick healing spell to help the blood, already starting to clot, knit together more quickly.  As the headache that had once bloomed in her skull subsided, she turned back to Shintou and Zildrax, soaked in mead, and scowling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bloody soft-stepping Iksar,&quot; she mutters under her breath, vowing that NEXT time she'll actually hear one come up, or at the very least, NOTICE one if it's there!<br>
<br>
She turns to the Teir'Dal.  &quot;That is exactly my point!&quot;  In spite of the previous incidents, meaning the near-concussion and the experience of taking a dunking in her drink, she beams a smile at the scowling Dark Elf.  &quot;You seek to see Evil over come everything, thus destroying the Balance and the world.  I don't know what you plan to do when you find out that, as part of the world and the Balance, you'll be overwhelmed and cease to exist as well as Darkness envelopes everything.&quot;  She pauses for a moment, then turns back.  &quot;Oh, and by the by, I'm not a Ranger, many thanks.  I am a Druidess and very proud of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turns now to the lizard-like humanoid that had, and still does, terrify her due to previous personal experiences with his race.&quot;I... uhm...  you, uh...  you found the...  the note I left...  um..  for Shintou,&quot; she stutters, watching the the Iksar warily, refusing to take off her armor to wring out the mead-soaked cloth beneath so that, if the Iksar changes him mind, her flesh would be harder to get to.<br>
<br>
&quot;I.  Uhm.  Err...&quot;  She stops a moment to collect herself, closing her eyes and meditating briefly to surround herself with a feeling of courage and ability.  &quot;Right.  I can understand that we softskins are evil to you.  I don't know a lot about the history of the Iksar, but I do recall the fact that you were ensla-...  um...&quot;  she stops at the angry glare of the Iksar.  &quot;Um.  Retained against your will...?  Something like that...?  By softskins...  I.  Um.  Don't really know which ones, but I would assume elves or humans or...  some race like that.&quot;  She shrinks back a bit, biting her lip nervously.<br>
<br>
&quot;So...  based on that, the actions done against you were actions of Evil, right?  They were selfish of those that..  um... made you...  um...  work for them, and those actions were intentionally cruel.  As hard as Evil is to define - of course, like Good, it is neither black nor white but instead a world of greys - I tend to define it as a being or race that intentionally does harm unto others, continues to do so, and feels no guilt over it.  Instead, they feel pleasure and excitement from others' suffering.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So, yes, what was done to your people was Evil.  However, your desire to enslave the rest of the world is no less Evil.&quot;  She stands up straight again, though she still fiddles a bit with her Paw of Opolla.  &quot;I'm not saying that Evil always allies with Evil.  Darkness often does the same favors unto other Evil beings the same that it does to the Good.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like I mentioned in the note, I don't know words for the forces I'm trying to describe.  I don't know if any lanaguage has these words; maybe there is one.  If so, I plan to find out what it is and learn that lanaguge.  However, since I am not currently given that option, you'll have to bear with the words I choose.<br>
<br>
&quot;And no, I don't think that I am the only one who knows what the Balance is.  Anyone who seeks knowledge will be able to find it.  The thing is that the one who seeks that knowledge must listen with an open, unjudging mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;About my &quot;most likely selfish, soft skin belief&quot;, pray, tell me what that is, since I have little idea of what you're talking about.&quot;  She glares back at the Iksar in a moment of sudden courage. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uamaeliya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amaeliya</A> at: 7/31/02 7:20:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uexiledelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Exiled Elf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/31/02 10:46:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Action &amp; Reaction</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Sitting in the corner Verash listens to the conversation.

“The primary basis for this debate rests on the flawed premises that things such as ‘evil’ and ‘good’ are absolutes. To assume the whole of the cosmos can be explained in terms that our small minds can comprehend is pure mortal arrogance. ‘Good’ and ‘evil’ are forms of morality, not powers within themselves. (chuckles) It is amusing to see so many think that the morality of a few select races governs the makeup of the entirety of existence and not to mention the absurdity in assuming that the gods themselves fall within such mortal limitations.”<br>
<br>
“The universe cares not for struggles of good nor evil and least of all the arrogant ‘keepers of balance’ who think that somehow they save the world from destruction with their laughable theories created to make them feel good about not being strong willed enough to pick a side. No, the universe is a place of action and reaction. Creation is composed and fueled by raw force. Force knows no morality.”<br>
<br>
“The mere thought that your precious balance somehow prevents the world from becoming stagnated? What do you think balance is? Net movement of zero…stagnation….One side conquering the other does not make a world stagnant. Look to the very planes themselves. They are places wholly devoted to a specific force yet stagnant they are not.”<br>
<br>
“Your work at keeping the two forces battling for power on Norrath stems from fear. It is your work that causes this world to stagnate, locked in its current form. You fear the change that will come when one side overcomes the other and move this plane of existence to its next level of evolution.”<br>
<br>
“The Knight of Hate comes closest to the truth with his statement that the goal is to ‘break the bowl’. That is indeed the ultimate goal but what happens after that is where he is mistaken. The purpose of breaking the bowl is not to have evil prevail and the world be bathed in chaosor madness. ‘Evil’ is a mere tool, a catalyst to propel this world into it’s next state. ‘Good’ can also serve the same function. It is the simple minded drones of ‘neutrality’ that are in fact the keepers of stagnation and stasis, which is why they must be destroyed.”<br>
<br>
“Once you begin to comprehend these truths and are able to understand then you too will seek to quicken this world’s rebirth in flames.”<br>

First of all, I reiterate:  Good and Evil are NOT black and white.  It has a lot to do with point of view, and variations in....  oh...  soul.  The humanoid soul.  Or something.  Blast this language!<br>
<br>
&quot;So, they are NOT black and white but instead a world of grays.<br>
<br>
&quot;Secondly, if you believe understanding of the cosmos is impossible to mere mortals, how do you know that you ar right and I am wrong?  Are you not mortal, much like I am, like we all are?<br>
<br>
&quot;Thirdly, if you wish to tell me that my beliefs are wrong and foolish, please, give me proof of how you know what the universe wants and what it does not want.  Beyond what your god says - while your god may say one thing, my god may say another, and it's my god versus your god.  You'll believe your god, I'll believe mine, and we'll both be in bad moods afterwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fourthly - a vital part of the Balance is this &quot;wobbling&quot; of the bowl that everyone seems to have read about in the note I left for Shintou.  If everything were to be completely balanced, then yes, the world would stagnate, and perish.  This, like the complete overwhelming of either Good or Evil, is something that we of the Balance seek to prevent.<br>
<br>
&quot;And lastly, pray tell, what is the next evolution of our world?  And how is it to be attained through its destruction?&quot;  She sighs again, nods to a barmaid, flips her a couple of gold, and then sips heavily from the heavy tankard, wishing to Karana that it would do something to ease the headache that this philosophy brings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 579<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 12:57:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaos</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'll respond to you soft skin...&quot; Zildrax says, folding his arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is absolutely nothing evil about enslavement at all. The defeated have no rights. Why is it you creatures seem to have no problem killing someone and yet detest slavery? They are basically the same thing only one makes a more efficent use of your enemies body. Of course we are not going to be fond of those who enslaved us, which, for your information, were Shissar. But it's assumed one isn't going to have an amiable view of those who defeat them.&quot; Zildrax shrugs, continuing.<br>
<br>
&quot;You soft skins are evil because you are all greedy, selfish, lieing pagans who insist upon being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want. You are the very essence of greed and decadence, of weakness and selfishness. And it is you creatures who defile and tear this world apart. The freedom you creatures cling too selfishly is what causes all the problems you encounter, and yet you insist on clinging to it so you can indulge your own pleasures and do whatever you please. Pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, we Iksar intentionally conquer others, it is nessecary. Obviously you cannot comprehend that this world doesn't get changed by prayers alone and that one has to fight for what they wish to achieve. We use fear to accomplish our goals. We feel no guilt about conquering our enemies. Why would we? Guilt implies we have done somthing wrong. Ridding this world of soft skins is only a good thing, Norrath is far better off without such creatures. We Iksar are cleansing this world of undesirables.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your entire theory is flawed because your kind are all greedy, selfish scum who base your sick idea of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; on what helps allow you to be selfish weaklings and what prevents it. We Iksar are not evil, soft skin. There is nothing evil in what we do. As I said before...since you obviously don't consider the Iksar's, or Cazic-Thule's, standards of right and wrong to be your judging point, you are basing your entire theory on your own, completely wrong and perverse, sense of good and evil. You are just a side, no different then any other.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 8/1/02 1:05:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uamaeliya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amaeliya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 3:36:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaos</span><hr size=1> &quot;Then you say that, when your race was enslaved, that was not evil?  Because, of course, as slaves, you had no rights, no minds, no purpose to exist save but to cater to your master's every whim,&quot; Amaeliya replies calmly, tapping one fingernail softly on her clay mug of mead.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you say that all we softskins are...  what was it... 'greedy, selfish, lying pagans', I believe it was?  Very well.  Riddle me this.  How greedy is the softskin that goes out of his or her way to help others in need?  How greedy is the softskin that gives away weapons and food and armor to those who need it even though said softskin could sell or benifit from that gift themselves?  How selfish is the softskin that does these things?<br>
<br>
&quot;You may say that we have never done these things for your race.  I agree with that - not admit, for there is no guilt on the part of the softskins.  You have not given us any reason to trust you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do Iksar not insist upon doing 'whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want'?  How is this purely a softskin trait?  You say that we will tear apart the world because we want freedom.  I say that is quite a rediculous way of putting it, since you are thinking only of your race.&quot;  She shakes her head ruefully.  &quot;And you claim that we softskins are selfish.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, exucse me for just one moment.&quot;  She sets her mead down, hops from the stool, and sudden blue stars and bubbles float around her.  A brief whirlwind, and she is gone.<br>
<br>
After a handful of moments, she pops back into view, clutching a worn book under one arm.  She pulls herself up onto her stool and opens the book into her lap, searching for the right tale.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope you'll excuse my using the gnomish library to find the history of the Iksar.  If I were to borrow any books from Cabilis, no doubt I should quickly find the book I wished to borrow soaked in my own blood.&quot;  She hits upon the page she wishes to find, and rapidly reads down the hasty-looking writing of the gnomes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah...  I should have done this sooner.&quot;  She closes the book with a small 'thwap' and sets it aside.  &quot;Very well - forgive me my ignorance of Shissar.  So, based on this book, the Shissar were '...devastating and vile, torturing souls for no other reason than their own pleasure and driving the largest slave army ever built to the brink of death and starvation.'  But, of course, as you say, this cannot be evil because it is done to a slave, and slaves have no rights.&quot;  Her tone is laden heavily with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Unfortunately, it does not mention in this text as to whether the Shissar were scaled or softskinned.  If they are scaled, then I cannot imagine your grudge against those with supple skin.  If they were softskinned, I cannot understand why you blame an entire type of being for the fault of one race.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not saying that...  oh, bloody hells.  Here we go with another round of my dispising this language.  I'm not saying that Evil is bad.  It is one end of a spectrum.  Perhaps this is why were cannot agree - you and I have different definitions of the word &quot;evil&quot;, and different affiliations with the terminology.<br>
<br>
&quot;You say that my point of view and my beliefs are 'completely wrong and perverse'.  Why do you expect me to believe you if you, rather selfishly and arrogantly, I might add, believe that you are the master race and that, like slaves, the rest of us in Norrath and Luclin have no purpose to exist save to cater to you as you did once to the Shissar?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 581<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 4:01:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chaos</span><hr size=1> &quot;If that soft skin who is giving things away is not willing to give up their freedom then they are still just as greedy as ever. The only reason to cling to freedom is because you are selfish. They may be doing a selfless thing, but in the end, their still selfish.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't expect you to do any favors for us Iksar. You are our enemies, and I expect you to act accordingly. I never even hinted that you creatures are selfish for not aiding us Iksar. You creatures are selfish when you interact exclusively with eachother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All Iksar are born to their respective caste and spend our entire lives serving the Empire, or they are killed if they refuse. As such, there are no selfish Iksar, we are all fighting for our Empire, our God, and Norrath. What few Iksar who are selfish are not allowed to indulge their desires, as our laws prevent them from doing so and keep them in line. You creatures and your lifestyle breed war, hatred and chaos, and encourage completely selfish behaviour. We Iksar are mostly a unified race, and once we conquer this world, Norrath in it's entirety will be unified through fear, and this weak way of life you creatures have abolished.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And yes, there is nothing &quot;evil&quot; in what one does to a slave. I told you, the defeated have no rights. They could be dead and if they do not wish to be a slave they can kill themselves, they are only alive by the graces of the one who defeated them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Shissar were scaled beings. What we have against you creatures is simple. One, your lifestyle is simply atrocious to us. Two, you do not revere Cazic-Thule. And three, soft skins invaded Kunark and both framed us for things we did not do, and declared war on us for those same things we did not do. You creatures can't even honestly wage war, you have to lie about it and make us out to be villains.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I, soft skin, do say that &quot;evil&quot; is bad, and in my peoples eyes, you creatures are just that. You are chaotic, selfish animals who tear apart this world. I do not know why you exsist, soft skin, but we Iksar do intend to conquer Norrath to rectify that problem. If your balance theory is true, then the world stands to &quot;tip over&quot;, as you say, from the immense amount of wretched soft skins who populate it.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 8/1/02 7:19:53 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=101.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=101.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=101.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=101.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=101.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=101.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
