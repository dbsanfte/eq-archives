I've heard things about this Srir person before, mostly in GFay. I've only grouped with him once and that was in High Keep. He didn't say much, but he kept fearing the mobs out of the room we were in, and didn't respond when we asked him why. Kept pouncing (pardon the pun) on every kill, then after the third time fearing and us asking why, he announced he had to leave. <br><br>He had a guild-tag on.

I was on my alt in PC one day.  Srir had died deeper in, and asked our group to help him get his corpse back (he was higher level than us), and that he would pay each member in my group 100 plat.  We leave our camp and off to get his corpse.  When we get his corpse, he then wants us to stay and kill some big shroom (i guess that is what he died from).  I didn't want to do his kills for him, so i told my group to leave.  After we didn't help him, he took off, not payting them, and stealing one of the other members daggers.<br><br>Pretty low in my book.  If you want a cr, just ask.

I'd been there awhile when Srir runs in and stands in the spawn spot.  I told him I am camping here and asked him to move on.<br><br>He then tells me he's healing and will only be a moment and sits.  Well, I knew what that would do upon spawn, but waited it out anyway because I had the spawns timed.<br><br>Sure enough, an owlbear spawns and his pet starts beating on it.  I calmly walked over and backstab it.  Said sorry, but you should move or you'll get aggro'd while you are healing.  Right after this, the other owlbear popped and took a swipe at him.  I engaged and killed it; then backed away to await the next spawn.<br><br>Srir then started in on the KSing theme and said he'd get a GM here to watch me and mentioned the PnP policy.  I reminded him that he told me he was there to heal and that I was making sure he could heal.( You really must be careful what you said to folks.)  I also mentioned that if he dragged a GM here to this lousy camp spot to PnP me, I'd let everyone know how he plays.<br><br>After about a minute of thinking, I assume, he told me he was joking and ran off.<br><br>Riiiight.  Sorry, I saw the guildtag, but made no note of it.

Why post something that's going to be obsolete soon enough?  And with damn good reason.

Even as I was porting in to warn the gnomes in steamfont about this bastage (I am taking it as my personal quest to warn every zone he goes into whenever he and I are on at the same time until I get tired of it), he's advertising for help for the traditional vaporous 100plat.  Even as I am in contact with his guild officer, he sends me a tell (After I've shouted in gnomish specifically what he does and why to get payment up front) saying &quot;Hey, I still owe you money don't I?&quot;<br><br>When his guildie arrives, I am told that &quot;He isn't the one who did that to me&quot; and that &quot;He says I am mistaken&quot;.  I directed the guild officer HERE so he could see that whereas I MIGHT be mistaken (But I am not...I have logs this time), the Modus Operandi is pretty obvious and Srir is not imaginative enough to modify it.<br><br>His behavior speaks for itself.  But then something strange happened and several of us went LD in Steamfont.  When we came back, of Course, Srir did not bother to come back.  <br><br>But that's ok.  I'll be looking for him.  And now with my new 34 spells, I have even greater mobility.  It's not tough to sit in a zone and warn people about this guy...and it's worth it to take away from my hunting time to do so.<br><br>Also, I met a couple of you in game.  Nice people all...not a single &quot;mercenary&quot; type in the bunch.<br><br>One note: When Srir denied in shouts that he was the culprit, I threatened to port in every victim of his whom I could find online into the zone so they could confront him directly.  He did not have much to say about that.  And I am serious.  Anyone online when he's around, feel free to toddle over to his zone or contact me for a free port so you can get there and warn people about him.  This happens often enough one of two things will happen: 1) His infamy will make gaming very difficult and he will have to play nice, or 2) he will stop playing.<br><br>I'm hoping for 2, but weasels like this don't just go away.  Their idea of fun is how much they can screw over other people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=999.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=999.topic&start=41&stop=47>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=999.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=999.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=999.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=999.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=999.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=999.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
