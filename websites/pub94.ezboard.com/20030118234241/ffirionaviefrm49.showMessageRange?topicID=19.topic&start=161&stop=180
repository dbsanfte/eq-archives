This guy is also at fault for his abrasive attitude twords someone not directly involved. We are flaming HIM for his wishy washy post and his obvious disregard for other people. This is no longer about her, its about his wrongdoings.

My opening line to Vivienne was not I&quot;m posting logs...<br>
It was Are you the leader and may I speak to you?<br>
Her Exact reply to me was:<br>
I know of the Actions of my daughter, and your attacks upon our city&quot;  when those words were spoken I OBVIOUSLY thought she knew the whole story, so to me that response was rude and crass as I was trying to resolve the problem. IF she had said yes, how can I help you...I WOULD HAVE NEVER threathned her.  I spoke to another officer of another guild during that night as well for the actions of one of his members he said he would look into it did, his member said it was an accident and we kept us between ourselves)  I'm not here flaming them.  Why they are a well respected guild. And the officer handled things perfectly.  I'm not out for  some sort of justice I think dorphen and dalion are comming to the aid of a friend and nothing more.  IF her response would have simply been yes how can I help you etc....I would have explained the situation to her and seen her response.<br>
But to tell me when I FIRST SAY HELLO that YES I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED obvioulsy show me that she didn't care at all that their members where training.  Which from her own words was then later confirmed over and over.<br>
IT was only after her attitude towards me in the beginning that I said I'm going to Plaster the logs on the board.  Its amazing how out of everyone here there are 2 or 3 trying to turn the situation back on msyelf when I tried to handle things through the appropriate channels.  STOP making excuses for her and her guildmembers actions.  I opened by saying hello and she replied by saying She knew of her actions..it was the brazen attitude of I Know what she did and don't care that caused me to react as such.  I did not do so when speaking to the other person earlier on in the night.  <br>
If she hadn't come off with such an arrogant line after I had been trained I wouldn't have replied with such an attitude.<br>
Like I have said before I find it amazing that their story went from<br>
Yes we did and its okay<br>
to after some major outcry<br>
No it wasn't us...shes young/they cursed/she couldn't have survived it etc etc.........<br>
If noone had said anything I'm sure her response would still have been same.  She's not sorry far from it, she's saying as much to save face because she condoned training.  Thats all it is and its SOOOO obvious.  The only one I think Is actually sorry is Mizz from my In game talks with her.  And most of the reasonable people on this server will agree with those points.<br>
Thats it I'm done, I sent the log to mizzery herself so she can review it.<br>

We all put our trust in people and dont want to admit when they screwed up and they lie to us of the crime. <br>
<br>
That being said I went to my original server Cazic thule to my 14th level DE enchanter and stood below the walls after targeting Tempi I cast my nuke and ran to the zone area out of their casting range to where they had to COME to me and yes they came to me and I then zoned with no damage to me.<br>
<br>
Now had there been someone of worse faction than me there they would have easily been trained, no doubt and I could have watched then zoned as I seen them running as well. I have seen level 4s try to train me on this server it is possible so stop trying to use level as an unlikely possibility. <br>
<br>
Also it is stated above as I easily read from the beginning and reading thru each of these posts that the accused did do it and Mommy knew. Therefore the rest of you look harder at what you read and dont be ready to flame others without full knowledge of the events. <br>
<br>
No one in their right mind would come here with a doctored log when it could be easily shown otherwise by someone elses log that may have been running. Have we seen other logs? No, therefore its an easy case to solve and therefore no need to banter and rage over something that makes you look *quote from Ish* Less than intelligent. <br>
<br>
Yes the matter could have been sent to maybe a few others in the guild but 1 insult was set upon by a second and he got mad and posted the log here and petitioned. He did only ask for an apology and whether heart felt or not it is easily done.<br>
<br>
Anyways May the rest of your Raids be plentiful and all have a great time gaming today and everyday.<br>

<br>
Why are you trying so hard to defend bad behavior? Whether Myth did the deed or not, she gloated over it, and then her GL defended her and applauded training as a good tactic during home city raids. <br>
<br>
I usually love your posts dearly, but right now I'm baffled by why you are so strongly defending Vivienne's behavior by niggling over the details. Whether they were trained by that member specifically or not isn't important. What is important is that said member gloated over them being trained and then the leader condoned it.<br>

I normally don't get involved in all this stuff.  But I got a tell last night from Aailin asking that I come here and post what happened. So I started an account today on ez board. What a pain.  I don't want to take up a lot of time (ooc-school starts soon *cries*)  <br>
<br>
All I can say was Aailin and Qwenu where GREAT..  They roleplayed and had fun the entire time.  Poor Aailin even died at one point helping his friend *cries again*.  There was one person in the group who was a little rude but Aailin was great the whole time.  They let me Loot  all their kills and even buffed me so I could run to Najenna <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .<br>
<br>
Anyone who is saying he was cursing is just being a lying jerk.  Don't think anyone cursed whole time I was there. Hmmm...well the peeing in the fountain thing some of his raid members did was a bit crude *shrugs*.  Oh and there were no duels I know about, at least didn't see any.<br>
<br>
I won't say what happened with the train because I didn't see but there were people there talking about doing it.  <br>
Sorry this happened to you Aailin but your are a FANTASTIC guy, thank you for everything and remember what I said about the other server.<br>

I'm not defending Aailin at all, and in previous posts mentioned that he could have handled things differently as well. I'm just saying that the response on Viv's part was inappropriate for a guildleader. <br>
<br>
The facts that concern *me* aren't debatable by game mechanics. Vivienne admits that her part in the log is correct, and it's THAT behavior that I find unfavorable. Let's hope she means what she says and will change her tune when handling issues as a guildleader in the future. <br>
<br>
Guildleaders are not supposed to take their members' sides blindly. They are to do what Mizzery did: listen and then discuss the issue with the members. <br>
<br>
edit: I realize Viv has come forward about events and that things are settled. The above is directed at Dalion in an attempt to explain that whether Myth trained Aailin or not based on game mechanics is not really important. <br>

No one died, lost exp or needed to do a CR, so whats wrong with a little in-character gloating?<br>
<br>
At any rate, this arguement is over. Lets hope a few things happen from now. 1. Vivienne learns to deal with such problems in a more dipolmatic manner. 2. Aailin makes completely sure that he is accusing the right person before making an accusation and becomes more polite in his requests to other guild leaders (If you are a rude whiney bastard, expect to be flamed for it).<br>

She uses the fact she was trained on, albeit accidentally (yes, I do not classify a bard kiting to a spot he thought was empty and had been for his previous kites over a 3 hour period as any but unintentional), as justification to call the possible intentional training of a young one (meaning level, not age) as ingenious.  She continues to hold that position.  She, as leader of her guild, continues to condone and even encourage training under specific circumstances.  But... will those acceptable circumstances change to suit whim?  She, as leader of her guild, is making a statement about Guild policy.  That guild policy, her words as leader, are what are reprehensible and need to be rescinded not excused.  <br>
<br>
I really could care less if the raider actually were trained or by whom.  That has not been the issue for me or for many many others.  The total issue is the fact that she, as leader of the guild, condoned and applauded its possible occurance.<br>

<br>
While Ish and Caillou are among the people I respect most on the server, I disagree that the entire essence of whats going on has to do with Viv's response.<br>
<br>
Mythria was publicly accused on a 9 page thread of training, and may very well not have done it. On a server where reputations are so important, I think that is an injustice that deserves an apology.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I hope we see less of this in the future, too. It is a dangerous precident to set.<br>
