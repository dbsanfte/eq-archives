If, however, someone has bought an entire character then their lack of education will hurt other people, so I am opposed to that.<br>

It affects everyone on the servers where it happens a lot. If you havent seen how out of control it can get, it might not appear to be that bad, but I assure you. It can get really grim... I'll give you two examples off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
Example 1: Lets say soooo many people have farmed Uber Weapon X that the price has dropped to virtually nothing on them, allowing low-level meleers to afford to buy them 30 levels before they would normally be able to earn them. <br>
<br>
As a result, you dont need 6 people to destroy low level Camp A. You barely need 3. Thus a zone like North Ro, which might normally support 18-22 people comfortably, can now only support 10-12 before it becomes overcrowded. Your life and game play is affected. You can easily adjust to this, obviously. Its clearly not a worse case scenario, but it would affect you.<br>
<br>
Example 2: Lets say Verrant does not intend for monks to be main tanks at high levels, but due to farming/duping/Ebaying certain items that increase Monk AC become overly available. As a result, groups start to seek out Monks as main tanks because they can also do great damage... <br>
<br>
Soon, the need for warriors wanes a great deal. Warriors have a hard time finding groups, and obviously cant solo, so they start rerolling or leave the game disgusted. Then Verrant decides to adjust Monks so they cant tank so well, in order to restore warriors to their position of main tanks, but by doing so everyone is left in a lurch because there are so few warriors who remain, as everyone has either remade monks or casters.<br>
<br>
The economy and the player power base are bound to be affected as the game itself ages. Items that were once 10K gradually become more accessible, more frequent, and easier to purchase...<br>
<br>
And Im not saying that the economy of FV is really vulnerable to this. The player base and the economy are more protected here. People are more commited to the integrity of the game and their characters. Harvesting is almost impossible.<br>
<br>
But Ive seen it happen elsewhere, and it isnt pretty, I assure you. Thats why Im all for keeping it out of the game as much as possible.<br>

First of all, very, very few newbies will pay $1k+ for characters.  Would you spend that much on a game you hardly know?  No, mainly it's people who have played the game long enough to really know what they're buying.  Newer players probably buy gear more than anything.  So really, it doesn't affect the gameplay that much.  Most of the time when a character acts like a real newbie at lvl 60, it was genuinely someone giving the account to his brother or something.<br>
<br>
Secondly, EBay isn't prevalant enough to change class definitions -- and it really couldn't.  VERY little high-end gear is sold (when it is, the supply is cut immediately -- i.e. the person selling it gets booted from their guild), most of it is easy to sell for plat stuff (fungus tunics, SCHW, etc.) which is then sold on EBay.<br>
<br>
The big problem I have with EBay is when people sell stuff that isn't really &quot;theirs&quot;.  I don't care if some lvl 60 necro who was never guilded and bought/camped all his gear sells on E-Bay -- even if I did, it's not really my business.  But when a warrior who's gotten all of his gear from hours spent by his guild decides to make a quick $2k, it irritates me a lot.  The same goes for EBaying such loot. <p>--Lacus<br>

<br>
More protected because the server population is much smaller.<br>
<br>
Less protected because with the removal of no-drop, a much wider array of armor and weapons become available to characters who on other servers wouldn't be able to even ninja loot those items.<br>
<br>
I don't think gear would be sold in a class-weighted manner as the example you have above (ie: If monk gear is being sold, you can bet warrior gear is being sold).  Likewise, I don't think gear is sold for RL money to any extent great enough to cause such an imbalance.<br>
<br>
Popular items are camped, period.  Regardless of whether they're being sold for RL cash or in-game platinum.  If something is worth a lot, people will camp it.<br>
<br>
Even if for some reason the whole server got big enough a bug up it's butt to go out and buy a bunch of equipment and twink newbies with it, our server population is so low that tripling the crowding in low level zones wouldn't do anything.  Sure, paludal would get crowded, but Stonebrunt was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> empty</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> every night I was out there this week.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying Verant should &quot;legalize&quot; selling items for RL cash, just saying that for all intents and purposes it has 0 impact on my gameplay in it's current form (a few people doing it for whatever reason).<br>

<br>
I think you both are referring to the Ebay situation as it currently stands on FV. I was referring primarily to the way it was when it was in full swing. While it has had a very limited affect on FV, it still affects other servers, and likely would have more of an affect both here and elsewhere were it not for the fact that about 12-18 months ago Verrant acted to shut down as much Ebaying as it could.<br>
<br>
The period previous to that, when Ebaying was in full swing and the duping bug was open, continues to have an affect on the economy of The Nameless (my old server). Everyone who was there during that period knows how much it messed that server up. If you're curious, ask about it on the server post board (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern).">pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern).</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
People were not paying $1k for accounts; at the time, there were not many accounts being sold to be honest. It was mostly items: people would pay hundreds of dollars for FBSSs, Mithril armor, GEBs, etc. I had unemployed friends who made a better living than I did (working fulltime as an editor) by Ebaying items they camped and duped... As a result, the server became flooded with gear. Two years ago, anyone could purchase items meant for characters 30 levels higher than their current one... This accelerated the maturity of the server, destroyed the balance of gameplay, and caused the server's economy to go into a spiral that it still hasnt pulled out of.<br>
<br>
It disrupted things to an extent that continues to amaze me. <br>
<br>
I agree with you both that it likely wont happen here. Harvesting items is very difficult. The server population is low. People invest more of themselves in their characters, and in general have more respect for the integrity of the server and the game.<br>
<br>
As the Ogah incident has proven, however, the affects of Ebay can still be felt. And as the game ages, more accounts are likely to be sold off in this matter. It will have an affect on FV, albeit hopefully a very minor one. If it wasnt held in check, though, by Verrant acting as they have, I believe the affect might have been much more significant. And thus... I am glad that Verrant acted in the manner they did when they did.<br>
<br>

This was the extended explination I was hoping to avoid. hehe I probably should have written it out originally.<br>
