I mean when FV was announced I was thrilled to death, but most of my mates on MT were upset, displeased, downright angry??  I was part of the original pilgramage to MT to make it the RP server, and yet I am willing to go over to FV with no problems...so why do others resist?<br>
<br>
I hear the argument that 'I am such and such a level' or 'I have this or that item...' but is that what RP is about?<br>
<br>
I will not lie, my highest level characters are laughable to many, and pathetic to some, but the reason is that I RP more then 'play' EQ.  I feel that those who blew off FV, and many great RPers still not comming over unfortunatly, feel threatened by a 'offical' RP server.<br>
<br>
That or they hate the new rules. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If RP was the only factor, then I'd say you're much better off MUSHing for an RP experience.<br>
<br>
Levels, Items, etc. are a big part of EQ and a part of the fun.<br>
<br>
If you want to play a Knight in Shining Armor Paladin, well, EQ is going to force you to play a dirt poor Paladin who has to flee from orc pawns or tough bats of no stature for quite awhile.<br>
<br>
It comes down to a Cost/Benefit ratio.  If you were satisfied with the RP experience on your old server, and you don't think that the features on FV are a substantial improvement/draw, then there is no reason to switch, and it doesn't make you any less of a Roleplayer for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 5:39:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1214.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The reluctance of 'roleplayers' to leave their servers..</span><hr size=1> &lt;i am not complaining! I swear!&gt;<br>
<br>
I think that some folks that are &quot;roleplayers&quot; do try FV, but are discouraged by the challenging ruleset on FV. Lets face it, the basic ruleset for EQ is fairly simplistic and some people really don't want to have to deal with some of the conditions on FV.<br>
<br>
I know comparing paper and pencil RPGs to computer games isnt fair..but here me out on this one...<br>
<br>
Its like when we played GURPS fanatasy or AD&amp;D we rarely had a communication barrier. It wasnt realistic of course, but gosh, we wanted to roleplay and have some fun... and our idea of fun included being able to understand each other. So all of our starting characters had common. On FV, its a little tuffer (more realistic) and a baby troll doesnt automatically get to speak to a dark elf. I like that fact, but some folks might not.<br>
<br>
Anyways, thats my 2 bits. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But as time has gone by they fixed it and for those willing to spend ALOT of time building languages they can so it's not to bad anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uleatherneckoftunare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leatherneck of Tunare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 6:14:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1214.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The reluctance of 'roleplayers' to leave their servers..</span><hr size=1> Also, I know for me, leaving behind a beloved character IS tough.

<br>
My friends. Most of my friends, who I had tons of, I had to leave behind. I didn't want too, but I knew if I didn't I'd feel I'm missing out on somthing. I still miss all of them dearly...<br>
<br>
My equipment and levels. The original Zildrax has 150 days played time on him. That's not easy to leave behind, and I had my epic among other things and was 4 blues from 60. I was proud of everything I learned and it was fun to play with. Despite what people say, levels are directly tied into roleplaying. You can't roleplay a really powerful Shaman if your level 5. I liked being the High Mystic of Cazic-Thule but in order to do that my level had to be very high, otherwise people just don't respect your rank. <br>
<br>
My characters personailty and history. This was very hard, the Zildrax of Morell-Thule had the best personailty, best relations and a really deep and long history forged by ingame events. I had to abandon ALL of that, as you can't come to a new server and proclaim your the &quot;High Mystic&quot; at level 1, with no powers to back you up, and no followers. Everything I developed on MT I had to give up...and it really sucked having to do that. The Zildrax who exsisted on MT will always be the &quot;real&quot; Zildrax to me.<br>
<br>
So that's why leaving MT was very hard and I always have and always will have a bit of a resentment of FV for forcing me to make that decision. I know I could have just stayed, but everything on MT started to change around FV's launch date. Besides...now the only reason I play EQ is for my guild, Skathris Ven'Sho. <br>

Also, if I hadn't canceled EQ a year ago, I'd be back on my old server and chars and not here.  I really didn't want to make a new char there and end up feeling like a twink-mooch.  There are a couple of my old friends still playing there -- maybe they'll come over to FV and maybe not.  I wouldn't have asked for stuff, but they're very generous and I'd not have been able to refuse.  I'm not playing nearly as much as I did then, too.  I used to be as fanatical about leveling and the end-game as FnF folks are here.

Over the last month I have logged onto that server maybe 10x.  I am 14 blues from 60 and my gear is pretty nice.  I have sent tells to old friends, yelled LFG ran from zone to zone LFG......nothing.  I got a group one time with some old friends and that was fun but 1/10 isnt.  So I thought to myself....why not level up Ichi and the Druid slave he has.  So I did.  Now when I go back it just doesnt feel like home.<br>
<br>
The politics there are more crazy than here.  I have decided to keep out of politics as much as i can despite my strong opinions.  <br>
<br>
I still miss my friends there.  But...there are more Im making here.  The wife feels the same way.  She hasnt even gone back to the old server for more than a cruise of Luclin to help us learn what to do there with our current characters here.<br>
<br>
I agree this game is more of a hobby than an addiction now.  My god I used to leave work early (easy cuz i own the place) and hurry home, shovel food in my face, hug my kids and sit in front of the computer 3-4 nights a week for guild raids.  I did this for 6 months straight almost.  TOO MUCH!<br>
<br>
I have since backed off.  RL is too important.  That is a big reason we came here.  Different setting.  More relaxed gamers.  Adults to hang with.  Thats right Adults.  I think we have more adult, normal, respectful people here per ratio of kids/jerks.  Now there are some very adult like 13 year olds in this game.  I in fact know about 3-4 that I was guilded with and friends with on the old server that I would play with over anyone else as they are kind, well manered and could play their character EXTREMELY well.  They also expected less of you when you messed up.  Kids are like that.  Us adults tend to expect more eheh  just my 2cp.<br>

<br>
And no, I am not deluded into thinking EQ is all RP, but yes...I do make items and loot take a backseat to my RP experience.<br>
<br>
Friends are hard to loose...that is why I play on MT and FV as of now...but when the world you play in (MT for example) makes the game feel dull and lifeless, well sometimes the move and possible loss is worth it.<br>
<br>
FV is a baby server still...epics, horses, and loot are rare...certain areas of the world that are 'safe' and settled on other worlds are wild and untamed (Desert of Ro is a good example!), and the server is specificaly geared towards roleplaying.  Yes not everyone will agree with the rule set, I happen to love it all and only worry about some of the problems the TLC makes...but overall the server has show me (Still a very young player) that is is filled with roleplayers who are willing to take time to play in character with you and make the adventure mean more.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the input, I look forward to more time on the server even more.<br>

I like the concept of the role-playing server very much, particularly the language and alignment factors.  I even played a little when it was still in testing. In my mind this was how EQ should have been from the very beginning.  However, opening the server 2 ½ years after release is much too late for me.  <br>
<br>
I have friends on Tunare and a strong commitment to my guild, not to mention over 130 days (that’s 3,120 hours) invested in my primary character. If I were starting today I’d definitely make my character on Firiona Vie, but when I read how it is hard to find groups and what a pain the TLC is, I’m not particularly motivated to make the switch.<br>

About the TLC, I have to question whether this really promotes role-playing or just creates a needless hurdle for players.  How RP is it for you to know in advance what items you’ll need before even being given a quest because you know the creatures that have those quest items will /consider green when you’re capable of completing the quest?  So everyone in Norrath is supposed to be clairvoyant?  <br>
<br>
I don’t know how many of you have played DAoC, but their questing system is so much better.  Yes, DAoC has a TLC but it’s not a problem for quests because you get quest items even off of creatures that don’t give experience…and you don’t receive quest items unless you’ve already initiated the quest.  In DAoC you don’t have to store several bags of quest items in the bank, wondering what the heck they’re for, before finally finding the spoiler information on some website like you do in EQ.<br>
<br>
So yes, having to leave friends and guildmates is the primary reason, time invested in character obtaining experience, skills, and items a secondary reason, with the TLC and the lack of people to play with being a tertiary reason for not changing servers.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*<br>
<br>
I wanted to add that I don't feel threatened by the existence of an official RP server, nor do I feel like I'm any less an RPer because I don't play on it.  It sounds like you guys have a lot of fun, but I have fun on my regular server, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Oh, and shame on that troll for enslaving a poor druid!  If I were her I'd port you to Surefall Glade and let those Jaggedpine Treefolk teach you a thing or three! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Especially leaving behind character(s) youve worked and cared for for so long and not to mention friends. Ive just settled in to Firiona Vie but im not going to abandon my own server. I plan on playing both servers but if I find I cant do it (because of time constraint for one thing), I have a sneaking suspicion that I will choose my server over Firiona Vie. Sad because I really like this server.<br>

<br>
I was burned out on EQ just before FV came into beta.  I had levelled up my main to near-uber status and I was tiring of the constant camps, guild politics, and the game in general.<br>
<br>
I took a couple-month break, and started anew when FV came live.  I logged onto my old character once to give away my stuff, and once to see who the SoL graphics looked on a high-level character.<br>
<br>
FV has given EQ a new life for me.  TThe rule-set is great, but it's the quality-over-quantity population that really makes it superior.  The people are simply a cut above on this server.<br>

But, I might go back and visit :P<br>

People would log on.... do who all friends.... if they where the first they would wait about 5 min..... decide no one was playing.... log to old server..... Second person logs on &lt;Wash rinse, repeat&gt;.... Until all but me and one other went back.... /sigh, I think a lot of people came here looking for any signs of the same old thing, and the first time they saw such, championed that as the reason that nothing was different and they may as well go back to what was comfortable. <p>Kazanti Er'Idine<br>

Actually, you don't have to deal with all that.  Go to your chat options and turn it off.  I did a very long time ago after a brief and utterly unsuccessful crusade to persuade all the goofs who used the channels indiscriminantly to use the correct channel.  <br>
<br>
The only times I'll have /shout or /ooc on is occasionally when we're doing a raid.  As most of the time we communicate in /gu, I use the public channels very rarely. <p><b>Tresjoli Louveteau</b>
