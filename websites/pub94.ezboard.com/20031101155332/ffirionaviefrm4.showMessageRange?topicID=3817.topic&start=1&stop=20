<br>
Why imposter you ask?<br>
<br>
Well, this is probably one of the lowest things in my 2 years of EQ i've ever seen done.<br>
<br>
Let me give you some background first.<br>
<br>
The Knights of the Ebon Wolf are a very small, low to mid level RP guild on this server.  They are also a very old guild on this server.  They were started not long after FV opened.  The guild grew at a nice pace with good people as members.  <br>
<br>
The original guild leader of KOTEW was a person by the name of Safron, she with a few others started the guild.<br>
Unfortunetly, Safron was struck by a drunk driver and was in a coma for a long time.  During that time, the guild without having an active GL was forced to disband and reform under another name.  Every member left.<br>
All except one.  His name was Fallguy.  See, Fallguy made a promise to Safron when he joined that he would always be a member of KOTEW.  Even when she was in a coma and everyone else left, he stayed.  Alone.  Just so the guild tag wouldn't dissapear.  He was alone for a year.  <br>
Through all that time he watched his friends grow and join other guilds. Guilds like Resolution and Fire and Fury.  He stayed behind and rarely leveled, as he wanted to be able to stay behind so that when Safron awoke from her coma she would log on and have someone in Her old guild to play with.<br>
<br>
A few months ago, Fallguy heard that Safron has awokend from her Coma and was coming back to EQ.<br>
He spoke to her, and she passed down leadership to him so he could try to rebuild the guild they loved.<br>
He petitioned to GM's and was given an officer title by them(GM's were aware of what happened to Safron).<br>
With the officer title he went and recruited people to help rebuild.  The guild grew back to the 15 or so member mark.  And they all looked forward to having Safron back as their leader.  Fallguy put all his time into this guild as shown by this website  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://kuboko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/">kuboko.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
He went out of his way to make all the new members understand the history the guild had.<br>
Well, one day he recieved a tell from a Bard named Raile.  In turns out that this Raile was one of the original founding members of KOTEW.  At that time she was known as Cuellari(spelling might be off).  Overjoyed at having her back Fallguy invited her back into the guild.<br>
<br>
Well, recently KOTEW had some upheavel and a few members left, and then came back.  During this time Fallguy was not available much.  Well, he logged on one day to find out that He and those he invited had been deguilded.<br>
How did this happen if he was the defacto leader?<br>
Well Raile took that time to Petition to the GM's and say that the guild had some upheavel and Fallguy had left and she needed to be made GL.  Since she had an accomplice Feelean who backed her story the GM's gave her the title of GUild leader.  She then deguilded Fallguy and all the other loyal members and took control of the guild.  She did this because way back when they started KOTEW she wanted to be Guild leader but everyone voted for Safron.  So this is her revenge.  <br>
<br>
She now refuses to give Fallguy back the guild he stayed in alone and worked to rebuild..  So here we have someone who lied to Gm's, and stabbed in the back someone who may well be the most honorable person on this server.<br>
<br>
This really makes me sick.  For those of you who know fallguy and what he did to just keep alive a guild tag, for a friend who suffered a RL injury I'm sure this will anger you.  I'm just utterly disgusted that anyone would stoop to that level.  <br>
<br>
This wasn't about loot.  This wasn't about trying to bring the guild in a differnt direction.  This was simply about Raile having revenge. This was about her having to steal control of a low level guild, who mainly just playted together and have fun, for no other reason then to hurt people.  And now, people like Fallguy and other loyal members are crushed that everything they stood for and went through to keep a name alive is gone.<br>
<br>
They have petitioned Gm's, so far with no response.<br>
He's devastated and has no idea what else to do.<br>
<br>
So I'm bringing this up before the FV community as a whole.  I'm sure, this person is thinking they can now rebuild the guild how they want. So I'm posting this for you all to be aware that if you see this bard Raile that shie is really a major fuckin lowlife.<br>
<br>
At this point, I don't know what else Fallguy can do.<br>
He's actually crushed.  And no one should have to feel that way over a silly game.  I'm starting a thread on their site pledging support to Fallguy.  I know it would make him feel better if he knew there were others out there who feel for him.  <br>
<br>
So I started a thread on their boards at:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guildsay.com/boards/view_thread.php?id=37499&type=g&board=399">www.guildsay.com/boards/v...&board=399</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I would normally never ask this, as their is enough drama on this server at times.  But I know how hurt Fallguy is.  All I ask is if you feel the way I do, that you drop by that thread and post some words of support to Fallguy so he can see that the FV community as a whole is made up of good people and that others do feel for him.<br>
<br>

<br>
As with a lot of people who were involved in this, I feel betrayed. I think it has hit Fallguy the hardest because this guild meant a lot to him. <br>
<br>
I think I joined back when there were fewer than 5 active members....Fallguy worked hard to keep this guild alive and to have it taken like this is terrible. Feelen was an alright guy too....he is her RL husband I believe and hence they worked together to cause this.<br>
<br>
I would like to see it back for Fallguy.....but I am unsure how much of the guild would return. What worried me the most is that the GM gave leadership to Raile without questioning Fallguy or the officers.<br>

Raile, there's really no point in perpetuating this foolishness. At this point, any guild your name is associated with is doomed. Now's the time to do the right thing, salvage what you can of your dignity, and give back what you stole. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=waii>waii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/6/03 6:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3817.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: sigh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=238692" target="top">Waii</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->TEXAN !!<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Waii.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I don't usually reply to things let alone something in the soapbox, but this just...really hit a nerve.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for Safron and for Fallguy for all his hard work and dedication to a good friend he wished to help.<br>
<br>
I hope things work out for you both.<br>

<br>
Personally, I wouldn't want to be in a guild where someone stole leadership like that.  I would leave if I knew about it.<br>
<br>
My sympathies also lie with Safron and Fallguy. I hope someone listens to Fallguy and his friends soon.  He should have leadership restored ASAP.<br>

And he thinks that Raile was able to petition for leadership because she was the original leader as Cuelarri.  I guess the guild being under her account or something.  She left the game and then Safron took over.  Now getting the guild back the way she did is wrong.  VERY wrong.  But what gets me is how could the GMs do that.  Would it be just because she was the original leader?  That seems like crap, since she left.  Who knows.  I like Fall and hope he gets it back.  I used to like Raile too.<br>
<br>
Oh and just so you know.   Raile did this after 5 officers(including her) got booted from the guild from a major misunderstanding.  Fallguy wanted to bring everyone back after the air had been cleared.  Four of the officers had made peace with the situation.  One obviously did not.  <br>
<br>
By no means does that excuse what Raile did.  Just thought you might want to see when and possibly why it occurred.  <br>
<br>
I hope you all can put pressure on her to quit the guild because I can't see the GMs giving it back to Fallguy.<br>
