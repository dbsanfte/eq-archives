Cursing myself inwardly that I slept so late into the day (though twas truly just a matter of chance that the day was almost gone when Lord Thule returned me to the waking world), I at first dismiss the blur, which is now moving toward me at increasing speed. <br>
<br>
My eyes widen as they make out the shape of a troll running straight for me, a large, gnarled club held in huge, clawed hands. Then I notice a smaller form just ahead of him. It takes me an instant to recognize my Nana---Marha---running from the troll, her skirts hiked above her knees, her normally pleasant dwarven face distorted into a mask of fear as her screams break the silence of Felwithe. <br>
<br>
&quot;Marha!&quot; I gasp, summoning the power to smite the troll. At the back of my mind, I sense something not right with the scene before me, but with little time to think it over, I smite the troll with my strongest spell. The troll staggers and I see Marha's eyes light up with hope---but just then I see what is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wrong</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with the scene unfolding before me. Firstly, Marha's feet are moving frantically, but the speed at which she approaches me is unrealistically slow. It is as if she is suspended in time, each desperate stride only taking her no farther than a baby-step from her attacker. <br>
<br>
Secondly, there is a peddler pushing his cart down the street, and he looks up, removes his hat, and bows to me cordially, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>does not even glance at the troll.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> These thoughts come to me so quickly, that before I sort them out, I scream as the club comes crashing down on Marha's head in a spray of blood and brains. <br>
<br>
And then Marha and the troll just blink out, as if they were never there. There should have been blood on the cobblestones. Even the echo of her screams resounding off of the manors. But all was silent. <br>
<br>
The peddler stands gaping at me, then hurriedly grasps the handles of his cart and runs off, with one final look over his shoulder at the madwoman he thinks me to be. And indeed, mad I must be, because I hear footsteps running to the door and Marha calling out to my father to come quickly, that she was napping and heard a scream outside the door. Panicking, I weave the simple magicks of a gate. I can't let them see me, for the first time in years, in this state.<br>
<br>
Something very bizarre is happening to me, and I need to figure out its nature before allowing myself close to those I love so dearly. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 12/8/02 10:39:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 675<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/02 10:39:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flight from Felwithe</span><hr size=1> (wow, lots of stuff happening right now... hard to keep updated)<br>
<br>
~~Some time after Isharra's trouble in Felwithe~~<br>
<br>
The ointment Isharra applied to the wound on her arm eased the pain a bit, but did nothing to heal it. The Shamaness had seemed doubtful that it would work, especially since Isharra's own powerful magicks had done nothing to cure the twin puncture wounds on her arm. <br>
<br>
And even more troubling was her constant state of thirst---no, more like hunger. But she would <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> allow herself to feed on that which would ease her deteriorating condition. She had not chosen this path for herself, but she would make choices now that would determine her fate, if she could. And her first choice was to find a cure for this god-forsaken disease, if it could indeed be called that. <br>
<br>
&quot;You must kill the one who turned you. . .&quot; the voice of a memory whispered in her mind. But how was that possible when the one who turned you was so powerful? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 12/9/02 2:41:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smallcutepuppy>smallcutepuppy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 646<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/02 12:40:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=63>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flight from Felwithe</span><hr size=1> (( Can't wait to see where this goes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 681<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/02 12:45:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flight from Felwithe</span><hr size=1> (( I can't either...

It was becoming increasingly harder to sleep at night. Since returning  from the world of dreams, the cleric had had disturbing visions when she was in more populated places, thus, she had purchased a small home in the Rathe Mountains, far from the waking world. So far, the mountains had been a sanctuary from her visions. Not only did the mountains give her peace from visions, but she was free here to ponder an even greater problem: how to remedy her weakening body. There were enough bears around for her sustenance, and she was away from prying eyes. Her raven Blixquick cawed from his corner of her dark room, and she could feel his eye upon her. He was a gift from Treewhisper to help her keep in contact with the world from her mountain den. He was eerily intelligent, and he even spoke a few words. But his most astounding trait was his ability to know precisely where to deliver his messages, even when he had never been to a location. He was, in all ways, an amazing bird, and Isharra’s only company when she was secluded at home. <br>
<br>
Isharra swung her feet over the side of the bed and stumbled to the floor, her feet sinking into the lush carpetry with which she had adorned her little cottage. Not for the first time, she wondered how long she would last. Now she could barely stand. Using the furniture for support, she lit a candle and inched toward her washing stand. She gazed into the mirror , frightened of what she would see. The face staring back at her in the flickering candlelight was pale, the cheeks sunken, and dark circles surrounded her usually vibrant emerald eyes.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I look like a corpse</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, she pondered gloomily, lowering her eyes to the half-filled washbowl. <br>
<br>
Placing the candle on the nearby writing desk, she splashed her face, the chilly water chasing away her fatigue, if only for a few moments. Then she sat down at her writing desk, tucking her night dress around her cold legs. She took up her pen, dipped it in ink, then began to write a note, her hand shaking with weakness. <br>
<br>
My Lord Dominion:<br>
<br>
My condition has deteriorated. My healing powers do nothing against this vile disease.  Please help me. You may return a note with Blixquick to arrange a meeting, or invade my thoughts, as you usually do. <br>
<br>
Yours, Lady Isharra Moonsong<br>
<br>
She closed the parchment, then sealed it with wax, using a generic insignia to stamp the wax, to avoid too many questions from his comrades at Castle Storm. She scrawled, “A private missive for Lord Dominion Sinchyld,” across the front and attached the parchment to the thong that would go around Blix’s neck.  Then, too weary to stand, she clucked at Blix, who flapped from his perch and onto her desk. “To Castle Storm,” she wheezed, placing the strap around his neck. “And hurry.”   <p><br><img

The hearth has grown cold, and I fumble through my pack for flint to re-awaken the flames. Even my elven vision is hampered by darkness this thick, and I praise Tunare that I am not human, for at least I can see enough to get my fire burning. <br>
<br>
Soon enough, a fire is crackling in the hearth and I light a candle off of it. My breath forms ghosts in the frigid air as I pull a blanket around my shoulders and sit in the chair by the fire. Blix cackles and glides from his perch to the back of my chair. &quot;Grrrrr. Grrrrr. Cold. Grrrrr,&quot; he says, his beak unable to form the B sound of brrrr. <br>
<br>
I sink down into the plush chair, my eyes transfixed on the alluring dance of the flames. I'm feeling much better now, but at what price, I know not. But at least Freeport is now rid of two of its more corrupt residents, I am feeling much better, and I even managed to increase my standing with the knights of Northern Freeport. I just try not to think about *how* the pair who had attacked me died. They should not have attacked in the first place. It was their own fault, not mine. So I tell myself.<br>
<br>
Blix pecks at my head in irritation, jarring me from my thoughts. &quot;You hungry?&quot; I ask, pulling off my boots and standing with a stretch. The heat is starting to fill the cabin, and I let the blanket slip from my shoulders to the chair. Blix's head bobs in a nod as he croaks, &quot;Hungry. Croak. Hungry.&quot; He turns his head, eyeing me with a single gold eye, then hops back to his perch while I fill his bowl with berries and some raw meat left over from this morning. <br>
<br>
&quot;Eat?&quot; he says as he tears at the sinewy meat. I shudder, my mind traveling back to earlier, when I had fed off of a human---and enjoyed it. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But they attacked me first,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I remind myself. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not hungry,&quot; I say sharply, tugging off my boots. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bitch. Bitch. Bitch,&quot; the damn raven replies, and I toss a boot his way, but he dodges and cackles gleefully. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who taught you that? Treewhisper?&quot; I demand, removing the rest of my armor. Blix cackles again, training an eye on me, and he almost seems to be smiling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bah,&quot; I grumble and pull my night dress over my head. I am turning my covers down when I remember Blix's delivery. &quot;Did you reach him?&quot; I ask, sliding between the cold sheets with a shiver. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hottie glue lady. Croak. Hottie.&quot; My brow wrinkles as I reassure myself that no one would dare read the wizard's personal mail. But then I remember seeing the wizard myself just hours before. He did not even seem concerned with my well-being, so he had either not yet received the missive, or he didn't care. My cheeks begin to burn with rage when I consider the  manner in which Dominion's allies had treated me. They had not only insulted me verbally, calling me a slave, but they had the gall to slap me! But I expected as much from them. It is Dominion's response that caused my blood to boil: he didn't say a word!!<br>
<br>
I crawl back out of bed and march to my writing desk. With words fueled by anger, I pen a much less cordial note to the Tier'Dal wizard. <br>
<br>
It says simply:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I told you already I would not be dismissed like a commoner. You offered me friendship, and I accepted, on the condition that you understand that I am a Lady of Felwithe and not so easily shunned. My pale skin was certainly not so repulsive when we huddled under the blankets in Cobalt Scar, xas? When you braided my hair, I did not see you flinch away in disgust. Yet you watch your comrades abuse me all the while calling me friend? Bah! I'd rather bed an ogre than entertain friends like yourself. <br>
<br>
Lady Isharra Moonsong</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I fold the parchment, quite clearly imprinting it with the seal of my House in Felwithe. I scrawl Lord Sinchyld's name across the parchment, and then, out of spite more than anything, I add &quot;and family&quot; to the front. I grin, imagining him squirming under the imperious gazes of his wives. &quot;I hope your bed is as cold as mine, this night,&quot; I hiss as I drape the message over Blix's neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;Castle Storm,&quot; I growl, and Blix caws excitedly, &quot;Hottie glue lady. Croak. Hottie!&quot; Then I open the shutters and he flies off into the night.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinadwenbrainbiter>Sinadwen Brainbiter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/02 7:10:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Serpent's Kiss, Part I</span><hr size=1> Isharra was awakened by the sound of footsteps at the door of her tiny cabin in the Mountains of Rathe. Half-asleep and rubbing her eyes, she mumbled, “Blixquick, you’re supposed to warn me when I have visitors.”<br>
<br>
“Blixquick would like to present Sinadwen Taleteller, your oldest friend and only hope,” said the figure standing in the doorway. The darkness was almost corporeal in the absence of the moon’s light, folding its black arms around the elf on Isharra’s threshold. The crickets that had sung her to sleep these late nights seemed to herald his appearance. “Hope,” echoed Blixquick.<br>
<br>
“Sinadwen!” Isharra exclaimed. And then, in order to mask her excitement at seeing him she added dourly, “It figures Blix would like you.” When Sinadwen did not speak for several long moments, Isharra invited, “Well, will you come in?”<br>
<br>
“Delighted to, Isharra,” Sinadwen replied, striding into the cabin’s single room and settling into an overstuffed rocker. The whisper of robes and the fuzzy red heat of his body filled her with a surprising sense of relief. “Forgive me for being away, but once I found out about your problem, I thought it best to remain hidden until I had some answers for you.”<br>
<br>
Isharra had learned that conversation with Sinadwen sometimes involved gigantic leaps past formality and segue, which was unusual for a High Elf. How had he learned of her illness? What had he found out that could help her? She forestalled these questions, because she knew that asking them would not gain her answers any more quickly. Sinadwen never handed out information before he was ready, so it was best to let him control the conversation. She chose the most prudent response she knew of from years of friendship with the peculiar Enchanter: She nodded.<br>
<br>
“All worlds were once ruled by serpents. There is nothing they didn’t create, or by some accident, cause to become created,” Sinadwen stated. “They brought Vampires and Werewolves into existence, and it is a serpent that can destroy the Vampire in you.”<br>
<br>
“But-- I was told I had to kill the vampire that made me,” Isharra protested.<br>
<br>
“Sure, that’s the hard way,” Sinadwen laughed, breaking into familiar joviality without warning. Those that didn’t know him might call him capricious, but Isharra knew there was too much calculation behind his actions to attribute anything he did to whimsy. He leaned forward in the darkness and quickly whispered, “I’ve been working on a salve for that bite. It’s almost complete, but I lack the final ingredient. It’s the poison from a wurm.”<br>
<br>
“But wurms don’t have poison,” Isharra found herself whispering as well, even though there was not another soul for miles. “Poison?” Blixquick asked.<br>
<br>
“That’s what most people think,” Sinadwen replied, settling back into the rocker, which creaked as if to answer the crickets’ song. “But I happened to speak with a scholar on wurms who told me about the vestigial poison gland some wurms still possess.”<br>
<br>
“How did you come by this cure? And how do you know it will work?” Isharra asked with hushed urgency.<br>
<br>
“Why are you whispering? There’s not another soul for miles,” The Enchanter inquired. She was unable to see it, but she knew the crooked grin that must be on his face. She couldn’t help but smile. Even after all these years, he still managed to pull the wool over her eyes from time to time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinadwenbrainbiter>Sinadwen Brainbiter</A> at: 12/12/02 7:15:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 731<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/02 11:33:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flight from Felwithe</span><hr size=1> “Blasted enchanter...” she grumbled playfully, fussing with her covers as she rolled over in her bed, her back to him. “Well?”<br>
<br>
“Well what?”<br>
<br>
“Well what?” cawed Blix.<br>
<br>
“How do you know it will work?” she repeated insistently, a touch of impatience in her voice. She heard the rocker squeak as Sinadwen stood, and his robes rustled as he straightened them. <br>
<br>
“Well, we haven’t got much choice, do we? Unless, of course, you have another suggestion?” A cupboard squeaked open and shut, then another, then another. “Gods’ gizzards, woman, your cupboards are bare! What do you eat around this--” he stopped abruptly, saying, “Don’t answer that. We leave for Burning Woods in the morning.”<br>
<br>
“In the morning? Where are you going to sleep?” Isharra said with hot indignance, sitting up to peer into the darkness. <br>
<br>
“Don’t get your bloomers in a bunch. That monstrous rocker will suffice.” Sinadwen sighed, closing the barren cupboards. He began rummaging through his pack for stale rations and water.<br>
<br>
Isharra’s uncharacteristic silence piqued his curiosity, and he paused, casting a curious eye her way. “What, no temper tantrum? The day would not be complete without an Isharra temper tantrum.” <br>
<br>
Isharra’s continued silence concerned him more than he cared to show. “What?”<br>
<br>
“Sinadwen, do you dream?” she asked softly as she snuggled back down into bed. <br>
<br>
“Dreams are for idealists. I am a realist. No, I don’t dream.”<br>
<br>
“I mean for real, like when you sleep. Do you dream?” she persisted.<br>
<br>
Pondering the question, he returned to his chair, rations and water tucked under one arm, and a book under the other. “Not particularly. Why?” <br>
<br>
“Nothing. You can stay,” she said simply, satisfied with his answer. <br>
<br>
His was a mind into which she’d rather not venture. <br>
<br>

The first light shone on Isharra’s lithe figure, infusing it with an eerie beauty. ‘It’s just the Vampire’s Curse,’ he reminded himself. Still, he couldn’t help but steal another glance at the serene beauty in the bed only a few feet away. He couldn’t seem to look away from nearly transparent white gown which was somehow even more alluring than if she had been wearing nothing at all. The way it clung to her legs in the moist air of the morning, clung to her abdomen as it gently moved with her breathing, the way it barely concealed her ample— He must have looked overly long, because when his eyes traveled to her oval face, they met emerald green eyes ablaze with passion.<br>
<br>
Without a word, she reached for him. The longing in her eyes called him to her. He was powerless to stop himself from going to her. He seemed to float, and it seemed to take far too many steps to reach her, but at last he was in her arms. And as he bent his face to hers, he breathed in her musk, which was flowery and womanly and strong at the same time, the way a High Elven female should smell. Slowly, their lips neared each other, framing the sun as it crested the Rathe Mountains—<br>
<br>
Sinadwen awoke with a yelp of shock. He was still sitting in the overstuffed rocker. Isharra had also awakened, perhaps roused by his scream. Her bosom was heaving as if she’d been having a disturbing dream. They looked at each other briefly, and there was no mistaking the recognition that occurred. Sinadwen raised his eyebrow in interest, then snorted. They both burst into laughter, probably more from relief than anything else.<br>

“Would you stop doing that! You know your own memory blur spells won’t work on you,” Isharra said, not bothering to conceal the annoyance in her voice. “Anyway, we’re nearing the Burning Woods and you’ll attract attention.”<br>
<br>
Sinadwen grimaced and kicked his horse into a trot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drama queen<br>

The killing was the easy part. It was finding the right wurm that proved difficult. Isharra and Sinadwen slew 89 wurms before they were able to extract the poison needed for Sinadwen's &quot;cure.&quot; The process was a mystery to her, however, as Sinadwen rendered her unconscious before he began, and by the time Isharra awoke, she was nestled into her bed in the Mountains of Rathe. Noise in the cabin alerted her to Sinadwen, who was shuffling around doing the types of things a Sinadwen does. When he saw the emeralds peeking out from beneath her pale lids, his face lit up---uncharacteristically---in a genuinely warm grin, which he adjusted quickly into his usual sarcastic grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well,&quot; he said, his robes swishing in gentle sussuration as he swept close to her bed. <br>
<br>
Isharra's body felt like lead and it took all the strength she had to turn her head and meet his eyes. &quot;How long have I slept?&quot; she breathed, her lips stiff from lack of use. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, only six days. You recovered much quicker than I expected.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SIX DAYS?&quot; she exclaimed, her voice coming out in a pathetic squeak. <br>
<br>
&quot;But it worked,&quot; he added with a wry grin. &quot;You are no longer under that silly little curse, and I no longer have to spend my days in this quaint, but woefully inadequate shelter. And do you know, you have the worst gas when you sleep?&quot;  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 12/15/02 8:57:59 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=326.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=326.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=326.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=326.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=326.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=70><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=326.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=326.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=326.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
