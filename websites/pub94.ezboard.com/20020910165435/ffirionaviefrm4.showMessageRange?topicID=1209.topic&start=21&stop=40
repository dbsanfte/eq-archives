Casting Ch on tank with 7 mobs on him at one bub of health bad....I'm stunned that so many clerics have never learned the concept of bridge healing.  <br>
Its the equal of a tank not knowing how to take and lose aggro...seen too many tanks(myself included)die lately cause cleric didn't know how to bridge heal and thought that CH was the only heal they needed loaded.<br>

I was on Drinal, playing a Gnome warrior, around level 8ish or so.  I was at orc 1 in the commons, with a tank heavy group, no healer.  Naturely we were happy when a cleric called Superbeing showed up.  At first.  He didn't cast a single heal, and I ended up getting beat down to half a bubble of health.  I was bandaging my self, as was the other warrior, and ogre with a surprisingly gentle touch.  Everyone was screaming for this guy to heal. But he was meleeing.  Said he was oom.  We told him to med.  He said that was boring.  I ended up quiting in disgust. <br>
   The next day, I was the leader of the group at Orc 1.  Superbeing sent me a tell, asking if he  could join me.  I replied &quot;No, I grouped with you yesterday and you refused to cast any healing spells.&quot;  I expected him to argue, but he didn't.  He just said, &quot;Okay&quot;, as if we had heard that alot.  Mind Boggling.<br>
   Me, I do whack a mob from time to time, if mana permits.  Or if sitting will draw aggro in close quarters.  But I do know that first and foremost, it is my job to keep the party alive.  That's why they invited me, that is why I exist.  If someone dies in my group, I take it personally, even if all agree it was not my fault. <br>
     I am trying hard to learn the best way to do this without drawing aggro.  I am playing with my stun spells, learning when it is a good use of mana to cast them.  Teapray is the highest character I've ever had, and the only cleric I've played above 14.  I do make mistakes from time to time.  I am not the best cleric in Norrath, but I would like to be.  I've had group members tell me that I am good at what I do.  <br>
   I just wish there was a way to learn how to be a great cleric without making mistakes along the way.<br>

Unfortunately the low aggro side of it has an irresistible attraction for some clerics and I think this is what makes them use it instead of better heals.<br>
<br>
The same is true of the lower level Celestial Remedy but without the excuse of long cast times for other heals. If you are fighting a single pull at that level and the cleric uses Celestial Remedy they are battle-shy. I was told of a cleric who refused to use GHeal because he might get aggro, and let people die because Healing was not enough.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;Battle-Cleric&quot; is concerned there are only two situations I will melee:<br>
Full Mana and health all round and a chance to catch up some skill, <br>
or <br>
OOM, no chance to med, and If we're going down it may as well be fighting.<br>
<br>
A cleric who melees when they could med and then calls &quot;OOM&quot; is a very bad cleric.<br>
<br>
I liked the comment about Clerics stunning. I am often having to explain how Stunning saves mana by not needing heals as much when someone tells me to &quot;Stop nuking&quot;. <br>
<br>
One thing that always amuses me is that places like Unrest are always described in the guides as &quot;Great for Clerics&quot; because of our mana-efficient undead nukes, and yet people you group with still don't want the cleric nuking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
I agree with the praise for high level Paladin healers. At low levels however they can be a royal pain. The number of times I have had a paladin join a group and immediately assume that they are prime buffer/healer without even asking. I usually end up fighting with my own buffs down because I would rather buff the tank than myself so I find I suddenly have Courage cast on me and that the same Paladin proceeds to burn mana casting his buffs on the entire group. I even had one who would stop fighting to heal. As soon as anyone was even half a bubble down he would step back and &quot;Healing &lt;xxx&gt; with the light of Mithaniel Marr&quot;, Light Healing would go in. I just could not get him to stop.<br>
<br>
I think the Druid healing versus Cleric healing is a paper tiger. A good druid/shaman is better than a bad cleric any day. The only issue is that these guys have offensive spells clerics can only dream of so they have much better things to be doing if grouped with a cleric than compete for the healing. If a druid/shaman insists on planting a heal while I am still waiting for the tank to go down far enough to need GHeal or SHeal from me then my role in the group is void. To leave them to heal while I become a second-rank nuker is sublimely silly. (Please note I am not talking about patch-healing while CHeal goes in.)<br>

     I have had druid healing without a problem, knowing when to heal is the main thing... i saw a cleric not heal untill i was around half a bub, and useing Celestial class spells to heal me.<br>
     I was useing the lv55 lifetap to keep myself alive through the fight useing a total of 8x 150hp lifetaps until the cleric landed a heal.... around 40 min later we had an add and i died because of waiting to low and then casting celestial type spells. <br>
<br>
And i know certain friends who i have died to while they were playing with Bridge healing with celestial *wink* on the bright side that 'rarely' happens, and i dont mind at all on melee clerics, There are times when you dont have to be all seriouse and can just have fun. The best place to do that is on Blue mobs, ones that you can have more leyway with for timing etc.. then you can really have some fun. Most clerics i know who melee have a good balance and pretty much never let me die.. it's the ones that always wait and bridge heal me... you dont need to bridge heal 'every' time and i just get the feeling that i am an experiment.......<br>
<br>
Saying that a few week back i had a 10hp Cheal or so land on me... now that was timing.<br>

Especially if the cleric is stunning mobs that are on the chanter. <br>
<br>
That being said, please note that your stuns that do damage BREAK mezz. Please only use your stuns that do not deal damage when trying to save your chanter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Root is also a life saver for chanters. Rooting a mob helps with crowd control big time. Even druid root (which deals damage) can be a very helpful because even though it might break mezz.. its still rooted!<br>

Sadly though some clerics almost reply as if I were attacking them. I'm not. That above was an actual incident (except for the celestial heal part, I'm not sure that 51 cleric even owns that spell) and if you sum it all up, THAT is what makes a bad cleric.<br>
<br>
I don't tell clerics what to use to heal me. Heck, I dont give out advice to anyone that is in my group.. they should know their class. Now if they are brand new to the area and ask for advice, I'll likely tell 'em what I know, and just as likely say &quot;Just do what you think is best.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a cleric healing, I do expect to be standing after the fight. (Unless everyone else is toast too.) If it's a one mob fight, why the heck did I just die? (with the cleric not saying OOM or otherwise warning me) ...that type of stuff gets me.  For this cleric..having been warned, well I wasnt' gonna give him much of a chance to kill me =P  He tried tho...  <br>
<br>
(To the person that said I'm a druid?  I'm a ranger... and was the main tank.)<br>
<br>
Good clerics... *HUGS*<br>
<br>
Bad clerics... *flees*<br>
<br>
To whoever says better not to have a cleric than a bad cleric... I TOTALLY agree.   But then again, i say that about EVERY class... better to have a great player behind a hybrid (the &quot;not so needed&quot; classes) then a bad player behind a &quot;core&quot; class, anyday.   And I gotta admit, except for the rez when things go bad, I prefer having a druid/shaman combo over a single cleric... then again, rez IS really nice :-)   Tho a cleric that uses stuns is a good thing.. but too many I guess got burned by folks telling them that it is a bad thing. In my personal opinion, I love stuns. I used to play a paladin and the thing I loved most was being able to chain cast stuns to keep a mob totally occupied while not taking any dmg. Sure I&quot;d run OOM quick as heck (maybe not now, this was before the increased mana pool for hybrids) but usually it was enough to survive a bad fight.<br>
<br>
And Jarkell.... you are 53. This was a 48 rogue.  How many hitpoints do you think he has, and does he warrant complete heal over the main tank (myself, 51 ranger, 2k hitpoints self buffed. With cleric buffs easily get 2500) ?  The rogue himself looked rather puzzled at that.... the cleric had almost killed him by casting too slow (the rogue was going down FAST when he was getting hit).<br>
<br>

<br>
my standard spell line up cleric wise<br>
divine<br>
divine 2<br>
annul ( or retribution ) <br>
root <br>
Complete heal<br>
divine light<br>
celestial heal<br>
remedy<br>
<br>
I normally only use complete heal the others are to save folks if something gets messed up. the break over point for me is if i expect to be  healing 2k damage per heal<br>
<br>
celestial 225 mana 750 heal<br>
complete 400 mana <br>
<br>
so celestial  is about as effective if i expect to  be healing 1.5 k so complete really begins to pull away mana wise 2k heals.<br>
<br>
of course is realize there is a delay on the  healing so i do use comp if needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utresjoli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tresjoli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shadow-striders.com/images/wolfIcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elven Princess</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 3:12:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1209.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cpinternet.com/~theduke/MythStuff/ez-tres.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Signs of a bad cleric</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A good druid/shaman is better than a bad cleric any day.

<br>
I agree about not competing with clerics for healing.  If there is a cleric in my group I do my best not to step on his or her toes.  Sometimes I do get a little nervous when I see a party member's health vanish to almost nothing.  On those occasions I'll cast Chloroblast (a relatively small heal with short casting time) to keep them alive while the cleric is trying to get off a bigger heal.<br>
<br>
And yes, Azhrai, that was a high elven cleric.  How did you know? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Might want to consider putting gate as your top spell slot. If you go LD there is an &quot;undocumented feature&quot; that will let your Link dead character cast your top spell slot... gating you to your bind point safely. Course' your group might not like that.. hehe.<br>

<br>
Ya, same can be said for the 2 divine aura's. I never had 2 mem'ed either and most of the clerics I know have a root or stun in its place. The second divine aura was always considered &quot;not worth memming&quot;, but that was before Luclin. Otherwise your spell line up looks pretty standard.<br>
