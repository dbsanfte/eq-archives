Specially the squabbling between (and about) some of the bigger guilds.<br>
<br>
I've been playing since the server came up and been having all sorts of fun. Yes, things were chaotic and cramped when 90% of the players were 1-15th, but that's already starting to change.<br>
<br>
I play with a few friends and haven't interacted in any way with any of these guilds. I haven't had or caused any problems. Just been having fun.<br>
<br>
/soapbox on<br>
But, I just wanted to take this opportunity to go on MY soapbox a bit. I've seen people complain about &quot;intentional training&quot; a lot. My favorite line was when someone complained vigorously about being &quot;trained off the bridge&quot; in EK.<br>
<br>
Let me give you some basic advice. If you sit on railroad tracks, you're gonna get hit by a train. Trying to sit at a zone to hunt is ridiculous. You may as well sit in front of a fire escape and yell &quot;fire&quot;. If I am ever in trouble and need to zone out to save my life, I run for the zone (duh). I do my best to warn people in the area, but I refuse to stand there and die because someone has decided to sit in front of the emergency exit! Get real! You can complain until you're blue in the face that you were &quot;intentionally trained&quot;, but it means nothing if you were at a zone, because the trainer can just say he was running from the monsters. Usually, that's exactly what's happening and no malice is intended.<br>
<br>
The other funny thing being complained about is &quot;ninja looting&quot;. People are complaining that they have to stop in the middle of fights to loot corpses to prevent others from looting them. First off, &quot;ninja looting&quot; is a term that came from days before everyone in your group got a message when a group member looted an item. Sometimes group members would grab an item from a group-killed monster and then pretend they hadn't. That's WHY they put in the loot messages. Ninja looting no longer exists. Sure, a group member can still snag a rare item, disband and take off, but there's nothing &quot;ninja&quot; about it because it's quite obvious what happened thanks to the loot messages.<br>
<br>
If you (or your team) killed a monster, they have a &quot;significant&quot; amount of time to loot the monster before it becomes publicly available to any passing stranger. If you are really SO busy that you can't get to your looting in that time, you'd better get organized or loot mid-fight. It's just common sense. The person I refer to was complaining about the Warrens. Well, there are dead kobolds all over the place in there sometimes. Perhaps the killers died or trained out, people WILL stop to see if they can loot unlooted corpses. This is completely normal and happens everywhere on every server, so it makes no sense to complain about it.<br>
/soapbox off<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am happy to see the server population plummet over the last couple weeks and have had a lot of great interaction with most of the people I've met.<br>

Way away from the zone off to the side. The train STARTED at the zone and was brought to us repeatedly by the same person. It was then later stated it was done because they didn't like the posts here on the board.<br>
<br>
Why would someone who was starting or causing a train and was at a zone need to move away from the zone? Why wouldn't he just zone? <br>

Hence we had 3 killing a 45th level mob. The rewared item was given to a person not in the experience group. therefore had to wait,(most holloween mobs' loot is no drop) Until a Low level person just clicked thier mouse faster and got it.

This is just the type of reading material I enjoy! It's good to see the Sovereign Lords and Guild Leaders of such notable guilds take an active and serious interest in the posts of others. I stand corrected. I don't remember what I was talking about earlier, but the record has been set straight! All has been made clear! The guilty have seen justice and all is right with the world!  /cheer<br>
<br>
Bane - Yes, that would suck. I hope you nailed whoever did that to you. I wasn't there, had no idea it had happened to you, and was not referring to that incident. Multiple people had been complaining about intentional training and the phrase &quot;trained off the bridge&quot; implied that people had been camped on the bridge. I was also commenting on other incidents where people had really been sitting at zones. If the phrase &quot;trained off the bridge&quot; came from some post regarding your situation, and I mis-read the phrase, I apologize. I'm really trying to be serious here and not offend you, cause you're probably a good guy doing his best to look after his guild. But, the gravity and breadth of the posts here are incredible and ludicrous. It must suck to be a Sovereign Lord.<br>
<br>
Bako - Glad to hear everything was taken care of, thanks for stopping by this thread. Again, my comments regarding ninja looting were not directed at your situation. Yes, multi-group kills with no drop loot, are an exception to common looting practices and usually occur in non-congested areas like planes (as opposed to events). I am sorry that I poked fun at such weighty matters and will gladly shut up now. It must suck to be a Guild Leader.<br>
<br>
Now I have successfully poked fun at serious issues, been brought up short by the two most powerful guilds in Norrath, made enemies out of anyone on Firiona Vie who matters. Not bad for one post. I guess I'll just go back to my fishing... far away from large guilds, politics, and squabbling. There's enough of that in the real world.<br>

<br>
I've adopted the term &quot;vulture&quot; for the kind of person that sits around claiming to &quot;watch&quot; a group or groups take out a large or many large mobs only to take the opportunity to (what was previously referred to as ninja loot) a kill uninvited.  I think it fits. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I am not in any way getting involved in the incident(s) that were referred to, just wanted to share my view of this terminology that needs its own word, being that I have seen so much of it lately.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     what a shame. <br>
<br>
I am not speaking for anyone but myself but when my group (yes I group with the same people almost every day) kills something that has a no-drop item on it, and no one in the group can use it, we INTENTIONALLY look around for the appropriate class that can use it and invite them to loot it.  If they are standing nearby watching, thats fine, all the less likely the item will rot.  But don't loot other people's kills while they are still in battle, its bad form and thats what I consider to be vulturing.<br>
<br>
I had a vulture do something similar just the other day and I was just sickened by it.  We (me and two others) killed a mob in North Ro and he dropped an int caster item.  Being that it was just myself (a cleric) and two warriors, we looked around for someone in a robe nearby and told him to loot it.  He was merely standing nearby but had no intention of taking the item uninvited.  Lo and behold a shaman, (a wis caster last time I checked)  runs up and vultures the kill, snatching right from underneath the caster that we invited to loot it.<br>
<br>
I was sickened and sad because the item was no drop and the shaman could not even equip it, yet felt he had to take it, because it was there, seeing that we were saying in /say for the caster to loot it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Sad, sad, sad....<br>
<br>
Just to clear up any flaming, Neither person, the int caster, nor the shaman were a member of my guild, (although the two warriors that were in my group were. /wave Kritical and Krindel. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) and I intentionally left the names of the int caster and the shaman as I don't wish to further cause anyone humilation or grief.  Nor did I tell this story to sway any opinions in favor or against my guild.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening, and watch out for the vultures!<br>

<br>
Obviously this doesnt work in all situations, but it does when time is being taken to &quot;give&quot; the item to someone in particular.<br>
<br>
How do you &quot;hold&quot; a loot monster........?  EASY as pie.... someone clicks on and maintains a lock on the dead mob till either booted by time or selection is done.<br>
<br>
If you are taking the time to find someone for the loot, I find it hard to believe you dont have the time to &quot;hold&quot; the loot. My suggestion is that if you arent &quot;holding&quot; it then why get irritated when someone else takes it? I am wise enough and worldly enough to KNOW that IF it is lootable, it WILL be looted.<br>
<br>
I find it less personally aggrevating if I either &quot;hold&quot; it or announce it and move on. Then I dont tie my feelings into it unless I am willing to see it done to my satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Just a suggestion to lessen aggrevation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueyasfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EyasFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tricky</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/4/01 3:45:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Intentional trains to zones and ninja looting.</span><hr size=1> Some of these posts show clear ignorance of the PnP.<br>

Rule #2 You may not ninjaloot.<br>
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br>

<br>
Too bad that even on this magnificent Roleplaying server people still see fit to Ninjaloot and or &quot;vulture&quot;.  The worst part about it is doing it under the guise of rp.  ie, my guild doesnt like your guild so im gonna steal your loot from your kills because you are good and I am evil or vice versa.<br>
<br>
Grow up! Thats not rp thats just plain and simple greed.<br>
<br>
I have to admit though I have gained new respect for GM's after coming to this server.  They are really on the ball, especially about ninjalooters.  There have been 3 instances (that I know for sure of) where things my guild has killed have been ninjalooted by vultures standing around watching.  Each time that person was stripped of the item and it was returned to the person it was supposed to go to originally.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So for all the vultures out there... don't get comfy with that item that you ninja'd.  It won't last. <br>
<br>
I can name names, but you know who you are and therefore it doesnt need to be said.  The GM's have already taken care of it, no need to taunt you a second time.  <br>

It has become common practice that in normal zones with special encounter mobs (Lucan comes to mind) on a normal server with no drop loot, some GM's and Guides will aid when a MORON loots an item not meant for them. But you are just as likely to be told... &quot;Sorry we cant help&quot; in that situation.<br>
<br>
Certain zones that require heavy team work and lots of time to kill mobs that fell with in the nodrop loot situation were treated different after &quot;ninja&quot; looting started to become an issue. But even that is subject to the whim of the responding GM/Guide.<br>
<br>
Dont confuse what SHOULD happen with what is or is not a RULE under the protection of Verant. There are still incidents on the main servers that are defined as &quot;ninja&quot; looting where in the GM will track down what happened BUT wont do anymore than confirm that the item was taken by soandso. At that point it becomes a matter of reputation and how the server population feels about the incident when informed. At the same time there are occasions reported where the GM removed the item and returned it to whom ever somehow convinced or proved it should have been theirs. Depends on the Whim of the responding GM. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=95.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=95.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=95.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=95.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=95.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
