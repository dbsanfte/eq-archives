It was a late spring afternoon and a light cool breeze whispered amongst the trees and danced lightly on the water surface.  Bright blue jayhawks hopped about in the branches above chasing away the wrens and sparrows that trespassed on their territory.  An occasional kingfisher darted down and caused a splash in the pond waters as it sought a meal of tadpoles or minnows.  Akida held a long fishing pole lightly with his right hand and rested it against his thigh.  Occasionally he would jerk the pole and line lightly so that the brown corked floater moved the dangling bait of bundled worms about in the pond.<br>
<br>
He had been there most of the afternoon and had caught nothing. But the truth was that he was fishing for an answer to a question as he sat in the peaceful setting.  His friends Kaputo and Arric were attending a birthday gala of a young lady of nobility in one of the more palatial homes of the High Elf city but he had demurred.  He had attended parties and galas by the score over the years, but now as he approached his hundredth birthday, he faced an important question.  What guild will I join?  Most of his friends thought that it was a foregone conclusion that he would emulate his father and join the ranks of the druids and then at some time in the future follow him onto the Kelethin Council. It was true that Akida loved the forest and the many creatures that dotted its landscape.  He spent every free moment outside and he knew most of Greater Faydark as good as any ranger and that was his dilemma.<br>
<br>
Some years before, a very old friend of his father, Duladan Bloodmoon, had stayed with them while he recuperated.  Duladan was a wise old half elf ranger from the glades of Surefall who had led scouting parties on behalf of the coalition of elves interested in the evils being hatched in Lesser Faydark.  He had been seriously wounded and had spent long months recuperating at their home.  He had filled Akida full of the lore of the half elfs and histories of the peoples of what the humans called Antonica and what the elves of the great Faring Forth that now lived in Kelethin and Felwithe still called Tunaria.  Duladan had taken Akida deep into the forests and taught him how to track and how to hunt and what to forage and eat.  Akida’s father, Laslan, had been called away to lead the fight in Lesser Faydark and Duladan had served as a surrogate father for a time. The old ranger had even taken his younger sister, Amerus, under his wing and spent time teaching her the same skills.  Though he could best her in the healing arts and tracking, Amerus was absolutely fearless and was the better shot with the bow; a point that vexed Akida to no end!<br>
<br>
Now years later, Akida faced the choice: become a druid and do what was expected of the son of Laslan or follow his heart and become a ranger like Duladan.  Though the two classes shared much in common, the ranger was taught more of the martial arts where druids focused more on nature and the gifts given to elfs by the Great Mother, Tunare.  As they progressed in ranks, the soldiers of Tunare, as the druid guild of Kelethin was called, became more healers than fighters and Akida wanted to fight the evil himself instead of assisting others.  What to do?  And there was also the matter of the dreams.<br>
<br>
When he was very young he thought that everyone dreamed as he did of things that came to pass and of places they had never seen. But as he grew (elves are considered youths until their hundredth birthday or the time when they choose a guild, whichever is first!) and began to question others, he realized that his dreams were different.  He had dreamed of a brave Halfling in the city of Rivervale and could describe the bank and a great tavern in the middle of the town though he had never been there.  While his parents and his father in particular scoffed at his descriptions of his dreams, Duladan had not.  He listened intently as Akida described Rivervale.  Though Duladan had no clue as to the Halfling that Akida described as having a rope at his side, he most certainly knew the layout of Rivervale and it was he that had gone to Laslan with proof of what Akida had dreamed. Laslan had listened politely but insisted that one of the many delegations that had visited their home must have described the scene to a young Akida who only now remembered what he had heard.  And soon thereafter, Amerus, in the cruel teasing way of all siblings, had taken to calling him the Dreamer boy to their friends.<br>
<br>
As the years went by, he had dreamed of battles and seen the faces of people in pain, dying, and very infrequently celebrating. He had awoken many a night, sweating and heart pounding and his mother had comforted him back to sleep as though he was still a babe.  He kept his dreams to himself now and only related the occasional one to Kaputo or Arric and as she outgrew the teasing stage, he would even talk to Amerus about what he saw.  One thing was for sure, he knew from his dreams that without a doubt, that Amerus would become a druid. She was head strong and unlike her father not given to pleasing turns of phrase.  She was pretty, plain spoken, and absolutely terrified most of the boys whom she could best in any number of sports and skills.<br>
<br>
His reverie next to the pond was broken by the sounds of footsteps crashing through the underbrush.  A smiling Arric and Kaputo emerged from behind the tree and thrust themselves to the ground next to him. “Heya, Akida. Any luck fishing?”  Arric picked up a pebble and tried to skip it across the pond from a sitting position. It simply splashed and sunk. “You might find a pole easier to fish with than a rock,” said Akida with an impish grin.  “Well from the looks of it, I can’t do any worse than you,” he retorted and they all broke into laughter.<br>
<br>
“That is true, my friends.  Why are you here? I would think the belles of the ball would have swooned to make the acquaintance of the muscle bound Kaputo and the silver tongued, Arric.”<br>
<br>
They gave a look of feigned indignation and Kaputo spoke. “ We would have but the young lady in question became ill and the party broke up early.  All though….” Kaputo stopped and shared a grin and glance with Arric.  “All though what?” Akida asked impatiently.  “ All though the most beautiful young lass in Felwithe was introduced at the gala. Her name is Isharra and she was stunning!!”  Akida shrugged, “One more pretty face to compose a song for or to hurl a blade a hundred feet for to impress…”<br>
<br>
“Aye,” Arric piped in, “but this lady expressed a longing for the forest and those at one with nature and the animals of Norrath.” Simultaneously they both pointed at Akida and said, “ So we told  her about you.”  They had a good laugh as Akida reddened. Kaputo went on, “ We told her of our friend who spends more of his time in the woods picking leaves and poking sticks in animal droppings than is natural.”  “ And we mentioned that you dreamed ominous dreams about Halflings, wizards, and all manner of giant beasts and more importantly, Dragons,” Arric added.<br>
<br>
Akida stood up and tugged on the fishing line so that the floater and baitless hook emerged from the water and swung toward him, “ You have great fun at my expense I see.”  They both chuckled. “We do not. We simply attend the galas seeking the special lady for your heart.  We test the waters for that special one, composing songs, and feats of bravery so that they will heed our words extolling your virtue. What better friends can a man have?” Arric asked with a grin.<br>
<br>
Akida tried to appear stern but a smile broke at the corner of his lips, “I’m sorry my friends. But you look in vain.  Kaputo with the broad shoulders and the sure heart of a paladin to be and Arric, the certain bard, quick with a jest and a story of old, you two are the toast of High society.  No lady of the court would want a red haired Fier’dal of slight build who wanders the forest dreaming dreams and wondering whether to become a druid or ranger?”<br>
<br>
Kaputo eyed him intently, “You still wrestle with that. Bah….you are a druid through and through. You are a natural healer and your gifts with the fauna of the forest are already spoken of.  And your dreams..well they put you in a class by yourself.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, the class of a weirdo…one given to flights of fancy as he sleeps.”<br>
<br>
“That is not true, Akida. Perhaps as young boys some thought so but I’ve heard priests speak of you highly and the Druid guild master has already called on your father. They don’t often do that but wait for us to step forward and declare ourselves.”<br>
<br>
Akida chuckled derisively, “ He speaks to my father out of deference to my father’s position.”<br>
<br>
Kaputo grew serious, “You sell yourself short.  I don’t know that I like the tone of self pity and denial that you have adorned yourself with this day.”  He looked at Arric and continued as they both rose to stand, “ But I think I have the solution. One that will awaken your every nerve and force clear thinking onto your small pea brain.”<br>
<br>
Akida was binding the fishing line to the pole and bending over to set it down when his friends grabbed him and with two swings launched him into the pond. “Noooooo,” Akida yelled as he hit the cold pond surface and sunk in water to his knees.<br>
<br>
Kaputo and Arric laughed and waved. “We go to dress for supper. Perhaps the cold pond water will clear your brain so that you make the right decision.  You are a druid and that is that my friend,” Kaputo shouted as they walked away. “And with that decision made we can get back to the serious business of impressing the fair ladies of Felwithe with our charms instead of yours!!” Arric yelled as they faded into the forest.<br>
<br>
And there standing in the waters of the pond, Akida made his decision.  The dreams seemed to imply that he would be a druid, his friends thought he should be a druid, and his family and father in particular would be proud of him becoming a druid.  And he was sure in his heart that wherever he was, Duladan would know of his decision and be glad for him! And soon thereafter, Akida al`Takish declared before the guild master and assembled council his desire to become a practitioner of the druid arts.  And at the party held thereafter, his friends Kaputo and Arric were there to extol THEIR virtues to the ladies in attendance.<br>
