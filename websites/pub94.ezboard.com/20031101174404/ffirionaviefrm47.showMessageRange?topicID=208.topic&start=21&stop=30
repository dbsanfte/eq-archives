Originally a small guild of Vah Shir.  It's leader disbanded after a while, having to go elsewhere, and the rest of the guild disbanded to go their seperate ways, but stayed in touch.  Anyway, two of the people from the guild who lived in the same house got kicked out of their new guild after a while for not playing enough.  They were screwing around and realized that one of their old characters was still wearing the TH guild tag, having not been online since.  They got the old GM of TH to give them leadership.  The guild is now made up entirely of people from my house and one real life friend.  I'm the only one in another guild.<br>

My first character on FV, started at day one (&quot;No, that's MY scaled wolf pup!!&quot;), was an Iksar Shaman named Sevelynth. As I was running across the FoB one day, I got a guild invite message pop up on my screen, from someone I had never seen before, belonging to a guild I had never heard of: Frenzy. I asked him why he had chosen me in particular to join their esteemed ranks, and he told me, &quot;Why not?&quot; Hmm, funny how totally unselective guilds just grow bigger and bigger and bigger, and then go POP!<br>

Probably because of a lack of focus.  Trying to spread themselves too many ways at once.<br>
<br>
Anyone remember the evil guild Blackened Roses?  Hell, I think they were another guild before that...well they broke off into something else, and then something else again, and I'm pretty sure into another thing again!<br>
<br>
And whatever happened to Norraths Soldiers of Chaos?  When the leader left to join AS, I was friends with who the guild was passed on to...but that person disappeared and so did the guild.

<br>
As for the rest, that is a fair description of the guild, a for fun, family style guild. Our only restrictions level 10, general officer approval, and now, a fluency in Human so that we can communicate across race lines. (while we have never had race or alignment restrictions, for the first few months we were almost exclusively an Iksar guild). While I am saddened that more guildmates don't RP very much, we have remained mostly d00d free since inception (there were a few exceptions who made it into our midst, most of whom are no longer on this server, let alone in our guild)<br>

Zsu became quite close with League of Shadows and, after the two guilds had been allied for some time, decided to merge into LoS. Some thought that was a good thing, some did not. Not too long after Zsu left BR, they began indiscriminately tagging anything that moved in Nektulos forest; they grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and--well, you know how that ends.<br>
<br>
Apparently, many of them morphed into Eternal Lunacy who also followed the wise recruiting policies of BR's latter days....<br>
<br>
As for Norraths Soldiers of Chaos, I saw someone with the tag a few weeks back for a split second, but nothing before or since; their website is pretty much abandoned--think it's safe to say they're gone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uchestnutx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ChestnutX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/13/02 7:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=208.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whatever happened to...?</span><hr size=1> Order of the Oaken had problems for a long time, largely due to mismanagement of the Guild Leader.  The straw that broke the camels back fell when the GL posted nude picutres of his girl friend on our Webpage.  The same day all the female members of OotO and officers quit, and quickly reformed Ancient Ways.  OotO lingered on life support for another two months, then finally evaobrated with people moving to FnF, Reso, Clan Werre, and other guilds.<br>
<br>
Ancient Way folded later, for it suffered from the same afflictions that Order of the Oaken did.  High level members chose to move on to active guilds, rather then stay in AW, which basically was a small circle of friends which almost never raided.  Eventually everyone abandoned ship, and moved on or elsewhere.<br>
