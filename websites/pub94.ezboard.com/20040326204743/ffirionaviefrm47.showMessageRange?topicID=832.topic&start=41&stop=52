Could it be? <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Celo!&quot;<br>
<br>
Neomiah fights his way through a rush of adventurers, who are anxious to bank they raid loot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey watch it...Hey Celo!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Erudite stops in his tracks and turns to face the young dwarf.  Neomiah notices Celo no longer wears the colors of Chosen Spirit, and is looking at him with distaste....even hate.<br>
<br>
&quot;How you been Celo?  Tanieth and Viala said you were attacked...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go away dwarf or sssuffer a death unlike any you could imagine.  The being known asss Celo isss dead.  He willingly accsssepted my ssspirit.  He isss now Khlsin, the Last Iksar Enchanter...&quot;<br>
<br>
Neomiah finds the Iksar dialect humorous...<br>
<br>
&quot;Ssstop right there Khlsin...&quot;<br>
<br>
Neomiah does his best to imitate and agitate the Iksar within Celo.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not going anywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young dwarf warrior moves his hands to the hilts of his weapons.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You refuse, you will die.  I would rather my friend die by my hand than be a tortured spirit possessed by the likes of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Khlsin snickers and begins to recite a spell.<br>
<br>
Neomiah lunges at the possessed Erudite, but misses his initial attack.  &quot;You Ssstupid Iksar!!!  It didnt have to be like this.  Neomiah presses his attack, and slices deeply into Celo's leg who winces but continues to cast his spell.  Neomiah screams and drops his weapons to grasp his head.  An evil grin spread across the Iksar Enchanter's face and he begins to cast another spell.  Neomiah convulses in pain...  <br>
<br>
Darina, a dwarven cleric and former member of Chosen Spirit saw the exchange between her former friends of which she both recognizes, and senses Celo is not about to stop until the young foolish dwarf is dead.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey backoff Celo!!!  You are gonna kill em!!!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Khlsin looks to Darina who has now begun to cast her own spell...<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesss...He isss about to die!&quot;<br>
<br>
Khlsin finishs weaving his final spell...<br>
<br>
Neomiah arches his back and hands recoil outward as he releases a blood curdling scream.<br>
<br>
Darina's spell lands too late...Neomiah is dead.<br>
<br>
Darina runs upto Neomiah's corpse...and cradles him in her arms...<br>
<br>
&quot;Celo, you bastard!  You killed Neo...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yesss...I did&quot;<br>
<br>
Khlsin begins casting another spell...<br>
<br>
Darina jumps to her feet makes ready her weapon and begins casting her own spell....<br>
<br>
Khlsin begins to laugh, and says &quot;The days of discord are coming...you will all die...&quot;<br>
<br>
Darina's spell finishes but to no effect for Khlsin has already faded away...<br>

Passing travelers, too, were welcome here and Tanieth saw several unfamiliar faces amongst the patients.<br>
<br>
Fenula knelt beside the statue of Prexus, praying. The tiny chapel in the corner of the infirmary contained statues of all the gods, for none had dominion over healing, but the Ocean Lord took central place. Taneith waited quietly in the shadows until Fenula rose.<br>
<br>

She loved cooking. To her, it was her second calling in life. To others, it seemed she had discovered a new way of inflicting pain and discomfort on her victims.<br>
<br>
New pledges to the guild were warned about her cooking on their first day. A few were foolish enough to think it was exaggerated. None of them had ended up in the graveyard yet, but then Fenula was a very good cleric.<br>
<br>
Morrigane jumped. A shadow seemed to detach itself from the wall. That in itself wasn’t too unusual; she was a necromancer after all. Generally she tended to sense when it was going to happen, though.<br>
<br>
“Binka, I really wish you would stop doing that!” she snapped. <br>
<br>
Binka had pretty much retired from her roguish life, but she still tended to sneak around the guild hall. She barely seemed to notice she was doing it.<br>
<br>
“Hmmm? Oh, sorry Morri. Didn’t mean to startle you.” <br>
<br>
She seemed distracted and thoughtful. That in itself was so unlike Binka it should have started alarm bells ringing, but Morrigane was too shaken to notice.<br>
<br>
“I have a job for you, a commission if you like. I need a cake made for me.”<br>
<br>
“A cake?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, a special one. A Fairy cake. With special ingredients.”<br>
<br>
From somewhere in the recesses of her chest plate, Binka pulled out a bag and dropped it on the table. The bag squirmed and there were stifled protestations coming from within.<br>
<br>
“What is it?”<br>
<br>
“Faeries.”<br>
<br>
Morrigane was astonished on two counts. Firstly both she and Binka were vegetarians. Morrigane had never cooked anything containing parts of any living creature. She knew far too much about death to ever want to consume flesh. If Binka was expecting her to cook faeries, then it must be very important.<br>
<br>
Much more importantly, if faeries were incorrectly prepared, the results were fatal. A single drop of faerie blood was enough to kill. There was no known antidote. As a result faeries were regarded as a great delicacy and were only ever prepared by Grand Master bakers.<br>
<br>
“Is this an assassination, Binka?”<br>
<br>
but Binka had melted back into the shadows, leaving the squealing and thrashing bag on the table. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=czakoriah>Czakoriah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/9/04 8:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=832.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chosen Spirit</span><hr size=1> Areli, being under the recent stress of Celo being possessed by an Iksar Enchanter named Khlsin, Neomiah being killed by Khlsin, and Echtelion being found unconscious on the floor of his room, goes off...<br>

Areli steps out of the way of the Echtelions neighboring bed to reveal Neomiah, who is pale and motionless.<br>

&quot;He has been here for days!  Darina was able to raise his body from the dead, but it is his mind we are unsure of.  'Course you would have known this if you hadn't been out cold yourself!&quot;<br>

Areli looks at Farbria and Sigella both staring at Echtelion for a response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay Echtelion, the question is what's going on with you!  We got too much going on these days for you to be possibly less than at full capacity.

Various members of the guild were lounging in front of the fire, listening to Cat’s latest composition. They stopped and looked at her expectantly. This caused her to scowl even more.<br>
<br>
“The sheer arrogance! It’s quite breathtaking, High Elves are so infuriating!” The others tried to avoid catching each other’s eye as the Erudian spoke.<br>
<br>
“Well?”<br>
<br>
“He won’t let me examine him.”<br>
<br>
All around her people slumped back. No one had really expected Echtelion to let the cleric help him, forceful as she was. Even for a High Elf, he could be stubborn.<br>
<br>
“Maybe if we could get hold of his medicine, I might be able to work out what it’s intended for. That may give us the information we need.” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=binkafv>BinkaFV</A></span><br><font color=#A62A2A>(2/13/04 2:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=832.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Chosen Spirit</span><hr size=1> She let out a soft hiss. She wasn’t expecting this at all, but the book was quite explicit in its conclusions. Fenula looked across at her and scowled.<br>
<br>
“I’m trying to work here Morri, keep it down.”<br>
<br>
Morrigane was worried. Ever since Binka left her with the bag of faeries, she had felt uneasy. She had decided to do a little research and she was distinctly unhappy with what she had found.<br>
<br>
“Nula, what do you know about Faeries?”<br>
<br>
“Faeries? Ummm, not a lot I guess. Pretty but stupid, tend to be attracted to bright lights, bang into windows a lot. Bit like Binka, I suppose.”<br>
<br>
“What do you know about cooking them?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing at all. You’re supposed to be the expert in that department, allegedly.”<br>
<br>
In fact, Morrigane was a very good cook. Unfortunately her upbringing as a necromancer had left her with a slightly different take on certain things. The time she had emptied Areli’s litter tray on the same day she had made chocolate cookies had gone down in the annals of guild history.<br>
<br>
What worried her now was the information she had just found on faerie blood. She knew it was incurable poison that was invariably fatal, but she hadn’t previously been aware of the side effect.<br>
<br>
Not only did it kill the physical body, it also destroyed the soul. There would be no possibility of resurrection, even by the most talented cleric.<br>

The dwarf narrowed her eyes and stopped to carve on a piece of wood. Grumbling, she moved around the rock till she was back in the shadows, making sure she could still observe the paths leading from the lake of ill omen to the city of Cabilis.<br>
As she picked up the piece of wood again, she felt the pain raise deep in her again. 'Cursed be the day I received this damn mask', she thought as the pain sent her on her knees and made her vision blurr, while she felt herself overcome a change.<br>
After a few moments the pain lessened and Farbria grunted as she rose an arm in front of her face and noticed the brown tan on it.'Oh how nice, an erudite - not been one for 3 days', she whispered, her voice full of sarcasm.<br>
<br>
Throwing the half-crafted model of a wodden dagger away, she sat back against the rock and closed her eyes, concentrating and reaching out with her thoughts...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
'Sigella, hows it looking over there?'<br>
&lt;silence&gt;<br>
'Sigella??'<br>
&lt;silence&gt;<br>
<br>
Pressing her palms together Farbria foccused her mental energies hard...<br>
<br>
'SIGELLA!!!!'<br>
<br>
The voice filled the head of the half-asleep dark elf with shock, coming out of nowhere. <br>
'I - I'm awake, I'm awake' she answered in her mind, her cheeks turning red as she realised she had been caught off guard ...again.<br>
'I'm sorry Farbria, it could not have been more then 10 or 15 minutes, as I can tell by the movement the shadows have made meanwhile', she tried to apologize.<br>
<br>
'You need to learn to control your medidating, young one, or this will cause trouble in your future, when your healing magics are needed and you sleep, your comrades relying on you'<br>
<br>
'Yes, I know - but we been here for 2 days now and we saw only a handful of lizard teennies venturing in and out of that town - can't we leave our guard?'<br>
<br>
Farbria kept silence for a few minutes, then shrugged her shoulders.<br>
<br>
'We have tried...seems Celo is not in there - we can go back to the guild halls and check for news anyway - hows the field of bone looking? Is the book free of guards?'<br>
<br>
'Certainly, I can see both the book and the wandering guard from my posistion...he is seems busy to keep those scaled wolfs from staining the path to his oh-so-mighty city'.<br>
A faint smile crossed Sigella's lips.<br>
<br>
'Well then I will walk over to you, then we take off together'<br>
<br>
Farbria rose to her feed, and after a moment to comfort herself to the Lenght and pace of an Erudite, she left her hiding place and sneaked away from Cabilis, staying clear of the paths...<br>

<br>
&quot;...I can not withstand the onslaught upon my soul any longer...find my brother Jebodiah......tell him...<br>
<br>
Neomiah grasps his head in pain...<br>
<br>
&quot;...he was always in my thoughts...and I will miss him...&quot;<br>
<br>
Neomiah gasps as a wave of pain surges through his fragile mind.  He reaches upand takes Areli by the tunic and pulls him close to stare him in the eye...<br>
<br>
&quot;Avenge me, Areli.....Aven*gahhhhhhhh...&quot;<br>
<br>
Areli feels a tug at his side, and his hand reactively goes to his side where his dagger was sheathed.  Neomiah loosens his grip and falls back to his bed...Areli's dagger protruding from his chest.  Neomiah screams and his back arches as if his soul were being ripped out of his body.  Neomiah begins to convulse and abruptly stops, and there is only silence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Neomiah!...Neomiah!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Areli stares at the motionless body of his closest friend and mentor...<br>
<br>
(30 minutes later back in the Guild Manor)...<br>
<br>
Areli over hears the exchange between Fenula and Morrigane, and walks into the kitchen.  I dont know what is going on, but count me in if ya need assistance.  I need to get my mind on other things...&quot;<br>
<br>
Areli walks over to the cooler and pulls out a bottle of milk.  Walking back to the doorway, Areli turns and speaks...<br>
<br>
&quot;...Neomiah just killed himself upon my dagger...&quot;<br>

The dwarf was breaking some colorful crystal free of some slag stone, so resembled his older brother, Areli thought he to be Neomiah's twin.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you Jebodiah, brother of Neomiah Noblespirit?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jebodiah continued to hammer upon the slag....<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you Jebodiah, brother of Neomiah Noblespirit?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jebodiah looked back to the towering Vah Shir and continued his efforts to break apart the slag.<br>
<br>
The other young mining dwarves had stopped working to watch the exchange...<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, I am Jebodiah...what be it your business?&quot;<br>
<br>
Areli was silent for a second to mustered his courage to complete his next words...<br>
<br>
&quot;I have some bad news, your brother Neomiah is dead....&quot;<br>
<br>
Jebodiah stood motionless staring at the slag in front of him, and showing little emotion as Areli recounted the incidents leading up to Neomiah's death.<br>
<br>
Jebodiah sat down the hammer and walked over to the foreman.  Jebodiah spoke into the ear of an elder dwarf who nodded in agreement and took out a key and unlocked a worn chest full of tunics and weapons.  The foreman took out a dirty tunic and a rusty two-handed axe and handed them to Jebodiah.  The foreman then leaned down and pulled some food, water, and bandages from a satchel lying on the ground besides him and handed them also to Jebodiah.  The young dwarf then turned and spoke not a word until he reached Areli again...<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us go.  I will avenge my brothers death....&quot;  <br>
<br>
Areli picked up the sacks containing Neomiah's gear and the two spoke not a word as they headed toward the surface...in search of revenge.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showMessageRange?topicID=832.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showMessageRange?topicID=832.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showMessageRange?topicID=832.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showPrevMessage?topicID=832.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showNextMessage?topicID=832.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=832.topic&index=52><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.threadControl?topicID=832.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=832.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=832.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47>Guilds and Associations</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31c<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
