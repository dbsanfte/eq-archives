[Wed Sep 04 01:29:30 2002] You told vivienne, 'if so i need to discuss something with you.'<br>
<br>
&lt;sounds like IC to me&gt;<br>
<br>
[Wed Sep 04 01:30:15 2002] Vivienne tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'Yes . i am the High Mistress . and i am fully aware of my daughter's activities and your attacks upon my city'<br>
<br>
&lt;now... Vivienne is a teir’dal necromancer who has just fully embraced her mother’s heritage as a succubus... she is full of anger and hate, except towards those she cares for. Some paladin, champion of good, just messages her, what is her reaction supposed to be? “Ah, gee, Mr. Paladin, how can I help you, kind sir? No, she is going to react with arrogance, hatred and disgust at being forced to speak with an inferior creature. Typically, her reaction would involve sneers and veiled threats, arrogance and anger. But I was exhausted that night from a really crummy day at work, and I wasn’t in the mood to really get Vivienne into her spiel ( not to mention suffering death by giants for being destracted ). And I was fully aware that my member was insulting this paladin as she was telling us in /guild all evening. As for the actual train, I did not know the details until Aailan told me that he believed he was trained specifically by her, nor did she tell me of it.&gt;<br>
<br>
[Wed Sep 04 01:30:53 2002] You told vivienne, 'um this is ooc-was really brave of her to train the raid 2 hours after it started when all 2 ppl where left to port out'<br>
[Wed Sep 04 01:33:46 2002] You told vivienne, 'lol at least train when the raid is togehter but no she waits until only 2 ppl are left to tl out...i have her conversations logged where she laughs it and a nice pic too should i report her or perhaps i will just plaster it on the FV boards '<br>
[Wed Sep 04 01:34:49 2002] You told vivienne, 'small community here i'm sure it will go over very well with everyone...specially since your guild has a good name from what i know, i could only imagine how this will help it further'<br>
<br>
&lt;and the threats begin. Now, when somebody tries to threaten and bully me, I respond in kind. In fact, I push back harder. Was I undiplomatic? Yes, I was, but I don’t tolerate being threatened by anybody, nor should anybody be forced to... it makes me not give a damn, which is very much in evidence here. With his bullying, I had no inclination to help him at all. None whatsoever. I simply don’t tolerate it. He pissed me off, and I treated him with the disdain he earned from me. I will not bow down to somebody that acts in such a manner, and if they do so, they had better damn well expect retaliation.&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
[Wed Sep 04 01:35:42 2002] Vivienne tells you,in Dark Elvish, 'Well . hearing from an individual about yours and your raid's behaviour while there i am not sympathetic at all'<br>
<br>
&lt;and I gave my undiplomatic answer to his bullying right here... and it goes on from there....&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Do I or my guild condone training? No, we do not. I merely stated that if a young one trained me while I was attacking Felwithe, I would not flip-out at them.<br>
<br>
However, in light of all this, I do apologize for my behaviour, it was inappropriate for my position as guild leader. In future, if a similar thing happens, and I am in a similar mood ( and it is 1:00 am ), I will ask them to step away for at least an hour. <p>What is the point of living if life is not spent dancing on the edge of the razor-blade?<BR>

<br>
I don't care what I'm doing and where I'm doing it. If you train me, I will /petition you so fast that your head falls off from spinning around too much. I refuse to &quot;expect&quot; to be trained for anything. If there's a log available, I will paste it on the Soapbox (and I'll probably get bitched at for doing it, but I don't care), and with any luck, you will become part of the average FVer's blacklist.<br>
<br>
If I'm doing something that bothers you to the point where you would even remotely consider training me, talk to me about it or just /report + /ignore me. Or, if it's offensive IC, /duel me. Chances are that I'll accept (and Kloevis probably remembers the time I /dueled him when he was 30-something levels above me).<br>
<br>
Once again, there is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  no excuse whatsoever</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for training. And Vivienne, while I respect that you are able to put some of the blame on yourself for handling it the way you did, I also feel that there isn't an explanation for what you said. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A> at: 9/7/02 10:01:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uedwarddunai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edward Dunai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/8/02 2:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=223>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Test...</span><hr size=1> This intrigued me a bit, and since I have a lvl 14 SK on another server I did some testing to see if it is possible for a lvl 12 to train the three sisters to the Foreign Quarter zone.<br>
<br>
For the purposes of the test, a guildie of mine (51 paladin) was seated visible at the zone in point, I attempted to pull the three sisters onto him with spells, melee and archery.<br>
<br>
I made approximately 40 attempts to train the sisters onto the paladin, succeeded twice (both archery pulls) but died before the sisters actually reached the paladin.  Every other time I was rooted and nuked before the sisters got within aggro range of the paladin.  Of these 40 attempts, 20 were with SoW from potions supplied by a guildie and cast outside the zone, SoW made no difference.  I was otherwise mostly rooted and nuked to death prior to the sisters reaching aggro range of the seated paladin.<br>
<br>
The way aggro works, moreover, is that if you pull the mobs, their faction aggro is secondary, they will first try to kill the person who hit them, before deciding 'Oh, I hate him too' and aggroing on the 'good' characters at zone in.  The only way to 'train' people not engaged in combat is to A) have a way to clear aggro (Feign Death, zone) or B) to bring more than 3 mobs.  Since only 3 mobs were in the 'train', another person DID zone, and Mythrilia did NOT prior to the sisters aggroing on the raid, she could not have pulled the train. Therefore, the only way for what was described to have occurred would be if another individual had done the training (the unnamed individual of Aailin's original post) and Mythrilia had been a bystander.  The officer and individual responsible for the training apparantly apologized, there was no need for Sisters of Myth to issue any sort of apology to Aailin.  Case closed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uspiritofstick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SpiritOfStick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Ominator</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/8/02 3:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=224>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tampalocksmith.com/holding/ExtraCrispy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Test...</span><hr size=1> And THIS, my friends, is the main reason why getting stupid and saying &quot;I hope this happens to so-and-so&quot; when the final evidence points to something else entirely, is so futile.<br>
<br>
The facts as I see them:<br>
<br>
The little 12th season whatever she was could not have trained the individual in question.<br>
<br>
Another party, of much higher level and experience, has already admitted committing the deed.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the crime was not upon the Sisters of Myth in the first place.<br>
<br>
That's the first part.<br>
<br>
<br>
The second part is that Vivienne was not fully aware of the situation at hand.  This is obvious.<br>
<br>
For her accuser to push threats to get her to take action upon circumstances which she could not possibly have all the facts to, BEFORE she had those facts, indicates to me a hotheaded, unreasonable individual whose credibility is immediately suspect.<br>
<br>
Lack of diplomacy only exacerbated this problem.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:  The Sisters of Myth did NOT train.  Therefore, they do not &quot;deserve to be banned&quot; no matter WHAT some hysterical git tells you.<br>
<br>
The fact that Vivienne was nasty about it perhaps indicates the tone in which this whole situation was approached.<br>
<br>
It is stupidities like this, that in real life, cause some of the stupidest laws to be written, so that poor guys in police cars can enforce them on a resentful society.<br>
<br>
Y'all need to CHILL and look at some FACTS before you start pointing fingers.  In real life, accusing someone falsely is actionable at least, prosecutable at best.<br>
<br>
Something to think about.<br>

You say it can't be done and others say it can and they went and did it to test the theory just as you did. So who is the definative it can or can't be done.<br>

I actually have no respect for them in any fastion any more. At one point i did, but not anymore.<br>
<br>
As to the issue of training...wouldnt you most anything to protect your city from a invading force..even at a tender age. (I'm not condoning training) That is simply leading a few guards to the evil invaders. Thats entirely a rp explination....OOC that is intentional training but THIS server is SPECIAL. You sw someone in the area and blamed them...from my point of view. I know a lot of the sisters i live with them still. I know enough to say that some of their rep is earned but when it comes to training i'll state my name that it was a big misunderstanding.<br>
<br>
No one died as you said so this shouldnt be anything really had the entire raid been killed that'd be different... as you said i dont have pride yet you keep this going based on pride...irony :P<br>
<br>
(dont take it that i'm staking my guilds rep on as well, when it involves the sisters i am fully independent of them) <p><center>

If you want to train someone go to Sullen Zek.  There's no excuse for training a raid... none... zilch... nada.  Roleplaying doesn't give you an excuse to be a moron, nor does it forgive transgressions specifically prohibited by the Play nice policy.  If you think it does, there's an entire server of idiots just like you... I would suggest you go with your own kind... on Sullen Zek.<br>

I for one hate when i get a rude tell.No matter how pissed one is its always good to send a nice tell and if it goes not well then put them on a kill later list.I dueled a druid in freeport was kicking his treehugging ass till i agros a gaurds and had both on me well i died lost exp lost lvl 52 and was pissed off!<br>
<br>
I sent him a tell saying how cowardly that was kept it IC and he felt really really bad cause i lost 52 and he was 52 to and knew how much exp was lost blah blah and was trying to get me a rez.Now if i started it WTF!? you stupid fucking dr00d! i fucking lost lvl 52 you prick better start looking for a rez asshole! It would of went a different way.<br>
<br>
Training sucks ass and its pretty much my biggest piss off here cause with Attuma i lvl from 27-55 pretty much only on killing gaurds so guess how many times i got trained all in the name of RP or whatever.But im not going to let some lame goof give me a ulcer.Killing highelves are the worse! them stupid highelves train all the time! But i still go back and will continue <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a> <b>12</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showPrevMessage?topicID=19.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showNextMessage?topicID=19.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=231><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.threadControl?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> -
