I doubt this is popular to say, but honestly, I think for almost all people who are obese, they're obese because of lifestyle choices and don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be obese.<br>
<br>
I don't think there's anything <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>wrong</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with being fat, and I don't think it's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>easy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to take the weight off, I just think it's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>possible</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
I think if you're more willing to go into life-risking surgery than you are to change your diet and establish an exercise routine you don't need surgery, you need a therapist.<br>
<br>
Do I think that genetics cause some people to be overweight no matter what they do?  Yes.  I also think the number of people who are truly like that is so statistically small it's irrelevant.<br>
<br>
If you're comfortable being fat, more power to ya.  If you've tried changing your food &amp; exercise habits and are finding it difficult, you have my sympathies.  But if you're trying to tell me it's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>impossible</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for you to lose weight, and you're still knocking back fast food (especially soda), you're smoking crack.<br>
<br>
I can't believe that kid's parents were willing to allow him to have the surgery.  That kid doesn't need his stomach stapled... he needs his allowance removed, his parents making him healthy bag lunches for school, and someone making him get his ass out of the house and do some yardwork on the weekends.<br>
<br>
If my son ends up fat, and comes to me and says &quot;Dad, I want to get my stomach stapled, I hate being fat&quot;, I'll be glad to help him change his lifestyle, or help him accept the fact that he's fat, but I'm not ever gonna support him risking his life to cut off some pounds.<br>
<br>
In fact, I think it's a parents responsibility to help make sure it doesn't even get to that point.  Some kids have higher metabolisms than others, so there's always gonna be some kids that are a little heavier, but if you notice that your kid is really ballooning to some abnormally unhealthy weight I think it's your job as a parent to get involved right then &amp; there... not because you want them lookin like a GQ model but because diabetes &amp; cholesterol that high etc are also life threatening.   <br>

The fact is, they operate on your stomach, not your brain. The success of the surgery is dependent on a lot of factors. If you are a grazer and munch in between meals, it's not going to keep the weight off and you'll probably gain most of it back anyway. Success is also determined on the willingness of make change in the eating habits of the patient. Success is determined by the willingness of the patient to exercise on a regular basis. Bariatric surgery is only intended to be one of many tools you use to lose weight, it's not the magical cure that the surgeons try to make you believe it is.<br>
Diet/Exercise...damn it, you can't get away from it!!! Argh!<br>
btw, I think most peeps on this game are overweight people behind the toon. I still am and I had the Roux and Y gastric bypass surgery in March of 2001. Well, Im considerably less than I was before surgery, but heck, it's a struggle and I'm still overweight. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skardon>skardon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/23/03 9:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=516.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Obesity</span><hr size=1> <br>

Out of curiosity, I am Swiss and I consider myself to be European as far as my society &amp; cultural background/heritage are concerned so my question may seem strange to the majority of the FV community, but is it considered acceptable to be overweight / obese in the USA?<br>
<br>
I was shocked when I went over for work a several months ago to see the huge (no pun intended) numbers of people who are overweight or worse. Is this situation caused by the over-abundance of fat rich food? Or is it a lack of exercise? Or is it that kids are left on their own and thus perhaps eat due to a feeling of neglect.<br>

There are a large number of factors contributing to this: readily available fat-rich foods (much easier to hit a fast food joint than to bother cooking something healthier), HUGE portions (if you choose to go to a sit-down restaurant, rather than a fast-food place, you will likely be given a plate nearly a foot wide piled high with whatever you ordered - even if it's a salad), lack of exercise (unless people are actively involved in a sport or subscribing to a fitness program of some sort, there is almost no exercise involved in a person's life: get up, get in car, sit on butt, drive to work, sit on butt, drive home, sit on butt), and of course the ultimate eating excuse: depression (I feel bad about myself or my life or the way I perceive certain others treating me, so I'm going to eat some food to feel better). We are, by and large, a very, very lazy society. To quote Real Genius, we &quot;run only when chased.&quot; Many of us are being sucked into a pit of apathy and ennui, about ourselves, our lives, and our country in general (how else can you explain a nit like Bush being in charge of the country? - I'm not saying there was a better choice available, I'm saying Bush is stupid - because he is), and it is only natural that as we stop caring about everything else, we stop caring about our health. Until it becomes an issue. When we are told we have high blood pressure or imminent risk of heart failure or other such critical problems, we change our lives and our habits and pretend we care. But often, we do this only when there is danger right in our faces (reactionary? Americans? oh, stop!)<br>

Is it possible for us to have a dicussion about anything in these forums without bringing President Bush into it?  When I woke up this morning, I stubbed my toe on a chair.  Somehow, President Bush was behind that.  When I figure out the connection, I will post about it.<br>
<br>
With respect to the discussion about obesity, I agree with Syllestrae.  Americans are becoming more and more obese and I doubt our genetic pool has changed significantly in the last 100/200 years.  The bulging waistlines, in my opinion, are caused by poorer diets and people getting less exercise.  Speaking for me personally, I have always had a high metabolism and have been able to stay trim.  Plus, since college, I work out about 4/5 times a week which helps counterbalance the time I spend sitting at work or playing EQ.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Humans, specifically obese people, were designed to hold up under harsh conditions. The obese person would not be obese IF we still had to hunt for our food, eat when we get kills, etc. Food now is rich with fats. The easier food to attain is the high calorie fast food. Put a thin person up against an obese person in a setting where they both had to forage for food and hunt for it, and the obese person would survive longer than the thin person. While the obese person is heartier and would survive longer in that type of setting, the society we live in today is not conducive to the &quot;heartier&quot; person. So....we have to work hard by dieting and exercise to adjust to our environment, keep our weight down, and survive.<br>

I used to be at 215 pounds with a 5'9 stature, that is not that obese but still it bothered me all the time, playing EQ from 4 to 6 hours every day, sometimes 10 hours straight and eating like a pig were the main causes, and well I've been a bit obese since I was born.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I decided it was enough, I made myself lose weight, literally, in 8 months I lost 45 pounds and now I weigh 170 pounds and still want to lose even more, but now I'm happy I took that decision 8 months ago and I think anyone can do the same, just believe in yourself.<br>

<br>
I was in the doctor's waiting room and flicked through a woman's magazine - New Idea or Woman's Day or somesuch - and there was an article on a woman who had lost 50kg (about 100lbs).  She was quoted as saying 'I was always very overweight but I never understood why'.<br>
<br>
Later in the article she explains how prior to her dieting she'd eat six slices of toast for breakfast and layer it with butter three times 'waiting for the butter to sink in every time'.  Then, later in the day, she'd eat KFC or Hungry Jacks (Burger King) or McDonalds.  She guzzled soft drink (soda).<br>
<br>
Now, this just made me furious.  It's people like these that give fat folks a bad name.  HOW can you be so incredibly bloody stupid that you do all that and then say, straight-faced 'Duh, I dunno why I'm fat'.   The article irritated me so much I put the whole magazine back and reached for another one, wherein was an almost identical story about a woman who 'didn't know why I was so heavy' but whose daily diet until then had included crisps, hot chips, all kinds of takeaway, burgers and icecream/cream.<br>
<br>
AAARGH!!! I just want to meet these people and bitch-slap some sense into them!<br>
<br>
Now I am fat.  Not 'pleasantly plump' - fat.  I don't eat much takeaway, I don't like soft drink, I don't drink alcohol, don't do drugs.  I don't even like crips or sweets much.  <br>
<br>
BUT I'm not about to say 'duh, why am I fat?'.  I'm fat because my job involves me sitting for 8 hours, I hate exercise, I love EQ and computer games and basically I don't really do anything physical.  See? I know my problem.  I'm absolutely bone-idle lazy.<br>
<br>
Now why couldn't the stupid women in the magazines just be honest and say 'Well, sure I was fat, but then again, I ate anything that couldn't run away in time and guzzled soft drink like it was going out of style, plus I spent my days watching tacky soap operas'.   <br>
<br>
That's an answer you can appreciate.  Sure, it doesn't inspire respect, but at least I for one would appreciate the honesty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/25/03 1:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=516.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Obesity</span><hr size=1> I would like to request a translation of some of the terms you used <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Could you please describe the following terms? <br>

The body fat on most peoples body came primarily from excess carbohydrates.  Some people have higher metabolism, some people excercise more, almost 100% of people take in too many carbohydrates as thats what we have been told is good for us for the past however long the food pyramid has been in.<br>

What makes you fat are excess calories, regardless of whether they're from carbohydrates or from fat.<br>
<br>
I have honest to god found snack foods where the &quot;low-fat&quot; variety has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>more</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> calories than the fatty variety, because they replace the fat with corn syrup to keep it tasty.<br>

To really over-simplify<br>

Excess Calories (any) makes ya heavy.<br>
Excess Fat clogs your arteries.<br>
Excess carbohydrates causes diabetes.<br>

If you want to lose weight, cut your calorie intake down, and increase your activity level.

<br>
Accompanied the missus on grocery expedition the other week. Can someone explain the logic behind this thinking?<br>
<br>
Vegetables &amp; meats at the market are priced well because we have improved technologies to maximize their success. These have progressed over time to include hormones, selective breeding, land use, irrigation technologies, pesticides &amp; hebicides, etc. Now food science is going a step further with genetically modified foods to even further enhance the goodness &amp; reduce the badness.<br>
<br>
But organic foods enjoy a higher price. The cars in the parking lot at the organic food store in my town are obviously of a higher median sale price than those at the chain grocery store (even those in better neighborhoods). It appears that the only people who can afford an organic diet are the upper middle class. They eat it because &lt;insert reason here&gt;? What if everyone wanted an organic diet? Would our farms &amp; ranches be capable of sustaining that demand? <br>
<br>
I can live with the pesticides but quite honestly GM food scares the bejesus outta me. <br>
<br>

<br>
With milk, for example, organic milk is basically from cows that walk around, eat grass, and get milked.<br>
<br>
Non-organic milk is from cows that are given hormones which increases their milk supply.  Their udders swell so badly that they develop sores so they're also given antibiotics.  They may or may not walk around depending on the farm (some are grass fed, some are fed cow feed which may or may not include ground up parts of other cows etc).<br>
<br>
Our country could very easily sustain an all-organic production if demand called for it.  Right now though, the demand isn't there.  If you go generic, you can get a gallon of non-organic milk for about $1.00 - $1.50.  A <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>half</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-gallon of organic milk will cost you $2.50 - $3.00.  People on the whole don't see enough risk associated w/ non-organic foods to offset that price difference.<br>
<br>
The organic food industry is having 2 big problems right now also.<br>
<br>
1) Non-organic food producers lobbying to be able to label their food as organic.  As an example, South american countries can call their tuna &quot;Dolphin Safe&quot; even though it's not dolphin safe at all.  They claimed to WTO that it's unfair advantage for wealthier countries, because they can't afford dolphin-safe harvesting methods, and so WTO lets them call their dolphin safe when it definately isn't.<br>
<br>
2) Genetic Drift: Genetically Modified foods are living organisms, and as such reproduce.  Many species, particularly wind pollinators, can travel several miles and set up shop in neighbouring farms.  An organic corn can get &quot;infected&quot; with GM corn, and they wouldn't know it until harvest time.  You can't have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>any</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> GM in your crops to label it organic, and so if even 1 GM stalk was growing in your crop, it means you can't call your stuff organic, and thus you can't sell it for the higher price that organic crops fetch, and you're basically screwed (because you invested all that money in organic growing methods).<br>

<br>

hmm.  I think, in situations of truly morbid obesity(500+ pounds, maybe), that it hits a point where your life may depend on how fast you can get large amounts of weight off.  Do I think you needn't blame yourself for being there? not at all. <br>

/agree<br>
<br>
<br>
In my opinon, obese people need to ask themselves one question...<br>
<br>
&quot;what am I gaining from being fat?&quot; Because(and I just had this discussion earlier today) humans, by nature, don't do things that don't benifit them, somehow.<br>
<br>
Once you find out what you gain(ie, attention, um, an excuse to keep people at a distance, etc) determine if that's really what you want.  If it is, find another way to get it, if not, find something else to do/feel/be.<br>
<br>
We, as humans, are far more in control of every aspect of ourselves, than we know/are willing to admit.<br>
<br>
Lastly, before anyone starts yelling...am I fat? yep.<br>
