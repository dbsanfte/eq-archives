<br>
<br>
  I have decided to write to you with my personal opinion on my good friend of two years, Dirfrops (Russ). I started Firiona Vie the same day the server went live In October of 2001. I created the Council of Silver Griffons. For some of you that do not know of us, that is because we died out sometime by the end of 2002. I will get to that later. I met Dirfrops shortly after the server went live and he was one of the founding members of the Council of Silver Griffons. I knew then I had a good man in the guild.<br>
I talked with Russ on the phone and played side by side with him for countless hours.<br>
Russ is a good friend of mine, and I know his moral sense is strong. Those that knew me, if you loved me or hated me on Firiona you knew my word was strong.<br>
<br>
The Griffons were based on a very strong moral compass. A roleplaying guild unlike I had ever seen. We were a strong family. Unfortunately nothing lasts forever.<br>
We had begun to die off when I split up with my wife of 8 years in real life in summer of 2002. I left my faith and trust in Dirfrops to run the guild for me, and passed over leadership for a time to him. Things were stable and he led well. I came back a few times trying to resurrect the idea of the Griffons and to maintain our presence on Firiona Vie. Things transpired that kept my life from becoming stable for a time and the Griffons slowly fell out of the guild without me being around. Most of them really just wanted to move on with the rest of the server, and raid. I had no problem with that, but I was saddened by it. One of the reasons I decided to leave Firiona Vie for good.<br>
<br>
My point is, I trust Russ, and he was there for me in times of need, be it in real life, or in the game holding a high responsibility and honor. I knew Kajiin for a little while, when he tried to enter our guild. As soon as he entered, he began a life of crime, and was quickly expelled by my character &lt;Gavin&gt; but Dirfrops like me has compassion, and the whole thing was in question, but when I gave an order, I gave an order.<br>
Russ maintained some friendship with him and that is where this all falls into place.<br>
Kajiin would like to play Mr. Innocent on here I am sure, but rest assured, the guy has lied even to me, who was his Guidleader. Russ is not nor ever would be like that.<br>
Besides he has nothing to gain anymore in Everquest. I got him hooked to another game and he has been playing it with me.<br>
<br>
To all my old friends, foes, I will close with goodbye and I wish you all good luck in your new adventures. If anyone wants to drop me a line sometime or find out where Gavin Steelheart’s decent is currently, don’t hesitate to email me.<br>

I met with Dirfrops last night and he made appropriate restitution for the debt.  My only inconvenience will be selling it all, which isn't a big deal.  I'll consider it my penance for being so stupid in the first place.  <br>
<br>
In the end, I haven't the slightest idea who I've been dealing with both before, during, and after the scam.  I'm not sure how many people have played the Dirfrops character, and quite honestly, I don't care.  My goal really isn't to blacklist anyone forever, but to hold a person accountable for their actions.  If indeed this is a situation involving account sharing, then there are two victims here, and I appreciate the original owner making amends.  If it is a different situation altogether, then I feel all is not well in la la land for whoever is playing this account, and I pity them.  Either way, my hands are washed of it, and I'm thankful to have gotten paid back in one form or another.  However, again, to whomever was playing Dirfrops last night, thank you for your follow-up and follow-through.  I appreciate you righting the wrong.<br>
<br>
As to the community at large, I have no clue what to tell you, other than don't be as stupid as I was.  Don't trust anyone.  If you're going to do X-server trades, I don't care if the person phones you in real life, gives you a urine specimen, or their mother's maiden name - do the transfer in small increments and do it with caution.  Assume nothing.  I sure learned that lesson.<br>
<br>
Take care.<br>

<br>
Only four people, strike that five, have ever played this character.<br>
<br>
Gavin Steelheart (used me for transports)<br>
<br>
Boleorn (used me for transports and P-leveling his shaman Jahvert)<br>
<br>
Belas (I am pretty sure it was Belas), but I gave him access to my character once, and that was to get me the heck out of PoInnovation when my power went out on a raid...if it was Belas, he only got on Dirfrops once)<br>
<br>
Kajinn (plain just used me, in the most horrific sense)<br>
<br>
And of course myself.<br>
<br>
I have played other people's characters without sin, but have never played two characters at once because my other computer runs Linux (/grin).<br>
<br>
What have I learned of this lesson?  Fortunately Kruggan stated it all for me.  Don't ever trust anyone.  You take a big risk in giving someone access to a character...loss of reputation, items, monies, or complete banning altogether.  Just make sure that before you let someone on you, make sure they are wearing a 'raincoat' or you may regret it for the rest of your life (or the life of that character.<br>
<br>
There is a 1% chance that you ever see Dirfrops on this message board again.  There is 0% chance that you will ever see Dirfrops Mildrethriel on EQ1...I have uninstalled EQ from my machine (thus freeing up a precious 3 gigs of space, heh), and all his passwords are changed.  I will not delete this character for fear that someone might recreate him once the name is freed up on this server.<br>
<br>
He is dead, let him rest.<br>
<br>
For those who knew the real Dirfrops, thanks for all the fun.  For those who were harmed by the fake Dirfrops, I am sorry.<br>
<br>
And finally...Dirfrops...where the hell did that name come from?<br>

With no soapbox full of 'meanies', I am sure there would have been no payback. <br>

This is the place where scammers get accounts banned, where liars are caught in their own traps, and we all laugh at it. And it's because of the bashing, and the hurting.<br>

    Rather than get mad at us, why don't you get mad at all the people who make this place needed?  Take arms against the people who create a climate that Lenny and I never lend our Jboots anyone, even though there are surely scores of people who could be trusted to give them back after the cast? <br>
<br>
Did you read any of Dirf's responses?  At the very least, he's compromised his account to the point that we can't believe that anything he says is actually said by him.  Or maybe he has multiple personalities.   Or maybe, just maybe, he's a guy that saw what seemed to be a golden opportunity to steal some &quot;untraceable plat&quot;, then started a mad scramble to cover his ass when he found out that the GM's can indeed track large plat transactions.  Whichever the case, I still wouldn't trust him with a loaned firebeetle eye. <p>-- <br>

I'm glad the plat was returned. But there will always be a little doubt in my mind about how the whole mess transpired. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Have seen enough of this stuff: scammers, people claiming that others used their accounts, people trying to prove their innocence....<br>
<br>
Too bad that this happens over and over again.<br>
<br>
Please: If your account got hacked, don't write <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hundreds</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of posts trying to prove that you are innocent. Change your passwords and shut up!<br>
<br>
The fact that everything was solved in the end speaks for (original) Dirfrop's innocence. However, the fact how he behaved in this thread (senseless and confusing postings, and overemphasizing the &quot;my account got abused&quot; story) still let me doubt about his integrity.<br>

We don't?!  Shit... I always thought of myself as the guy standing in the dark alley with a lit cigarette, an overcoat and a fedora.  You know, the one that always says &quot;Psst... hey kid.  I got something good here for ya...&quot;  When you walk by him.<br>

And... you ever *really* see a guy in an alley wearing a fedora?  Was he in color or black and white? <p>-- <br>
