Balancing healers, evaccers, making sure the enchanters have enough healing power in their groups, and lastly (yes, last!) trying to balance out fire power/melee dmg.  Sometimes you balance out a wizard with 3 melee in another group.. you know the wizard will get the xp when he/she nukes on the singles, but in long drawn out fights the melee group will get every kill. It's just the way it works,and the reason why xp will NEVER be divided evenly.<br>
<br>
Then again, it might be redundant soon. There's a new raid system on the test server, so that there can be several groups grouped on raids and get xp at the same time. It's less efficient, but one thing less to gripe about at the end of the day. Yay!<br>

When I lead a raid I want folk to get experience, loot, epic items and have a great time, but it is not always possible to provide this. I warn folk up front that a raid may equal no loot and 0 exp.  <br>
<br>
For the most part people are great. Most I find not only sign up nice and early, but they actually read the instructions and print out the maps!  For those that are not so great, I have a tip, as raid leader invest in a couple of potions. If a person presents enough of a problem, in tells suggest that they may wish to take a graceful exit, and provide them with a way out. &lt; A less expensive way would be a wizard to TL if available&gt;.<br>
<br>
Another tip, from Valquiss, instead of camping out to chat channels, have people make a character of a similar name on another server, and when they camp out, they can log on this character and /join firiona:raidchannel.  You would not believe how much nicer this is for the raid leader <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One other thought ....As a raid leader you also owe the folk who have taken the time to attend something. If a critical class does not come to the raid, or the mob you seek is not up, respect the time and commitment of your friends. Offer the chance of an alternate activity hopefully close for those who choose to stay. Of course if you change the aim of the raid also allow folk the option to do other things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As I have recently begun running some raids and have assisted those who have run some befor, I find it interesting that as long as SOME drops occurred, and there was no wipeout, most raids I went on were considered successes. Now, if the BEST drop doesn't happen, or people are not getting exp every other kill, the whine factor starts to become a real pain. People no longer seem to be happy to have come along for the ride, and thank you for the complimentary drink and nuts...but please, chill some.<br>

People should go to a raid expecting only the experience of it, everything else is gravy. <br>
<br>
I would never plan one of these raids as there are too many unknown quantities at stake like not knowing the actual number of type or capabilities of people that will show and having not fought with many of them before. Hats off to those that try to organize these, they are in my opinion the toughest type of raid to get moving. <br>
<br>
And Sneez, I have not raided under your leadership that I know of, so these are not things I have observed on a raid with you if that means anything, just trying to highlight some feelings of the crowd of raiders if possible as I perceive it to be. <br>
<br>
Though much has been said about attendees...<br>
<br>
THERE IS A FLIP SIDE TO THIS COIN<br>
<br>
I do not know what open raids were like here earlier than say two months ago. From what I have seen, there are some huge negatives that will prevent me personally from ever attending another open raid again. The following issues, in my opinion, are valid constructive criticisms of the overall process:<br>
<br>
1. There have been many &quot;As many people who want to come, feel free&quot; type open raids. Some places do not require 150 people to raid. Limits need to be set on the size of the raid. Sometimes less is more.<br>
<br>
2. Groups need to be planned out better rather than creating them on the spot.<br>
<br>
3. If a raid is scheduled for a certain time, attendees expect it to happen near to that time, not three hours later. Late attendees do not go. period.<br>
<br>
4. Certain things which should be common knowledge in the planning of raids which seem to be left out of many open raids. Questions like &quot;How are clerics re-imbursed for symbol spells&quot;. What should attendees bring with them? ex: Resist Gear, gems for clerics, coffins for necros, etc etc<br>
<br>
Along this same vein...<br>
Basically, the capabilities need to be determined. Should we do this raid betting that the one signed enchanter will show? Do we need them? How are we handling rezzes? What is the minimum percent rez we can guarantee people? At what point does the raid leader bite the bullet and cancel the raid because the requirements they drew up for required participation have not materialized. Tactics need to be drawn up based on the classes that will come, etc...<br>
<br>
5. Loot Order. It is true many people who are not in powerful guilds see open raids as perhaps the only avenue to attain things they need. I have witnessed &quot;Open&quot; raids that are nothing more than weak pathetic guilds who do not have the power to raid the place themselves recruiting a bunch of flunkies to die for them while they loot everything. Loot order must be in stone in advance and all members of the raid that are seeking an item ought to have a chance to attain it equal to all others on the raid (meaning a warrior who wants their epic for example on a dragon raid ought to have same chance as any other warrior to obtain the epic item... no biases at all) Want to be biased towards your friend???? Get into a real guild and raid with your guild.<br>
<br>
6. XP. People actually go on OPEN raids expecting to gain XP? Are they nuts or just plain stupid? I fault people on this one. Being in an XP group is the last thing one should be concerned with while participating in an open raid. Want XP??? Do SOMETHING ELSE!<br>
<br>
7. The leader has called the raid. They should know what hell it can be before taking the plunge. Once taking the plunge, you must be a near expert on the place to be raided and have maps, strategies, tactics and roles established for people who are raiding in advance of the raid. It is then up to the attendees to come up to speed on their function. I dare say people ought to leave e-mail addresses days in advance so the raid leader can communicate with everyone and assign them tasks...<br>
<br>
Raiding a powerful zone is not easy. Zerging with a chaotic horde of a million people does nothing but kill alot of people. That is not an effective strategy most of the time unless you like lag, LD hell, chaos, etc. For a lower level example, I challenge any 50 people of 20 - 30th level to attempt a frontal assault with no tactics on the main courtyard to Mistmoore Castle.... hehehe =)<br>
<br>
This is no different, just much higher level. The game is designed to be defeated by superior tactics employed by well organized and discplined groups of people who have a role and a plan and stick to them. It is a test to see how well real people through their character Avatars can actually cooperate. If this is incompatible with Open Raiding, and if open raids are to continue to go as I have seen them go and heard of them go from friends, then I can see a swift decline in participation in such and will gleefully watch the whole movement fall on its ass and die in utter disgrace and failure. <br>
<br>
On a more positive note, here is a chance for leadership if that is possible given the difficulty of the Open Raid concept. I cannot in good faith blame any particpants when they tire of dying countless times due to a total lack or leadership and coordination. I can blame them if there is a well organized plan of attack and *they* do things like show up late, gate out early, do not digest their role in the raid before-hand and stick to the plan, ninja-loot if they are in the XP group and the plan is master loot by raid leader, etc.<br>
