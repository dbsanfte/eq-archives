You should put that on your resume... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as roleplaying, Firiona Vie has been almost better than I had hoped for. What I've discovered thus far is that RPing tends to feed on itself. AKA I will meet someone who doesn't initally emphasize RP in their playing, however as soon as I start spouting my '...duty to Tunare and my love Dyshira...' routine and other various colorful (but useless from a XPing/uber standpoint) dialog, they can't help but respond in kind.<br>
<br>
In other words, YOU (yes you!) can make Firiona Vie great! Just keep on trying.. There is more than one way to enjoy the game, and everyone has their style, so lets mix it up and see what happens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umoandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moandor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 4:37:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1109.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm not a jerk, I just play one in FV</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I can't speak for the rest of the sexy wood elves, but it's possibly that I might find time in my busy schedule of Elf seduction for the 'Resident sex icon of Neriak'. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Seduce me, huh? Methinks you got that backwards! <br>

I read a book written by the world reknown Gnome geneticist Sputnik Dinkalotapus, and his book has a convincing theory that deep down inside, all you wood elves have an innate jealousy of our beautiful creamy blue skin. <br>

<br>
Valquiss and the others make a good point about how RPing an evil character could get you labeled as a jerk player. <br>
<br>
That's a valid point, and one thing I need to look out for. <br>
<br>
But there is one method I use to avoid this.... I normally try to 'feel out' other RPers first before I continue.  Normally if you can distinguish players who ARE willing to role play along, it's usually a given that they realize you are simply RPing an evil character, as opposed to acting like a player who is a bona fide jerk. <br>
<br>
Although my character is elitist in nature, not to mention that Discordant Evil necromancers tend to be an insular type of people.... IMHO it's not so limiting being a Dark Elf, as we do have many perceived allies whom we tolerate (if not admire). <br>
<br>
It does seem far more difficult to do this with an evil RPing Iksar.... the Iksars have it hard, because they are called on to roleplay insular xenophobes who mistrust almost anyone with soft skin.... which is more than 90% of the population of EQ servers. I can see how this makes things more difficult for them in terms of game play. I sympathize with the Iksar RPers here, I know they really have it tough. <br>

<br>
Entirely ooc, I am Lawful Neutral as an enchanter and I think I pull that off reasonably well, even without the &quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot;.  I've never been too impressed with my own racial history as a High Elf and I would have no problem, in theory, with joining and getting to know some Tier'dal.  Might even lead me into relationships with some of the other dark races.  But I don't speak Tier'dal really well (damn, keep meaning to work on that) and it's just never happened.  Starspun is a fairly good-oriented guild (with acknowledgement to Syll, our resident bad girl) and that's probably part of the reason why also.  But this is a character direction I'd be interested in exploring eventually.<br>
<br>
So, if there are any evil types out there with a decent command of Human, Elvish, or (unlikely) Dwarvish, feel free to get in touch with me.  I'm currently season 27 and closing on clarity.  Soon, very soon.  I've heard there's a lack of enchanters among the dark races....<br>

<br>
You see, my brother, Sekali, and I were orphaned at an early age, and I was put in charge of bringing him up. Sekali was not the brightest torch on the wall and was prone to wandering, so taking care of him was a full-time task.<br>
However, we were quite poor, so when I was given the chance to be an apprentice and learn the skills of an enchanter (and jewelsmith), I jumped at the opportunity. Soon after I started my schooling my brother, unknown to me, hopped on the boat to Antonica and was reportedly captured by the Tier'Dal, presumably to be sold into slavery. The guilt I feel at letting him fall into their foul clutches is unbearable. It has become my life's work to find and rescue him. <br>
<br>
I headed to Antonica before my early training was complete(level 5) to look for him. I spent a lot of time prowling through in dark elf form through the dank, dark streets of Neriak, searching for clues to his whereabouts. When my search turned up nothing, I turned my frustrations on the dark elf guards, killing them over and over near the entrance to Lavastorm. The Neriak citizens now hate me on site, regardless of my disguise, so I doubt I'll ever enter that horrible city again. <br>
<br>
My training has continued at a slow pace, mostly because I am constantly wandering, hoping to hear word of my brother. I'm now in my 23rd season and still have heard nothing of Sekali, though I have donned the dark elf disguise many times and joined their ranks for adventuring and to learn their snarling, gutteral language. There have been many awkward moments after my disguise has faded while grouping with their kind, but no matter. I remain steadfast in my quest, and will continue to hunt for word of him.<br>
<br>
If you see a high elf lad, with white hair and dark eyes, who answers to the name of Sekali, give him my love, and tell him I am coming for him...<br>

RPing evil seriously all the time will only get you burnt out and bored with it. But role playing evil to the effect that you are occasionally goofy and laughable....that's where the fun is.  In other words, learning to &quot;ham it up&quot; is the best part of role playing. <br>
<br>
My evil characters tend to be like that. They are boastful, arrogant, delusional and conceited megalomaniacs.... yet they are also very vulnerable, insecure, bumbling, self-evident putzes that you just can't help yourself to laugh at them sometimes.... <br>
<br>
and deep down inside, one starts to wonder if such personnas are really genuinely evil.... or simply unloved and misunderstood? <br>
<br>
This is what I like about role playing.... it doesn't have to be one-dimensional. It never has to be linear. Even the example of &quot;evil&quot; role playing does not have a single perfect template. <br>
