I know FV is low pop so that tunnle doesn't see alot of traffic but i also know that alot of folk running for the  spires pull trins though that area, by chooseing  well travelled point of the map your chance of getting your casters trained  on &quot;accident&quot; is greatly increased.<br>
<br>
When folks on your raid start appolizeing that's a sign that you're doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
So again prove you've got a bit of pride in your guild, don't flame.<br>
<br>
&quot; I'm sorry that I decided to use your camp as a pull site, it wasn't an intentional slight i assure you. If you have any more questions please talk to the guild leader ( if it's you guild officers ) , and we'll come to a reasonable understanding&quot;<br>
<br>
That would have ended this thread. It would have shown that you're atleast halfway respectful to the comunity. If you step on another raiding guild here it's not a real problem, if you step on the open roleplay community your in for a headache. Ask any Ex AS member, not that the open roleplay community can really do anything to you, other than smear your name in the dirt at every chance and try to make your life complicated.<br>
<br>
as and example See the Blayze Vs Xarp thang there are others.<br>
<br>
Note that this post didn't start generateing post count and negative publicity until you responded without the respect you asked to be paid to you in tells ? <br>
<br>
Respect is a 2 way street if you want folks to treat you with it atleast fake it for the boards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kethlar>kethlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/6/02 4:04:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   *L That's Funny</span><hr size=1> You expect respect out of me when obviously I see a huge lack of respect for my person on this flame?

<br>
Its irrelevant that she didn't tell you where her camp was..... look around, and verify beyond a shadow of a doubt that no one is close to your pull area. Then dismiss her as a crank, if you can't find her... or ASK her where she is at.<br>
<br>
And for the xp groups<br>
Raids moving through a zone WILL cause havoc with xp groups in their path. Just treat em like a freak storm that travels through, disrupting pulls, killing mobs, messing up timers, etc. They will be moving on soon enough....<br>

Fix your underwear before you hurt yourself!<br>
<br>
Yes, i called you a moron!  Right after i mentioned that you took over our camp, you had mentioned that i do not own the entire zone.  After your rude comments, i did call you a moron and yes, even made a comment about the size of your genitals.  I will fully admit that!   Im surprised you didn't mention that...  i dont have anything to hide. <br>
<br>
However, with a group like yours, didn't you wonder why green yeti's were coming up and attacking some group thats not even a part of your raid?  it happened at least twice.  I had also mentioned it many times that we are hunting here and we were ignored.  I also heard at least one member apologizing for your rude behavior and telling me about the dragon.  Kethlar, your spamming will not prove that you are WRONG!<br>
<br>
Again, we would have moved if you would have asked.  You didnt even mention that you were pulling a dragon to us.  If it wasn't for someone i knew telling me so, we would have died.  <br>
<br>
here is it again Kethlar.  Here is YOUR mistakes.<br>
1.  you took someones spot without asking.<br>
2.  you rudely were going to pull something that would have killed a small hunting group.<br>
3.  you didn't call anything..  or have any considerations for anyones feelings.<br>
4.  you were as rude as can be, not admitting to your mistakes.<br>
5.  you misspelled my name quite a few times..   its A-R-A-N-I-A.  If youre going to call someone names, try using the right name.<br>
<br>
Here is what i want.  I dont want an apology from you. After all, whats it worth?  I want an apology from Asdeuce, the leader of Norrathers Call (or at least this is where my research points me).  I hear he is a VERY reasonable man unlike yourself.  As soon as we meet, i wish to have a chat with him about you Kethlar.  I hope to be doing this as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
All i want here is satisfaction that you will NOT do this again.  <br>

<br>
There were some people who came out of the tunnel, I first noticed a halfling sitting behind us and I stood up and turned around and said &quot;look people!&quot; but they just sat there, there were quite a few NC folks, and one from Ring of Light, and an iksar from Night Legion.  No one said anything, and Arania had called Inc and brought a yeti to us.<br>
<br>
Well we started to fight the Yeti, but the yeti was turned into a skeleton and the other group of people killed it rather quickly.<br>
<br>
We didn't ask for their help or assistance in anyway.<br>
<br>
So we turned around and I asked them to please refrain from helping us and not to turn things into skeletons anymore.<br>
<br>
No one said anything, but the Iksar from Night Legion said Hail, then sent me a tell saying that he turned the yeti into a skeleton, and I told him to please not do that anymore, becuase it is rather rude.<br>
<br>
I got a tell from Corrina saying how these ruffians were being really rude, but that they were going to kill Gore and we'd better move.<br>
<br>
We also got told that we'd better move or get killed outloud.<br>
<br>
We eventually moved to the BW zone line, but it was quite upsetting in the sense that we were basically forced out of our area, our pull got turned into a skeleton and then killed by this group, and told to leave or get killed ( in basic words)<br>
<br>
I am of the opinion it is better to just leave a situation rather than escalate it.  I am posting here because it was a rude situation, and uncalled for and that I was a witness to the whole thing.<br>

<br>
Arania and I - and a third member - had been pulling onto the ridge in front of the tunnel entrance for quite some time when suddenly I realized that there were a number of people standing around. I had heard no shouts, nor did anyone say anything to us (yes, I have shouts turned on). One person who knew the other group member said hello to us, but that was it;there was no mention of why they were there and so Arania continued to pull. She pulled a yeti onto the ridge when suddenly a few people jumped in and started attacking it. I was confused, but didn't say anything, thinking perhaps they just meant to help (although none of us were low on health and we were doing just fine).<br>
<br>
The second time Arania pulled a yeti, a necromancer turned it into a skeleton before we had a chance to kill it, and none of us received any experience for it. At this point, Arania asked &quot;Why are you attacking?&quot; The necromancer did step forward to say he had turned it into a skeleton, but before any of us could really say anything else, someone said &quot;u better move sister if you want to live.&quot; <br>
<br>
At this point, the other member in our group informed us that she had been told in a private tell sent to her by her friend that they were planning on pulling Gore onto the ridge, and that her friend had apologized for the others' behavior. We moved away, but Arania informed me she had contacted the raid leader because she felt that their behavior was rude and was speaking to him in tells.<br>
<br>
I don't know what was said between Arania or Kethlar, but I feel she had every right to contact the raid leader with her concerns because quite frankly, she was right. It all boils down to common courtesy. We weren't claiming the entire zone to ourselves nor would we have argued with anyone if someone had just said &quot;Excuse me, sorry to intrude on your camp like this, but we were planning on pulling a dragon onto the ridge.&quot;<br>
<br>
This entire issue could have been resolved by a simple and polite request asking us to move for a few minutes. We would have all understood and gladly done so.<br>

But as far as you Arania..I never claimed &quot;how big and powerful&quot; I am...guess you got that from just looking at me?  Although I never saw you when I got to the mouth of the cave...as I said before.  And I DID give you clear warning that Gore was being pulled to there.  As far as other people and how they were acting over by the mouth of the cave, not sure if they had it confused that maybe they thought you were part of the raid as well?  But at the time I was running from Burning woods zone to the mouth of the cave so I was not there to address the situation nor did I know that is what happened.THIS IS the first time I'm hearing about it.<br>
<br>
As far as an apology, again you can beg me for it and I am not going to apology to you.  I don't think you deserve it personally.  I will though apologize to your other party members who seem much more mature than you could ever be.  So to the other party members there besides Arania, if it is true that we did happen on your camp then it was unfortunate.  It was not deliberate nor was it our intent to take over your camp.  When I arrived I didnt even see you all there, all I had was a irrating bee buzzin in my air (Arania) who didn't mention at all where your camp was.<br>
<br>
Also, our leader is not Asduece.  Please get your facts straight.  You could have asked one of our guild before you assumed it.  Our leader is now Uncamike and our advisors are me, rbniceone, batam, rhayannon and sakuta.  You can find that info by visiting our website.<br>
<br>
And last night if you did not know on Gore was an open raid and yes I was the raid leader for it.<br>
<br>
That being said,<br>
<br>
Milow, I've grouped with you before and you seemed to be an ok guy.  But you got something against me?  Why the hostility I seem to be seeing here from you?  Out of curiousity was it somehow because of last night's rumblecrush kill? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cutierogue>Cutierogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/6/02 5:32:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Kethlar, you dont need to be pushing anyone else around.

But i only heard that from word of mouth so thank you, i shall be talking with Uncamike.<br>
<br>
Just think, if you didn't have this &quot;fly buzzing in your ear&quot; then you would have never even considered apologizing to my other sisters.  Wow!  What a concept!<br>
<br>
You also have three people telling you that they did not hear that you were pulling anything or taking that spot.  We did tell you after moving that you did take our spot and yes, you did respond quite harshly.  I am not one to take attitude problems to kindly and you did have an attitude problem.  <br>
<br>
Its funny how you view yourself and how others view you.<br>

<br>
As far as how other people view me...what are you talking about?  I haven't seen anyone express negativity about my person but this situation.  You seem to have a knack about twisting perceptions around to your own mindset and basically lying to achieve your means.  You must have had a lot of practice...surely.  <br>
<br>
And need I remind you that I would have apologized to all of you if YOU had talked to me in a civil manner.  I don't recall yet .... not one person I have talked to in a manner other than civil to this date, in the game, from the time I first started playing.  If there has been one person I did not talk to in a civil manner in game, please step forward and state your case.<br>

Not that I would speak for someone else, but could it be because you're acting like a moron?  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't act too nicely to a group of people planning to pull a dragon that AE's on top of me on a spot I'd been camping for awhile.  Especially, when the spot that you were pulling to is asinine.  You act surprised when someone actually stuck up for themselves instead of capitulating.  <br>

P.S.  Perhaps you could be my counterpart on the board title... Totally Visible, Incredibly Moronic seems to fit your personality quite well.<br>

Its funny how you say im manipulating but the others say exactly what i say.<br>
<br>
Do i really have lots of practice?  I thought i showed a good amount of patience with you Kethlar.  Not only have you not admitted to your mistake but you have spammed this board with talk about me and what your opinions are about me.  The only thing i really called you was a moron and that was last night.  This is because you were acting then as you are now.<br>
<br>
All i hear is how you didn't do anything and how you think you are so special.  Maybe you are a good raid leader but your attitude in this is a disgrace to your guild.  We have witnesses here stating what you did and how wrong it was.  If you were man enough to admit your mistakes and dropped this high and mighty attitude, i would have dropped this long ago.<br>

<br>
And stop with the condescending remarks please. Kethlar has five levels over Opir. That doesn't necessarily mean that poKethlar knows alot more about the game than poOpir.<br>
<br>
Any decent puller should be able to get Gore a respectable distance. A decent puller will never be hit by Gore's melee. A decent puller will never be summoned. A decent puller will just be hit by AE's. <br>
<br>
If you for some reason find it impossible to pull her with one puller then use two. The first one fd capable.<br>
<br>
750pt ae once in a while isn't all that.<br>
<br>
Pulling to the tunnel is wrong, wrong and wrong. It's wrong because it will likely kill some passer by, and it's wrong because someone running from KC to spires will invariably come by and leave a train in your knees. While alot of drolvargs aren't dangerous they can mess things up bad by hitting on key casters. (And they do it only at the worst time.)<br>
<br>
Some other creatures actually de-aggro if you are out of melee range, those are much more fun pulls.
