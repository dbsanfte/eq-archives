His eyes are drawn to a necklace that dangles from his fingertips.  His eyes follow the small silver chain down to the lone emerald set in a silver casing.  A simple necklace, yet his eyes are drawn into the emerald's murky depths, staring at a part of himself, his essence, his soul.  His thoughts wander back as to how he came about this simple, yet meaningful necklace...<br>
<br>
I knew what I wanted to give my wife for our anniversary, something meaningful, yet simple.  And so I decided on a necklace with my life's essence imbued within.  First, I had to find a necklace which would be able to hold my life's essence, and thus I remembered mention of a Sparkling Soul Necklace found within the Tower of Frozen Shadow, and so it was there that I made my first visit.  After borrowing Mudwart's master key to the tower from Littany, I entered the tower alone and worked my way to the fourth floor where I had heard stories of a dreaded mummy by the name of Amontehepna whom carried this rare neckpiece.  After slaying all inhabitants and not finding a trace of the mummy, I waited for their spirits to reform and coalesce into their material form once again.  I made my rounds once again, quickly dispatching the weak shadows and mummies.  As I came around a corner, I heard the mumbling and shuffling that was a new sound to me.  I peeked around the corner and with its back turned to me was the beast Amontehepna.  Smiling to myself, I lifted my cudgel and made quick work of the mummy, reveling in the crunching of bones as my cudgel fell repeatedly upon the beast's body.  Once the walking corpse had stopped moving, I investigated the ruins and found to my delight the Sparkling Soul Necklace which I sought.<br>

<br>
Grinning to myself, I left the tower and sought out the next part of the necklace, a gem imbued with my soul.  I knew that the bonedancers of Neriak were able to infuse one's spirit within an emerald and so I sought out the new bonedancer to the League, Dekarn.  Meeting in the Nexus, I explained my request to the bonedancer and Dekarn set about preparing the ritual.  With the preparations complete, I sat on the stone floor and lost myself in meditation, whilst Dekarn began the ritual.  I awoke from my reverie, expecting to feel ... different ... but I did not and raised my eyebrow at Dekarn.  The bonedancer was holding the emerald in his hand with a puzzled look.  He was quite confused and did not know the reason, but he told me that my soul was too powerful to be encased within the emerald.  The both of us puzzled, we departed and I pondered, wondering as to the reason behind this.  Surely, I was a powerful Dread Lord, but too powerful for my essence to be held within an emerald?  And thus I sought out the council of Dekarn's master, Xon Qeuxill, as well as my old masters, Nezzka Tol and Tralon Din'a, in the Tower of the Dead.<br>
<br>
Tallonar: &quot;Fellow Lords of Neriak, I have sought out one of your students of the dead to infuse my soul within an emerald and he was unable to do so.  Why?&quot;<br>
Xon: &quot;You have grown too powerful Tallonar.  There is a limited time when my fellow bonedancers can infuse one's spirit within an emerald, and you have grown past that.&quot;<br>
Tralon: &quot;Their powers fail against the most powerful amongst us, those that have been given the title of Lord, Tallonar.&quot;<br>
Tallonar: &quot;Then take of me my title and my rank, for it is my heart's yearning to have this gift for my wife.  Strip me of my power and abilities so that I may be sacrificed!&quot;<br>
Nezzka: &quot;As you wish it, so it may be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
And they fell upon me, each blow stripping of me some of the power I once held, until at long last I was once again nothing more than a Revenant.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/images/Sacrifice.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
I quickly called for one of Xon's students, Tylos, of the 57th rank of bonedancing and this time the ritual was a success.  Clasping to my breast the emerald containing my essence, I thanked Tylos for his services and next sought out Faentriel V'Ghera, wielder of the Holy Water Sprinkler.  After finding out what I had done, she quickly traveled to Neriak, and after reveling in the delight of being more powerful than I, began to deliver some of my once gained power back to me.  After hours of painful resurrections, I once again held the power that was once mine.  Yet I was not as powerful as before, the Priestess Faentriel could only restore me to the 64th rank, a mere Grave Lord.  I would have to once again regain my status of Dread Lord by smiting my enemies and grinding them into the dust.  After thanking the Lady Faentriel for her patience and time, I then traveled to the forest outside and set about slaying the wolves and spiderlings for a skin and some silk from which to make a small bag to hold the necklace.  Using the skinned pelt of wolf, I fashioned the silk into a decorative thread and sewed up the small bag.  Traveling back to the bank, I asked Antian F'Lok to see my account.  Rummaging through my various bags in the bank, I found what I was seeking, the boughs of mistletoe that my wife had wrapped up with a gift of enchanted adamantite ore for me so long ago...<br>
<br>
Tallonar comes back out of his reverie at the shifting of Didi in their bed and after taking one last glance at the shimmering emerald bound within the necklace, carefully places it within the bag, wrapping it in the boughs of mistletoe and setting it on her dresser for her to find in the morning.  Smiling happily to himself he makes his way to the bed and his wife and slips in next to her, waiting for the morning to come.<br>

She'd gone to sleep before him, as usual, and hadn't woken up when he slipped into bed.  Also as usual, she awoke before him, and slid quietly from the bed.  Tallonar muttered and rolled over onto his back, but settled back into sleep. <br>
<br>
Walking softly to her study, Didi removed a small bag and a package from her desk, and returned to her husband's side.  She smiled at the stern lines of her husband's face, now so many years more careworn than the day they married, but every line familiar and accounted for, the burdens shared and lessened between the two souls bound as one.<br>
<br>
She sat down on the bed beside Tallonar, lips curling in affection at the familiar form beside her.  The silk sheet had slipped down to expose his bare blue chest, and strands of soft white hair brushed his collarbone.  She placed the large, flat package on his dresser for him to open once he awoke; a small bag on her own dresser caught her eye as she passed and made her raise an elegant white eyebrow.  <br>
<br>
Putting down the small bag she held, she paused to investigate the gift left by Tallonar.  Her breath caught at the sight of the pendant inside, glowing with a life of its own.  She unwrapped it carefuly from the mistletoe, smiling in memory, and carefully fastened it around her neck, where it lay warm and almost alive to the touch against her breast.  She could only imagine the cost of such a gift ... but a cost far less than the value she placed on it.<br>
<br>
Picking up her own present to Tallonar she turned back to the bed to find him watching her with sleepy eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You like it?&quot; he smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You silly, silly man ...&quot; she shook her head with a smile. &quot;of course I do, it's as wonderful as you are, and I shall treasure it, just as I have treasured my husband all these years.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tallonar smiled, relieved, and she moved to join him on the bed, swinging a leg over his to sit astride his knees as he lay on his back.  &quot;Close your eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tallonar obediently did so.  <br>
<br>
Holding the bag in one hand, she removed the rose tied to the bag's drawstring, and ran the petals softly over his face, letting him breathe in the sweet fragrance of the flower.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that scent...&quot; he murmured, memories flooding back.  &quot;A rose ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;...of Firiona,&quot; Didi finished.  &quot;Very rare indeed, and risky to obtain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You carried those roses on our wedding day, I remember,&quot; Tallonar smiled, opening his eyes.  &quot;I was so nervous, I do not recall half of what was said, but I remember that scent filling the small chapel.&quot;<br>
<br>
Didi smiled, slightly surprised he remembered.  &quot;A rose of Firiona, then, to symbolize the love and the vows that unite us, and gives us the strength to fight and the strength to hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
She lay the rose aside and tipped the bag, spilling handfuls of smooth stones across Tallonar's chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;A dozen essences of shadow, one for each month in a year, symbolizing all the years of devotion we've shared.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tallonar chuckled.  &quot;And how many of those years did you spend collecting these for me, as I was learning to smith?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't remind me,&quot; Didi replied with a mock shudder.  &quot;But it was worth every minute just to give them to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Picking a few brightly sparkling stones from amongst the dark ones, she poured them into her husband's hand.  &quot;A dozen blue diamonds, one for each month in a year, to symbolize the years together still to come, and the eternal bond we share.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tallonar blinked at the bright gems mixed with the dark stones, and smiled speechlessly at his wife.  Didi reached into the depths of the bag and drew out one final gem.<br>
<br>
&quot;And, an essence emerald, containing my own life's essence.  Our life's essence, I should say - see how they pulse and flicker as one?&quot;  She held the unset gem beside her necklace, and both watched in fascination as the light of the two gems waxed and waned in exact unison.  &quot;I have not had it set - I thought perhaps you might like to set it yourself in the pommel of your sword.&quot;  She placed the warm stone in Tallonar's hand, and he folded his fingers around it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/misc/anniversarygift.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
&quot;The rest of your gift is over there, when you are ready to unwrap it.&quot;  Didi carefuly replaced the smooth stones back into the bag, and set it carefully aside with the rose. &quot;But perhaps it can wait a little longer...&quot;  She bent forward and kissed her husband firmly on the lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;Happy anniversary, dear!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
((ooc - it has been one RL calendar year as of today since Tallonar and Didi were married in Neriak by Lord Gray.  She did carry a Rose of Firiona down the aisle - supplied by Maladominus - and it was caught by Lythene at the end of the ceremony (after a slight scuffle with the Slaaz, who spent the entire ceremony lying feigned in the aisle).  Tallonar was just beginning to learn to smith adamantite cultural armour when they married.  One week Earth time = 9 months Norrath time, so Didi and Tallonar have in fact been married almost 40 years in Norrath time.  They have three children, all adult now and out studying on their own.  There is one more part to this present to follow, it will be ready on Thursday.)) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
