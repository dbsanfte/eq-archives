I'm sure you learned your lesson out of this Donjira, dont ever explore without consulting a spoiler site.  I used to go everywhere in the dark but now I have maps all over my desk and know exactly where most traps are (except for falling in the jail in Najena like 5 times, good thing the door is bugged so I could get out and find a key for later.)  It's not very Rp'ish, but hey, I'm sure you understand the feeling of losing your corpse and not knowing what to do, but I guess Verant doesn't promote exploration to those who aren't rich or in a large guild.<br>
<br>
Props to those who helped, you're some good people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uevangelinanife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evangelina Nife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 424<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 8:50:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/allencraig1/Syll4.jpg width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My most humble and grateful thanks.</span><hr size=1> If Verant made a pen &amp; paper RPG, it would probably look like this...<br>

Have some advice?</span><hr size=1> Maybe this is a little off topic, but I have a paranoid fear concerning the Hole.  I know that when you go linkdead, if you're moving, your character keeps moving in the same direction for a while.  Obviously if you go linkdead while you're running the ledge to or from the Paineel lift, the chances are you'll step right off the side.<br>
<br>
What happens if this happens?  I don't think you can zone while linkdead, but if you log back in and find yourself in mid air directly over the Hole, the end result is going to be the same anyway.  Or does it end up teleporting you to the zone's default coordinates?<br>
<br>
Anyhow, though I respect what the Hole brings to the history fo Paineel and all, I think it's a little crazy putting a deathtrap of that magnitude in a newbie starting city.  Hold the key a little too long, or expect your Levitate spell to function normally as you explore the area about the Hole, and you're dead.  Not only are you dead, but you're dead at the feet of a nasty NPC in the middle of a high level dungeon with living and unliving creatures.  Recovering your corpse likely involves enlisting the aid of a high level necromancer... a problem particularly on this server with alignment restrictions... though you can get around those if you're willing to abuse a bug.  To me, that's a penalty that's just a little too steep for making a simple misstep.  There's nothing about the history and relationship between the Hole and Paineel that would have prevented the design from being a little more forgiving. <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT><BR>

Have some advice?</span><hr size=1> Still, I'm glad your story had a happy ending, Donjira.  If you had fallen in a week or so later I would have been able to help you out since the same thing happened to a member of our brother guild and I logged onto a friend's character (Mage of Brell) snuck in and grabbed his body.  It does work, ladies and gents.  My friend was so intrigued by it he made me teach him how I did it, now he's willing to pull anyone out of the Hole.  Hopefully it doesn't happen anytime soon, but I suppose if you need out, look for Animusumbrae in game and he'll probably help you out.  He's a crazy oddball, since I had nervous fits after my run-in with the undead down there *giggle*  At any rate if anyone else falls into the Hole, look for him (or me I suppose since I know how it's done as well) and we'll get you out as soon as we can.  Very intriguing.  I don't mind the death trap part of it too much, but putting a death trap you can't get your body out of because the zone is Level 45+ is a completely different story. <p>Qilae Aiae'Azhu Kickingwolf - Circle of Sisters<BR>

This is evidence exhibit #1 that proves dark elves should simply rule over Norrath and allow the weak to die and the hateful and sinful to prosper.  Only someone who doesn't follow evil and hate could let this happen.  All hail the Father.   <br>

I thank you all for your kind comments. I was indeed lucky to find that there are good people on the FV server because losing your corpse here means you may never see certain items ever again unless you can find a low level to hunt the pieces for quests for you while you hope that they are not no drop.<br>

The mage was a worshipper of Brell.  Brell worshippers aren't KOS to all those nasty elementals that are in the Hole.  And the giant rats can't see through invis (But the elementals do, so you can't have a non-Brell worshipper do it).  So he invised and dropped down to the area where the bodies land then dragged it up.  Aside from having to skirt around the undead briefly it was a pretty safe trip.  Just have to be able to get the person who died inside the hole long enough to grab their corpse and then get out.  Enduring breath is very helpful for that part, but just for going in he didn't really need it since he's a gnome and slips through cracks very easily.  The plan still depends upon a Brell worshipper with some method of invisibility.  Wouldn't need it if not for the rats, but we can't have everything.  I developed the opinion that the Hole is really a very evil place, and an enchanter's worst nightmare from my trip down there.  Still, that method is much cheaper than having to have your corpse summoned. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwyntercrystalbow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wynter Crystalbow</A> at: 1/5/02 1:36:33 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=884.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=884.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=884.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=884.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=48><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=884.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=884.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=884.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
