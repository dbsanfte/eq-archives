<br>
Early predictions! You heard it here first. <br>
<br>
Rupert will be kicked off mid season, when they all realize he's a huge threat.<br>
<br>
One of the lesser known people will win. I am prediciting Rob Mariano or Shi-Ann. They'll fly under the Radar. Or Kathy.<br>
<br>
Anyone else watching?<br>

Saboga Tribe (Rupert's) seems a little weak physically in comparison to the other two.<br>
<br>
Rudy has a lot of grit, but he's like 75, he's not that strong anymore.  It's been 6 years or so since he was on Survivor 1. <br>
<br>
Rupert's tough, of course, but back to back survivors have to be taking their toll on him physically.  <br>
<br>
And if you compare the women in the other tribes -vs- the women in Saboga... yeah...  the other tribes' women look like body builders.<br>
<br>
I'm predicting a string of Saboga losses until just a few are left.  I think Rupert, Rudy, and that guy from Survivor Africa will become allies, but I also think they'll have some difficulty winning challenges and may have to visit tribal council often.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering what's gonna happen with the water / fire situation too.  Everyone's so dehyrdated, maybe the tribe that just breaks down and drinks the unboiled water will have an advantage... or maybe they'll have diarrhea... we'll have to see.<br>

I think you couldn't be more wrong about Rupert.<br>
<br>
The advantage these people have is knowing who is trustworthy who is not, as based on watching the other Survivor shows.<br>
<br>
I think the trustworthy people will bond together with each other immediatly, and Rupert would certainly be among them.  The liars and cheats would have to come together to counter this, but it would be difficult since they all know each other to be a bunch of liars.<br>
<br>
Rob Mariano?  <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:x-large;">ROB MARIANO?!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->  The only person with less of a chance then Rob M to win the whole thing is Tina, and that's cause she's already gone!  Rob is, without a doubt, the single STUPIDEST person ever to have been on survivor.<br>
<br>
In a Boston Accent - &quot;Hey.  Look at me.  I'm like da godfather... I says who stays and who goes.  Amber's a hottie, and she'z all ova my john.  I got her wrapped around my finger.  I own dis island.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think the other survivors (aside from Amber, most nieve person ever) will see through Rob as if he were glass, and smash him just as quickly.<br>
<br>
My predictions for winners?  Hmmmmm.  Rupert, Colby, Tom, and Kathy.  Maybe Shii Ann, but I'd consider her a long shot.  Like I said, provided they can make it to the merger, I think the honest people will band together quickly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leanisidhe>Leani Sidhe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/04 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Survivor All Stars!</span><hr size=1> Just for the heck of it, Leani Sidhe's breakdown of all the survivors!  The odds are looking at this from the standpoint that the honest people band together, but I will note that anyone I rank as &quot;high&quot; due to being trustworthy is a high risk as well.  All the liars and manipulators have targets on these people, and some could go early if luck falls against them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Name - Chances of winning - Strenghts/weaknesses</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Alicia</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - medium - She's physically strong, but that will hurt her more than help.  She is way too bossy and confrontational, so people will vote her out to shut her up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Amber</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - low - She can fly under the radar with the best of them, but she does not own a single brain cell.  Her only hope is having someone else pull her the entire way, which is unlikely, since she has the greatest chance of being used and manipulated, and her puppetmaster will throw her away when she is done being useful.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Colby</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - high - Physically and mentally strong.  Very personable and kind.  Very trustworthy.  He can do it all, outplay people in the mental and physical game and get the people he's beating to like him.  His weakness is that he is a major threat, so people would want to gang up on him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ethan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - medium - Like Colby-lite.  Strong physically and mentally, and very nice and friendly, but not as much as Colby.  This can help, since people will go for Colby first.  His weakness is, really, that he's already sided with the wrong person (Tina) and that he's already won.  People might not like a two time winner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jenna L</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - low - No obvious strenghts.  Not strong, not exceptionally manipulative, too loud and bitchy to fly under the radar.  Weakness, too bitchy.  I don't think anyone likes her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jenna M</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - medium - Despite being a winner, she can still fly under the radar.  Her sex appeal and how she can use that to get close to others is her biggest asset.  How she ever won the Amazon, I don't know.  I still have strong feelings saying that season of Survivor was staged to have her win.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jerri</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - low - She's a bitch.  She has no chance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kathy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - high - She is not physically strong, and this is a strenght.  She is not a threat.  She has great potential to be under the radar.  Top that off with her being honest and trustworthy, and she's a frontrunner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Lex</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - high - Very smart, very manipulative, but he can still get other people to see the &quot;nice guy' vibe.  He's a major threat to everyone, and his biggest asset is that he can make sure no one else sees it.  I can't believe I forgot to list this guy in my previous post.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Richard</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> -  low - He's the first winner.  He's the survivor icon.  Everyone knows he's a manipulative jerk.  People will be gunning to get him off quickly, and he won't find too many places to hide.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rob C</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - medium - Very smart and manipulative.  Not a physical threat, so he might be overlooked.  His weakness is a flaw in his smarts, that he couldn't lie right to save his life  On Amazon he screwed up about twenty times by being too open.  If he's learned how to lie well in the meantime, he'll become a major threat as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rob M</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - low - Total baffoon.  Arrogant, sexist, phyisically weak, and stupid to boot.  No chance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rudy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - medium - Very trustworthy, easily likeable (even when he says stupid things people still like him)  He's like your grandfather, no matter what he does, you like him.  His major weakness is his age and is the only reason I knock him down to medium.  Can he last the whole time?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rupert</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - high - Everyone knows he can be trusted and no one but Colby comes close to matching his strenght.  Both things work strongly against him, as liars will gun for him and everyone knows he can win immunity at any time.  Rupert is far too trusting as well (why did he take Jon back TWICE?!) and this could kill him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Shii Ann</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - medium - Nice, friendly, could fly under the radar, but I see no overwhelming strenghts.  To win, I think she will have to ride the coattails of others.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Susan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - low - Lazy and bitchy.  No chance.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tina</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - none - She's already gone unless they bring people back like last time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tom</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - high - Easily likeable.  Trustworthy, useful to both liars and honest people.  He's hardly a phyisical threat, so he's not a major target.  He's subtle enough to fly under the radar, but strong enough of a player to not have to ride coattails. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leanisidhe>Leani Sidhe</A> at: 2/2/04 4:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=smallcutepuppy>smallcutepuppy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 915<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/04 5:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Survivor All Stars!</span><hr size=1> I hope Richard gets mauled by a shark.

BTW, those were gut picks, I've sat down and thought out my winners.<br>
<br>
Here are my picks.. BY TRIBE. I will pretend that they never merge, just for the sake of the order in which I think everyone would get kicked off. These will be good up until the merge, with which I'll make another post later.<br>
<br>
Order goes from First Kicked until Last<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chapera:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This is a hard one. All my picks rely on whether Susan gets a brain disease from drinking the damn water. I'll assume she stays healthy.<br>
<br>
Rob M: He will piss off too many people. He's already started, and he trusts Amber too much too early. <br>
<br>
Alicia: The scales will even back out with Rob gone. I could flip this pick with Rob, these two will be first two gone.<br>
<br>
Susan: She will be gone early. She is already rubbing people the wrong way, but she's not seen as much as a threat as Rob M/Alicia are. <br>
<br>
Tom: You'll see why in a second<br>
<br>
Amber: Rob C is done with her at this point. Rob C is one of the best players Survivor has ever had, and I don't think everyone realizes this. Rob C will gather the trust of Amber and Tom, and dump tom first as he is more of a threat than Amber. Rob C is a phenominal player.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
Rob C </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->to win Chapera<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>
Saboga</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
As has been mentioned, this will be the most violitle tribe. Not enough strength, even with Rupert there. They won't last until the thinking puzzles, which they would do well at.<br>
<br>
Tina: Obviously<br>
<br>
Ethan: Jenna makes a very valid point about past winners<br>
<br>
Jenna: Because Jerri is not dumb, she is in fact very smart, and VERY eger to stab anyone in the back. Rupert and Rudy will realize this, get her on their side, and bye bye Jenna. Jerri will go along with it, with the knowledge that she can convince Rudy to go with her against Rupert, as Rupert is the greater threat.<br>
<br>
Jerri: She will overestimate her relationship with Rudy, who will stay true to his word with Rupert.<br>
<br>
Rudy: The age will become a factor, and Rupert will become ultimate Sabago survivor.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rupert</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will win Sabago<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mogo Mogo</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This one, I realize now, is the trickiest. Forget Chapera. Only because Shi Ann is much more tricky than people give her credit for, and she realizes the brilliance of taking Richard Hatch to the final two. That plays a key role in my predictions.<br>
<br>
The women will try to form an alliance against the men, as seen earlier. Now, will Richard go with the women, as he's practically one himself, or will Shi Ann vote with the men, to assure her alliance with Richard. I think the latter.<br>
<br>
Jenna: She is a past winner. At some point her beauty will piss off Shi Ann or something. I don't know.<br>
<br>
Colby: He's too much of a threat. At this point Shi and Richard have everyone in their control, and point out easily that if they don't get rid of Colby before the individual immunities, they are all sunk. He's nice and a good player, but he's the biggest threat Survivor has ever seen.<br>
<br>
Lex: He is the the next biggest threat, and Kathy will go with Shi Ann and Richard knowing this full well<br>
<br>
Kathy: The alliance will hold<br>
<br>
Richard: Its a toss up, and will never get to this point, but she has it in her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Shii Ann</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to win Mogo Mogo<br>

Amber<br>
Big Tom<br>
<br>
From THAT list.. hmm.<br>
<br>
I'll ponder on this more later. One thing I think we will see this time around. Some big twists we haven't thought of yet (a 16 person jury?), and I bet that they get rid of big threats early, instead of dragging them along to do grunt work and win challenges. These are the best of the best.<br>

I agree, Rob C is a very, very strong player.  But he messed up SO BAD last time, and I don't know if he realizes it to recover.<br>
<br>
He had the opportunity in Amazon to play both sides.  To make both sides think he was with them and only them.  But, repeatedly, he opened his mouth and admit to lying.  He could have gotten away with it all if only he didn't turn himself in.<br>
<br>
If he has learned this and dealt with it, I agree, he'll be tough to beat.  I have little doubt he will steal Amber and Tom just as you said, but I think once Tom hits the merger, he doesn't need to worry about Rob C anymore, because Tom can make friends with anyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaspfv>Gasp FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AKA Brevis</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/04 5:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Survivor All Stars!</span><hr size=1> Check out the Fantasy Survivor game on the official Survivor site:<br>

<br>
Jerri vs Colby: This one will be Sweet. Scorned Scorned Scorned.<br>
<br>
Ethan vs Lex: They are friends, but Lex has always been resentful because he really could have won Africa. It was released after the show was over that one of the last challenges, a trivia one, had a mistake, in which Lex should have won. If that had happened he would have had immunity, and the last suvivors would have been all switched around. Lex is the most bitter of losers, as he had the biggest chance and was cheated.<br>
<br>
Susan vs Richard: I happened to catch these two on a celebrity... Dog eat Dog or something. No love lost between these two.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Ethan will last long enough to face off against Lex, but that'd be great.<br>
<br>
Ok, let's make bets on Fire first.<br>
<br>
Richard is the only one there who can make a fire, but has no desire. Kathy is wearing freaking glasses, and I think soon they will realize this and use the lenses to make fire.<br>
<br>
I predict Mogo Mogo. Call it a gut feeling.<br>

<br>
I agree.  Mogo Mogo.  With Lex and Colby's work ethic, I think it will happen here first.  Kathy really had glasses?  Man, how can they overlook that?  (How did I overlook it though?)  Richard probably won't ever help, and I think he's just talking trash to the camera in saying he could if he wanted.<br>
<br>
Chapera will have fire last, if they get it at all.<br>
<br>
Does one team winning a reward challenge and being given fire count?  I don't think so.<br>

That's the funny thing.  Survivor did so well that it spawned the whole &quot;reality show&quot; thing here big time.  There were other reality shows before it (like the Real World), but they didn't have the mass appeal that Survivor did.  So in that sense, it's been an easy show to hate because of what it did to prime time television.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>But</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... the show is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I love it.  My wife hates me because I forced her to sit down and watch Survivor: Pearl Islands with me and she's become a fan.<br>
<br>
The tye-dyed guy with the beard is Rupert.  He's the coolest person who's ever been out there.  He only made it a little over half-way because he was way too honest / trusting, but he just kicks ass.  He's an outdoorsman in the way people who just like rolling around outdoors are... not the hyped up $300 hunting boot kind, but the taking care of injured snakes and feeding his whole tribe with all the fish he brings in kind.  He's great <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The scary hairy naked guy is Richard Hatch.  He's the winner of Survivor Season 1, and exemplified the whole scheming thing.  He went into the first season with a game plan when everyone else was noobies and he kicked their asses.  He's also an arrogant naked slob if you haven't noticed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And hey, Kuladen, you say Rob C was one of the best survivor players ever... I wholly disagree.  He had an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>excellent</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> plan for getting to 3rd place... and 3rd place gets you nothing.   At the end of Survivor Amazon, Jenna and Matthew are both lying and saying he deserved the spot because he played so well... bullshit.  If he had played so well they wouldn't be asking that question because Rob woulda been in the final two.  Consider the fact that Matthew THREW the final challenge... HE INTENTIONALLY LOST IT... and he made it to the final two... that shows you how bad Rob's plan for getting all the way was.  If he plans on doing the same thing as last time, I predict similarly that he will make it far into the game, but will have no shot whatsoever at the final prize. <br>
