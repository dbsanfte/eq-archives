Now, apply this to the following situations (all players are very green to you in these scenerios):<br>
<br>
1) Someone is lost and needs directions<br>
2) Someone has pulled to many things in a battle and needs a little assistance.<br>
3) A Red-NPC is attacking someone and asks for help.<br>
4) Someone needs a Sow/Res/Locate Corpse, etc because they died.<br>
5) Someone pulls a train to a zone filled with greenies and you de-rail it.<br>
<br>
Now, these are all acts of &quot;mercy&quot; and most of us routinely do them. When it comes down to it, this is twinking. The players involved did not have to live with the consequences of thier own actions.  This includes the potenial deaths of the other greenies due to a train. If we left them alone, then the consequences might teach them a lesson they would not repeat. Now, for me the game would not be as fun, but hey - no twinking.<br>
<br>
I like to help people. I like to find a lowbie who is killing theings and give them items I was going to foist onto vendors. I like giving presents to guildmates. I would argue with you day and night that these are all the same as any of the items in scenerios 1-5. The effects may last a bit longer, but not in the long run. I will agree with you on the undersirability of a complete outfitting of a newbie in high level gear, but that is just my own personal weakness allowing hyprocisy to grip me. <br>
<br>
Sometimes EQ is too much like life itself. Some people are born into rich household, some are born into poor ones. Some people take advantage of youth and beauty to gain wealth while others use the brains and skills. Some languish in the newbie pits and whine for handouts. Still, EQ is a game and life is not. Enjoy EQ, try not to sweat the stuff you cannot control.<br>

<br>
First off, I think some twinking actually enhances the roleplay aspect of the server.  <br>
<br>
Example 1)  You re-roll and give your gear of 25 lvls or so to your new character.  Sarhea did something like this.  Her Ranger was converted to Evil, and rerolled as a warrior keeping her gear.  So now by some of your estimates she would be a twink and perhaps disdained without even asking why she has the gear she did at early levels.<br>
<br>
Example 2)  You get lucky.  Say you kill pinzin in qeynos hills in your early teens and she drops a Glowing Black Stone.  Random high level caster wants it and trades you 3kpp worth of gear for it.  Are you a twink?  No you just won the lottery, in my book.  But a number of you would judge this player a twink and not bother asking....<br>
<br>
Example 3)   Favors for the powerful.  Lots of things on this server needed for quests are only available in certain level ranges due to TLC.  If a high level player wants something like this that they may have missed, or not even known that they needed, they have to buy it from a lower level character.  Moderate generosity from a high level character can be extreme riches to a lvl 10 or 20 player. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, Where is it written that EQ is a commune?  Why does everyone have to start in the same abject poverty and work their way up, wearing only what they loot, scorning gifts.  What if you want to roleplay a prince of the realm out sowing his royal oats?  A rogue who is the son of a rich merchant and absconded with the family jewels when he left town?   What if you are Bilbo, and find the ultimate ring of power while stumbling around in the dark?  what if you are on a mission for your temple and they equip you for your journey?<br>
<br>
I try and judge players by how they play not what they wear.  There are many reasons that I consider valid to have better gear than you might have obtained on your own.  Some people are just better at trading for example.  Game knowledge helps a lot as well.  I guarantee that 2 players of lvl 20, one who just started and one who has played for 3 years on five servers will have different gear, and the experienced player will have much better gear. <p>Lorec <br>

<br>
I give away stuff all the time. Hides if someone is doing tailoring. Food, just because I can. Non-Magical weapons. Just about all the junk I pick up that I don't have a need for. Any crafted items that are surplus.  I am more than happy to share. Especially with fellow barbarians. I have a fondness for my own kind. I think I would put a limit on magical items. I personally think acquiring a magical weapon, armor, spell is an acomplishment. I don't want anyone to hand me a magical weapon or armor I did not actually participate in the killing of or questing for. The only exception is TLC limited items that I have already gone over the limit to acquire. Then I am ready to pay hard cash for those items. <br>
     As far as Twinkers that have gifted equipment, I am indifferent to them. I feel somewhat miffed that they have better stuff than me at the level I am at, but I know I earned everything I have. That gives me pride in my character and his accomplishments. The game bottom line is about the person behind the screen. If they get more enjoyment out of getting more powerful items given to them, well then that is  their business. My game is all about accomplishing what I want the game to be for me. In my case, I am all about the quest. I do all the quest I can. So I feel good when I get a quest done.  The items I earn through the quest are the things I want to show off and use.  <br>
       So I don't mind if somebody examines me. I got all my stuff by &quot;sweat equity&quot;. Take a look. I may not impress anyone, but I feel good about Lasonta. <br>
