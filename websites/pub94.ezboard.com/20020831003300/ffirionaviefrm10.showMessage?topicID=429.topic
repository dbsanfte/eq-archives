It was dark, broody and smelled of dripping blood.  However, much of that appeal was lost on him today, as he sat by his desk, in a room half filled with tiny, non-human bones that a few Fier'Dal slaves were attempting (and failing, what a pathetic race) to clear up.<br>
<br>
He took up his writing quill and paper, and began to scribe:<br>
<br>
&quot;Today has been one of the strangest days I've ever seen in a long time.  Some time ago, a young and very attractive female necromancer-in-training consulted me about being allowed to practice her art with the blessing of the guild.  I reviewed her lineage and concluded that while not being anything special, she would serve our purposes.&quot;  He sighed, tapping his fingers on the table.  &quot;I should have consulted my records in greater detail.  Had I done the proper research, I'd have realized that she had a particular part of her bloodline that should have sparked an interest in me.  She's an Ussdeth'auix.  That fact will cause us considerable problems in the future.&quot;<br>
<br>
A slightly feeble smile edged slowly onto his lips.  &quot;She progressed quickly, fighting small insects and snakes with a vigor and general bounciness that I've never been before.  She has the most elaborate little routines for casting spells that normally I would suspect would cause her problems, observing her combat.  However, when she accidentally managed to fell one of those Leatherfoots that roams so close to Neriak in one spell while aiming for a snake, I realized she was exceptionally gifted.&quot;  The Teir'Dal tapped his hands on the desk again.  &quot;I asked her if she could demonstrate her ability at raising the dead.  So she did.&quot;  He began muttering something to himself.  &quot;I should have known better.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have never seen anything like it.  She started to cast the spell, willing the dead to rise out of the ground, literally dancing in circles around a spot.  When the ground began to move, I first felt elated.  My elation rapidly turned to disappointment, then annoyance, as she proclaimed with quite considerable joy that 'I've summoned my first little bone thingy!'  I remember staring at some stupid little creature, remembering it vaguely from a human newspaper I once read.  A pidgeon.  She had summoned a pidgeon.  A dead, skinless, five year old corpse of a pidgeon.  This was my second mistake.&quot;<br>
<br>
He placed his head into his free hand and began to mutter incoherantly.  &quot;Apparently, in life, Innoruuk blessed the common pidgeon with absolutely nothing.  There is a reason for this, which I now know.  I tried to unsummon this pidgeon and get her to do it properly, but try as I might, her little pet pidgeon would not budge.  Quite how such a young necromancer could produce a creature that even I could not put to rest, I do not know.  I asked her to unsummon it, but when she tried, she destroyed every manifestation in a three mile radius.  Including my own faithful servant, my Emissery of Innoruuk, Gonanab.  Yet this pidgeon remained standing.  So, it was with a heavy (and cautious) heart that I decided to let her demonstrate her skills to me while I worked on recalling my pet.  This was mistake number three.  Apparently, when rid of it's worldly bonds, the common pidgeon undergoes a miraculous change.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Simply put, this pidgeon killed everything offensive in a three mile radius in the space of twenty seconds.  It put a hole in at least twenty trees, smashed through Neriak's gates, killed our own ghouls  and generally made a nuisience of itself.  Then it flew back, straight through Gonanab and settled on a tree.  My spectre instantly disintegrated.  Again.  I could think of nothing to say.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I remember her charming little face grinning at me, looking immensely proud of this pidgeon.  She asked if I wanted to see some more bone thingies.  I was too speechless at the time to actually reply with 'For the Hate of Innoruuk, NO!' so she did.  She lost concentration halfway through the spell and wandered off into Neriak, skipping through the gates, planting a kiss on both of the cheeks of our guardsmen and disappearing into the shadows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When I passed the gates, glowering at the two swooning guards that had watched the young apprentice enter the city, I vaguely considered having her transfered to the wizard's guild.  She has unspeakable talent but she seemed to be quite dangerous.  I never got to finish that thought, because I had to duck behind a rock as an entire swarm of pidgeons swarmed through Neriak's gates, creating holes in stone and steel as they charged through.  Maybe fifteen thousand dead pidgeons smashing Neriak to pieces.  The bones of fifteen thousand pidgeons and about three million pidgeon sized holes in every wall in Neriak are now part of the city's scenery.&quot;<br>
<br>
He sighed.  &quot;We've ordered her sent to Freeport to learn from their people while we rebuild our city.  With any luck, she'll raise a cockatrice and level North Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
Putting away his quill, he glanced at the sodden face of his spectre, floating around looking sorry for itself.  &quot;Come, my pet, we shall go and destroy some Lightbringers.&quot;  The spectre's face brightened as much as a spectre's face could, and it followed it's master through a hole in the wall, shaped curiously in the form of a flock of birds. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A> at: 8/21/02 12:16:20 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=429.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=429.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=429.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=429.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
