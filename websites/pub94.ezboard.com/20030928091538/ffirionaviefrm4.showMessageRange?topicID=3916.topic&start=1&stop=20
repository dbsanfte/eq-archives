<br>
I'm sick to death of seeing people post things like 'No caster should ever have gate memmed if they're in a group'  and 'A caster should never gate out of a battle' blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
What a totally ridiculous sentiment.  If caster can gate out of a group wipeout situation, then by all means they should do so!  If you're going to end up at your bind point one way or the other, I'd prefer it to be dressed and buffed.<br>
<br>
Unnecessary deaths are a drain on the group.  It's one extra corpse to retrieve and resurrect, one more body to heal up, one more person to be buffed.  One more peridot down the drain.  I don't begrudge replacing symbol buffs when a group wipes - don't get me wrong - but I really do begrudge it when someone could have escaped and didn't because for one reason or another, they weren't 'allowed' to Gate.<br>
<br>
I fail to see why anyone who can gate should be 'forced' to stay and die.  At the very least they should feel that they have the right to go to safety if their group is being shredded.<br>
<br>
I totally understand that not everyone has room in their spell lineup to include gate - depending on where and what you're fighting, it may not be practical to have it there.  I also understand that you can't always channel it successfully.  This isn't in any way aimed at anyone who would-if-they-could.<br>
<br>
This is about selfish melees who think they can lay down the law and say that because they can't gate, nobody else can either.<br>
<br>
It's also about casters who insist that it is more noble to die with your group than to escape to safety - despite the fact that they're not the ones stuck with the rez-heal-buff cycle. <br>
<br>
(And yes, I have been in situations before where the casters could have gated, and in fact were told to escape when it was obvious the situation would turn to a wipeout, and instead chose to stay with an &quot;I shall die in your defence!&quot; attitude.  Very noble, very dramatic.   Not really very *nice* though, if you see what I'm saying.)<br>
<br>
Time to realise that they're call 'casters' for a reason.  They cast spells.  Spells to draw in prey, spells to damage it, and spells to escape it.  Despite what melees seem to think, Gate is not there merely to provide easy access to a bank.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes gating out of a situation is not only the most logical thing to do, it can also be the most responsible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khiadra>Khiadra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/03 12:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3916.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Casters who gate out of battles ...</span><hr size=1> Oh, my my.

It makes sense to have one person as the designated evac caller.  Usually, that is a melee who is often in a better position to judge whether the group will wipe.  In my groups, I prefer to be the caller as I am usually pulling and have a good sense of what is or isn't beyond the group.  <br>
<br>
It is lame if someone gates at the first hint of trouble.  Even more lame if you abandon the group (ala Shadowglade).  That is what you are mostly detecting in terms of hostility.  However, if everyone knows that it is a hopeless cause, then by all means gate.  In my groups, I will often tell the casters to gate and try to hold off the mobs as long as I can before I have to feign.  In those situations, as a monk, I am often the only person that survives wipes and I can tell you that doing a cr in a dungeon with two or three geared folks as opposed to just me is *much* easier.<br>

<br>
I dont mind if a wizard or druid evacced, that means everyone made it out.  Sometimes it's better safe than sorry.<br>
<br>
I'm not against turning tail and making for the zone or gating out, when the situation asks for it.  But when the group might be able to make it and THEN you gate out without a word being said.... that's wrong.<br>
<br>
Heck, I used to yell at casters in Karnor's when we called run and they'd dawdle at the zoneline... when I say &quot;run&quot; I mean RUN!  Sitting at zoneline means the dutiful tank will wait til the casters zone out (because a caster with 4 things beating on him gets stunned too much to move.  And the tank has 4+ things on him/her and when the tank zones out, they'll migrate to anyone else standing at the zoneline)... I know the cleric is trying to get a heal off, but just zone, please... that lets me get out that much faster.<br>

Couldn't you find a better use for the spell slot? There is only 8 slots after all. (If bards got gate) and if I wasted one by memming gate at all times, I wouldn't be able to bard properly. <br>
<br>
In any case, if the pull is sooooooooooo bad that the puller is creating an instant train, he shouldn't bring it back to the party - the puller should die before he returns. That's proper. Gating is ok.  <br>
<br>
HYPOTHETICAL: But the reason you gate out is because the puller brings two back, and the enchanter dies, you gate out, leaving your party to die. That sucks. You're a coward. The bard is sitting there backup mezzing, and everyone would've survived. And you gated your sorry cleric ass out. <br>
<br>
This hypothetical situation is based on the actions of a group I was in recently, that succor'd out after the enchanter died. If we didn't have someone who could succor, we would've stayed and faught. If the cleric had gated out, we all would've died. <br>
<br>
All being said, GATE IS VERY SITUATIONAL. And if you get used to having it memorized, it's instinctual to want to use it the second things look bad. That is why people say that having gate memorized is a bad thing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A chardok raid I was in lost over 50% of its members on one clusterfuck and still survived due to wise playing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=llilywillowfyre>Llily Willowfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Canadian Proud<br>

Now that I played a ranger though, I would gladly keep gate up if I had it and run away at every possible chance.

I want no part of any character that is going to gate on me when it gets tough.   When you have 10 mobs and your cleric just died then go right ahead and evac or gate out and that is usually something that only deaths will bring about.<br>

I say don't gate.  The worst you can lose is a few pixels and the reward of actually succeding far outweighs it as a reward.<br>

Instead, I memorize spells that will help my group with the fight.  In a bad pull situation where it looks like my group may wipe, I might be able to save the group by chain casting pets.  Assuming you end up winning, those type of fights are the ones you get a major sense of satisfaction from.  <br>
<br>
I also never mem Gate because inevitably I will Gate out by mistake.  Last week I was in a bad pull situation.  Group was me, a druid and a cleric in Mauvin hallway in Justice.  We had 3 enforcers/punishers all at full health.  The druid told me and the cleric to gate out.  I thought we could win if I chain casted so said &quot;No lets fight&quot;.  I did sit down to mem Gate just in case I was wrong.  Well we ended up winning so we all patted ourselves on the back for a job well done.  I however forgot to delete Gate after the fight.  It happened to be in the same spell slot that I normally put Burnout (pet haste buff) in.  So a few minutes later Burnout wore off on my pet so I hit the hotkey that I have used hundreds of time to cast Burnout.  This was in the middle of a pull where my pet was tanking.  To my horror, I didn't realize I had cast Gate until it was too late.  Fortunately the druid and cleric were able to evac out safely.<br>
<br>
If you get into a bad pull situation and you don't have Gate memmed, then you may want to go ahead and just try to win the fight.  If you sit down to mem Gate, good chance any extra mob beyond the one the main tank is attacking will aggro on you because you sat down.   That combined with the fact I can chain cast pets ususally means I will try to win the fight versus Gating out.    <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

That's me, as well.  Chanters have far too much going on at any one time, given only the 8 spell slots, to be worrying about gate, too.<br>

Normally:<br>
chloroblast (small heal)<br>
turgurs (slow, always loaded)<br>
kragg's mending (aka 1950 point CH)  or torpor<br>
malo  (gets swapped out for a nuke/dot when not needed)<br>
cannibalize4 (was always loaded, now semi optional thanks to c5)<br>
root (unless we have an enchanter)<br>
dmg spell (nuke/dot)<br>
swap slot for buffs<br>
<br>
If I have to have torpor as well as kragg's and malo loaded, it gets fun... usually have to drop anything resembling a damage spell, of course then I get FM and have to swap like crazy in that last slot to be able to nuke a little.<br>
<br>
Having gate in a fixed spot would just make swapping life ridiculous.<br>

Sometimes it is fairly obvious that the group might have survived, if the gate happy casters had stuck around.  And sometimes, a caster will gate at the first sight of more than two mobs.<br>
<br>
    I think the original poster is referring to situation #1 above. And I agree with her 100%.  If it is obvious that there is no chance of &quot;one last nuke&quot; making everything right, if it is plain as day that nothing anyone can do will turn it around, then yes, gate.  Save my mana.  That said.. I don't usually have gate memmed.  If things are going bad... very very bad, I prefer to try to sit down and camp out instead... so I'll still be at the scene of the tragedy.  If feasible, I might head for a local zoneline.  <br>
<br>
 A few people have sidetracked to situation #2.  A &quot;maybe&quot; situation is alot harder to call.  Some prefer to err on the side of &quot;Better safe than sorry&quot;, some take the &quot;No guts, no glory&quot; approach.  Neither is more right than the other,  but they can cause trouble when both approaches are represented in the same group.  If it turns out to big a big problem, I would think that having the prevailing policy decided by the GL would be the wisest course.  If dissenting group members felt strongly enough, they would have the option to leave.<br>
<br>
Situation #3 is what is most damaging to the &quot;gate when sensible&quot; idea, I think.  No one who is sensible wants to get a rep like a certain gate-eager cleric we're recently read about.  And for good reason.  Lenny and I were duoing in Guntak yesterday, when we happened to get 3 blues.  With wise use of root and celestial healing, I managed to keep the adds off of both Lenny and I for the most part, and keep both of us in reasonable health.  Yes, I did get beat on a couple of times, and got low on life.  But I dealt with it.  We finished with both of us at over 80% health, and me with over 30% mana.  Gating at the first time of trouble simply doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
Still, that doesn't mean that the OP is in any way wrong.  The trick is just knowing what kind of a situation you are in, and responding accordingly. <p>-- <br>

Sheesh.<br>
<br>
I only mem gate when I'm about to use it. Otherwise I have no room for it.<br>
<br>
As a druid, if I am in battle my lineup looks like this:<br>
<br>
Dot/Nuke<br>
Dot<br>
Snare<br>
Root<br>
Damage Shield (If Mage is doing damage shield this also becomes changeable slot)<br>
Regeneration/Changeable (dot, Nuke, cure or some other needed buff spell)<br>
Cheal<br>
Fast Heal<br>
<br>
If I do not need Snare or Root (Ie the mobs don't run, or aren't affected by changes in run-speed) Those get switched out for other things that the group may need. <br>
<br>
Gate is not needed. (Yes I know there's no Succor in there, I have a Crucible of Escape -- manaless Succor that ALWAYS works and its hot keyed to a key I can't type by accident <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
<br>
That said I never worry about gating out. Any situation that requires me to gate out, I might as well succor the rest of the group too.<br>
<br>
This reminds me of a raid the other day on Xannamech. A druid somehow agroed our little gnomey guy. Rather than either a: taking a fall and being rezed, or b: letting the chanter mez and mem blur the gnome, she gated. Well, guess what. She had to leave the raid.COTH does not work in PoI and we were too deep in for her to rejoin.<br>
<br>
There's no reason for a druid to have gate memed unless they are soloing.<br>
<br>
Clerics should be trying to heal to the end, and if there is a porter in group, let the porter evac them unless they die, then they can gate -- though I'd be surprised if a cleric had this memed with all the other essential spells required by a group :/<br>
<br>
Enchanters have so many friggan spells that would be much more useful in any situation that I can't even imagine one having gate regularly memed, and if they did, should be shot. I do not have gate memed with my alt enchanter. At level 35, I have so many spells for my lineup that come in useful for my duo partner that it wouldn't make sense. <br>

Here's my group line up<br>
1. Fire based DoT line<br>
2. snare type spell<br>
3.  Magic based DoT line<br>
4. Jolt/DS if I tank or not, unless there's a mage or druid there, or root, because aggro changes to the closest person to a rooted mob, which simplifies aggro, just shove the tank closest to the monster.  (be amazed how many tanks don't want to get close)<br>
5 and 6 are a couple short (less than 10 minute duration) buffs<br>
7. is wolf spirit or a medium duration buff when indoors<br>
8. is my heal<br>
<br>
My solo line up I use even MORE stuff (because I have to cast tons of buffs on myself/load panic animal/load root/load dispell for those DS'ing mobs/and probably something else I'm forgetting)<br>
<br>
And then there's nukes.  Rangers get 3 flavors: magic, fire, and summoned (which when we get them are a lot more efficient than the others, but they're rare in our spell lines, so they lose potency after several levels).  I could load at least 2-3 nukes I'd like to use, like call of flame at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thraallfv>ThraallFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 905<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/03 12:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3916.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~msamuel/frgSthrl.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: It's situational</span><hr size=1> Screw that i am a caster and i say gating out is for the weak.<br>

The difference between a skilled player and your average EQ player is being able to make an ugly situation liveable.  I know there have been many a times when to run would be the easy way out but its a ton more fun to root the 7 adds and kill them one at time with more adds coming mid fight and finishing the epic battle with the whole group at 40% health or less and all the casters out of mana.  I dont know about you but one thing that makes EQ so much fun is the challenge, wheres the challenge in running?<br>
<br>
yeah i am one of those people who would rahter die than gate, but then again i seem to have a knack for dying even in the easy zones. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170394" target="&quot;web&quot;">Thraall Prophet of Justice</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="&quot;web&quot;">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=3916.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=3916.topic&start=41&stop=48>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=3916.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=3916.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3916.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=3916.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3916.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3916.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
