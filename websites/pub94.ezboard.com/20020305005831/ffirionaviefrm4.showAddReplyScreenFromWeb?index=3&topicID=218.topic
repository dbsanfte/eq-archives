how you may feel about your perception of the FV server and some of the people on it.  However there are two things to consider. <br>
<br>
First, these are your perceptions based on your style of roleplay - clearly you &quot;get into it&quot; and quite enjoy it...however I didn't get a How to RP on EQ servers guide with any product I bought from Verant.  Thus, we all have different styles of RP, some of us may have played pen and paper, some may have played Final Fantasy as their roleplay background...and some of us may not wanna RP at all.  FV is a roleplay PREFERRED server - end of sentence.<br>
<br>
Second, you do not own the server, you do not have any special status on the server and you don't have the right to slander or harrass other player because they don't fit your vision.  You're looking at things from one angle my friend - someone in Fire and Fury posts that they got their epic and all you think is they are flaunting, all you can think is that everyone in Fire and Fury...or who doesn't adhere to your ideal of rp on this server is a greedy, powergaming, lewt whore...  <br>
<br>
I'm not a defender of Fire and Fury or any other guild (me and my friends do our own thing on this server) but what I am a defender of is my right to utilize this game, for which I pay a subscription fee, any way that a choose, provided it doesn't violate the user agreement.  <br>
<br>
Qixx posts a very innoffensive message and you railroad it.  Man just chill out and realize that while this may be a game, attitudes like this cause a LOT of problems in this world...and it starts in places like this.<br>
<br>
Live and Let Live,<br>

To be honest I also believe that eventually we will become like that as well.  It starts out with one uber guild, then a second pops up.  Often these two will work together, but then a third shows up and decides they need to farm Venril Sathir for legs and screw the rotation...  What I do think is that this will take a long time on this server.  It took 8 months to get ugly on Luclin, it took a year on Torvonnilous to get real bad.  It could be two years here.  And i think we will never have the population of 60's that most servers do.   Many of us have been in the high end game on other servers and we came here to start fresh.  I am not in a hurry to get to those levels again, and I will never again be a serious raider.  Plane raids  = watching paint dry, like Shintou said.  I think the thing to really get from Shintou on this issue is that a certain amount of vigilance is needed.  We should't and can't bar people from playing here, nor tell them how to play with their money.  But While is FV is the (Roleplaying preffered) server, it really is the (doods discouraged) server and with luck the rulesets will keep out much of the trash. It seems to have worked in the low end game, perhaps it will also in the high end game.  I am bothered by posts that say things like &quot;remove anon&quot;, or &quot;TLC petition&quot; because though painfull this is what really keeps us the way we are.<br>
<br>
Shintou has good points but they can't be enforced.  Do your part to discourage non rp behaviour even if its as simple as a hotkey like this if you can cast Spirit of the wolf....<br>

Here. You can post that so and so got their epic on YOUR homepage and YOUR Message Board.<br>
Thats fine and Dandy.<br>
Here, you are just flaunting.<br>
And you know what? Why should I not think that? I see no FnF member comming out here to calm it down, in fact, I think they are very behind 'Epic Flaunting'.<br>

Sorry. I didn't mean to make it seem that I owned the Server. <br>
This is our server.<br>
Our server, as the Community of Roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Non Roleplaying and Roleplaying just does not fit together. Its like trying to use Legos and Generic Blocks together. It doesn't work.<br>
Non Roleplayers just have to go.<br>
<br>
Fronicia-Vie (Roleplaying Preffered)<br>
<br>
I don't have the acual text with me, but when Verant described the making of this Server.. I remember one single quote<br>
<br>
&quot;...We believe all of our servers are Roleplaying servers...&quot;<br>
<br>
Why did they call FV a (Roleplaying Preffered) server?<br>
Verant doesn't want to admit that Ubers have taken over the rest of their Server Base.<br>
Verant had 100% intention of making this a straight up Roleplaying Server.<br>
That is why. Not because Verant wanted to make this a nice Cozy home for Powergamers.<br>
Anyhow, Why do you not go on ((Well, since I keep bringing it up I minus well)) Innoruuk. See how it is for.. oh.. 2 hours.<br>
Its not a Roleplaying Server.<br>
<br>
This is the Roleplaying server. I don't buy this &quot;Preffered&quot; thing at all. Its just a word to allow Verant not to face the Powergamers on their other Servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't tell people how to RP.<br>
I just want people to RP.<br>
<br>
I, as well, do not want to see ANYTHING change with this Server's Ruleset.<br>
TLC is great, it FORCES you to explore places that you would never go at a Level where it is a Good fighting experence for you.<br>
<br>
The Language Barrier is another thing that is fun to Roleplay with. As is the different Alignments.<br>

<br>
Becase they like you are part of this comunity and I like to hear what is happening in my community and congratulate those that succed at things.<br>
<br>
Yes this server still needs work before it can come into its own and be a great RP server.  However it will be some time before that happens and just becase one or even a few people don't fit a certain mold is no reason to chastise them.<br>

This is still a game.<br>

Shintou, listen to yourself...telling people who don't follow your ethos to leave the server?  Telling them not to allow their accomplishments to be displayed on this message board?  <br>
<br>
I'm quite sure that if you attained your epic (regardless of the method) and all these people were posting &quot;Congratz&quot; messages, that you'd be somewhat happy over it.  <br>
<br>
Maybe you need to start your own game or run your own message board where your Spetznaz officer moderators can quash ideas that conflict with your own.  <br>

I am exteremly proud in helping 3 people get thier epics. <br>
This was a lot of work from a bunch of people over a long time period. So yes, speaking for myseld (not FaF) I am flaunting that we did something very difficult.  No shame here in having pride.  I am exteremly proud of being a part of the first Cleric epic on this server which was very difficult to obtain. <br>
<br>
  I do not agree that this is non-roleplaying behaviour. I (most of FaF) do not try and step on peoples RP toes. I will post congrats on the next epic achieved also, regardless of which guild the member is from. Every person playing this game is thier own hero, if you achieve something grand, be proud and shine. Where in the roleplayers rule set does it say:<br>
Only the humble shall be considered role playing?<br>
<br>
Would you not tell people in real life when your first son is born how proud a papa you are? Acknowleding an accomplishment, and reconizing others pride is called being sociable in my eyes. Roleplaying or real life. If your of the view that pride is wrong,  that is a whole different issue, totally seperate from EQ and roleplaying.<br>
<br>
A lot of what is going on here is  plain and simle:<br>
                      anti-social behaviour<br>

Is it roleplay preferred? Yep, sure it is.<br>
<br>
Does the word prefered mean they absolutely have to? Nope, not at all.<br>
<br>
If folks truly want a roleplay server I would suggest the test server. Great people there. All of them will roleplay back with you if you roleplay with them (most of those folks are GM's, guides, beta folks and some folks that are physically challenged). Low server population too, under 800 as I last saw. Either that or wait for Neverwinter Nights to come out. Then you can create your own world and enforce whatever rules you have in your little ol noggin. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>
