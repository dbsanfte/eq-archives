I am not a Knight.  I am not an Evil.  I am me.<br>
<br>
You are nothing, boy.  Without me you are a fleck of manmeat stuck to the axe of pity.<br>
<br>
I am a Knight.  I am an Evil.  I am Shiden Kaidan.<br>
<br>
You are not, Shiden.  You are hurt and afraid.  But you are not anything more than yourself.  Understand this.<br>
<br>
I am me.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Shiden woke abruptly, the breath catching in his throat.  It was cold in Toxxulia Forest, much colder than he was used to when he slept abroad near Lavastorm or even the Desert of Ro.<br>
<br>
A wood elf slept beside him, snuggled into him for warmth.  Her mouth was open slightly and it looked like a tiny smile played across her lips while she dreamed.  There was a tiny doll clutched in her hands.<br>
<br>
Carefully, so as not to wake her, Shiden slid out from beneath her arm and folded it against her chest, then laid her head down gently on the sandy rock where they slept.  He started to take out his journal to write, but he'd have had to move his gauntlets that were in the way and he was too afraid of waking her.  He left the journal and his armor in the backpack and he picked up his axe and shield and walked.<br>
<br>
His destination was the entrance to Kerra Isle.<br>
<br>
He stopped just inside and looked at them.  Kimaya had refused to take him in because he would not promise to never hurt them.  He'd tried lying to her, but the words died in his throat before he could ever squeeze them out.<br>
<br>
They spotted him then and he grinned.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Love has no place in this world.  It disappoints.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The axe sang in his hands.  The thrill of using the shield when he had no armor to rely on was exhilarating.  The first Kerran fell with a pitiful cry, it never having even touched him.<br>
<br>
The second one was a bit better, and cast spells to aid it, but soon enough it too fell.  Shiden bent and skinned the poor thing, smiling as he took a bottle of milk from its belt.  It must have thought he'd be an easy target, to take a drink along to a fight.<br>
<br>
He held up the catman fur lovingly--he'd have time to dry it properly later, perhaps--but his prize didn't get to be admired for long.  Two more of the catmen sprang at him, calling out curses.<br>
<br>
Shiden was annoyed by the interruption and dropped the first one with little more than a Harm Touch.  The second one fought savagely, enraged at being unable to defeat an unarmored foe.  Shiden thought to end its life, but Kimaya's smile appeared before his eyes.<br>
<br>
He remembered how she had cried when she accidentally killed all of the rats in The Warrens, and how he'd snapped at her in surprise and horror.  He thought of the poor kerran that lay sprawled out in a prison cell, too weak to even stand.  He recalled how the erudite suggested that the catmen and kobolds be allowed to kill each other off.<br>
<br>
Suddenly he felt very sorry for the Kerrans.  They weren't the same as the Sisters that he had killed.  Shiden dropped his shield and axe to his side in defeat, letting the Kerran rip a few holes in his bare chest.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If anything, these Kerrans are like me.  They wish to be left alone.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kill them for hurting you!  Kill them to spite the elf!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Shiden snarled at the kerran and sent Fear recoiling through its body.  As it turned and sprinted off, he walked quietly away, hoping they would not follow and wake Kimaya.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep well, Kimaya Elf.&quot; he said as he pushed the bottles of milk in the sand.  Quietly he lifted his breastplate, his weapons, and his backpacks and carried them all to the boat that sat waiting nearby.  He would return to Shadowhaven tonight, drink an ale, and hope that when Kimaya woke up she would think he had finally been able to enter Paineel and bought some milk, rather than find out what he had done just to spite her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/Thumbnails/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 272<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/3/02 5:06:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=297.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Twilight on Kerra Isle</span><hr size=1> As Shiden first slipped out from her embrace and quietly crept away, Kimaya stayed curled up on the beach.  She was sleeping deeply, her mind busy dreaming of wisps of memories from the evening before.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
~ * ~<br>
<br>
She was in the Warrens to check on them for King Goest, and found Shiden fighting there.  They fought together against the frothing rebellions, the scene suddenly shifting to playing with over a dozen cute rats.  The ground was hard and rough beneath them, so she patted it softly and asked it to please be softer.  <br>
<br>
In an exaggerated, dreamy horror, the ground spewed and heaved forth, leaving her surrounded in an endless sea of countless dead rats.  Shiden spun on her, bringing out his weapon as if to avenge them, but it all blurred away in a wave of tears...<br>
<br>
~ * ~<br>
<br>
A pit fighter called challenge to Shiden, spitting insults that in her dream, Shiden understood.  He bravely went forth, and without aid, barely survived the close battle that sped fast in a blur of kobold fur and Combine steel.  She clapped and declared him a champion, and thought he should have a prize... a wish!  <br>
<br>
He then turned and said he wouldn't wish, she needed to wish for him.  Confused, she tried to open mouth to speak, but couldn't... she couldn't explain that faefriends don't make wishes, cause they wouldn't come true, not for her...<br>
<br>
~ * ~<br>
<br>
They were then on the rocky beach, lightly covered in nothing but sandy dust.  They had been playing some kind of game, and she was laughing when he grew quiet...<br>
<br>
&quot;Love me...&quot; he said, &quot;That is my wish.  If noone else in the world does, and even if someday I tell you that I ha--'  He was interrupted by a sudden fit of choking.  He struggled for breath to continue, &quot;--tell you that I don't love you back...  Love me.  For who I am.  Not for what I am or who I serve.'  He paused.  &quot;That will be enough, I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
She tried to talk again, about how she always had loved him since she first saw him in the desert so long ago and, for right then, all she wanted in the world would be to grant his wish and make him happy...  But though her mouth opened her words wouldn't come.  Instead she slipped with him into the water and shared what words couldn't express.<br>
<br>
The dream rippled, and he was drowning.  He thrashed violently in the slow-moving water, gazing at her with eyes that half-pleaded with her to save him, half-warned her to stay away lest she be killed in his lashing out.  She reached out to pull him to safety, but he was suddenly gone.<br>
<br>
~ * ~<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
She snapped awake, feeling his absence.  She blinked her eyes open and saw some milk left for her, but almost instantly she saw something amiss in the flow surrounding the sand in which it stood.  Something about the bottles looked familiar, and under the lip, there was a fleck of blood.<br>
<br>
As she neared the end of the tunnel she could tell the guards were not at their post, and in the distance she could hear the chanting they used to send a soul onward, and to guide it back home in a renewed body.  She closed her eyes, sending her own support, along with her apologies for yet more harm coming forth through her friendship with hurting souls.<br>
<br>
As she did so, she felt a return connection filled with love and understanding. The spirit said he had learned much about keeping his own balance while defending against the maelstrom of hate that visited his post, and he was stronger for it.  He also said he glimpsed an eye within that hateful storm, one that he hoped she would someday help to see.  She then felt the spirit slipping away, preparing to return again for his next cycle of learning and growth without any blame or regrets holding it back.<br>
<br>
She sighed, knowing her friends there would blame Shiden for his failings no more than they would blame her for loving him despite them.  However, she struggled about whether she should blame herself, for neither the kittymans nor Shiden would have been endangered by her friendship if she hadn't...  <br>
<br>
She paused there at the entrance, wondering if she should speak to the priestess, or simply slip away.  She was tired, and wanted to rest.<br>
