Well, I'm an advocate of the language barrier, but i can now see their point.<br><br>People don't take the time it seems to talk euff.  Take the oportuities to slow down and stop if you see someone you can talk to, this is what opens doors to RP.<br><br>I was in Blackburrow and realy was just going to be in and out (personal reasons that i will not go into, wizard research).  Then I saw a barbarian and a halph elf getting beat up by 3 gnolls, so i cast bonds of force snared all 3 went up and stood by the gnolls and told the barbarian and his friend to have at, it and that i would try and keep the gnolls attention to distract the gnolls long enuff for the barbarian and halph elf to get a killing blow on one or two and even the odds.  (barbarian was low on life)<br><br>Well, after the gnolls were dead I asked them what brought them there to blackburrow and they responded that it was fame and fortune that lured them there.  One thing lead to anouther and we ended up having a great conversation while i snared the ocasional gnoll and chatted with them about how blackburrow was where I had practiced some of my first spells.  All in all I had a great time in those few minutes.  But being the Erudite I am I did not want to over stay my welcome and soon left them.<br><br>Anyway my point is people need to take the time and ask questions and just talk to whoever, never know what could happen.<br><br>Heck now that i think of it, slowing down may just be the key for me to roleplay more and better.  I'm new to roleplaying never realy did it before this server and i'm still learning.  I've always been a beleiver that just becase someone is leveling quickly does not mean they don't roleplay (and i still beleive this).  BUT I think it's EASEIR to roleplay if your not in such a hurry.  For example your sitting in North Karana and waiting to go up to the moon and someone else is sitting there as well kind of like a buss stop in RL.  Now many of us sitting at a bus stop in RL probably wouldn't take the time to chat with the person next to us becase we put up walls and put our selves in our own little comfort zones.  Same thing happens to the 2 people sitting at say the Nk spire or a boat dock.  I think one of the biggest and hardest things to over come will be breaking free of the comfort zone to talk to others and change your goals and plans on a whim to have more roleplay experiances.  <br><br>In our world of tecknology and work, scedules and deadlines, we get in habits of setting goals and rushing to get them acomplished.  Just like we set goals in this game to accomplish certain things.  Perhaps many of us should sit back a moment and well, in a word, &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot;.<br><br>It will take me awile to absorb these thoughts as many are comming to me as i type this, considering how easy it is to get back into old habbits it may take me awile to implament much of this.<br><br>Would be nice if other more experianced roleplayers could actualy start a thread stating what helps them get in a roleplay mood and also STAY in it.  Any tips and advice on ways to actualy play a ROLE would be helpfull as well.  Heck no one has ever as far as I know listed out any standard do's and don'ts becase they are so veried.<br><br>Yes I roleplay every chance i get but I feel many times I may not be looking at an oportunity right in my face becase im in a hurry.  Those 2 in blackburrow i could have helped them by just snaring the gnolls and leaving or snaring the gnolls and waiting to make sure they lived before leaving, but instead took the time to talk.<br><br>If all the people harping about how leveling fast and roleplaying don't go together would have been able to explain it like this, then I could have understood, but know one ever could seem to explaing the WHY.  Well now i think i have a better understanding were they are all comming from.  Can all those who level fast still roleplay and level?  Most certainly.  But will they have as many roleplay oportunities becase they are in such a hurry?  Probably not.  Does that mean they are anti roleplayers in their established habits learned form real life of rushing to do things?  Of course not.<br><br>Now with me does this mean becase i'm a somewhat high level that I don't roleplay? No.  Does it mean I don't take the TIME to roleplay MORE? More then likely.<br><br>I hope some people can make sence of this and perhapse get something out of it.<br><br>Artillis Windruss<br>Wizard of the 44th channeling<br>Follower of the Burning Prince<br>Officer of Clan Werre <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessage?topicID=1134.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessage?topicID=1119.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1136.topic><img src=http://www.firiona-vie.com/images/arfv.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=1136.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1136.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1136.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
