<br>
The king of the Gnomes went on a journey. He was accompanied by his royal court and he brought all his royal bodyguards on this diplomatic trip, to pay homage to the High Elven King of Felwithe, who was his ally at that time. <br>
<br>
The Gnome King had three children, two sons and a daughter, the youngest of them being the princess. Having full confidence in his children, the King set upon his very important journey and left the defense of the kingdom to them and the few watchmen that remained. <br>
<br>
The eldest prince had always been vain and boastful, always claiming that he was the mightiest warrior in the land. He was the heir to the throne, and nothing stood in the way of his ambition.... as well as his vanity. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing can harm the kingdom, for my blades will slice the mightiest of foes!&quot; <br>
<br>
The second prince was equally vain and audacious, claiming that he was the mightiest sorcerer in the kingdom of the Gnomes. He was indeed a powerful mage, and was convinced that his powerful magics will one day inherit the kingdom of his father. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing may invade the lands of my father, for my majick is beyond compare, and my spells shall consume all foes!&quot; <br>
<br>
The youngest child was the king's only daughter, the princess. She was known to be shy and quiet, nevertheless she was the king's favorite. Some say she was a reclusive girl. But beneath this shy and quiet figure was a remarkable talent, for the princess had the brilliance for invention and innovation. She was a tinker, an inventor of sorts, and this was how she spent much of her time. <br>
<br>
Her brothers mocked her as a daydreamer, a bookworm, an oddball. Nothing would ever come of her, they said. This is not to say that she was the only gnome that loved to tinker. In fact, many gnomes in the kingdom enjoyed tinkering as well. Nevertheless, not everyone in the royal court of that time thought that tinkering would always bring practical solutions. Those silly inventions and contraptions would amount to nothing, the royal princes mocked. What a shame that one born of royalty would waste her life like that! <br>
<br>
On the Third Day after the king's departure, a great shadow quickly covered the land. <br>
<br>
Even miles beyond the horizon of the Steamfont Mountains, the great wings of a white dragon loomed.... casting a pall over the land. <br>
<br>
They knew it would arrive. The danger it posed was certain. No dragon of this ferocity had ever threatened the kingdom for over 80 years. To this day, no one was certain who this dragon was. Some say that it was the great wurm Baltanis. Others claim that it could be no other than the bone wyrm Xykansys. Many others were convinced that it was no other than the dragon of gnomish legends, the great white wurm Vorpoxafen, one of the most feared of the steam dragons. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why do my father's people worry?&quot; said the elder prince. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need nothing more than the unwavering loyalty and courage of the watchmen to rally behind my blade, and victory will be mine. Victory will be assured!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Why do you people cower so much?&quot; quipped the second prince. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you not see that this steam wurm is no match for my eldritch genius and powers of sorcery? Rally behind the power of my enchantments, and nothing can harm our kingdom!&quot; <br>
<br>
The princess did not boast a single word. Instead, she immediately set about to tinkering various devices and contraptions. With the scant help of only a few of the royal tinkering assistants, she set about on her task to create various contraptions that would help in the defense of the kingdom. <br>
<br>
The elder prince set forth with his small army of watchmen. <br>
<br>
The dragon came. Curiously, it looked down at the pathetic rabble that opposed its advance towards the gnomish cities. <br>
<br>
The warrior-prince rallied his troops and barked at them with the order to charge! And charge they did. Javelins flew and arrows shot into the air. <br>
<br>
With a single cloud of dragon breath, a great white mist of scalding hot steam engulfed the rag-tag army below. Dozens of the watchmen perished, many of them horribly singed. Seeing the utter devastation inflicted upon his troops, the elder prince quickly broke ranks with his own soldiers. <br>
<br>
He was first to flee, and gave no second thought to his dying men as the great dragon descended upon them to feast on their flesh. <br>
<br>
The dragon paused its advance for the night. For that night, it feasted on the flesh of the vanquished watchmen. <br>
<br>
The next day.... the great dragon advanced again. <br>
<br>
This time, the second prince set forth with his army of eldritch sorcerers. <br>
<br>
The dragon looked down again, seeing the ridiculous attempt to hinder its rampage. <br>
<br>
The sorcerer-prince rallied his troops, and called upon them to unleash all their salvos of magical missiles and conjured bolts of fire! <br>
<br>
But it was for naught, for the great white wurm once again engulfed the entire army with a gigantic ball of toxic steam, of such venom that it quickly burned the skins off the poor gnomes below. Completely surrounded, the eldritch casters panicked and started running amok, sometimes trampling each other, while others quickly perished as they were consumed by the deadly cloud itself. <br>
<br>
Witnessing this devastation upon his troops, the sorcerer-prince quickly cast a spell..... he faded away from the scene of battle. With this cowardly act, he Gated out of the chaos as his spell ported him back home to safety...... leaving all his doomed followers to perish below the marauding dragon.<br>
<br>
The dragon paused its advance for the night. For that night, it feasted on the flesh of the vanquished army of gnome mages. <br>
<br>
The following day..... the dragon advanced again. Finally, the city of the gnomes, Akanon, was in sight! <br>
<br>
Upon reaching the outskirts of the city, the dragon saw the most curious thing it had ever seen in its life. The city itself was greatly fortified, of course. But this was to be anticipated. <br>
<br>
As the dragon advanced closer to the gates of the city, the gates themselves swung open.... <br>
<br>
From the city gates emerged the oddest looking contraption the dragon had even seen. It was made of metal, some kind of steel-hardened contraption.... it was possessed of several long clawed legs like that of an eagle, a long mechanical tail like that of a scorpion, a strong slender body not unlike that of a lion, and a pair of giant wings like that of a great bat! Did this metallic abomination resemble a griffin or a manticore? It mattered not to the great white wurm. <br>
<br>
Although this odd looking creature climbed into the air as agile and swift as the white dragon itself, it was only a fraction of the dragon's own size. <br>
<br>
A fierce aerial battle ensued, the great white dragon dueling the strange mechanical beast in the air.... both lunging at each other like two predators. Raking claws dodged each other, tails slashed and missed.<br>
<br>
And alas, this contraption parried and blocked every attempt the white wurm made to dismantle it. <br>
<br>
Soon enough, many of the gnomes from Akanon had surfaced just beyond the gates. From the ground below, they cheered on their champion, their clockwork defender.... by now it was apparent to everyone that the brilliant princess herself was responsible for the creation of this very odd clockwork creation! But where was the princess herself? No one was quite sure. <br>
<br>
It was an attempt to fight fire with fire. Or rather drake with clockwork drake. For a while it seemed that the clockwork defender would prevail. <br>
<br>
Frustrated, the great white steam dragon veered away briefly. With annoyance, malice, hatred and vengeance in its eyes, the great white wurm decided that it would instead focus its rage upon the defenseless spectators down below!! <br>
<br>
Without so much a warning, the ivory-scaled dragon set forth its deadly breath upon the hundreds of gnomes watching below! There was great panic as many gnomes were quickly consumed in the scorching deadly vapor. Others ran to and fro, as they cried like helpless sheep being chased by a wolf. <br>
<br>
Knowing that the white dragon was capable of raining a continuous spray of its deadly cloud down upon the populace..... the clockwork defender knew what it had to do. <br>
<br>
Flapping its great batlike wings, the clockwork defender quickly lunged towards the dragon again. As the two great winged creatures collided violently -- one made of reptilian scales, and the other scaled of metal -- strong piercing metallic claws latched onto the great white dragon. Their bodies entangled and entwined. <br>
<br>
They wrestled, tumbled and twisted in the air. And then the great white dragon finally managed to crane its neck just right, and with a final exasperated breath, set its breath upon the metallic body of the clockwork beast. <br>
<br>
The clockwork beast was unrelenting, its tight grip on the dragon clawed even tighter. The hot cloud of scalding steam began to burn the very metal of the clockwork contraption. The metallic body of the clockwork started to combust, like a fiery furnace of steel searing and burning anything and everything that touched it. <br>
<br>
Its own body still entwined with that of the clockwork, the great wite dragon writhed in pain and misery, it screamed in agony and horror, realizing that both would perish in one great fiery inferno. <br>
<br>
The gnomes below, barely regaining their wits and composure, witnessed the conclusion of the battle. A fiery gaseous ball of flame began to fall swiftly from the sky.... the entwined and scorched bodies of both the great white wurm and their clockwork defender. <br>
<br>
And with a thunderous crash upon the ground, it was all over. <br>
<br>
A hushed silence fell over the entire land. Most of the gnomes were still in shock, reeling from the tragedy of the white wurm’s invasion. <br>
<br>
Nevertheless, they understood what just happened. The clockwork defender, the contraption made by the Tinker Princess had just won the day, and spared many lives in the kingdom. <br>
<br>
With an austere and cautious manner, the elder watchmen approached the burnt and mangled mess on the ground. The great white dragon breathed its last breath and hissed its last hiss, and its eyes finally shut closed. Still partly conjoined to the burnt flesh of the now-dead dragon was the twisted and burnt wreckage of the clockwork defender. <br>
<br>
Using their long pikes to prod and pry open the metallic wreckage, the watchmen heard a muffled cry just inside the twisted wreckage. Soon they had discovered the mystery behind their metallic champion. The badly crippled and singed body of the dying princess lay trapped inside the clockwork defender. <br>
<br>
All along, it was the princess that had somehow possessed and controlled (some would say ‘piloted’) the great flying mechanical beast that saved the kingdom. Her two brothers rushed to her side as they knelt down and wept, praising her courage and asking for her forgiveness. <br>
<br>
But everyone knew her fate. Just like the great white wurm before her, the Tinker Princess breathed her last. <br>
<br>
The elder watchmen knew it was impossible to pry her badly mangled body out of the wreckage. Her body was never pulled out of the metallic enclosure. The following day, she was buried, entombed in the contraption of her own design as a great funeral pyre incinerated the remains and all the gnomes of the land mourned for their valiant princess. <br>
<br>
From that day forward, the gnomes called her the Clockwork Princess, the Dragon Slayer. And once every three years hence, the people of the gnomish kingdom and the gnomish inhabitants of Steamfont vowed to celebrate a festival in her honor. The gnomes of the kingdom had celebrated many smaller tinkering festivals in the past, but none rivaled the magnificent celebration of Tinkerfest, commemorating the brave sacrifice of their Clockwork Princess. <br>
<br>
<br>
The End. <br>
<br>

Just one comment.  I noticed this and thought you may want to fix it.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you not see that my eldritch genius and powers of sorcery shall be no match for this steam wurm? Rally behind the power of my enchantments, and nothing can harm our kingdom!&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you really mean to say that the wizard knew he would be &quot;no match&quot; for the wurm?  Or did you mean to say, &quot;Do you not see that this steam wurm shall be no match for my eldritch genius and powers of sorcery?&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope to not appear to nit-pick, but I have edited novels for my brother before and still have a habit of speaking out when I see something that might need correction.
