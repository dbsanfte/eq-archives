<br>
Because all things are born capable of love, even if it is buried deep in a dark heart. <br>
<br>
They met in Paineel, the boy and the girl, and they fell in love, though, like many great love affairs, their families and their lives stood in the way of that love. <br>
<br>
She grew up to become a necromancer, though not a very good one, because her heart was not in it. And he grew up to become a shadowknight, which he had the talent for, but not the anger. <br>
<br>
And they both went into the world, and thought of each other. They met when they could, and they shared their love when they could. <br>
<br>
And then one day they discovered the beauty of Stonebrunt Mountains. <br>
<br>
They did not belong there, not in the least; though powerful they were truly cityfolk and not well suited for life in the mountains. But in the peace of Stonebrunt Mountains, they could love each other without reproach, without fear, without hesitation. <br>
<br>
But their kin had caused too much fear for too many. The catfolk of the mountain had long been at war with the lovers' people, and had a bounty on the heads of the heretics. <br>
<br>
And one morning, like so many great love stories, theirs met a tragic end. <br>
<br>
The boy, now a man, went to the river to gather water for cooking. His lover, the girl now a woman, was nearby, singing songs in a tongue that carried the sadness of a race split in half by difference. <br>
<br>
And suddenly, the man no longer heard the singing of his love. <br>
<br>
He found her body, separated from her beautiful face, on the ground at their camp. He cradled that broken body, rocking it, his tears mixing with her red blood, still warm. <br>
<br>
And not long after, the bounty hunters found him. He had just finished burying his lover's body. <br>
<br>
When he saw them, he began to sing, his lover's song, in the language his people spoke before the severing. <br>
<br>
And he fought not with the fear of his god, but with the recklessness of a broken heart. <br>
<br>
He died singing, and knowing that wherever the dead go when they leave this mortal sphere, he would be with his love, and they could love each other. <br>
<br>
Forever. Unconditionally. And without reproach. <br>
<br>
(for broken hearts)<br>

He was not as large as other cubes, but he still took pride in keeping his section of corridors free of litter and debris.<br>
<br>
Without warning, a scream reverberated off his outer membrane, alerting Cuburt to trouble nearby. It was generally the policy of gelatinous cubes not to become involved in the affairs of others, but being unnaturally curious for a protoplasmic being, he couldn’t help but investigate.<br>
<br>
Round a corner, Cuburt’s cilia sensed a girl in the clutches of a reanimated skeleton. All three of his olfactory organelles detected fear in the little girl’s pheromones, so he began to envelop the skeleton with several pseudopods. As the skeleton realized it was being digested, it released the girl and started struggling to free itself. The girl tottered precariously on a ledge for a few moments, but Cuburt’s flagellum was too slow to catch her. He did manage to snag her dress, but he could feel from the inferior weave of the material that it would not hold.<br>
<br>
Helpless to prevent otherwise, Cuburt listened to the girl plummet into a pool of ravenous piranhas. As his mitochondria sprang into life to process the skeleton’s remains into energy he could use, he thought it prudent to form a protective membrane around the little girl’s dress, which was still entangled in his flagellum. ‘Perhaps someone will want this to remember her by,’ he thought to himself. Cuburt was quite fond of keepsakes and deduced that other beings might share his sentimentality.<br>
<br>
No sooner had he enveloped the dress in its own special vacuole and returned to his assigned area, when he felt the vibrations of footsteps approaching. It was an adult human, male, and wearing size 12 leather boots, judging by the nature of the vibrations. He began pushing the girl’s dress to his surface in order that the human might easily reach it.<br>
<br>
“Aha! There’s the foul thing!” cried the human. A sword cruelly sliced his membrane and his cytoplasm began streaming out. Cuburt desperately tried to show he meant no harm by forming a crude face out of two fire beetle eyes and a pair of rat whiskers, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
As the second sword strike pierced Cuburt’s nucleus, he lamented that he would never be able to engage in mitosis. ‘Capricious fates, would that you’d given me large cute eyes and a furry hide to protect me!’ he mourned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 738<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/02 7:49:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cuburt's Demise</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Cuburt desperately tried to show he meant no harm by forming a crude face out of two fire beetle eyes and a pair of rat whiskers, but to no avail.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

His face was wizened with age, the skin around his one enormous eye puckered with folds of skin, from laughing, from crying, from squinting against the sun. <br>
<br>
Despite his age, despite the heaviness in his muscles and the aches in his bones, the cyclops traveled. This was still his world, he thought, and still his world to see.<br>
<br>
He remembered when elves ruled the shoreline, when the Desert of Ro was the Eldarr Forest. When he wandered, often he would stop and become entranced in those memories, illusions covering up the ugly reality that remained. <br>
<br>
Here, I fought the elf-knight Veridyl and won. Here a great dragon laid her eggs, only to find them destroyed by a rival. Here my son died. And here. And here. All my sons are dead, he thinks. But I still remain. <br>
<br>
In the cyclops' pocket, he carried a ring. He knew it was magical, but understood the concept only in the way laypeople understand magic. It holds power. This ring is special, and I don't know why. <br>
<br>
So he carried it. He found the ring on the ground in the Eldarr Forest centuries ago, and kept it because it was pretty. Cyclops are simple creatures and keep very little by way of possessions. <br>
<br>
And though his one enormous eye is still clear and bright, the cyclops is blind to one thing: the ring he carries makes him a hunted creature.<br>
<br>
And so the ancient cyclops wanders, stands hip-deep in the Ocean of Tears, listens to the gulls, and waits for the world to change again. He has seen it change many times. Through one great green eye he has watched history unfold. <br>
<br>
But tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow he will be hunted. And he will die for a chip of gold he pocketed from the floor of a forest that no longer exists. And with him will die the memories of a world since past. <br>

<br>
Welcome to Kimaya's world...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kimaya wasn't hungry.  She had just finished snacking on a juicy piece of fruit, its sweetness still playing about on her tongue.<br>
<br>
She wasn't hunting for food.<br>
<br>
Kimaya wasn't cold.  She was nestled cozily into the folds of the warm scouting cloak she had earned in Katta, her finger gently tracing the neatly embroidered &quot;KS&quot; they had stitched just inside the collar.<br>
<br>
She wasn't hunting for shelter.  Nor did she hunt to protect her own safety.  Once again, she was hunting for the safety of others, and each time she did it she wished it would fix everything so she'd never have to hurt anything ever again.<br>
<br>
She ducked her head as she peered around the corner of the tunnel leading deeper into the kobold warrens.  It wasn't that she was afraid of being ambushed, as most of the bearmen-barking-like-dogs had stopped daring to attack her ages before.  A part of her was hoping that, if they didn't know she was looking, she might catch them doing something natural.<br>
<br>
She didn't.<br>
<br>
Once again, that little stab in her heart deepened as she overheard gutteral growls celebrating a recent kill of a young &quot;tall-header&quot;, and plans to venture back out in the night to assault a newly trained &quot;meowl-walker&quot; scout as it tried to learn its new route.  She paused as she listened.  She wanted them to be good, she wanted them to learn.  More than anything else in the world right then, she wanted them to hunt for food, or for shelter, or even to thin out an overpopulated rank.<br>
<br>
But they didn't.<br>
<br>
They wanted to hunt simply to steal the lives of others, simply to be mean, and she couldn't let them do it.  She stepped from the concealing camouflage and asked them if they'd please do something else instead, but they only attacked in reply.  She kinda knew they would.  Her hammer swung smoothly, and the wounds were clean, the vines holding them still as they turned away to ensure their deaths were as quick as she could possibly make them.  <br>
<br>
Yet with each splintering of bone, something cracked in echo inside her.  With each bruise she crushed, her soul ached more deeply.  She felt their arrogant anger turn to selfish fear, and it made her want to yell at them, MAKE them behave, MAKE them stop hurting people so she didn't have to make them hurt.<br>
<br>
She didn't cry.  No matter how much she wanted to when she had to hunt, she never cried.  Instead she paused over the lifeless bodies, wishing them a safe journey into their next step, searching for any final gifts left behind to do the good they failed to perform in life.  And as she often wished since the day she first had to help squash a bug to keep it from killing Kenyon, she wished she'd never have to hurt anything ever again.  But wishing wasn't making anything true, so with a quick sigh she turned back to helping the world of the living.<br>
<br>
She retrieved a small empty bag, a worn bokken, and a few battered coins.  She gave the bag to a young man training his skills just inside the tunnels, and earmarked the coins to pay for frosting on her next batch of cookies.  The bokken she took with her out into the mountains.  There was a young scout she had to find as it tried to learn a new route, and it probably needed protection. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kimayasilverbark>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0> at: 12/17/02 3:18:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 536<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 7:43:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yer never know how yer life turns out, do yer.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay.&quot;<br>
The others stayed silent.<br>
<br>
The campfire cracked slowly, showering tiny sparks onto the soggy ground of the plains.  It cast a flickering light on the few figures hunched around it, illuminating each detail of their face, while barely creeping around the edges of their assembled, battered animal skin huts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer know.&quot;  The tall one glanced around the group, the scars of the battleworn mounted upon his once youthful cheek as dreadful trophies.  &quot;Long afore yer use tae be out 'ere.  Long afore we were out 'ere, I used ter 'ave a keen interest in a young lass back home.  Back in Halas.  Real beauty, she was, just yer comfy height below yer, big, strong.  Honest.&quot;  The big man sighed, his shoulders consigned to carrying a dreadful weight.  He stared into the floor.  &quot;I miss 'er, yer know.  She prob'ly be marryin' some blader, yer know, warrior, big type, noble.  Rich.  I be hopin' she 'aves an 'appy life, but I can't 'elp but think what we could have 'ad together.&quot;<br>
<br>
A general rumble of consent came from the group.  The stoutest one, a dwarf with an unkempt beard, ragged from years of neglect and glass trimming, nodded solemly.  &quot;We be leavin a lot behind.  We should never have be botherin tryin ter survive out here.  Should havin died.  Better than livin like this.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's not that bad.  We are living the dream of many a nobleman, you know.  Life on the open road, no one to regulate us, no one to catch us.  We are a law unto ourselves.&quot;  A young elf.  She sounded reasonably upbeat, but her tone betrayed her true feelings.  A melanchony as black as pitch lay poised beneath her jovial speech.  Her fingers lay nervously upon her scimitar hilt, forever poised for inevitable, unending and final combat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer naive, lass.  Yer will learn..  Yer will learn, there ain't bein' no freedom 'bout bein a bandit.  Yer live, and yer die by yer sword.&quot;<br>
<br>
A human nodded, another untrimmed beard among the many.  He drew back the tattered rags along his arm to reveal a half foot long scar.  &quot;Last of those bastard rangers did this to me.  They think we bother their animals, or something.  If they weren't trying to kill us so often, those damned animals, we wouldn't fight them so often.  Shortsighted little ranger sh-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be quiet and drink yer ale,&quot; the dwarf said sharply.  He narrowed his eyes, the great lines of sleeplessness being a scar of their very own.  &quot;We'll be movin termorow.  Word's been gettin out they know where we be.&quot;  The dwarf picked himself off the ground.  &quot;Expectin yer all to be ready.&quot;<br>

The day had dawned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, not much here, is there.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nae, tae bandits, they nae look all that rich.&quot;<br>
<br>
A young human, clad from head to toe in banded mail, plodded slowly across the bloodstained earth, the Ghoulbane swung low to his side as he scanned the camp for survivors.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like that's all of them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yep, sure looks that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
The human and his tall female companion fanned out across the camp, checking each body for useful trinkets, weapons, money, anything that might prove worthwhile.  A few knocked out golden teeth.  A fine steel or bronze weapon or two.<br>
<br>
A tall Halasman, his face sadly at ease lay prone, a crimson stain spreading from his belly.  It surrounded a small golden trinket, enveloping it in a blanket of colour.  The human absently picked it up and looked it over.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am findin these bandits, they have plenty of tae gold teeth!&quot;<br>
The paladin waved off the comment.  &quot;Just a second, I'll be right with you!&quot;<br>
<br>
It appeared to be a locket of some sort, tarnished by years of bad weather and abuse.  The chain was ornate though, seemingly having managed to survive the ages.  The main body of the locket was a simple circle, protected by little more than a clasp.  It flicked open with the most miniscule of effort, leaving him wondering why it had even survived at all.  Inside was a portrait.  A picture from what looked like a gnomish kamera, poor quality, almost watercolour.  The face within the picture, spoke volumes.<br>
<br>
The paladin looked over to his companion, still rummaging her way through the bodies.  &quot;Oh..&quot; he whispered.  He held the locket up, his eyes darting between the two women, one of them lost in the past, the other trapped in the present.  A great sadness washed over his heart, and he placed the locket within his backpack.  A silent prayer to the Lord Marr.<br>
<br>
All was done.<br>
<br>

The heads of the bandits were to be taken to the Qeynos guards, normally.  They offered a substancial reward, but the paladin had refused to do so.  It would only go to the Temple.  Instead, he labouriously carried the heavy body of the dead Halasman to the bridge crossing into the southern plains.<br>
<br>
The corpse floated off down the river, the blood having long since stopped leaking from his body.  If any other than the paladin were watching, they would have seen his hand closed over his heart.<br>
<br>
The paladin sighed sadly, turning to his companion who sat fishing over the side of the bridge.  Saying nothing more, he merely tapped her on the shoulder, and the pair set off on adventures anew, a locket lighter in weight. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A> at: 12/16/02 8:10:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gatsuthewarrior>GatsuTheWarrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 9:09:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> Heres the only thought i have to that post. <br>

<br>
The jungle was sickly and long past its prime, its ancient trees kept alive only through the magics of the sentinels of Cazic Thule.  What few small structures dotted its landscape were crumbling and worn with the steps of creatures called evil that were yet as holy as any creation of the opposing alliance of Gods.  Everything is holy to someone...<br>
<br>
His had been the first plane to have been torn into, its rifts to the mortal world spelling doom for the Lord of Fear, not because He was somehow weaker than any other God, but because more creatures hated Him.  Since then, the footfalls of Mortal creatures seemed to never leave his tiny realm. Since then, he had taken up the sword that he had not wielded for thousands upon thousands of years.  Many had fallen to it--Elves of all colors, variants of the Marr children, the tiny Brell creations, and more had tried their hands at him.<br>
<br>
What broke his spirit was the others.  Trolls. Iksar.  His own children, creatures of power and, in their own ways, simple beauty.  Since the rift opened they had taken their blades to him alongside the ranks of others, without so much as regret.<br>
<br>
The footfalls came again--dozens this time.  Cazic Thule stood from his throne and clutched his sword in one massive arm.  Heading outside, he felt himself stumble, a painful reminder of his age and his lost power.  He could already see the mortals passing through his moat of fire, and readied his blade to meet them.<br>
<br>
They didn't even fear him anymore... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lest@firionavie>Lest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/17/02 11:10:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> &quot;Everything is holy to someone...&quot;<br>
