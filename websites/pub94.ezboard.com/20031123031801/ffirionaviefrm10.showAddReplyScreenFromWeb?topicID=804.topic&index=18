De'vir's reaction to her pseudonyme for the night was a bit odd. Like he had heard something he hadn't expected. In actuality it was nothing more than something that popped into her head from a dream she had once when she first met Anrae. An odd dream it was, perhaps she should look into further one day.<br>
<br>
   Expecting little to happen until the party, Kyri took some time to return to the Temple of Lord Platinum on Luclin to attend to her duties there. It seemed Lord Platinum was pleased with her recent activities as many of his servants fell into her posession during her stay. She returned back to the League estate and was indeed a bit surprised to find the old woman she had followed to the Temple showing up in the League halls in servant's attire, unquestioned by the guards. Of course the woman paid no notice of Kyri when their paths crossed- she never knew she had been followed that other day.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps Maelgroth is wiser than I thought, then again it will be much easier if he is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused. She expected the leaving of the invitation would stir things up, let Maelgroth know someone was suspicious of him and whatever plans he had in mind. Better to shake them up when the plans are in their infancy than to grow accustomed to their false safety when it is just an illusion. Now to bring the old woman to the League halls indeed offered Maelgroth and the woman - no doubt the necromancer's nanny or something like that far better protection from harm than the old shack they were staying in. Even if discovered the defenses of the mansion were far stronger than most in Neriak. Naturally they didn't pose too much trouble for her, but Kyri had her own reasons to know the defenses inside and out.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps I should return to the halls of the Ebon Mask and see just who has been brought in for the latest round of killing. Get an idea of who might be talented enough to break in here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused. Of course the warring houses had come to her with their offers to assassinate one party or another. But such snobbish nobles also tried to cut every corner they could and the offers they had made were insulting at best. At least House De'Vir was wise enough to know that to hire one of the best you had to pay accordingly.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course now i'm planning to lay a false trail for him. Need to make it a good one or my rep might suffer from this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri told herself as she made her ways to the Mask halls. Inside the usual riff raff were up to their old tricks, a bunch of youngsters still learning the basics. A couple who seemed to have survived the first round of training. A few more experienced ones were in quiet conferences with some of the leaders of the Ebon Mask, professional courtesy prevented Kyri from interrupting, folk tends to get upset if they think someone is trying to steal the job they're planning. In this professions such disagreements tended to leave one party dead- so courtesy was recommended.<br>
<br>
   Off to one side she saw someone who's name she never learned who was claimed by a couple to be &quot;on his way up the ranks&quot;. He was wearing some Ravenscale armor, newly gained by the lack of bloodstains,rust and other signs of battle wear and tear. Normally she would dismiss him as another moderately skilled youth but though he was hiding it well this thief seemed a bit nervous about something. Quick darting glances, more than the usual caution when entering this place and some slight fidgiting that only someone else in the profession would notice. Kyri quickly went about her busniess, giving the nervous thief no reason to keep an eye on her. Stopping briefly to the Guildmaster she made her token report before taking a last look around and moving along.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well someone screwed up their job it looks like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself reflecting back on the nervous thief. The guildmasters didn't seem to concerned so obviously it wasn't a guild job that had been botched. In those cases, the failed thief wouldn't be in condition to stand for some time, nevermind fidgit around nervously. Returning to her quarters Kyri decided it would be best to just sit and see what happens next.<br>
<br>
  The next day Kyri was haggling with one of the merchant in the Commons during the early morning hours when she heard a commotion behind her. Turning around she saw a large crowd heading to the third gate. She was about to turn back to the merchant and finish that deal before skimming some profit out of that itightly bunched mob when she saw a familiar face.<br>
<br>
  Leading the mob, bearing some sort of chalice, was the priestess Kyri had seen leave the temple the day she followed the old woman who returned later a beaten mess. Curious now, she ignored the merchant and his trinkets and attached herself to the back of the pack following the priestess. Looking at the clothing of the mob, Kyri sighed to herself as she realized the pockets here wouldn't be worth the effort of picking. No doubt the Copper Demon had a great following among these common folk.<br>
<br>
 As Kyri expected the procession stopped just outside the Temple to Innoruuk in the third gate. Due to her profession Kyri manged to make her way closer to the front of the mob while still keeping a few to shield her from easy view, then listened in to the conversation as if they were speaking of platinum. Of course the god's booming declaration was no doubt heard in Freeport and left no doubt that this priestess would become a force in the church.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So like Inny to bluster and yell, Lord Platinum is much more mellow when delivering his wishes. Then again that must be what Lord Platinum hires Inny for- to do all the yelling and threatening that would interrupt Lord Platinum's counting of his servants in the world.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri reflected as the underpriests all came scrambling out of the temple to help the priestess inside. She was about to turn and leave when the High Priest dumped the contents of the priestess' backpack out, and the skinned faces fluttered to the ground as those nearest to them took several steps back when they realized what they were.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So another connection it seems. The priestess and the skinned faces, just like the one that De'vir brought me in for. Of course the priestess isn't behind this. Not like Inny to take such care when killing. So the question is, is the priestess part of the Waes'Harventhur, an ally of them, or some common lackey</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri pondered. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Then again, in either case she knows something of who is behind all this. She can put names and faces to these people. Do I tell De'vir this, or wait and see?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  As the crowd dispersed, Kyri went along so as to not attact attention to herself as she thought about this new developement. Things were moving faster now, perhaps the party might be too late by then. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well, if De'vir wants to talk to me about this he knows how to contact me.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as she walked off.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I need the time to come up with something anyway to throw him off the real scent. Of course i'm still at the edges of this as it is. I need to know more. Perhaps its time Maelgroth and I have a little talk about a few things before things get more difficult. Perhaps he'll have some ideas as to who we wish to take the blame for all this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   After all the game of houses was a game Kyri never played being raised on the streets herself. Who ruled, or who outmaneuvered who only interested her in the skill or lack thereof involved in the set up. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So far Maelgroth has proven a clever player indeed, it will be interesting to see what we might accomplish together. Perhaps after this party De'Vir will be holding, so I can see how he handles himself in a social setting we'll have a little chat... After all,its always nice to see a Shadow get ahead in life after all, especially over the blood of one's foes...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as she returned to the League mansion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/4/03 5:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> <br>
“There is another suitor at the gate master.” Vilkev the door warden announced. Suitors had been arriving all day, this being one of the preliminary functions for Athava’s ascension. <br>
<br>
“Really, how wonderful.” Nystrye muttered sarcastically. He hated this part of the ritual, it seemed every house in Neriak trotted out all their available males, be they in diapers or using a cane, just to gawp at his house and eat his food. The gifts were predictable as were the proposals. Just about everyone knew that Athava had been promised from birth to another house, this was simply more tasteful display and pageantry that masked the vicious infighting that was a part of daily life in Neriak. Still it was nice to have the opportunity to look one’s enemies in the eye for a change. He felt very much like one of his hunting dogs curled up in front of the fire surrounded by yapping puppies that insist on attracting his attention.<br>
<br>
“House Jindrun’Belbol!” Vilkev droned in his most impersonal voice, even though it was a house name he had never uttered in his many years as protocol master of house D’Vir.<br>
<br>
Nystyre smiled, a genuine smile for the first time that afternoon. Jindrun’Belbol indeed, the name translated literally to ‘Face Giver” but most likely meant ‘Gift of Honor’. He had been expecting this guest.<br>
<br>
He surveyed the rest of the gathered houses before turning to greet this guest. All faces were turned towards the marble pillared door, most bore the bored expression he was still struggling to maintain. A few, most notably the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr gaped openly. It was obvious each thought the other had this house in their pay. Both had come to this affair hoping to gain the support of some of the other noble houses in their war. It was bleeding both white, but it was quickly becoming apparent that the Fire Hags were going to loose.<br>
<br>
“It was a pleasure to receive your reply to our invitation.” Nystyre replied formally turning to greet his guest. In fact he had taken to carrying the response tattooed into living elf skin with him everywhere. It was delightfully warm and pliable, very soothing to touch.<br>
<br>
“Please accept this gift of respect from our house.” Jindrun’Belbol replied in the old tongue. He was wearing the same courting mask that had been displayed at the Chath’elg’Caress ascension. The robe was similar, black bristle silk from Kunark, cut in a style similar to that popular today, but an original masterwork from centuries ago. It was a robe fitting for a Teir’Dal noble. He extended a small treantwood box.<br>
<br>
Nystyre took the newcomer’s hand in his and exchanged the gesture of peace after receiving the box. It was time to see what this pup was made of. “We are taking great interest in your activites, Waes’Harventhar.” The last being whispered so only the two of them could hear.<br>
<br>
He had been expecting a reaction, and he got one. The eyes behind the mask suddenly locked onto his own, he sensed the pride that the listener took in the fact that his true name was on the lips of the great houses once again, even if it was in a whisper. There was no fear in this one, only cold determination.<br>
<br>
The greeting ended, house Jindrun’Belbol stode purposefully away, towards the rest of the guests awaiting a moment to present themselves to Athava.<br>
<br>
He opened the box. Inside was a single bronze nail, identical to those affixing the faces of the Vlos’Shannal to the temple doors. Nystyre chuckled softly, here was a valuable gift. <br>
<br>
He looked about for his new “neice” and spotted her in the shadows. Vynna K’yari had not yet been officially presented at court and was something of a mystery to the guests as well. She was absolutely stunning in the silversilk dress and platinum tiara, too bad most of the guests did not seem to notice her. He smiled to himself once again, it was probably for the best that she was hiding from the guests, and he was relieved there appeared to be no place to hide any additional items that might find their way into a pocket or purse.<br>
<br>
Vynna noticed his gaze though, and with a sultry wink in his direction she fluttered off in pursuit of Jindrun’Belbol.<br>
<br>
The newcomer was politely ignoring the stares and questions being put to him by the lesser houses who swarmed about him like flies. The higher status houses ignored him publicly pretending to know who he was and what he was doing, but to her trained senses their hunger for information was palpable.<br>
<br>
The afternoon had begun with little fanfare, her arrival in what she thought was appropriate attire had been easy enough. Vilkev had met her at the door, and immediately directed her upstairs where Nystyre was waiting for her. It was the first time she had ever openly entered the house.<br>
<br>
“Not bad, but as a representative of house D’Vir you will have to do better.” <br>
<br>
Kyri was about to take issue at that comment, why she had stolen oneof the finest gowns in Neriak. That was until she saw the dazzling dress Nystyre held out for her.<br>
<br>
In truth, she had never really had much interest in this world, other than as a source of quick cash from foolish nobles. She found their ritual and formalities boring and incomprehensible. Now she was beginning to appreciate the subtleties of the game and with that appreciation came a fascination with its intricacies. <br>
<br>
“I see you like the dress.”<br>
<br>
“It…its beautiful.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, and we will make you so as well. Try not to torment Vilkev too much over the next few hours, I have other matters to attend to, but I will check in with you as soon as I might.” Nystyre replied, handing her the dress and ordering Vilkev to enter.<br>
<br>
“I understand you are our cousin, freshly returned from Mistmoore?” Vilkev announced. His tone more than told her that he did not believe any of her cover story, but that he would play along. He walked over to her, appraising her much like she examined a fine bit of jewelry before she stole it.<br>

“A bath, a haircut, another bath and a manicure is in order.” He clapped his hands together at the last and a flock of servants appeared and whisked Kyri away. The next hour was full of the most delicious pampering she had ever received. She appreciated the way the staff kept her naked and busy most of the time, giving her no opportunities to properly case the building or to palm a few valuables. Their behavior was totally un-necessary as Kyri had given her word to behave herself.<br>
<br>
When they were done and Kyri had slithered into her dress. There was a knock on her door.<br>
<br>
“This, goes with the dress, neice.” Nystyre handed her a small box.<br>
<br>
Tentatively she opened it, inside was the most exquisite tiara. She had made a point of laughing at tiara wearing princesses wherever possible, and had stolen quite a few in her time, being amazed at the aftermarket interest in such ridiculous headgear.<br>
<br>
“Let me show you how it goes.” He took the platinum dream and gently placed it on her head.<br>
<br>
She wished, for the first time in a while, that she had a mirror in which to see what she looked like, part of her was terrified that the would break out in laughter, a smaller but increasingly vocal was curious to see if she could measure up to those snooty nobles. Still she had taken to avoiding mirrors after a particularly nasty experience in the Plane of Disease.<br>
<br>
“There is a mirror in the next room if you are interested in seeing what you look like Vynna.”<br>
