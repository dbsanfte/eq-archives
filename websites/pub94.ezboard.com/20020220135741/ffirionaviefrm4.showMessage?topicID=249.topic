<br>
What is the effect of Powergaming on Roleplaying?<br>
<br>
I see that question asked from the PGers constantly, 'How am I effecting your RP, I'm not hampering your RP at all.'<br>
<br>
To let you in on a seeming little known secret, you are.<br>
<br>
I'm going to take my Character for example.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/PLing.html">members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/PLing.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is going to get a bit RPish, but I'm going to do two different story lines for the situation. One for the situation that happened, and one for what would of happened if the Situation dictated above in that picutre, Dante Powerleveling That Woodelf, never happened.<br>
<br>
Alright? Before I do, all of you Roleplayers out there, defending this kind of behavor on our Server, I want you to think.<br>
<br>
&quot;What would my Character do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Scratch that. I don't need to do some drawn out RP story. I'll just state the facts and let you all call be a Biggot once again.<br>
<br>
When Shintou pushed open the wooden double doors leading into the Court Yard of the Temple of Cazic Thule.. <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
He saw that, a Darkelf, Greatly assisting a Woodelf, keeping her safe and protecting her. Being the Samurai, or Knight, which ever you wish, that he is, Nautrally he went about Verbally scoulding the Dark Elf for his show of Weakness towards the Woodelves, who he belives all should die. All typical Shintou figured, Another Neutral Controling a weak willed former member of the Forces of evil.<br>
Shintou then went to attack the Bard, offering her a Challenge to enter a battle with him for her insolence in controling such a Powerful Tier'dal Priest. Fighting the Priest was also an Option, but maybe he could save this one from the Wench's evil seductive grasp, and end her Control over him.<br>
Naturally, she was cowardic and turned down the battle. Dante said some Unimportant mess, he is under a neutrals control.<br>
Something in the order of..<br>
&quot;Its my life, its my business, I'm just controling her&quot; Et Cetra.<br>
What he expected. Shintou could do no more here. They would not fight, so he turned and left the Temple of Cazic Thule, cursing in discust.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Everything within the &quot;~&quot;'s was effected by Dante's Powerleveling.<br>
<br>
And you Powergamers have the balls to say that your crap doesn't effect Roleplaying?<br>
<br>
Imagine, what could Shintou of done in the Temple of Cazic Thule had their not been Dante there, Powerleveling the Bard.<br>
<br>
Maybe he would of faught and trained fighting the Lizards.<br>
Maybe he could of called some of his Friends and Guild Brothers and Sisters and went Adventuring within the Temple.<br>
Or Maybe he could of just been bored and left the Temple, seeking another place to train his skills.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can come up with other little things Shintou could of done.<br>
<br>
But because of Dante, Shintou had to change his focus.<br>
<br>
Now, I know what you Powergamers are saying. Hell, you're probably shouting it.<br>
<br>
&quot;JUST IGNORE HIM JUST IGNORE HIM&quot;<br>
<br>
Pipe down.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go Literally with you.<br>
<br>
When I roleplay, I like to turn off the OOC switch when I click on Shintou to start spawning him into Norrath, or by RP terms, he's waking up in his Camp.<br>
If you don't, thats on you. I'm not telling anyone how to RP, I'm telling you how I choose to RP.<br>
<br>
And I know I have the right to RP as I please, espically here, on the RP server.<br>
<br>
I will mostly Answer an OOC comment here and there, and ask a OOC question here and there, but its clearly marked by my ((Out Of Character Brackets)).<br>
<br>
Alright, back to the Point.<br>
<br>
I immerse myself in my RP. I try to stay consistant to what I want to do with my Character as much as Possible.<br>
<br>
Something like this, I just cannot have him turn a blind eye and walk away as if everythings pretty pink flowers and happy go lucky butterflies, because in his Book, its not.<br>
<br>
I once made a comment, I reguard everyone in RP mode once they log into EQ. <br>
<br>
I RP with everyone, or try to.<br>
<br>
They can say u and thx and grats all they want. I'll still RP my character.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to stop RPing because some Powergaming Son of a Handbasket (Made you look.) wants to Powergame.<br>
<br>
If I see any situation, I'm going to RP it.<br>
<br>
And thats my Right, as a Player of Everquest.<br>
<br>
One of the most MMO<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  RPG</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->'s ever created.<br>
<br>
I forgot to add something within my No Spin Zone. If Velious and Luclin had the words Roleplaying written across them as brightly as they shined on the Kunark and Old School EQ Box, I would of said this:<br>
<br>
&quot;In my Humble Opinion, Powergamers do not belong on Everquest, at all. Verant clearly states that Everquest is an Roleplaying game, all of its servers are RPing servers.<br>
But you know what, I think of myself as at least kinda fair, so you can have most of them.<br>
Heck. Us Roleplayers only need 1.<br>
Look at those Servers, all of them RPing Servers.<br>
<br>
Why are they not RPing servers anymore?<br>
<br>
Because Uberism TOOK THEM OVER.&quot;<br>
<br>
You say I'm a Racist Intolerant Biggot.<br>
<br>
I have put up with the crap of Powergamers for 2 and a Half Years.<br>
Way Longer then I should have.<br>

The he you are refering to here is yourself. What stopped you from doing those things you listed above? Had a full group of role-playing characters been at the same spot as Dante and the bard, would they have affected your ability to do your above mentioned actions? Yes, a role playing group would have affected your ability to do your above mentioned actions. Boils down to eq limitation again:<br>
People fighting over mob spawns. This has nothing to do with<br>
Role playing. <br>

<br>
First off, mostly the party would of went after places where the Decaying pieces of armor are, or we would of just attacked the Maze for training. Their is no fighting over spawns here, they were Powerleveling off of Lower Tae, or as it is called here, the Temple thinggy.<br>
<br>
Also, where did I say that RPers didn't effect how I RP, they do too! Everyone in Everquests effects everyone elses character. Interaction, weither you like it or not.<br>
<br>
Nice try to get away from the point, that Powergamers do effect Roleplayers, cause if you missed it by chance, that was it.<br>

After 30 minutes or so one of the group would inevitable do something the other thought was inappropriate. Then would come the appeal to mom:<br>
<br>
MOM, make her play Barbies the right way.<br>
<br>
Shintou: There is no Mom here. VI doesn't care. There is also no right way to play with Barbies. So you play with your Barbie Doll your way and everyone else will play their way. Let's leave mom out of it and have fun.<br>

<br>
Okay, I think I got it clean now.<br>
<br>
These are Generic Boys and Girls.<br>
These Girls play with their barbie dolls one way. Thats okay.<br>
These Boys play with their Barbie Dolls in a .. different way.<br>
Girls are Offended. Why can't the Boys just play with the Barbie dolls in their own room alone?<br>
<br>
Another.<br>
<br>
Boys acually take the advice. These boys are up, playing with their barbie dolls as they see fit. The Girls know they are playing with the barbie dolls as they see fit, but they walk in the boys room, sit down on their bed, look down at the boys and just smile.<br>
<br>
You know dang well those Boys are NOT going to play with those Barbie dolls the same way they were playing with them before, espically with the Girls looking down on them like that?<br>

Alright, I'm done.<br>

I'll try to put this delicately..<br>
<br>
Practice tact, first of all. (Which you showed moderate signs of doing in this post, at least) Personal attacks and coarse language get your point across, but people will be less likely to give a damn what you say. This is a bit of lame example, but it's like when a 84 year old lady that everyone knows is a kind, sweet gentle person one day gets really mad because _______(insert reasons for old ladies to get mad) and says, &quot;Two tears in a bucket, mother fuck it!&quot; and punches the 20 year old pizza boy who happens to be near her with a surpise right hook. People's ears prick up and they tend to listen. <br>
<br>
However, when you have Sploksy the drunken Russian floor cleaner at a hospital who spits out every four letter word both in English and Russian at the drop of a hat, people just shrug and say, &quot;Bah. Dumb old fool. Throwing another one of his fits again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Secondly, you are not going to find pure RP on a commercialized, massive user base game. You'll grow wings and a sultry singing voice comparable to Diana Krall before that ever happens. I enjoy roleplaying, and this sever is what brought me back to Everquest, but pure RP was never even a hope of mine because I knew it was too unrealistic. It is a lovely place to play though, isn't it? Which brings me to my next point...<br>
<br>
You should be thrilled about this server. If you can look me in the eyes and with a straight face say there isn't any more RP on this server than any of the others I'd likely have a heart attack, and you would be charged with involuntary man slaughter or something. <br>
<br>
Sure, we have FnF and maybe some other uber guilds, but they're nice enough people. If anyone prefers not to RP on the roleplaying preferred sever more power to them. Maybe they just want a challenge. I'd rather be on a server with mature power gamers than ones with &quot;sow k thx phuq j00 Arr Peee Er.&quot;<br>
<br>
Last berating splurge here... As for your rant on power leveling. Though I share most of your views on the utopia of a role playing paradise my thoughts are a bit different on power leveling. Paying plat for a pl session, sure, that's lame. However, I see it entirely permissiable if it is to help a friend. I know I sure don't want to travel the land without one of my friends from my young adulthood of killing extremely resilient bats and spiders. If you can keep a friend that you met in your character's beginning, those can often be your best allies all the way to 60. Granted I've never been to 60, but I would assume that if it's true at 40, it'll be true at 60. I'll give another bad example.<br>
<br>
Let's say you're a Hong Kong action movie character. You're getting ready to enter your arch rival's urban castle patrolled by hundreds of gun wielding maniacs with a friend of yours from the streets of your youth as your only back-up... but... The poor bastard doesn't even know how to run on walls, dodge bullets, or wield hand guns akimbo yet. So what do you do? Run in, drunken dodge a few bullets, flip around, kill everyone, and be very lonely with no one to share your victory? No, I say! Take him to the shooting range or an abandoned building and power level his ass! Now you're revitalized with a lust for life you haven't had since your younger days with your old friend by your side.<br>
<br>
I enjoy both giving bad examples and being long winded.<br>

QOUTE:<br>
Imagine, what could Shintou of done in the Temple of Cazic Thule had their not been Dante there, Powerleveling the Bard.<br>
<br>
Maybe he would of faught and trained fighting the Lizards.<br>
Maybe he could of called some of his Friends and Guild Brothers and Sisters and went Adventuring within the Temple.<br>
Or Maybe he could of just been bored and left the Temple, seeking another place to train his skills<br>
<br>
END QOUTE<br>
<br>
Would this not have been the same thing had thier been a role playing group at the Temple? Your ability to do these things you mention has NOTHING to do with role playing.<br>
You inability to do these things has EVERYTHING to do with mob spawn issues.<br>
<br>
1. Nothing preventing you from going elsewhere in CT and fighting lizards.<br>
2. Nothing preventing you from calling some friends/guildies to CT to fight besides the Temple in CT.<br>
<br>
 Some one was in a mob spawn spot you wanted, this has NOTHING to do with role playing. Your blaming your &quot;inability&quot; to do certain things on lack of role playing is bull honkey doodoo. You got upset cause someone was in a spot you wanted, and since they were &quot;not-roleplayers&quot; you find an easy venue to vent your frustation. I do understand your concern with lack of role playing response to your role playing statements to the 2 people at CT Temple, but they did not affect your ability to continue on and enjoy the game.  <br>
<br>
I will give you a REAL example of powergaming affecting someone in EQ: My second char on another server was at this same exact spot. A full group of level 26-30ish chars in the Temple. We were there for hours having fun when long comes a single 50+ necro and proceeds to steal the camp from us, killing the Tae before we can, etc. He wanted to twink his rogue, imagine that. <br>
<br>
Welcome to EQ Ronin,  the nature of mob spawn issues.  Nothing role play about it brother, boils down like this for all of us. Thankfully, there is for the most part a nice set of people on FV. Really be sad to see the bickering and fighting that goes on over mob spawns on other servers come to FV. Please stop blaming mob spawn issues on role-playing, has zero to do with role playing. <br>

It's over, he's right. This isn't a server all to the Roleplayers, and such a thing will never exist.<br>

<br>
It was wrong. Maybe it was wrong for me to try to want an All Roleplaying Server.<br>
<br>
I guess its not polotically correct or somethin. Powergamers diversify our server.<br>
<br>
But I still had to try.<br>
<br>
I couldn't let the end of Roleplaying come to Everquest, espically now that I have learned 100% more Lore about things that I have wondered about, and things that I did not even fathom on this 'Multiplayer Online Game'.<br>

<br>
In multi-player RPG's (whether it's online or table-top), you have to pick your companions carefully or develop blinders.<br>
<br>
Obviously in Everquest, you can't pick your fellow players carefully so that everyone around you plays with the same style. You have to roleplay (or fail to do so) with the people available.<br>
<br>
Therefore, you MUST &quot;develop blinders&quot;. By develop blinders, I mean you have to turn a blind eye towards many of the ooc game mechanics and ooc behavior of other players.<br>
<br>
Heck, there are lots of things in the world of Norrath that just plain don't make sense. Big things. HUGE things! For instance, you kill a monster and new ones pop into existence in the same spot. This obviously has nothing ot do with any normal type of reality. Heck, the fact that a 50th level can walk into a WC camp full of orcs and cut them down one by one without them scattering in terror is also silly. BUT, we suspend belief!<br>
<br>
Shintou, you must extend that suspension of belief to the other live players around you, or you will simply never be satisfied. You've created an ideal that even Don Quixote wouldn't try and charge.<br>
<br>
When you see another live player, I love the fact that you try to interract with them in character! But if they are not interested, you have to put them out of your mind. You can not let them disrupt your illusion. If you must &quot;acknowledge&quot; their existence, then Shintou should make up explanations for their behavior, not try to change their behavior.<br>
<br>
For instance, if I was an aggressive elitist DE and walked into that situation... I would have wondered if maybe the bard was being fattened for later slaughter, or maybe he was simply a slave being used to harvest lizard meat for his master. I would have ignored the wood elf completely (wood elves being contemptible and weak) and would have said something like, &quot;How's that young slave working out for you?&quot; to the dark elf.<br>
<br>
Maybe the two would have wanted to roleplay and would have started a dialogue with me, if so..great fun. If not, I would have mentally written them off as a couple of inferior weaklings not worthy of my notice and gone about my business.<br>
<br>
I would NOT try to badger them into playing the roles I think they should play (or any roles whatsoever for that matter). I would NOT let them break my illusions and interfere with my roleplaying mood. If they started to, I would simply /ignore them and go about my business as if they were beneath my notice.<br>
<br>
That's how &quot;I&quot; would handle that situation if I were you. If you continue to let others dictate whether you can successfully stay in character while on FV, you will continue to be disappointed. Just like you ignore the thousands of game mechanics inconsistancies in Norrath, you must ignore the RP inconsistancies in other players...otherwise, you'll never maintain the illusion of being Shintou. <p>Grimwyrd Storm<BR>

You are not the first to face the Powergaming Monster, in fact the point was argued extensively for weeks when FV first opened.  There are flaws in EQ that allow it to exist, although this server did try to address them.<br>
<br>
Anyone is free to come play on this server.  And although it was bad manners to come with no intention to roleplay, they were still free to do so.<br>
<br>
I respect your efforts and arguments.<br>
<br>
Even if VI had made this a &quot;RP Only&quot; server, still the Powergamers would have arrived.  Of 100 000's of people, there would always have been the rude and inconsiderate.  It's called Freedom.<br>

I could go into this argument for hours I think, but I can't be bothered.<br>
<br>
Roleplayers like myself know your pain, Shintou. I came to FV expecting a much more in depth RP environment than I found, due to many different reasons. I have since changed my expectations, and unlike you I comprimised my RP values in order to still enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
But I think this argument has been long dead. No amount of shouting and yelling on this board is going to get anyone anywhere, and so far all you have done is made a bad name for yourself.<br>
<br>
It is an unfortunate fact of life that sometimes you have to comprimise, even on things you love. I will comprimise and accept FV as it is, and continue to enjoy myself.

I'm having lots of fun, and to be honest, if Some_Dumb_Guy_01 wants to power level to 50 in a week, go for it.  I'm not here for that.  Lots of other people aren't either.  <br>

Live and let live.  Many complaints seem to be centered around FnF.  /boggle. I've only bumped into a few of them, but they were more than happy to RP with me.  I could really care less if they rp in guild chats, and I&quot;ll tell you this, when we raid, we're not RPing in /gu.  <br>
<br>
I just think we can all get along.  I'm not going to let what someone else is doing ruin my expirance on the FV server.  9 out of 10 people that I have met here will RP with you if you initiate it.  Some of the others do it all on their own (like Shin) and a few just say &quot;sow plz.&quot;  Gotta keep in mind that we all play the game for different reasons.  For some it's an escape from a borring or stressfull life.  A place to be sombody. for others it's a distraction or an addiction. and for a few it's just something to kill time.<br>

I'm going to shut up now, as I'm beginning to ramble, but I had to toss my 2cp into the pot.  FV is what you make of it.  Enjoy it and have fun.<br>
