<br>
I disagree with you as usual Heagan.  On the regular servers with a hugh population I can see that, but we have a much smaller tighter community here on FV.  If the top guilds agree not to kill the sleeper it should not happen.  On Test the top guilds did not kill sleeper.  I played there for 2 years before coming to here and this server is very much like the test.<br>

<br>
I think the point that others are trying to make here is that there is utterly no benefit to waking the sleeper.  Not only do you deprive other guilds the same experience and loot that comes from fighting the warders, but you also deprive yourselves of ever being able to do it again.<br>
<br>
What is the benefit you gain by waking the sleeper?  You get to see a mob rampage across a few zones killing everyone in its path and open up some quests that anyone can do but noone does because they're not worth it.  In short, zero benefit.<br>
<br>
Oh, that's right, there is one benefit to waking the Sleeper...bragging rights.  Basically this is why others have been saying that you take a hit to your reputation by waking the Sleeper.  You are denying the ability of anyone else to EVER experience this zone the way it was designed for absolutly no benefit to anyone other than your own ability to brag about being the ones to do it.<br>
<br>
If FnF does not kill the sleeper and someone else comes along later and does...that other guild gains no benefit from it and everyone on the server loses the ability to do fight those warders ever again.  Everyone loses, noone gains.<br>
<br>
Doesn't make much sense to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/17/02 1:25:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1964.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Let it be one of the originals</span><hr size=1> Heagan, don't be so paranoid.

I hope my comment about me wanting to see the sleeper waken is causing folks some distress. I made that remark with a &quot;wouldn't it be cool to see this big dragon rampaging around&quot; kind of mindset.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt ever advocate actually doing it.<br>
<br>
If someone else does it, well it would be upsetting but there are still other challenges out there waiting to be conquered. Further, I am sure Verant will design gear/items that are on par with primal in PoP... they always seem to.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I doubt the sleeper will be woken for a long time. And if a desicion to wake the sleeper ever comes up in our guild, and is put to a vote, I would vote no.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

This was done a little prior to the first few NToV clearings, sometime last June I believe.  <br>
<br>
So, for argument's sake, say it was done a year ago.  It was a big deal to those guilds who were competing very hard for the few remaining Velious server-wide firsts (with NToV first being cleared by FoH around the last week of June / first week of July).  The warders and sleepers saw several retunings in the Spring of 2001 as VI had a nasty time finally finishing the script post-SoV release.<br>
<br>
If you want to split hairs, the sleeper was awoken a couple times before that while VI tried to fix the broken zone.  The famous 50' tall naked human model was awoken, multiple versions of the model were awoken, the disaster surrounding Conquest, all kinds of buggy stuff, but the first sleeper awakening of the final version of the zone belongs to BotS.<br>
<br>
On a side note, all the mobs in Sleepers are on their third or fourth faction set.<br>
<br>
Once it was done, it was assumed Sleepers itself would be changed in such a was as to now recaputre the Sleeper in some way.  However, the quest couldn't be found, although the ultra rare Prysmatic Dragon Scale appeared as a random drop.  A few more guilds awoke the sleeper in hopes they would be the first to find the quest and earn the prestiege of being the first to figure it out.<br>
<br>
The quest does not exist.......so people soon realized.<br>
People kept looking and looking and looking.....<br>
People bitched and bitched and bitched....<br>
VI eventually said, Waking the Sleeper is working as intended.<br>
So, there is no quest, no means of killing Kerafrym, will never be any means of killing or recapturing him.  Accpet it.<br>
<br>
Basically, waking the sleeper is now exposed to be the premiere selfish act of EQ.  You screw the rest of the server for a few minutes of deathtouches and a couple of cool screen shots.  A few very nice items will be completely eliminated from the server and outfitting your guild in primal, while still possible, becomes a big pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
FnF will make their chioce, and probabaly doesn't give a shit about my opinion.  But, I hope they do so knowing all the facts.<br>
<br>
The real paranoia is....eventually you want to kill the fourth warder for his stuff and the nice challenge he presents (unresistable 70% AE slow....).  When you do that, you have to leave one of the other 4 warders up, or else the sleeper wakes up.  By this time, people won't really want items off the first warder, but if you know what you're doing, he can be killed with like 15 or 16 people.  So, people worry that some other guild will sneak in and wake him up.  Don't laugh, it happened on one of the PVP servers.  But, I have a lot of faith that people get along much, much better here.<br>
<br>
Chysl<br>
<br>
P.S.  I think you can add Karana to the list of servers that never woke him up.  Their guids just agreed not to do it, it's as simple as that.<br>

He has 30453 hitpoints and his weapons are 150/15. He also has a right click deathtouch item that he got in a duel with a GM.

I started on Veeshan from day 1, and never did like Furor (not Ferror), although there were a few in Fires of Heaven I did like.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Furor was his second incarnation, a L60 warrior that he PL'd to 60 in about a week after his first account was banned. Well, I was in a group in Paw hacking at gnolls near the doors and lo and behold, who do I see run by but the almighty Furor himself, decked out in the finest FoH could provide. He runs thru the doors and I hear some fighting then he comes running out with two gnolls on him, they had to be green as ivy etched to him. Prob was, they were caster gnolls, one a necro and one a mage, and he started dying right there in front of me.<br>
<br>
He asked for help, and I told him that because of past deeds, I liked gnolls better than I liked him. And so he died.<br>
<br>
Mean? Yeah, probably, but what goes around comes around, and I remembered those bozos hassling some poor L13 soloing ogre warrior in Najena one day, intentionally training him out of the zone for god knows what reason (they were in their 30s at the time).<br>
<br>
Anyway, has nothing to do with ST, but since Furor was mentioned, I thought I'd relate my Furor-the-uber-warrior-gets-whacked-by-green-gnolls story. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
And yes, as far as I know, Fires of Heaven was in ST before anyone else.<br>

It wrecked great havoc on the lands of Norrath during the First Age and many a dragon was killed before it was sealed in the tomb. Four of the greatest and bravest of dragons of the Claws of Veeshan willingly gave their lives to serve as warders of that tomb.  The tomb was sealed with their deaths so that Norrath could be protected from a creature that hates all living things.<br>
<br>
Those who seek to slay all four of the warders and release this foul beast do the work of the minions of evil.  Death and destruction will surely follow this act and it may be wise for the guilds and clans that claim an allegiance to good to meet in a great Council to consider the ominous news that the foolhardy are considering such an act.<br>

I've not seen him before, mind, but I've heard reports of what he can do from random folks on other servers, and even if half of those are lies and the other half are exaggerations, this guy's one big, bad dragon.<br>
<br>
We could also look at it from a purely RP standpoint. If the dragons were altogether so incapable of killing him that they had to merely send him to sleep (always the standby for villains too weak or squeamish), what are the odds that even a whole guild of the best the lesser races have to offer could take him? <p><I>A lurker replies to YOU for 5 points of damage! <I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/02 11:11:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1964.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Making a claim that will never matter</span><hr size=1> You cannot kill the Sleeper - plain and simple...don't fool yourself that there is some quest/item that would enable you to do it.

<br>
Thus the reason for a to guild awaken the Sleeper is a) to experience a once in a server event (albeit a broken script) and/or b) a political move.<br>
<br>
Either of the above reasons is a valid one for a guild capable of killing the 4 warders IF they are prepared for the consequences.<br>

<br>
Bah!  I say that if you release it, it should STAY!  It should move around various zones killing everyone FOREVER!  Take this, Freeport Newbies!<br>
<br>
It should stick around until it can be killed, which should be a difficult but not entirely impossible event.<br>
<br>
Just waking it and then it disappears forever...blah...why even have it in the game? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=folodar>Folodar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/02 12:36:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1964.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Making a claim that will never matter</span><hr size=1> Of course it can be killed. Anything without literal, hard-coded invulnerability to everything short of a RL power outage can be killed, it just comes down to a matter of tactics. <br>
<br>
In most games, with most high-level, nigh-invincible mobs, you can go back and adjust your tactics, correct for error and what went wrong the last time. Each attempt gets a little closer, sometimes steps backwards a bit, but all in all brings us a lot closer to taking out the baddy. This can be done because these targets don't despawn. They can be attempted time and again. Screw up the last Nagafen raid, try again, maybe you'll get it right this time. The Sleeper is not like this. From all I hear, he despawns and you only get one shot. After that if you still want to take him, it's on to the next server and hope they don't wake him before you're good enough there. <br>
<br>
I still believe he can be killed. I also believe that, if he can be destroyed, it isn't the result of some as-yet undiscovered quest/item.It requires tactics. Tactics different from current modes of thinking, but tactics nonetheless. These tactics must be invented, developed, honed and refined before anyone has a real shot at the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
Course, I'm still wallowing in level nine. Ten to one I know nothing of this and I'm just shooting off posts because I'm bored. Keep that in mind. Your mileage will almost certainly vary. <p><I>A lurker replies to YOU for 5 points of damage! <I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unorroffv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Norr of FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/02 2:21:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1964.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Making a claim that will never matter</span><hr size=1> I tend to agree with Folodar.<br>
<br>
It probably IS possible to defeat the Sleeper.  Perhaps you have to have a set of fifty L60’s in EACH of the zones that he rampages through ready to lay waste to him in a storm of laggy particle effects, or maybe only a L15 Erudite Paladin with a rusty scimitar can hurt him.<br>
<br>
Nothing in EQ is unkillable, you just have to find the solution set.<br>
