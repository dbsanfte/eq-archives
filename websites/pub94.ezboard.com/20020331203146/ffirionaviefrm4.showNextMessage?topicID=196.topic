<br>
All the time.<br>
<br>
Every day.<br>
<br>
And the surrounding zones?  A bit more, but much the same.  Why?  Because 90% of Iksar on our server decide to be complete nerds and go off and flirt with dark elves.<br>
Perhaps there are some who have good RP reasons for this.  Perhaps there are some who don't like to roleplay and would instead prefer levels and loot.  That's all well and good.  The thing is this.  Here's a shout out to all Iksar, a wake-up call of sorts.<br>
<br>
WE ARE KOS IN NERIAK FOR A FREAKIN' REASON!!! And vice versa, dark elves are KOS to us.  They are NOT our friends as far as roleplay goes.  So why the hell are there only ever 15 Iksar around cabilis at one time?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to tell people how to roleplay.  On the contrary, I only wish that I wasn't bitched at about this. I roleplay as a good, law-abiding, loyal-to-the-emperor Iksar.  Because of this, I do NOT group, consort, play with, hunt with or interact more than snarls and brawls with non-iksar.  Dark elves included.  I only wish I was more free to play this way.  /duel and /snarl, 90% of the time, gets this from the dark elf &quot;roleplayer&quot;:<br>
<br>
&quot;Um dude, what the fuck is your problem.  You gonna join the group or not?&quot;<br>
<br>
NO!! You're on my freakin' land and I'm angry as hell about it, can you not tell that?  No, I do not want to be in your group. No, I do not want your buffs, your heals, your SoW. NO, I do not want you in my city or lands.  The fact that a bunch of people prefer their platinum and &quot;lewt&quot; over roleplay sense does not mean that we all do!!<br>

<br>
What if I can freely walk the streets of Cabalis (well except maybe the shamans)?<br>
<br>
The whole idea of faction is to restrict interaction, but not to prevent it completely. Except for Ogre and Troll and to a lesser extent Barbarian and Dark elf cities, every city can be worked for faction. The troll and ogre faction is nearly impossible to work up because no quest I know of gives faction for them unless you already have faction with them. Same with Barbarian and Dark elf, though they can be worked around easier than the first two.<br>
<br>
To write off every race except Iksar for ever is a bit tough. I enjoy roleplaying but not to the extent a game cant be played at all. Ever hear of the idea &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;? Maybe incorporate that as a means to work with others around your city?<br>
<br>
But obviously if you have no intention of ever working with other races that is your choice. It does , in all likely hood, mean you wont be advancing far if you cant do it alone.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your style of play.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 9:24:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmm</span><hr size=1> Actually, Neriak faction is incredibly easy to raise.

It just gets frustrating trying to roleplay according to the Iksar as defined by Verant when so few choose to do so =\.  I realize that it's much more common and convenient for Iksar to join with Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres, and occasionally even the &quot;light&quot; races.  We just have different styles of play, and I respect yours completely.  In fact, it would be interestin for Kelisk and Gore to meet again (we hunted together in the pit once, a long time ago <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ).  I think the resulting argument would be pretty damned explosive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Twotribes, if you ever walked the streets of Cabilis...it'd be really weird.  I hate the whole bonechip thing, it makes no sense whatsoever that the Iksar would suddenly fall in love with their hated enemies because they handed a few thousand bonechips to a confused trooper.<br>
<br>
Dalninil, as far as the set RP situation for Iksar goes, we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   don't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like Dark Elves, which is my point.  Certainly, dark elves are useful for strictly game issues-hunting, raids, etc-but Iksar and Dark Elves are not natural friends, which seems to be something a lot of people think...The fact that you have enchanters and clerics means jack to the empire in RP terms, because those magics are considered forbidden and evil.  Another point which I stand strongly on is that, while Iksar might be viewed as &quot;evil&quot; by Firiona Vie and her gang of bitches, they're not &quot;evil&quot; in the same way as Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres.  Which is why we're by default KOS to Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres...because our views are so drastically different. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelisk</A> at: 1/3/02 5:45:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 9:40:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *cries* No!  I don't like !@#$ softskins!!</span><hr size=1> Most Fantasy stories I have read have the &quot;evil&quot; guys using the not so evil for their own purposes.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule preaches Fear. Not hate. I see nothing in the tale of the Iksar that prevents them from making &quot;allies&quot; with any except Dragons. Any one foolish enough to trust an Iksar alliance deserves the results that will occur sooner or later.<br>
<br>
Maybe as Gore has suggested, you need to learn the finer points of using people. <br>
<br>
As for Iksar loving me.... well the best I can get is indifferent, and I suspect I will always be Kill on sight to the Shaman guild. No where in the history of the Iksar does it say they are Xenophobic (spelling). So it leaves open the door to use anyone they think they can.<br>
<br>
And the point made by another on Neriak... Yes I know the wine quest. It requires invis to get there. And it requires a minimum (now anyway, dont think it did before) amount of faction with the giver. A troll friend made the mistake of angering the guards in Neriak and is now KOS there and he cant do the quest because his faction is to low with the giver. (though sneak would work if he had it). It is , as pointed out, all the way in the back of Neriak. This is why I said it is hard. )<br>
<br>
Barbarian quests also require some small amount of faction but as I understand it can be worked around if you are careful and research them right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufalconeroftunare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falconer of Tunare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 9:52:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *cries* No!

<br>
Yeah, I can understand your Rant. I feel pretty much the same when the wood elf ranger of Tunare tries to invite the dark elf shadowknight of Innoruuk into the group. Sure the rules allow it, and there are roleplay cases where it might happen, but I still feel its against the grain of Norrath.<br>
<br>
But even for roleplayers, sometimes game convience comes first. <br>
<br>
I personally would have prefered a more faction based ruleset, rather than the &quot;alignment&quot; idea. For instance, a devout cleric of Quellious isn't really likely to join with a warrior of Rallos, or a Paladin of Brell grouping with a bard of Veeshan. All choices, however are neutral....<br>
<br>
From what I've seen, all the alignment idea does is force &quot;light races&quot; to choose the neutral option they have, to allow them to work with the evil guy who gets no choices. And theres nothing to reinforce the Racial/Cultural differences between different characters. But undoubtably VI would have been flamed if they had tried to introduce rules that gave penalties to Iksar who like softskins. <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/jimturner99/gyrhawk"></center> <b><center>Gyrhawk - Tunare's Falconer</center></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzarsissrazorscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarsiss Razorscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 11:02:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *cries* No!

Each Iksar is Norrath as I see it. We do not pitch one nation against another, or one soft skin against another. That is the domain of Cazic Thule, who has graciously sat us at the center to host and witness that wondrous fear. We are not petty. We may favor an Elf, light or dark, just as readily as we would favor a fellow Iksar. There surely is nothing wrong with choosing disdain for all others, but what benefit does the trunk receive by disdaining it’s foliage? <br>

The only way he'd consider grouping with them is if they were the slave of some other Iksar, and he'd certainly never treat one as an equal. He doesn't care if you've managed to get your faction to indifferent in Cabilis; ok, so the guards won't kill you, you're still a secondclass creature and he'll act like a great big southern redneck racist to you. (Well, more refined than that, but that's the general idea.)<br>
<br>
I realize that this means he'll never be uber in EQ terms, due to the lack of clerics and chanters and such to group with, but I wouldn't feel right RPing an Iksar any other way. I'm just surprised, like Kelisk, that so few others seem to share this point of view. Every stitch of Iksar lore I've ever read has indicated, to me, that they are a very insular and proud people, and wouldn't stoop to accept the aid of any others. In contrast, the majority of Iksar I've seen on FV have chosen to consort with the softskins freely. (And I'm not accusing them of not RPing. I've actually had some interesting in-character debates with some of them.)<br>
<br>
In my view, they're kinda like Klingons. To take the analogy a little further, the Klingons did eventually ally themselves with the Federation due to mutual gain, but there were always (very vocal high-ranking) members of the Klingon Empire who opposed it, and even the ones who did cooperate with the Federation did so with an attitude of superior disdain. They didn't do them any favors unless there was a measured gain for the Klingon Empire as well. Look at how many hoops Picard had to jump through and debts he had to pull in to get a cloaked ship in that episode where he had to go to Romulus. The alliance was always uneasy even at its best.<br>

I'm holding out hope that once we manage to get enough people online to form our Iksar-only RP guild, that more will flock to the banner and we'll be able to get some more Iksar-only groups going. Maybe we'll even surprise everyone and manage some high-level stuff without any outside help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upakuachuan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PakuaChuan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 12:02:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /agree Kelisk</span><hr size=1> Problem with Iksar only guilds be at the high level -- no clerics. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Verant in its wisdom decided the Iksar had fallen far enough down not to have clerics. No clerics, heal spells are harder to come by, and rezzes almost impossible. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Sorry to say this, as I wish it was possible for Iksar to have their own separate world, like the story line goes. <p>Pakua Chuan <BR>

Yes, it makes things tough purely from a gameplay perspective, but that makes Iksar-only groups no less viable from a roleplaying standpoint.<br>
<br>
I look at it as a challenge, but not an insurmountable one if you have some good players. Between having shaman and necros for healing (yes, necros make pretty good healers if need be), plus natural regen to reduce downtime, I think an all Iksar group could hold its own in pretty much all but some of the most high-end encounters.<br>
<br>
There's nothing stopping Iksar from having their own separate empire, except the players' OOC desire to have rezzes and other such conveniences available. They don't have enchanters either, but remarkable things can be done with root-parking. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 2:03:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I was pointing out the  reason that other iskar get along</span><hr size=1> I've grouped with a massive 2 iskar on this server both were roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Once in the crypt of Dalnir : with a lizards that was interested in hireing merc's for use by the empire, after subjugeting us to his terror , and seeing signs of fear did he then dirrect us about.. (group with us and main tanked)<br>
<br>
The second time wasn't really a group I was checking the time that haddan was killed so i could show up later. After a prolonged religuos agruement over which was greater and originated the other Fear, and Hate. I cursed the iskar with my Hatred ( AC/HP,HP,AC buffs) then showed him the true power of Hate ( darknessed Haddan so he didn't run off ) cursed him again with the power of hate ( sup heal ) then claimed the soul of Haddan for Innoruuk, ( stun/wrath after Haddan was below 50 % health )<br>
<br>
I've also been harassed by a few iskar for being a lesser being etc, but that is good roleplay any way so either way, some Iskar have a more open minded veiw of others, you don't like us &quot;shrug&quot; don't ask for a rez then and comprimise your roleplay even when you just lost 46 and are 4 blue away from it again.<br>
<br>
I don't deal with light elves for the same reason they are the opposite of my view for my character. Each to their own but it's a small world are there enough other iskar out there to support your way of roleplaying ?<br>
