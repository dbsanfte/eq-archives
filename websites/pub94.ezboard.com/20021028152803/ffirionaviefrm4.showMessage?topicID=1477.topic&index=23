<br>
So in that case yeah, the warrior should get them if he's the only that can use them.  If that warrior has a lot of honor...well that warrior would pass down his current peice to the group, whether they could use it or not, however that doesn't really have to happen to be nbg, it's just a really nice idea.  <br>
<br>
What if something no one can use drops?  Well, by my logic that could sell and bring the same amount of money to anyone in the group, it should be rolled on by all.  Now if you have better gear than most of the group, maybe when it's your time to pick an item you pass.. But you dont have to, you earned that gear just as much as anyone else.<br>
<br>
Exception to this, for me, is in a group of friends or a guild group, something *nice* that none of us can use drops, i have no problem with one of us just keeping it and giving it to a friend/guildie that can use it later.<br>
<br>
Example of greed before need:  Say you were in plane of growth, and there were two clerics.  One cleric had thurgadin legs, one cleric had junky legs.  PoG legs drop, go to the cleric with thurg legs (they are almost the same) because they like them better.  But that cleric doesn't pass down their thurg legs.  That's greedy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udvara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dvara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 6:00:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_money.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: nbg</span><hr size=1> Look at it another way,<br>
<br>
Warrior gets item he needs, you say wtg man. Warrior remembers you helped him get that item which was an upgrade.<br>
<br>
A month later, you want a Bonecaster robe or something, you need a meatshield to help you, guess who is going to likely remember your courtesy back in Velk's? that right the warrior whos day you made last month.<br>
<br>
Eq isnt about instant rewards, think of EQ in the long term and make some freinds along the way by being generous about things you cant use, and someone else can. It has a way of coming back to you. Besides, I dont know of any Necros running around Velk's with cloth sleeves &lt;snicker&gt; but I get your point. <p><img src="http://www.yahara.net/fortim/Dvara.jpg"border="0">

I hunted in seb the other day at Chef... a Mrylo Bracer dropped.  That sells for a ton.  And I already had one, and it went to the other rogue.  ANd that's how I've always done it, even though a straight /rand would work better for me, since I buy a lot of my gear and thus have better gear than what drops in the zones I can hunt in.<br>

I will just say that I firmly believe on NBG  I have a rather large number of friends new and old that I group with and we always use NBG IMHO it is the best way to go I am from a very old blue server before commin to FV and when I see a wizzy (or some some thing )  rolling or a warrior item or a necro item so they can feed a alt it gets me upset because I feel if they want to gear up a alt they should play the alt..... and believe me being a lvl 30 pally running around in banded still because I cannot seem to beat a druid on a plate drop or a 2hs drop  gets a little on the old side <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  now that I am a fairly high lvl  warrior on FV and have gained many honorable friends here I have a simple way of choosing who I group with a second time  and here is how I decide who to group with more than once  at the end of a group when loot is being delt with if a person isnt greedy with the drop and doesnt cry about not getting a drop if one doesnt drop that they can use I will group with them again... ie if hunting in a place and only cleric stuff drops and the cleric can use the items that drop in my oppinion it would all goto the cleric if no one throws up a bitch that the cleric got all the drops I will group with them again and if they ask me to goto a place where items drop for them or ask me to go be the meat shield for some named mob that drops a item they want I will happily go with them and take the hits I end up in places for weeks on end where no warrior items drop and dont care (even though I still need gear) I figure they are good people and some time in the future they will probably come and help me out in my time of need <br>
 I dont group with loot whores and really havent found many of them  IMO the &quot;game&quot; everquest is meant to be fun and its not fun to watch people disgrace themselves whinning about sheet like items because if one drops guess what a second will drop as well just get a group and hit a place till the stuff drops that the people there need then goto the next place  heck goto a place that no one knows or have ever been to thats the funnest time when ya dont know whaats going on what drops what haveing to run for  your life to a zone line that your not sure if you can get back to or not or people saying &quot; OOOOO  whats that is sounds cool &quot;  or walking up to a door and wondering if your going to have to eat a death because you dont know that theres 7 63 lvl mobs sitting behind the door waiting to eat some stupid iksar that cannot fight off the temptation to open the door while pulling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  though I  like it when my monk brother who is 5 lvls my junior has grown so accustome to pullling red mobs that he doesnt think anything of it when pulling for a group of his own lvl or lower group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (hehe that is fun when I hear him say OOOHHH SHIT  forgot who I was with ) ......... I am getting the feeling now that I have digressed from the topic just a tad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 So NBG works it works good and it can be used for a great many other things that getting items it can be used and is used for judging your character and if you get help from others in the future because of it I have gained friends that I have banzied into Hate to get there bodies rezzed and ported out I have ate many deaths for friends to help them out and I will keep doing it until they get what it is they are looking for why because they are friends and thats what friends do they put themselves at risk to help each other out they jump out of the fox hole to pull them back to a medic or even sometimes a priest.... thats what I would do for  my friends and thats what my friends would do for me    exp is easy to get  loot is easy to get   good friends and a good name is not that easy to get  so  get  good friends and they will help you do what you need   trust me on this   there your friends want to be your friends  they want to hunt with you ... why because there your friends so there going to do what it takes to keep you hunting with them its not rocket science  its just plain every day old fashioned friendship....<br>

That seems fairly equitable to me.  Though in some cases, certain items are MORE useful to some classes than others.  Like if you found a bracelet with +10 int and +2 agi, I would think you'd expect that to go to a wizard rather than a warrior.<br>
<br>
However, if someone comes into the group and says, &quot;Hey, I'm looking for a Blackened Crystalline Robe down here,&quot; for example, I would expect the group to give that person the item, unless there was someone else in the group who was also particularly looking for it.  But then again, I would also expect that the person looking for the robe would forfeit the opportunity to roll on other equipment, unless no one else in the group needed or wanted it.<br>
<br>
It's a tough call on what's getting your due rewards and what's being too greedy.  But in general I'd say that if someone in the party can use it and wants to equip it, it should be given to them and not to someone who wants to sell it. <p><div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/velsig.jpg"><BR>

So instaed I was at a camp that drop noting for me, but it was helping the melees out a lot.  Should I have said well I will go with you, but only if you camp where I want or maybe roll on the FBSS so I could what sell it to some twink that never saw the inside of a tough dungeon...(well at the time it was tough).  No.  When I make up pick up groups I explain the rules ( or try to remember to I am so use to not having to that at the end I just impose them) and if you dont like them leave dont group with me not going to hurt my feeling at all...side bar Twig only 202 on tailoring, I am sure I need someone with 250 get killing....So for the most part I think your example suck at the start and if you see in forming a group I am guessing you will want to avoid it as you will not like the loot rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1477.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1477.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1477.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1477.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1477.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
