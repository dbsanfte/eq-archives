was so obviously out of frustrastion how can he be faulted for that?

That being said, I have had one positive experience with AS ( that was with Shayde, many months ago ) compared to 10 times that in the negative. Times that I have been KS'd, pushed out of camps, and have had garbage spewed at me by AS members (many of which, I don't see around anymore) far out-weigh the good experience of meeting Shayde. Does that make the whole guild bad? NO. But, a few bad apples screw up the reputation for the guild, and if leadership doesn't &quot;fix&quot; the problem then the GUILD gets the rap. <br>I am not saying that whenever something negative happens in game that the guild tag is AS, far from it. As I said, by shear proportions of positive/negative experiences here, the negative is winning out and I can see where there is at least some credability to the flaming posts.<br>The only AS member that I know by name is Shayde but, the guild tag sticks.

But, what you see as a mob mentality attack is a collective voice realising that &quot;gee, I'm not the only one&quot;.  Yes, the individual &quot;random&quot; acts may be small, and might have been overlooked, but they are compounded when the collective begins to notice the &quot;I'm not the only one&quot;.<br><br>Granted, I have only been playing EQ since last Dec and I came from a pretty tame blue server (7th Hammer) and have never gotten higher than 28 (my present level), but I have been intentionally trained on only once in the months I have played.  What was the guild tag of those doing the training?  Awakened Souls.  At the time, did I say anything, do anything, no, I considered it minor, nothing to get upset over.  I let them win, I left the area.  it wasn't worth it to me to give them my energy which is what I would have done if I had spent the time and effort to do something.  Did I remember the individuals who did it? No, but I did remember the &lt;Awakened Souls&gt; after both of their names.  It was small, it was petty (heck, it couldn't have been more than 25-30 level characters since I was, I think, 22-ish at the time), but it did leave a bad taste in my mouth.  If I hadn't heard other accounts of other people with similar tales of mistreatment, I would have shelved it in my mind under random one time occurance and eventually forgotten it.  But... finding other &quot;me too&quot; stories does compound it and adds to the bad feeling I have in my mind for you guild.<br><br>The fact you not only accect but condone and laud the practice of ebaying and other blatant EULA violations does not do your &quot;cause&quot; any good.   Yet another besmirching of your guild's repuation in my mind.  If you are willing to break the rules in this, why do you think all the other rules are being upheld.  That you excuse your actions by saying &quot;but they do it&quot; is pitiful and weak.  They who do it, any who do it, are not right, so why do you think you are right by doing it.  As most of us probably heard too much in childhood, &quot;two wrongs do not make a right&quot;.<br><br>I'm sorry you feel you are in a beleagered guild, but you and they have brought it upon themselves.<br><br>Who am I? no one, nobody important, not anyone of consequence, but yes I am part of the body of the community, those you would like to call a mob, and the community is against the very things you think are not only acceptable but laudable.  <br><br>It is not the feeding frenzy of a mob you see, but the upswelling of a community rising with a voice against what they perceive to be wrong.  Do you honestly believe that -all- the stories could be false or misunderstandings or tainted interpretations?  Reputation is something you create.<br><br>-Caillou Kyrielle (Caillou's player)<br>&lt;Saga&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BakoFV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Ladies Leezard</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 3:46:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Awakened Souls-Sindell</span><hr size=1> its because when you are on the outside looking in, you see things at an askewed angle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Bako Emberfist<BR>Caparelli Furio<BR>Guild Leader of Fire and Fury<BR>Firiona Vie<BR>- Everythings so blurry, and everyones so fake.<BR>Everybodys empty, and everything is so messed up.<BR>-Puddle of Mud.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uattumadabeast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Attuma Dabeast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keeper of the Heads</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 3:47:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Awakened Souls-Sindell</span><hr size=1> *hides his torch behind his back*<br><br>Im glad your sticking up for your guild sin but come -on you reap what you sow.Hell i am known for saying i only care about DS members and a few friends and the rest are just shadows but i do help.I even helped a little halfling druid with a CR and died twice trying to get his body.Cause even i know that RPing a evil ogre and only caring about his guild will make people think im a jerk.<br><br>Would i care? well no but if tons of people jumped on the Attuma's a asshole wagon i couldnt say they were all lying.<br><br>And i think Assouls is kinda catchy!

I realize you are trying to defend your guild, because I'm sure you all have a lot of fun together and do a lot of really interesting things and kill UberMobs with very little competition.  I'm sure that, from the inside, your guild is a well-oiled, functioning machine that gets its job of acquiring loot done extremely well.<br><br>I don't know anybody in your guild, I've only run across a few of your people ever, and I haven't personally been on the receiving end of any of the many things your membership has been accused of doing.  All I have to go on is what I see here on these boards and what I hear in game.  Coming up on having been here a year ( that fast already?   wow...,) I have never seen so much venom and so many accusations lobbed at any other guild that has ever existed here.<br><br>Your folks have openly stated that they don't, and aren't interested in, roleplaying.  Fine, I suppose.  But when this is combined with your having ganked Ragefire from a well-deserving member of our server, causing XP loss in the bazaar, training, killing bankers, cursing in /shout, supporting ebays, and just generally not giving a shit about anyone else on the server, you do have a huge problem.<br><br>Knowing all this, I did last night respond to Taiil's request to rez his loudmouthed friend ( who is not in AS, I know,) because hopefully that small act might lead to their doing a good deed for someone else down the road.  Most of us try to maintain a good sense of community and not cause havoc wherever we go.  Unfortunately, none of all these complaints seems to have made your guild leadership decide to follow a friendlier course of action.  Instead, however, we get responses like &quot;Blow me,&quot; which show a lack of maturity and an incapability to respond intelligently to an argument.  Is it really that difficult to play nice?  I'm sure you could have all the ebays and non-RP uberd00dz you want, if only you could just respect the fact that there are other people that play here.  But it doesn't look like you care at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwyrdup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyrd Up</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 546<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:27:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   well</span><hr size=1> From the very day the guild was created, I've gotten nothing but bad impressions.  First they came here saying &quot;We aren't going to roleplay&quot; ... uhm.. ding number 1.<br><br>Then I've had several run ins where individuals were jerks.  But truthfully, not many of those, and that has happened from FnF and Resolution members as well.  <br><br>What totally ticked me off was the run in with Blayze.  Gather up 20 folks in Skyfire to take down Ragefire and have AS (the entire guild!!!! Not an individual) basically take it because they got better communications and way more practice, and because &quot;they could&quot;.<br><br>Then add in many MANY descriptions of individuals in AS going rampant in velketor's lab, acting as if they owend the place.  No personal experience, but it adds up when you hear it from several different sources.<br><br>So my opinions are my own, and that is simply that AS is ASses... sorry. Individuals are ok maybe, but together, they seem to be some of the worst out there.<br><br>PR might be your solution. Turn around, go help the community, dont step over the little folks. Yeah, it means having to care for someone other than your immediate guildmates.. it's a lot more work, but in the long run, a lot more rewarding. <p><center><img src="http://www.sa.il24.net/~saran/kyrial/kyrialsig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubormwarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Borm Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:48:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1220.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well</span><hr size=1> I will add only that Sindell has been nothing but kind, helpful and a credit to her guild in every aspect of my interaction with her.
