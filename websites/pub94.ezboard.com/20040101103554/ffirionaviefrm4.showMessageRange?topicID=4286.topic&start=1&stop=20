Somebody that I called a friend did it and I think it’s very wrong. I went off. I’ll explain why I think it’s wrong. There is no need for names as this is a discussion of the principle, so don't point any fingers at people you know that did it.<br>
<br>
I think when people buy/sell platinum, it contributes to the decline of quality people on this server. People sell the platinum for cash, and it contributes to people coming to FV for the No Drop rules as they can get better equipment for their cash here. That’s what keeps the ebay trade going and directly affects the quality of EQ for players on our server. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, the point of being in a guild is to work together to accomplish things. Why would the guild ever work to raid a target if the members are just going to buy platinum and get the drop without raiding? What’s the point in moving to the next tier if you are just going to buy the items past that? If it’s not any fun to work your way up, then why be in a guild that is full of members wanting to work their way up? <br>
<br>
When a person works to get plat and buys something, that’s part of the ingame economy. When a person buys plat to buy items, that’s helping people that don’t care at all about the quality of the server. <br>
<br>
I know the ingame economy is broken because there is no limit on how much money is on the server. Also, there aren’t enough ways to pull money back out of the game to get the ingame economy stable. Think of how rarely you buy anything from vendors. Most money drops of mobs and never gets out of circulation.<br>
<br>
But, I still think it’s wrong and makes the server worse. Plat dealers make it easy for anyone that wants to take advantage of the No Drop rules here to start up a character and have Planer or better gear on day 1. No working their way up; often no bother with really learning their class. Most don’t care about an ingame community beyond a few people that think like them: push as high as you can as fast as you can. I don’t care about the server economy, but I do care about the server community. The bazaar made it too easy for these plat dealers to thrive and for these jerks to flock to this server.<br>
<br>
Buying platinum helps keep the dealers in business so they are available for even more jerks to jump to FV and gear up. Because of the high level gear, they are in their 50s fast and we all wind up dealing with them. Trains, profanity in shouts, and just all around jerks. There are a LOT more on this server than there used to be. I started on this server with a half elf warrior. At one point I tried to switch to another server because I wanted more than one character. Anyone who’s played on other servers knows the crowd on FV a year ago was much more mature than on other servers. That’s what brought me back. Now FV is sliding down. It’s too convenient for them to jump over here and get uber. People can buy a naked character, gear it up, and go play. Tell me it doesn’t affect anyone when you are grouped with a 60 cleric that doesn’t know what all their spells do or an epic monk that doesn’t really understand FD. <br>
<br>
So what do you think? Some people who think ebaying is wrong still think buying platinum is ok. I know this isn’t the only factor. Am I overreacting when I get mad?  Am I stupid for thinking this has a negative impact on the quality of the game for people who play on FV? Has it ever affected you?  <br>

<br>
It's a slight hijacking of your thread to be sure.<br>
<br>
People will buy whatever will aid them in anyway.  Be it to get that random_drop_03 or that nice_armor_01.  People know this, and will set the price to match the fact they have something that someone wants.<br>
<br>
Plat is the same.  Only difference is the fact that someone is spending Real Life (tm) dollars for it.  And the person selling it?  Probably spent Real Life (tm) time getting it.  <br>
<br>
Not all of us can be on EQ all the time to get what we want.  Some will buy plat and think nothing of it, some will mention they did, and some will get flamed for it.<br>
<br>
Some of us care, and some of us don't.<br>
<br>
The deciding point is, as always, you.   Can you live with it?  Does it bug you?  Answer yourself first. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.salvasti.com/EQ/" target="top">Bryannae Salvasti</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Here is a question for people.<br>
<br>
If the price of pp dropped to 5$ per 100,000 how many of you would buy?<br>
<br>
Think of that honestly.  <br>
<br>
There is that piece of elemental gear in the bazaar....which you will in all honestly probably never see.  It is priced at 100,000pp ....and for $5 you could have it in whatever time it takes to do the deal on some ebay thing.<br>
<br>
How many of you would/wouldnt do it?<br>
<br>
The answer to that question leads to other questions...<br>
<br>
Morality?<br>
Fair play?<br>
What is RL time worth?<br>
What is RL money worth (ie $200 to one person is like $5 to another)?<br>
<br>
But just for starters....if 100k sold for $5....how many of you would do it?<br>
<br>
Personally I dont care.  Heck maybe im for it....I have some nice items for sale if you buy pp....maybe you will buy my items ....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then I could afford to buy that nice piece of sometin I want!<br>

It's thier money they are throwing away on it. To my understanding. The plats are earned on this server. The transfer from one charactor to the next doesnt effect the economy. The money was here already. The problem of e-bayed charactors is another thing tho. As the actions of the players of these charactors does have a tangiable effect on others around them. ( That is if we are useing the assumtion that everyone who buys a charactor has no experiance in that class.)<br>
<br>
If your a trader in the bazaar. With semi-good gear and weapons for sale. You've been payed with bought plats. It's that common now. I dont see anyone complaining about waking up and checking your trader to find you've made 10k.<br>

<br>
I think that's a silly sentiment.<br>
<br>
What contributes to the decline of &quot;quality people&quot; on this server, are several things. People who insult roleplayers, people who insult the raiders, people who toss the PNP out the window.  These people contribute to quality people leaving.<br>
<br>
I really don't see how someone buying plat would contribute to good people leaving, or contribute to good people declining to come play here.<br>

<br>
 <br>
People who come here and whine about plat are people who can't really afford it or can't go past some mental block. To make 100k on the server it would take a person a LONG time unless they struck some good deal. 100$-150$ is a couple days work. How many of you can make 100kpp in two days of playing EQ? Not too many.<br>
This isn't about ruining the server, this isn't about quality of people, all this is a sneaky way to say you are jealous. That is the end of it.<br>
I made enough buying/trading but if I needed 100kpp all of a sudden I wouldn't even have a hint of 'guilt' about buying that with real money. I'm not a kid anymore, I don't have much time to play EQ and if I want to increase MY enjoyment of the game by paying some extra money for it who the hell are you to tell me not to do that?<br>
<br>
And once again, if 100kpp was 5$ would you do it? Damn right you would, so please... <p>Silenius<br>

<br>
I agree with her 100%.<br>
<br>
Its not buying platinum that contributes to the low quality of players. I doubt that more than 5% of the people who buy plat suck that bad. If you couldn't buy plat, people who are rude and obnoxious would still come to our server, they'd just have to work up to get the items they want *shrug* Considering how fast many of them rise in levels, my guess would be that they know the game well and know where to go and how to play.<br>
<br>
Ebayers are not necessarily bad. Many are, yes, because they're complete newbies who've never played, buying high leveled epiced characters and going out there with a level 1 mentality (God I remember how stupid I was about this game just last December). But there are also folks who buy ebayed alts who have played to 65, and probably even played an alt of that class to whatever level, so thus know how to play. I'm sure a lot more people are ebayed than we know about, just because they were bought by knowledgeable people.<br>
<br>
The people that lower the quality of our server are the immature assholes who treat others with disrespect and who have no consideration or compassion for others.<br>

Some people pay a bit more, that's there choice.<br>

If no one bought plat then there wouldn't be a person selling it but they do *shrugs* the same thing could be said for illegal drugs.<br>

Will the plat increase there fun ? I hope so.<br>

Personally I'd not harass a friend about buying plat it's there choice and there money.<br>

Anyway it's against the contract you sign to play the game, but speeding is against the laws of the state you live in.<br>

Is it &quot;wrong&quot; yes it is. Is it worth loseing a friend over ? Not in my opinion.<br>

I have very limited time to play and would love to have great gear. But I also want to feel like I've played the game and earned what I've accomplished in terms of gameplay. <br>
<br>
Some people buy a game and the walkthrough book at the same time and work their way through both together. Wrong? Not wrong. But not how I want to play. <br>
<br>
I don't get mad because people buy plat. If I know someone buys success in a game with real life money, though, they lose my respect. It's kind of sad that it's not enough to play the game and they have to buy success/happiness in the game.<br>
<br>
Ebay and plat for RL money are the Gameshark codes of EQ. It's not how I want to beat the boss. <br>

A lot of people in this thread seem to think buying plat is acceptable ... yet how many would say buying characters is acceptable? <br>
<br>
If I only have 2 hours to play a night, and my friends play more, is it ok for me to buy an Ebayed character? I really don't see the difference. You invest a certain amount of time into the game, whether it be earning platinum or advancing your character. Using real money to do either is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>clearly against the rules</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as set forth by Sony, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and those of you who condemn ebaying characters but go ahead and buy platinum are hypocrites</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

Go up and re-read DriaAnn's post which clearly outlines the rules.<br>

Saying that complainers are just jealous is stupid. No, I'm not jealous of the fantastic stuff that some people have bought. I look forward to the day when I might be around to see it claimed as a reward for a particularly challenging encounter. But no, I'm not jealous.

I would have no moral problem buying pp in order to save myself some of the &quot;newbie blues&quot; and start getting to know more people.<br>

The reason that I do not is because on my home server, the people who farm cash tend to be inconsiderate hogs who don't hesitate to dampen everyone else's good time in the name of scarfing up more pp or items to sell to players.<br>
<br>
While I'm sure that there are friendly and honorable &quot;cash farmers&quot; out there, I have no idea who or where they are.
