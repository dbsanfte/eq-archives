<br>
What it would be like if you could banned for being out of character?<br>
<br>
How would the end game look? <br>
<br>
How would market channel look?<br>
<br>
This is not about the mechanics of how it would be enforced but just a question about how it would be after the enforcement.<br>
<br>
Imagine a 3 strikes and your out policay.<br>
<br>
Imagine it being wrong for a paladin and an SK to play together without some serier RP excuses.<br>
<br>
Well thats my thought for the day, I have not come to a conclusion yet as to how I think it would be. A few guilds and folks would be totaly unchanged, others would be shattered.<br>
<br>
Some grindage groups would play exactly as they are, others would after a few minutes of interacting with be given at least one warning :-)<br>

I'm thinking you could make a rp-enforced server like that in Neverwinters Nights, though.

<br>
The key to an enforceable &quot;roleplay&quot; ruleset would be unambiguous rules. They couldn't be a bunch of subjective judgements (those only work in small groups where you can reach a group consensus).<br>
<br>
So, you couldn't have &quot;Rule #18: Pick a racially-appropriate name that reflects your cultural heritage.&quot; - because that is subjective. Maybe I think &quot;Ellywig&quot; sounds very gnomish, but you think all gnomish names have 18 syllables and sound like bad german?<br>
<br>
You would either have to have &quot;Rule #18: Pick a name from one of the appropriate racial lists below:&quot; or something akin to Verant's naming policy and name filter, where you ban specific, defined types of names. &quot;Rule #18c: No numerals used to replace letters in names.&quot; Or, for something like the name rules, you would have to have to have each name submitted to someone for approval - not a very efficient process for a massive EQish game, very doable with small groups (think NWN or tabletop games).<br>
<br>
Once you had that clear ruleset in, you would have a bunch of people testing it initially, and periodic incursions afterwards to see if you still mean it. But the rest of the population would settle in within the limits, just like they do in any other gaming environment. They would match their playstyle and expectations to what was available.<br>
<br>
If you went with anything subjective, you'd have constant bickering that would destroy the server. Period.<br>
<br>
You would have to take an enormous number of game issues and draw lines - where is the line between attacking guards as roleplay and lazy powerlevelling d00dism? Is it roleplay or griefing when someone buffs the monster you are fighting? And so on.<br>
<br>
Ideally, The rules would be set up to encourage a roleplay environment (within whatever game mechanic limits there are). For example, on a &quot;roleplay&quot; server, I would expect the NPCs to speak their native language (and maybe a couple extra) - rather than them being fluent in everything like they are now. Languages start to have value if the game engine gives them value.<br>
<br>
The most fundamental thing you would need to set up a roleplay server is a very cynical outlook regarding your players... you would have to realize that ANY and EVERY loophole that can be used to evade the rules or grief other players will be, and adjust your rules accordingly. You cannot base a ruleset on the assumption that everyone will play fair and do their best to adhere to the spirit of the rules... they don't. Most do, but it only takes that small, dedicated core of wankers to ruin a game - and those folks will be rules lawyers. They will know every nuance, and find a way to argue that they are entitled to their &quot;fun&quot;, regardless of the cost to others.<br>

I don't think I'd like it. Who's to say, really, whether my character concept is good RP or not? If I play the concept correctly, does the race and class matter? I'd hate to constantly be on the receiving end of GM and guide inquiries about whether or not my High Elf Enchanter really has a good reason to be enjoying a cool glass of ale with that Erudite Necromancer. (Before you ask, yes, he does. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I also suspect the GMs and guides would be driven mad by the petition queue. There'd be a huge number of complaints about this guy's use of abbreviations, that guy's failure to use &quot;ye olde propere Englishe,&quot; that improper group, this bad use of /shout, etc. I suspect, after a while, the GMs and guides would just stop enforcing it altogether.<br>
<br>
Now, if RP enforcement involved ditching people who refuse to separate OOC and IC in conversation, and who say things like &quot;crack plz k thx&quot; and call that an IC statement, I'd be all for it, and I think the server would be better off because of it. <p>Illudin<br>

<br>
If it means &quot;there are basic, clear guidelines regarding unacceptable behaviours and the ruleset is tweaked to encourage roleplay interactions&quot; you get one possible scenario.<br>
<br>
If it means &quot;vague or subjective interpretation of what roleplay is, with inconsistent enforcement and alot of perceived bias in said enforcement&quot; you get a whole different possible scenario.<br>
<br>
The two questions are so intimately tied together that you can't answer the question (what would it be like) without answering the premise (define &quot;roleplay&quot; and &quot;enforced&quot;).<br>
<br>
It's like asking what it would be like to live on another planet, without mentioning what planet. Living on Mars would be a whole different thing than a colony on Pluto.<br>

<br>
RP enforced to me would mean keeping OOC chatter OUT of the game.  The OOC channel would be reinstated to let people talk OOC.  After all, why remove it?  You can turn it off if you don't like it - when you remove it completely, people just start abusing /auction and /shout.<br>
<br>
A petition and a report of some OOC chatter...last nights game score, for instance, in a say channel instead of a private chat channel or a tell...well, that would be that.  Gm would see it, and the person would lose the ability to speak for an hour.  The next violation would be a day, and the next would be a week.<br>
<br>
Twinking would be against the rules, either using the drop and roll method or the hand off to a friend method.  All items would be level appropriate anyways, like some of the luclin items, so you couldn't even hand off uber gear.  Characters that were found to be twinked by a conclave of GMs could have all their equipment wiped and given a few items to replace it...you lost your full set of Ry'Gorr, here's some leather, be happy with it.<br>
<br>
The GMs themselves would hold events, and more than weddings, holiday events, and the occasional spawn stuff til everyone dies 3 times events.  There'd be a mass storyline involving lots and lots of characters...good vs evil maybe, or good vs evil vs Iksar.  Imagine, suddenly Kunark is overrun by hordes of iksar...level 63 Iksar roam throughout the entire continent, turning Firiona Vie and the Overthere outpost into ghost towns...an Iksar GM leads a crusade against Freeport, or Kaladim, or maybe to wipe out those Thule-blaspheming Trolls in Innothule.  Light elves wage war on dark elves.  Trolls and Ogres clash in fierce border wars, with frogloks and lizardmen caught in the middle.<br>
<br>
Well...enough rambling.  That's just what I'd picture an RP enforced server to be.  Not justifying HOW you RP, but whether or not you actually attempt it.  Kinda like how you can't fail Art class in grade school unless you don't do any work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udanykalla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Danykalla</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f95.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/19/02 8:16:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2163.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/willowswood/images/Pally3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If FV was role play enforced</span><hr size=1> I completely agree with Madrain.<br>

I like the high fantasy setting of VIs FPS also, and FV still has the least corrupted backdrop. <br>

OnT: I'd do well in an RP enforced server. I like rules, and I like being around people who like, or can at least follow, rules. DAoC advertised RP Enforced servers. I played a bit there and saw no difference between those and the regular servers. VI, in their quest to push the bottom line down even lower, at least advertised this as a RP Preferred server. Everyone knew, going in, that this would be no different than a blue server. If this were an RP Enforced server, you would lose your FnFs and your Resolutions and any other group of people that came here for uncontested end game encounters. You need cross teaming to get much of that game done. An Iksar only society would never stand a chance of reclaiming all of Kunark, for example, being void of clerics and wizards. So, IMO, were FV RP Enforced, you'd have a fairly pleasent (quiet) gaming atmosphere, but it would come at the price of less content. <p><CENTER>

The bad thing about this is that d00ds would still come, but because they only have one character on the server, they cannot twink their newbie characters and reputation is now a big thing in Firiona Vie. Meaning if you were an ubber guild leader on one of the Zeks, transfer to Vie, expecting everyone to bow before you, everyone would just put you on ignore for your horrible roleplaying skills. I've also heard that many of the roleplaying guilds wouldn't come to this server because of their friends on the others so this would be kinda a haven for them if they're allowed to transfer. Good for roleplayers, bad for d00dz. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uegilbe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>egilbe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/19/02 8:03:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2163.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: stupid decisions</span><hr size=1> Who's to say that you can't find a roleplay reason to be twinked.  Say, a young adventurer, after burying his parents, finds a complete set of Ry'gorr armor, and magical weapons, buried in an old closet. He dons the armor and weapons and goes forth to slay some small critters with it, while also building up thier combat skills.<br>
<br>
See! a roleplay reason to be twinked.<br>
