<br>
My faction with the Crushbone Orcs and with the Indigo Brotherhood begin low (as in, KOS) and are currently at the very bottom (as in, kill-anything-nearby-on-sight).  My faction with the Dwarves of Kaladim is incredibly high (allied, in fact) as it is in Kelethin (duh).<br>
<br>
However, the ideology and philosophy of true neutrality requires that one balance good and evil, not getting involved in the conflicts between races, or between religions, or between good and evil.  This is difficult, since, due to my race and religion, I'm Kill-On-Sight in most &quot;evil&quot; cities.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that it might be interesting to attempt to play a wood elven Druid who sees the schism between the Koada'Dal and the Tier'Dal as balanced, with the Fier'Dal roughly between, but it doesn't seem to me that there's any easy way to build faction in Neriak, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  de facto</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, one's faction tilts towards &quot;good&quot; because the Tier'Dal attack us on sight.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as a player, I simply try to avoid certain racial conflicts--like Grimling vs. Vah Shir, or Dwarf vs. Goblin--in order to maintain my &quot;neutrality&quot;.  I'm just wondering if there might be a more &quot;pro-active&quot; (gagh!  Someone stop me from these buzzwords!) way of maintaining one's putative (there I go again!) neutrality.<br>

Absolute neutrality is really hard to understand and roleplay. It always seems to come off as some weird zen riddle and is fraught with contradictions. But it always seemed to me that most neutrality is not absolute neutrality when you think about it.<br>
<br>
For example in the case of druids they're only neutral in the sense that both good and evil can work against the interests of nature. Thus what would really freak a druid out are rumors of a wizard war, corruption of the land or invasions by undead or demons...all not natural things. The fact that some of those psychopathic Tier' Dal are killing Koada'Dal is just not really that important, just politics. The fact that the Tier' Dal want to kill you is a good reason to avoid them, and you meet the occassional one you can deal with (PC's in other words), but they're not important enough to oppose. And really, when the Koada'Dal get some sort of crazed ambition to &quot;make the world a better place&quot;, and start considering what magics to use, they're almost as dangerous.<br>
<br>
Indeed the fact the Tier'Dal want to kill you just shows they are sadly obsessed with politics and don't realise what is important in the world. That being the natural world on which we all depend.<br>
<br>
That said, I think you could make a decent play on hating those who use un-natural powers. I thought of making a high-elf cleric who will heal everyone except magicians, necromancers and shadow-knights on the basis that pets are an affront against nature <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That's my take on it anyway, there's lots of others.<br>

It's just a matter of what camp your in. Both good and evil will scheme, murder and steal in EQ, and call themselves in the right. <br>
<br>
IMO, true neutral would not get the extremes of good and evil involved in their philosophy, since they are identical to one another. <br>
<br>
Rather, a neutral would be concerned with the balance of chaos and law. That is, the existence of the civilized races, and what power they hold in the land, versus the wilderness animal and monster populations, and their power. When one force manifested to an extreme, the neutral would put their efforts toward the aid of the lesser party. <br>
<br>
This is fundamental to how all the mannish races function. It is like the conscious (light) and the subconscious (darkness). Both are required, and have their time so that a being can experience the full range of life. If you snuff out the subconscious, you will never dream, and ultimate predictability, control and entropy (death) would follow. <br>
Likewise if you snuff the conscious, you have a reckless zombie that will upset it's fellow beings.<br>
<br>
Just my thought on neutrality: not an impartial-to-everything attitude, but one that supports a balance of forces. To me, that gives neutral a face, rather than just being a player's excuse to do whatever they feel like because they 'never chose a side'.<br>

Playing a true neutral would mean helping the team that was the weakest (and thus support the balance). I think in EQ though, you have to take another look at it. Wood Elf and Halfling Druids in EQ, though labeled &quot;neutral&quot; are basically thrust into the &quot;good&quot; group at least as far as cities are concerned. I look at it from this standpoint: there are MANY more forces of evil in Norrath (counting NPCs of course). Any druid in his right mind would fight against that evil not only to ensure balance but because those blasted dirty evils have no respect for the &quot;foresty&quot; things. &lt;wink&gt;<br>

How cruel, I plan to put down a rich layer of organic compost in the grand forest of Kelethin in the near future. After all that blood and bone, and perhaps a bit of charcoal from the occasional burning tree-house, is great for plant growth.<br>
<br>
I do agree that most of the neutrals in EQ are basically `good'. The halflings, dwarves and woodelves come from organized, lawful and friendly cultures which are unlikely to have much in common with necromancers and worshippers of evil gods.<br>
<br>
This is especially true since the Dark races would probably exterminate / enslave the good races. Whereas the `good' races might be satisfied with a military victory and not feel the need to completely erradicate the other races. Thus good and neutral are more sympathetic to each other.<br>
<br>
The other type of neutral is `selfish neutral'. People who care about looking after themselves first and will deal with the evil/good question on the basis of what they can get out of it. Likewise the followers of Quellious who might want to `expand their minds' by actively working with evils (which is ultimately selfish).<br>
<br>
The `pure balance' concept of keeping good and evil embroiled in an equal conflict with no chance of victory on either side always strikes me as either an insane or chaotic approach. Followers of rallos zek might want an endless conflict, but it would not make sense for many.<br>
<br>
You'd have things like the druid who successfully protects a village from orcs, and then goes and trains them when they start losing, that's just nuts.<br>

One is seeking a balance between good and evil, another is being apathetic about everything.<br>
<br>
As my character, I view it differently. A kind of a mix. I dont care about the concepts of good and evil. I care about other things. As a druid's concern is nature, whether it be good or evil, I care about my usefulness. I care about my worth to others. And I care about wealth. Okay, so I'm self-centered and maybe a bit spoiled. One day I may come across a group of people being massacred by orcs. I ask if I can help them. If yes, I slay the orcs to the best of my ability. If no, well, hope you all have a happy death. Another day I may come across a group of people planning to ambush or assassinate another group of people. It doesn't matter whoich side of good or evil I fight on, as long as I can help make a difference, and maybe a little bit of cash. <br>
<br>
I do reserve some areas as non-negotiable, such as my guild. My guild is what is most important to me and they will always come first. Order or chaos, good or evil, come what may. Druids have their nature, Warriors have their battles, Cleircs have their dieties. I have my guild.<br>

I am SO SO SO glad to see some people trying to play druids along their alignment.  It's damned hard, and quite possibly the biggest reason I rerolled Sarhea the first time. She was a druid, and I went with ranger, as I played her much more discordant than neutral.<br>
<br>
I give huge roleplay props to anyone who even makes the attempt to play a druid true neutral.  I say again, that's some difficult roleplay. <p><p align="center"><b><font color="#C00000" face="Black Chancery" size="-1"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner">Sarhea Tebaun</font></a><font

If it were an AD&amp;D setting, things would be easier.  My druid in my partner's campaign is a reclusive bastard.<br>
<br>
Another thing that's been nagging at me...  how should a Druid consider Luclin in the order of things?  Are its creatures in the natural order?  Out of it?  In a different natural order altogether?  I'm leaning towards the third option, myself...<br>
<br>
Also, after a cursory glance at the thread over the Grimling/Sonic Wolf/Vah Shir conflict in the Hollowshade more (a conflict a friend tried to get me involved in), it seems that a Druid could do a lot of work in that setting at attempting to maintain the balance.  But the question, for me at least, is should a Druid bother to care?  Does Luclin fall within the perview of Karanas &amp; Tunare?<br>

From the gnome's perspective, I'd have to say apathy is the rule.  We care about gnomish things and our tinkered contraptions for the most part.  Most of the other races don't see us as a threat, so they let us in their towns.  The choices you make in your journeys will always effect how certain factions will treat you.<br>
<br>
As a neutral druid, you would have to expect that some good or evil folk will still consider you an enemy.  Just because you mean them no immidate harm does not mean they will welcome you with open arms.  This is definitely how some of the good and evil guilds look upon the tinkers. <p><b><i>Sabbik Silvertongue</i></b>, Cleric of the Tinker's Pride<br>Linguist, Master of Tinkering and Pottery

As far as factions go.  As an order neutral I have it a little easier, I support orderly societies, and disdain the disordly.  However none of my feelings are overt and I judge each individual on their own merits.  As a neutral you do what you have to do, for whatever reasons.  It may be personal advancement, it may be an &quot;adjustment&quot; in the war between good and evil, between order and chaos....  Factions could be roleplayed as an almost incidental result.  In truth Lorec cares not who likes him. He is  a judge (order neutral), but It ill serves him  to be KoS anywhere, as it prevents his studies of the workings of all society and his judgement of the overall balance....  To become KoS to a societyt (read player races) he did not start  out KoS to shows a bias on his part.  I he is   KoS to a society from birth, it shows THEIR prejudice, and he should build faction in order to better know why.<br>
<br>
Like Bjond said.. Pure neutrality is very contrived and doesnt exist anywhere.  If you roleplayed true neutral you would likely  do nothing, fight nothing, unless perhaps it attacked you to begin with. <p>Lorec <br>

<br>
It is frowned up if someone kill animals, but it is perfectly reasonable if the purpose was to satisfy one¡¦s hunger.<br>
<br>
It is bad to tilt the balance of good and evil, but it is perfectly acceptable to strike down a person (despite his alignment) if he is caught ¡§disrupting the balance of nature¡¨<br>
<br>
It is unacceptable to chop down a tree, but it is perfectly logical if the woods are used to build shelter for oneself.<br>
<br>
All of them are contradicting principles.  It is not right to do something unless it is justified by personal need.  It is ¡§need¡¨ that drives the idea of neutrality.   A true neutral aligned individual would not side with either good or evil unless he has the ¡§need¡¨ for it.  An animal should not be killed unless there is a ¡§need¡¨ for it.  A tree should not be chopped down unless there is a ¡§need¡¨ for it.  In simple words, whatever a true neutral aligned individual does is driven solely by his ¡§need¡¨.  <br>
<br>
What is this need?  It's basic animal instinct.  Both good and evil aligned have ideologies that they try to fulfill.  The patterns of their actions are already settled forth by their religion, society, culture, and their environment.  Yet neutrals care not of these ideologies and their actions are only responses to the situation at hand.  Frankly, it is selfishness that is the driving force behind those of neutral aligned individuals.  Self perseverance and self fulfillment are the reasons behind a true neutral¡¦s actions.  <br>
<br>
As a druid, myself, I don't question my neutrality over the war with the Crushbone orcs.  It is simply justified by my own selfish attempt to preserve my own life.  It is rather simple ¡V if an orc wishes me dead, I have every right to ally myself with enemies of the orcs and defend myself.  It is this belief that made me an ally of dragons and dwarves on Velious as well.  Simple, the first race that wished me dead on Velious was the giants, and the result is that my alliance with the dragons and the dwarves.<br>

Alignment is not like some absolute distinction you choose and follow like it was a Political Party or something.  It also isn't something that is stamped on your forehead.  People make assumptions all the time, and have various and sundry prejudices.  Alignment is something that is only discernable through careful observation and knowledge of a person. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/8/02 4:28:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1507.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There are many ways ..</span><hr size=1> Wow, lotta good stuff before I ever got to it.  Not much time (as always lately), so here's...<br>
<br>
1) Karlithas put together a pretty good summary of part of Kimaya's neutrality.  She's VERY much a naturalist (as well as a naturist) -- animals fight with one another to secure food and shelter when they have to, and even beavers fell trees.  To her, all living beings are equal, and therefore she views animals and &quot;sentients&quot; on the same footing.<br>
<br>
1a) Kimaya is the &quot;love everybody because they're alive&quot; kind of neutral.  She'll generally only take sides in specifics when the overall &quot;live and make your own choices, and let others do the same&quot; of the balance is directly threatened.  I'm never really positive when she'll make that decision until she does, though, so I can't say in advance what those specifics would be.<br>
<br>
2) Kimaya is still convinced that Luclin is &quot;underground&quot;, since she's not been to the surface and it looks like Kaladim to her.  Once she gets above ground though, she'll probably take the stance that it's all nature, and therefore all good.<br>
<br>
3) You can raise Neriak faction by some wine quest with some guy in the Library or something.  As soon as I have the cash to spare, I'm doing it.  I don't care how long it takes, Kimaya's a neutral.  I'll eventually do whatever other quests I can (like maxing out the Dwarven paladin quests before going in and trying that one with the Ogres.)  If you want to do Neutral, it takes a lot of work, but you can get there with most races, if not all.<br>
<br>
4) I wish the Heretics would listen to #3 and quit hating me.  I've killed HUNDREDS of those @#$% kobolds! <p>---<BR>

It is all in the matter of perspective.  What is good for one may be evil for another.  I choose not to judge.  I just react to any threat around me and take whatever action is necessary to preserve my health and those I am with.  If a guard or monster attacks me on on sight, I will kill them if able.  However, I do not view them as evil for I also have attacked others on sight who wish me no harm for no other reason than to loot their corpse and progress in my skills and level.  I am evil?  I do not think so.  I hope that we all eventually realize that no one is good and no one is evil.  We just all do what is necessary to survive. <p>Osensei

I dislike disorganization, as it reflects on your mind as well, and an unstructured mind makes for a sloppy body. As a monk, I can't have that (except for the fact that Jiren is also a drunk, part of his character).<br>
Good creates Evil, Evil creates Good. Why choose a side when your siding only creates more of what you're fighting against? I exist to train and create my own niche in the world.<br>
Jiren is changing to Order Evil though, as recently he's killed &quot;innocents&quot; and found he enjoyed it. He also likes nothing more than to train his body at the expense of others. Their societies don't mean anything, he has a vision of the power he seeks and their rules will not propel him toward it. So he creates his own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1507.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1507.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1507.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=1507.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1507.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1507.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
