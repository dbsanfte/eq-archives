With her light gray eyes she looked at the old venerable dwarf sitting beside the bed in a chair.<br>
<br>
“Grampy?” she asked, “ Could ye tell me a bedtime story?”<br>
<br>
“Aye lil’ one, aye” he spoke softly with a nod, “What would ye likes ta hear?”<br>
<br>
Her brow wrinkled in thought, little lips puckered.<br>
<br>
“Could ye tell me where all the cat skins hangin’ in StormHammer Hold came from?”<br>
<br>
She blinked and looked to her grandfather innocently. Leaning forward he lay her back onto her pillow and kissed her forehead as he tucked her into bed.<br>
<br>
“Ah! Yes lass, yes the cat skins. Tha’s a wonderful tale fer ye.”<br>
<br>
“Ye see, it begins wit’ one o’ the unlikeliest group o’ heroes there e’er  were. Jes’ git yerself cozy lil’un and I’ll tells ye the tale o’ the Stonefist Boys an’ the King o’ the Cat People.”<br>

Within this stronghold is a small, unadorned chamber, a quiet room where members of the order come to sit in quiet meditation and commune with their deity.<br>
<br>
On this particular day a lone dwarf knelt within the chamber, the shield of his order to the side of him, on the floor in front of him lay his blade.<br>
<br>
It should have been an inspiring sight, a devout paladin in communion with his lord but no….this was not your average paladin, this was Sclong Stonefist.<br>
<br>
Sclong knelt there, fist clenched, face distorted, tip of his tongue poking out the corner of his mouth, grunting of all things….<br>
<br>
Yes, grunting. You see Sclong was what some might call…well, simply put, the boy aint right. <br>
<br>
So, there sat Sclong, grunting and eyes squinted tight, trying with all his might to get a vision from his patron deity. He’d been there all day and had even passed out twice from lack of oxygen as he focused all of his well meaning efforts into obtaining a divine revelation. Sclong was wanting a quest to prove his worth to all of Kaladim.<br>
<br>
A stubborn one he was not about to give up and as he was on the verge of passing out for the third time he heard  a voice!<br>
<br>
“SCLONG STONEFIST!” the voice boomed in the small chamber.<br>
<br>
Cracking open his good eye Sclong replied.<br>
<br>
“Brell?”<br>
<br>
“DON’T OPEN YOU EYES AND CAST YOUR GAZE UPON ME! MY MIGHT IS TO MUCH TO BEHOLD BY YOU!”<br>
<br>
“Ya! Ya! Me no look Great Duke sir!”<br>
<br>
Sclong flung himself forward touching his nose to the cold stone floor.<br>
<br>
“WHAT DO YOU SEEK FROM ME?”<br>
<br>
“Me wants a quest sir! Yessiree a quest me wants ta prove meself worthy.”<br>
<br>
“BUT YOU ARE NOT WORTHY!”<br>
<br>
Panic sets in and the dwarf lets out a strangled…<br>
<br>
“Huh?”<br>
<br>
“YOU FORGET SCLONG, I THE DUKE OF BELOW SEE ALL! I SAW WHAT YOU DID WITH THAT GOAT! UNATURAL….UNSPEAKABLE…..”<br>
<br>
The voice trailed off to bellowing laughter.<br>
<br>
Sclong jumped to his feet and spun about spying an intruder in the room.<br>
<br>
“Thargan! Arrrrrgh! Ye aint funny!”<br>
<br>
He dove at the figure, another dwarf, seeking to grapple him. Thargan darted to the side  and with a boot in the rear sent Sclong headfirst into the wall.<br>
<br>
“Owwww.”<br>
<br>
Sclong dropped to the floor with a thud.<br>
<br>
The door to the room creaked open and another snickering dwarf slipped in.<br>
<br>
“He out cold is he?” the new dwarf asked.<br>
<br>
“Aye Zeckius, that he is.” Thargan replied with a wry grin.<br>
<br>
Zekius laughed, “Ha! I’ll git his legs ye git his arms, we can tote ‘im to tha mines and strip ‘im o’ his greaves and pour Ma’s jam on his jobbies to lure the rats!”<br>
<br>
Thargan let out a hearty bellow and slapped his brother on the back, “Lets hurry afore he wakes up!”<br>
<br>
“AHEM!” A familiar voice sounded behind them.<br>
<br>
The pair cringed, shoulders slumping.<br>
<br>
“This is a place of worship! Do ye not respect the dignity of this chamber? And you Zeckius! Ye be a member of the order as well!”<br>
<br>
Thargan and Zeckius turned towards their chastiser, heads lowered.<br>
<br>
“We was jes’ joshin’ Pastor Ristak.” Mumbled Thargan.<br>
<br>
“Aye Pastor, we didn’t mean nuthin’ by it.” Said Zeckius.<br>
<br>
Exasperated the Pastor shook with anger.<br>
<br>
“Pick yer brother up and the three of you wait in the main hall while I decide what’ll be done with you.”<br>
<br>
The Pastor knelt beside the unconscious Sclong, patting him on the side of the face.<br>
<br>
“Sclong…Sclong! Get up boy.”<br>
<br>
“Brell?” came a mumbled reply.<br>
<br>
“I said pick yer brother up boys!”<br>
<br>
Thargan and Zeckius sheepishly helped Sclong to his feet and shuffled out.<br>

<br>
“A what?” replied the head of the order.<br>
<br>
“A quest sir. I’ll give them a quest.”<br>
<br>
“That’s how you propose to handle this?”<br>
<br>
“Aye.”<br>
<br>
“What type of quest?”<br>
<br>
“We have need of  ingredients to make incense for the Festival of Heroes coming up. One of the ingredients can only be found in possession of the Kerrans on Odus. I plan to send them as emmisaries to the king there and retrieve what is needed.”<br>
<br>
“What? Incense? We already have everything needed for the festival, what are you talking about?”<br>
<br>
“Aye sir, I know. But just think...the Stonefist  Boys clear across the world. Imagine with the peace their absence brings we could actually complete the final details for the feast without…incident.”<br>
<br>
“Aye, I see your reasoning. Very well. Do it.”<br>
<br>
The Pastor nods with a grin, “I must say I’m looking forward to it already.”<br>
<br>
“And Ristak…”<br>
<br>
“Yes?”<br>
<br>
“Do the Kerrans even have a king?”<br>
<br>
Pastor Ristak shrugs with a chuckle, “ Does it matter?”<br>
<br>
“Ha! I suppose not.”<br>
<br>
A bellow and a loud crash can be heard from the main hall.<br>
<br>
Gritting his teeth Ristak growls, “Booooys!”<br>
<br>
From the hall comes the sound of a dazed Sclong….<br>
<br>
“Brell?”<br>
<br>

I don' care even if it is ta see their king! Cats are filthy animals!&quot; shrieked the mother of the 3 dwarves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ma!&quot; protested Zeckius &quot;I'm a Paladin o' Brell! Tis' me duty ta do this!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Asides Ma, &quot;spoke Thargan, &quot;I'll be goin' wit&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I like cats.&quot; muttered Sclong.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll not let me boys go flyin' willy nilly off on some quest ta git' yerself killed!&quot; she continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;MA! I served as a Tunnel Rat in tha goblin wars! Methinks I can look after tha two fer a simple trip like this'un.&quot; countered Thargan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yeah? An' jes' how do ye think yer gonna cross the world ta see these furry folks? Thas 2 oceans ye know ye gots ta cross! Ye wanna end  up dead like yer father?&quot;<br>
<br>
All four dwarves drop their heads solemnly at that and mutter, &quot;Brell rest his soul&quot; in unison.<br>
<br>
Zeckius butted back in, &quot;Ma! Pops died in a horrid fishing accident, not takin a boat!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, but he was fishin at the ocean! The ocean bears no love fer our clan boys! Mark my word! Ye git on tha' boat an' it'll go fer ye too!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Relax Ma&quot; Thargan spoke softly. &quot;We're not even taking a boat. We're going to travel through the Nexus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;THE NEXUS!&quot; the boy's mother almost fainted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye mean yer gonna let some newfangled magic takes ye! Oh dear boys...oh dear...I je's know ye'll end up in some horrid plane with demons set to devour yer souls! Ye don' be trustin yer souls ta non-dwarves an' their accursed magic do ye!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO Ma, thas not gonna happen, I promise&quot; Zeckius tried to comfort her.<br>
<br>
Slumping down she sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, go on yer hootin falootin quest an' leave yer mother here. Brell knows I done lil' fer ye in all these years since I birthed yer big heads an' kept yer bellies full and yer britches clean.&quot;<br>
<br>
All three boys groan, &quot;Ma!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, fine. A mother can fret over her boys can't she? Well if yer gonna be goin at least let me pack ye yer lunches.&quot;<br>
<br>
After a couple hours the brothers stagger out of their home with packs full of breads, cheeses, sweet rolls, dried meats, sausages, fruits, mushrooms and everything else their mother swore they needed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love ya boys!&quot; She hollered to them as they walked off on their journey, &quot;An don' ferget ta changes yer knickers! Ye can't go visitin no King with skid marks in yer britches!&quot;<br>
<br>
The brother again let out a collective shout, &quot;Ma! Hush!&quot;<br>
<br>
And so the would be heroes left Kaladim heads hung low and to the snickering of the city guards.<br>

Upon their arrival in Toxxulia Forest the brothers wrinkeld their collective noses.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's....green...&quot; Zeckius spoke flatly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye....very....green....&quot; added Thargan.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me like green!&quot; chirped Sclong with a vacant grin.<br>
<br>
They looked about the dense forest, the greenish mist  hanging in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which way?&quot; asked Zeckius.<br>
<br>
Thargan replied, &quot;West. We go west boys. Les' head out.&quot;<br>
<br>
They adjusted their gear and set out. After picking their way through the forest for awhile the brothers reached water.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah!&quot; growled Thargan.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did ye expect? They call this place Kerran Island right?&quot; Zeckius said with a chuckle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye aint helpin matters much! Lemme think.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We no swim der' huh?&quot; asked Sclong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay.&quot; said Thargan. &quot;We'll follow the shore here, we're bound ta find us a boat er sumthin'.&quot;<br>
<br>
They set out,  following the shoreline to the north. Eventually they came across a short pier justting out into the waters. Strutting out to the end of it the brothers stood there deep in thought.<br>
<br>
Sclong let out a sniffle, &quot;Jes' like the pier were Pops.....&quot; he let out a strangled sob.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; Thargan spoke softly as he pat his brother on the back. &quot;It's jes' like the place were fishing gone awry took our Pops frum us.&quot;<br>
<br>
The trio lowered their heads and in unison uttered, &quot;Brell rest his soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then a canoe pulled up to the dock. An erudite smile politly and nodded to them as he stepped onto the pier and began to tie the canoe to one of the posts.<br>
<br>
The brothers looked to eachother quickly then back to the canoe. Thargan burst forward and clubbed the erudite on the back of the head, the unsuspecting man flopped to the pier unconscious.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaaaah!&quot; Sclong cried in alarm pointing at the unconscious man.<br>
<br>
Zeckius was allready untieing the boat. &quot;Brell fergive me Brother thargan, he knows not what he does.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked back to his brothers, 'Well? Hurry!&quot;<br>
<br>
Thargan grabbed Sclong by the beard and hopped into the small water craft.<br>
<br>
Zeckius grabbed the paddel and they set out across the dark waters.<br>
<br>
They made their way to the isle of the cat people at a leasurly pace, enjoying the ride. Sclong sat in the middle, arms propped on the side of the canoe as he gazed into the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;OOOO!  OOOO! A fish!&quot; he exclamed suddenly, pointing towards the water next to the boat.<br>
<br>
The sudden movement upset the balance of the canoe sending Thargan sprawlng unceremoniously into the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye stupid oaf!&quot; he spouted as he splashed uncerimoniously trying to flounder his way back onto the canoe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer gonna dump us too!&quot; Shouted Zeckius as his brother clumsily tried to make his way back onboard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well help me then!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let fo o' the damn canoe! Yer gonna dump us!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye git! Grab me friggin hand!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zeckius placed his boot on Thargan's face and with a mighty heft pushed him off the near capsizing craft and back into the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll make ye pay fer that Zeckius, mark me words!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zeckius paddled quickly moving further from his now cursing brother. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye know I can't swim! I couldn't let ye capsize us.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do ye expect me ta reach the isle then!&quot; Thargan roared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Swim west!&quot; Sclong piped with a snorting chuckle.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm gonna brain ye two when I gets there....&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Thargan began swimming, gritting his teeth, dreaming of fanciful ways to abuse his brothers when they reached dry land.<br>
<br>
