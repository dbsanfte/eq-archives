<br>
Fact? What Level 1 Vah Shir quest is impossible to do a level 6 or level 60?  What FACT?<br>
<br>
This is another FALSE anti-TLC comment.  The FACT is that you CAN do any low level quest available to your class/race.<br>
<br>
I actually was affected by the TLC on 1 quest (VS Tailoring).  I was too high to get Hopper Hides, so I went down into the pit and found those hunting near by that were not, cooperated with them and got the TLC barred Hides that I needed.  I had also been able to purchase some of the hides off merchants (and I have seen many many other TLC quest items on Merchants).  Yes, it took my maybe a day or two to get the componets, but I still was able to get them. (and I did not have to pay the Millions of Plats to the Lower Level farmers that Bjord is so fearful.  In fact, I have actually given away quest pieces I gathered that I do not need -- stretched hopperhide for example).<br>
<br>
Getting from level 1 - 6 doesn't happen by accident, you have to focus on killing mobs, rather than wandering the city speaking with NPCs (Focus on Leveling instead of Questing).  The price you pay for that is that you have to get help with low level quests.<br>

That's what you do in every post here and what every proponent of TLC so far has done.  TLC is flat out broken.  It does not stop farmers.  It stops the original questers that put in the work so you can do your web-crawls.<br>
<br>
You don't find farmers in the dungeons you visit because there are no people on FV.  Most zones are completely and utterly empty.  If someone wants to farm here, TLC is literally no barrier at all.  The only things that drop off TLC'd mobs that people want are quest items.  The farmable items all drop high enough that TLC has no effect.<br>
<br>
Farmables in Kurn's?  Eh, you don't find famers there because there is nothing worth farming.  I've been in Guk -- prime farmer land.  It's empty and it's not effected by TLC.  It's not farmed because we have no farmers.  Since TLC doesn't hurt farming, it's not what is keeping them away.  What is fending them off is, imho, the single character rule and the 20 level buff rule.<br>
<br>
Vah Shir here in FV have complained often about how normal hunting of just the right mob and only the right mob will level them to 6 and make the mob trivial.  That's a blocked quest.  The point is not that there is an exploitive method to get around doing the quest yourself.   It's that you have to use one in the first place.  Try starting up somewhere other than Vah Shir -- there are NO people there to hire; &quot;/shout can anyone hear me?&quot; yeilds zero responses in many starting areas.<br>
<br>
Hey, I'm happy for you that you spent all that time wheedling new cats and vendor-mining for pelts.  The point is not that you could get around it, but that you had to get around it in the first place.  Any self-respecting cat should have been able to obtain them by hunting.  Try a quest sometime without a spoiler page in hand and see how you like the TLC then.<br>
<br>
For new quests, you don't know the reward.  You don't know how much work is invovled.  You don't know the levels of all he mobs in advance.  You don't even know if it's a &quot;newbie&quot; quest or a &quot;high level&quot; quest.  TLC artificially makes low level quest items insanely valuable and puts them out of reach of most people.  Take a look at Bako and the monk sashes.  Offering a Wu's stick for sashes is outrageous and because of TLC, it's not enough to even mildly tempt me to give up my sashes.  He'll probably have to make a mule.  Sure, there's a way around the block, but while the path around it is not precisely an exploit, it also is definitely NOT in the spirit of the quest.  That's the point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uchiporama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiporama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 10:02:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &lt;sigh&gt;</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Vah Shir here in FV have complained often about how normal hunting of just the right mob and only the right mob will level them to 6 and make the mob trivial.

<br>
- Give me a SPECIFIC example of how a quest is 'BLOCKED'.   Not 'There are some quests', or 'I know this person'.  A proper example would be 'The Xakra Dart Quest cannot be done because of X, Y, Z. which is caused by the TLC.'  Are you simply afraid that people will point out that that quest really is not BLOCKED by the TLC?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   The point is not that there is an exploitive method to get around doing the quest yourself. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
- Explotive?  Using materials purchased from merchants or players is not.  It is actually what was intended for FV.  In fact, the Deves said that you were to use lower level players assistance to help when the TLC barred you from getting an item (see Deve Forum on EQ home page).  So please stop trying to infer some moral inferiority of players that follow the TLC guildlines.<br>
<br>

<br>
Again, you do not know me.  I have done quest with out the help of spoiler pages (most of the SOL lucin quests are on the spoiler pages).  I do them and (if you read in my above post) I have also had to deal with the TLC.   I still like the TLC.<br>
<br>
Bjord, you may also notice that I have been able to use FACT to disprove everyone of your 'The TLC makes quests impossible' arguments.  <br>
<br>
The TLC works just as it was intended to work.  There is no reason to remove it from the game.  Just because you are incapable to patience or the ability to work with in the rule set of FV does not mean the TLC is broken.<br>

<br>
I ran my Shar Vahl Taruun quests myself.  The only help I got was a nice druid who tracked an NPC for me.  I've completed every step on my own.  I've even gone back and RE-completed some of the steps when I messed up and handed in the wrong items.<br>
<br>
It did mean that I levelled more slowly.  I accepted that.  I didn't have a spoiler to follow, and I accepted that too.<br>
<br>
My wife ran her Shar Vahl Shaman quests herself.  TLC didn't stop her from completing them, although it did make them more difficult.  Again, she had to level slowly.  When we get to a point in the quests where we have to get to a higher level, we look around at the quests other NPC's are handing out in Shadeweaver's and Hollowshade, and otherwise enjoy the sheer power of the Vah Shir.<br>

Chip, you haven't proved or disproved anything.  You keep dodging the points I've brought up.  If you want to know the specific quest, talk to the Vah Shir that posted.  Exploitive: hiring others, using a mule, using a second comp, vendor mining.  Some more, some less.  All permissable, but most not within the spirit of solving a quest directly.<br>
<br>
An example: monk trainer says &quot;You must prove yourself worthy.  Go forth, kill orc pawns, bring me their scalps!&quot;  Scalps don't TLC, but just imagine that they do for argument's sake.  You stop by a vendor, buy 4 scalps, and return them.  This is the least &quot;exploitive&quot; method of dodging TLC.  You did the quest, but it wasn't quite what the trainer told you to do, now was it?<br>
<br>
A more real example.  Suppose you are doing the monk shackle quest from scatch.  One clue is along the lines of &quot;we need the hand of Tynn&quot;.  Hmm.  Not very descriptive.  So, you kill things all over.  If you are very very lucky indeed, you will hunt in Kurns and kill fingerbone skeletons and a finger bone will drop.  If you are even luckier, you will save it and have someone identify it.  If you are luckier still, you will realize it's significance and go back to farm more until you have a full set.  More likely, you will have missed all this and leveled past the TLC barrier and never ever solve the quest because TLC would have denied you even the clues to solve it.<br>
<br>
Then there are the quests that are bugged.  Many are buggy.  You know what you need, but it doesn't drop or you're not quite sure if you have the right MOB/s.  What do you do?  Level or wait?  For most bugs, you can leisurely level to 60 before it's fixed.  Do you then delevel to do the quest?  Use a second comp?  Pay a lowbie to test to see if it's fixed -- this may mean a 20 hour camp just to test it (ie. 5-10k plat).<br>
<br>
It's not that TLC literally makes completion impossible, it's that it makes solving impossible and makes completion a nightmare.  Not every quest is worthy of epic effort to complete.  In fact, most aren't.  That's why TLC kills off discovery here.  Because most aren't worth it, it behoves one to wait for the solution before taking the plunge.  It encourages folks to wait for others to do all the work and post a spoiler.<br>
