Today wasn't about greed.  I didn't take a single page.  I was making sure others who came along got a fair chance to finish this quest, without having to deal with farmers.  If anything, it was in the spirit of altruism, not greed.<br>
<br>
As it turns out, at least one and maybe two people who wanted to finish this quest got to do so today while I watched (I left before the Dyllin showed up for the second one, but he was due at any minute).<br>

<br>
This really sickens me.  Really.  Note:<br>
<br>
-Guild was farming an item, and didn't want to share.<br>
-Someone came up and grabbed the item they were farming, got /rude in response.<br>
-That someone gave them the page, then showed up on the boards to complain about it.<br>
-That someone gets what they want, then after having flamed the guild publicly, goes about doing the same thing to them just to teach them a lesson.<br>
<br>
This isn't the first time I've seen this from that Someone, either.  Last time was when I was hunting with my wife in CB.  Here's how it went:<br>
<br>
-Calare and I were hunting the throne room for 45 minutes, and quite effectively.  We got overloaded on one of the pulls, shouted and ran to the zone.  Someone was in the path of our train, caught it, and got out alive, as well.<br>
<br>
(note that this happened about an hour earlier, and we ended up outfitting the folks who got caught for their trouble.  We tend to be nice to people who are nice, especially those who understand that, occasionally, trains happen.)<br>
<br>
-Someone spent the next 10 minutes complaining about it on the other side.  I finally told someone to stuff it and Calare and I both ran back inside.  (note that we didn't outfit this person, who was being a jerk)  This individual's last statement was 'welcome to permanent ignore'.  Hey, that's a valid perogative.  Heck, I can almost respect that.  almost.<br>
<br>
-We picked up another tank to help assure that things like that didn't happen again.  Of course, you can't guaruntee something like that, but it never hurts to try.<br>
<br>
-20 minutes later, the same thing happens.  Chain agro off of Lord Darus pulls the tower.  I hold for a minute or two, shout a couple of times, then when Calare and Tank are clear make my run to the zone.  Someone gets hit by the train.  Someone yells and screams about it again on the other side.  I commented on the permanent ignore bit, and was told that someone couldn't afford to whith all the training we're doing.  You've all heard the argument:  'don't hunt there if you can't handle it'.  Profferred buffs and heals are declined.  'I don't want your help, I've already taken your damage for you.'  I welcome him to permanent ignore so I don't have to listen to his whining.<br>
<br>
-10 minutes later a mutual friend (who had used up his Lay of Hands helping Someone who was training to zone, earlier) informs me that someone is running around the zone shouting about how horrible Calare and I are, and how we train other people who don't deserve it yadda yadda yadda.  I explain what happened and he laughs.  Says he won't use up his Lay of Hands on the yutz again.<br>
<br>
-30 minutes later I holler about a train, again, then hold for a good 4 minutes before dragging my 1 bub of health closer to zone.  I make it out to the courtyard and hold while Calare and our spare tank finish off the last of the mobs (she's stubborn that way, sometimes).  I die, and the other two in the party make it with just a sliver of health.<br>
<br>
-SOMEBODY chooses that moment to train a full health mob onto our spare tank, killing him and costing him his level.  Somebody then sends a tell to our spare tank to the effect of 'Ha ha, now you know how it feels' (got this second hand, so I don't have the complete text).<br>
<br>
-Our spare tank reported Somebody, and we didn't hear from him again.<br>
<br>
My point is, this is behavior that I've seen in the past, that I'm seeing now, and I expect will see in the future.  I had hoped that Somebody's attitude had undergone adjustment in the intervening time, but I can see now that it hasn't.  Somebody is just a jerk.<br>

<br>
Getting killed just entering because the group in the Throne Room can't handle it is no fun for anyone.<br>
<br>
I can understand it happening once, but on that night (and on other nights), these trains occured with clockwork precision: every 15 minutes, pretty much--set your watch on it.  That shows that the group in the Throne Room just couldn't handle it to begin with, but wasn't willing to learn that lesson and didn't want to die in order to learn it--they preferred, instead, to let others do the dying for them.<br>
<br>
What I said, before I did, in fact, put you on /ignore was &quot;I am not an elven shield&quot;.  In other words, don't throw me up in front of your trains so you can escape, and that's exactly what you did.<br>
<br>
You claimed you'd /shouted a warning.  You had not, or at least had not before your train slammed in to me right at the Wall outside Castle Crush.  The dispute was in private, in /tells between myself and Calare, over just that issue.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I did not train your group in any way, shape, or form that night or any other night, as you allege (second-hand, no doubt).<br>
<br>
Frankly, I don't have much good to say about people who act irresponsibly and ignore that other people are in the zone, too.  Your comment that night, as now, of &quot;don't play on the train tracks if you don't want to get run over&quot; shows exactly how much you respect the other people in the zone with you.  A simple &quot;Gee, we're sorry we trained you and you got killed&quot; would have sufficed, but for whatever reason, you couldn't bring yourself to apologize for training me, and instead responded as above.<br>
<br>
I at least stand there and attempt to fight whatever it is I've trained to give people a shot at getting out before me.<br>
<br>
And, no, I wasn't &quot;doing exactly what they did to teach them a lesson&quot; in this case.  I was making sure everyone who wanted a shot at the Testament got it, without having to contend with mules and farmers.  I did not farm it myself.  I merely watched.  That's all.  I specifically said &quot;I am *NOT* in line for this camp, I'm just ensuring that everyone else who wants to be in line can be.&quot;  If anything, I was 'reverse-farming.'<br>

<br>
Now, I can understand some confusion, especially considering that shout just doesn't seem to carry as far on FV as it does on other servers.  You may very well not have heard a shout from where you were fighting.  After testing it out in Kelethin, we determined that an individual standing at one lift couldn't hear a shout from a person at the next closest lift.  Either way, we're pretty good about these things.<br>
<br>
At first, we thought that your righteous indignation was RP.  If you recall, we appologized for it.  Then you continued, as we healed up, to complain nonstop.  That's when I told you to stuff it.  Not in so many words, but that was the desired content.  Your quote was exactly correct, and I commend you on your memory.<br>
<br>
I recall the next time it happened, running to zone, shouting all the way, with a bub of health left.  Maybe you are some sort of superman who never has to run from a battle.  More likely not.  More likely you complain about things that inconvenience you, or cause you to have to think about where you're fighting and what you have to worry about in zone.  Whining about trains in crushbone is akin to complaining about the fact that you stood on the walkway in unrest and someone trained a skeletal monk on your butt (not saying you did, here, but the analogy carries).  Trains in crushbone happen.  Constantly.  And the fact that you chose to whine about it rather than finding a good strategy said volumes about your attitude.<br>
<br>
The lovely thing about grouping with Calare is the fact that she sits right next to me in RL.  I just have to look to my left to see what's happening on her screen.  I watched you train Calare and our companion.  I saw our companion's tell to Calare about your 'ha ha now you know how it feels' tell.  I saw his confirmation after we told him how to report you correctly.  I also recall, shortly thereafter, you casting shield of brambles on me (I assumed it was an 'I'm sorry' gesture but at the time I just wanted your blood, so I killed the effect).<br>
<br>
So I stand by what I said.  You are a sanctimonious schmoe who whines, and when you're finished whining you participate in just the activities you've been whining about if it suits your needs.<br>
<br>
Note:<br>
<br>
-Hey, Order of the Oaken is holding a spawn when _I_ don't think they should be allowed to.<br>
-Hey everyone, gather around me in support.<br>
-In retaliation, let's grab and hold the spawn for two days.<br>
<br>
Don't you notice the hipocricy of this?  You could argue that you were doing it for the greater good, but that wouldn't be true, would it.  You did it because you think percieved wrongs justify any actions.<br>
<br>
I should point out here, that many people run into many problems and percieve that they've been wronged.  Happens to Calare and I all the time.  Now, we _could_ dive on the boards and whine about it, and try to get everyone to say &quot;oh dear, you are so right!&quot; and &quot;that's horrible, here's a bottle!&quot; but that only serves to belittle the whiner.  Even if it does give you a quick, cheap ego boost.  Instead, we suck it up, adjust our tactics to take unforseen variables into account, and dive back in with a more refined method.  This way we become more effective at what we do, and we see that as a good thing.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, trains happen.  Complain about them all you want, but it won't change that fact.  And you will no doubt cause your share throughout your career.  As well, when going after a rare spawn, disagreements will happen.  You handled the disagreement on that spawn wonderfully, and if not for the actions afterward, I would have said you had gained a world of respect in my eyes.  Fact of the matter is that I've done just the same thing in the past... pulled down a contested spawn (Moltor, in my case), then had someone pop in yelling about how they went LD and lost the kill, and just handed over the ring for the Paw of Opalla (heh, got calare plenty mad at me when I did that, but she later agreed).  However, running around and whining about it later (i.e., being sanctimonious), and then organizing a demonstration of just the kind of behavior that you've been whining about (i.e., being a schmoe)?  Sorry, but you've dropped back down to Saurek Rockhopper in my esteem.<br>
<br>
But I'm sure my esteem means nothing to you, as it should.  Your sanctimony will keep you bouyed all by itself.  And you can always find people to pity you if you complain loud enough... that should help the old ego too, huh?  And let's not forget... you can justify any action if you label it 'for the greater good'.<br>
<br>
Have fun being a martyr.  Just follow through and die in the process, ok? <p>Denoi<BR>

If it had, after my 'If you don't want to get hit by the train don't play on the tracks' comment (which admittedly was very UN-rp, and therefore inappropriate for the situation), which was followed by your comment of 'welcome to the world of permanent ignore' there wouldn't have been a comment from a druid next to us stating 'Oh please, add me to your ignore list too!  I feel the same way!'.<br>
<br>
Fact is, if you had stopped complaining long enough, we probably would have buffed and outfitted you for your trouble.  Instead you were being a loud, obnoxious martyr, which is what you're trying to do now.  One would think you'd learn faster than that. <p>Denoi<BR>

<br>
I AM mad at myself for not being an Iksar.  How could I have missed it?<br>
<br>
Heh, and you're right that it's Christmas, and not the best time of year for a flame war.  So let me offer up this white flag:<br>
<br>
Lasgalen, go ahead and flame me.  So long as you don't open up any new areas of argument, I won't flame you back and this whole thread can just die out.  That'll give you last say.<br>
<br>
Then, if Denoi ever runs into you, I'll look at you with a clean slate and won't take another character's past experience with you into account.<br>
<br>
Or, alternatively, we can snipe at each other, and have a jolly old time of it.  Either way works for me. <p>Denoi<BR>

I just have to look to my left to see what's happening on her screen. I watched you train Calare and our companion. I saw our companion's tell to Calare about your 'ha ha now you know how it feels' tell. I saw his confirmation after we told him how to report you correctly. I also recall, shortly thereafter, you casting shield of brambles on me (I assumed it was an 'I'm sorry'  gesture but at the time I just wanted your blood, so I killed the effect).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is a misrepresentation of what happened.  I don't know who trained you and your companion, but it was not me.  I do remember seeing a train coming and turning tail and running.  I presume that's the train that hit your companion, but it was not my train.  I did not aggro whatever it was that hit him.  I just saw the writing on the wall earlier than he did and bolted before he did.<br>
<br>
I did, however, consider it cosmic justice for what your group was doing.  You were training everyone else, and then you got trained; however,I did not cause that train.<br>
<br>
Nor did I say &quot;ha ha now you know how it feels&quot;.  I believe the words were &quot;what goes around comes around threefold&quot;, a Wiccan proverb.<br>
<br>
Yes, the Shield of Brambles was an attempt at making amends.<br>
<br>
Fritz, I didn't bring up this issue.  You have.  I didn't come here and complain about it.  You have.  I was perfectly willing to let that issue go that night.  I haven't come here to complain about the group that trained DVinn three times in an hour (killing me twice that night), either.  (He killed a lot of other people, too, and that group held your attitude: &quot;don't play on the train tracks&quot;.  It didn't fly with anyone who DVinn killed in that hour.  A lot of people were angry at this irresponsible group who kept saying &quot;we almost had him!&quot; as they sat there with sliver of health, and DVinn raged inside with all but a sliver of health.  They weren't anywhere close to having had him.)<br>
