<br>
150 years ago...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A cool wind stirred through the Swamp of No Hope. It passed through a land of low lying marshes and bogs, where inhuman creatures had all too human dreams of freedom. The wind dispersed the fog that clung to the water's edge, and blew towards the east. <br>
The cool wind passed through the Field of Bone. It found ancient bones there that brought wonder to the hearts of young adventurers as they passed through. It rattled these bones in its passing.<br>
The cool wind blew through the timeless ruins in the Lake of Ill Omen, and caught up in itself the scent of revolution, and carried this scent with it into the city of the Iksar to the north.<br>
The cool wind blew across the scales of Notuanot, which caused him to raise his face into it and sniff the air. Perhaps, crouching there on the stairs to the Tower of Death, his guildhall, he could smell the dissention the wind had carried up from the south. It matters not to the wind.<br>
Notuanot considered the strange new feel to the air for a moment, then returned his attention to his book. The Truth of Battle, by Rhamukhar. Within its somewhat yellowed pages were the battlefield philosophies of an honored warrior, who's scales had grown soft in his old age, but whose mind was still sharp with the painful, beautiful truths of the ways of war.<br>
Abruptly, Notuanot looked up to the sky and saw the sun entering its first phase, just over the buildings to the east. He stood up and walked into the tower. It was time for his fateful meeting with Arch-Duke Xog.<br>
<br>
..................................<br>
<br>
The Arch-Duke, ruler of the most prominent city in the Iksar Nation, looked down upon the Iksar male kneeling before him on the high parapets of the Tower of Death. There was no emotion in his expression. His scaled lips never parted, and his eyes never left the supplicating figure. &quot;Tell me of your travels to thesouth, Xaxsar.&quot;<br>
Xaxsar lifted his head only slightly, looking at the Arch-Duke's ankles. &quot;My lord, I cannot, nor would not, hide this from you. I lost a valuable tome, to a party of Froglok Raiders. I had on me, at the time, other documents that I would not, for the safety of our realm, part with. I chose to take those documents, and run. The last thing I saw of it, the book was wrestled from a young Squire's hands just before he was slain. The pages were scattered about the swamp.&quot;<br>
The Arch Duke said nothing for a moment. He walked to the parapet wall, and looked down. A Figure had been kneeling there, below them, but he had stood up and walked into the tower. Finally, he turned back to Xaxsar. &quot;You know the price for failure, Xaxsar. Did you think I would be lenient on you, for bringing this to me straightway? Because I know its not in your nature to normally own up to such misdeeds.&quot;<br>
Xaxsar seemed to shrink into himself upon hearing this. He DID know the price for failure, and he was not ready to pay it.<br>
&quot;My Lord, I do only what I must to preserve our realm, surely you-&quot;<br>
The Arch-Duke turned away from him, and grazik knew the conversation was over. He knew death was coming, and he panicked. He stood up and tried to run from his Lord's presence.<br>
The feeling of cold hard steel in his intestines stopped him in mid turn. His eyes bugged out of his head in a fashion that seemed physically impossible. He began to whine, and cry.<br>
Notuanot had seen the figure turn to run as he had followed the Paige's instruction to come to the parapet. Instinctively, he knew that whoever he was, he should not be running.<br>
Rhamukhar taught in his writings, that if you are to do a thing, do it not halfway. Do not timidly place your foot into a place, but tread confidently forward, so that those ahead of you know that you are about business.<br>
Notuanot eviscerated the figure. Staring back at him across the length of his Black Alloy Sword, was the shocked and frightened face of the Arch-Duke's right hand man, his personal agent, Xaxsar. Not once did Notuanot reconsider his actions. Brutally, he shoved the figure back through the red curtain that covered one of the openings onto the parapets.<br>
Xaxsar came to rest at the Arch-Duke's feet. He lay there making whining noises, clutching his opened belly.<br>
Xog looked down at the crumpled Iksar for a moment, then lifted his gaze to meet that of the Shadow Knight whose sword had downed him. &quot;You are the young one I sent for. You are the young Crusader who has shown such promise!&quot; Xog seemed almost happy in saying this. <br>
&quot;Young Crusader, I will not put lightly what I say now. There has just been an opening in my council,&quot; Xaxsar groaned in fright at hearing this said, &quot; and I need someone who has displayed both wisdom and great strength of will. Someone who is well versed in magic, and the ways of war. From what I hear, you fit this description. I may have a use for you.&quot;<br>
Notuanot acted without hesitation. He leaned forward and grasped the cloth insignia draped over Xaxsar's now punctured armor. He wiped the man's blood on it, and resheathed his sword. Then, he knealt before his Arch-Duke.<br>
&quot;I come before you ready to serve, my master.&quot;<br>
The Arch-Duke smiled. &quot;Excellent! Then if you are ready to go to work, prepare to be tested. If you meet my needs, and succeed where I need you to, then I will make you my enforcer. Your name will be written in the pages of history, if you know how to put it there. Right next to mine.&quot;<br>
Xog looked down at Grazik Plaguebringer as he whined for his life and bled it out onto the stone floor. &quot;Notuanot is about to kill you now, Xaxsar. You have dishonored your post, and I have no more use for you. But know this; your pennance for failure shall not end here.&quot; Xaxsar's eyes were nearly out of his skull already, yet the protruded more, and he began to shake all over. &quot;I shall send this young Shadowknight on his first test. It will be to eliminate anything and everything in this city that is remotely related to you. If it was your Clutch-brother, it shall meet you in the the afterlife. If you were mated to it, it shall not wake come the morn.&quot;<br>
Xaxsar was crying now. He pronounced his shame and worthlessness for everyone to hear.<br>
Xog continued. He knealt down, grasping the man by the neck, and lifting him up. &quot;He will go from house to house, from alley to alley, from whores' den to whores' den, to each and every gilly that lifted her tail for you, until nothing that has the blood of your ancestors within its veins breathes. Die like the dog you are!&quot; Xog stood up, gave Notuanot a nod of his head, and walked down the hall.<br>
There was a series of painful cries that echoed through the Royal Quarter. The wind caught these, and gleefully carried them throughout the city, for everyone to hear.<br>
.....................................<br>
<br>
After he had seen his orders through, Notuanot walked back down the hallway, to a study room, where the Arch Duke was waiting for him. He stood just after the entry way, waiting for the Arch Duke to acknowledge him. The Duke sat down in a bone back chair next to a fireplace, and motioned for Notuanot to do the same. He removed his scabbarded sword from his back and leaned it against the wall near him, and sat down.<br>
&quot;The man you just killed lost a very important book in the Swamp of No Hope. It is called the Origins of Pain, and contains great magic. I know it is still out there, as its pages are imbued with magic, and indestructible. Gather the pages from the Froglok Raiders. Find and kill each Froglok that has a page, and bring me his head. Bring me the Origins of Pain. Do this, and I shall set you high in my council. This is your test. Now go.&quot;<br>
Notuanot stood, bowed before the Arch-Duke, and turned to leave, without another word.<br>
The Arch-Duke stopped him before he reached the door, with a single, ominous sentence. &quot;You know the pennance of failure.&quot;<br>
Notuanot turned to meet his gaze, not once blinking or looking away, and uttered several words that would soon cement his role in history. &quot;I AM the pennance of failure.&quot;<br>
He waited for the Arch-Duke's response before turning to leave.<br>
Xog merely smiled at him and said, &quot;We'll see.&quot;<br>
<br>
........................................... <br>
<br>
The Voice of Freedom<br>
<br>
The night air was thick and heavy. A haze of mist tickled at exposed skin. It was not an unpleasant night at all. Indeed, thought Brahm. Good breeding weather. He smiled as he stood at his post on the outskirts of their makeshift village.<br>
Here and there, a contented croak could be heard as his people slept. As they slept free. Not like his brothers, trapped in slavery in the evil Iksar city. However, if they<br>
fought bravely and used all the resources they had, they would have freedom for all their kind.<br>
A twig snapped somewhere nearby. Brahm's great round head swiveled in that direction, the membranes over his eyes made a snapping sound as they opened to full.<br>
Out of the night a tall lean form stepped forward. Moonlight glinted off its scales.<br>
&quot;Who goes there? Know you the sound of freedom?&quot;<br>
&quot;My voice is the sound of freedom,&quot; came the response, in a passable form of the froglok tongue, and the right answer.<br>
&quot;Then come forward, child of freedom.&quot;<br>
The Iksar moved out of the shadows and stopped a couple feet from Brahm. They stood like that for a moment, toe to toe. Then Brahm reached out and embraced the Iksar.<br>
&quot;Glad you made it back, old boy,&quot; Brahm said. &quot;You had us worried!&quot;<br>
The Iksar's eyes were practically glowing with excitement. &quot;We must gather the camp, Brahm, wake them all up! I have news. Most important news!&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye, Rrothmal! We have been waiting for your news. Come, let us tell them all what you've learned.&quot;<br>
Watchman Brahm and Rrothmal the Iksar walked from tent to tent in the camp the Clan Rogpok of the froglok people and the Outcast Iksar shared, until every frog and every iksar were awake, and gathered around a fire in the center of the camp. From close to the center of the camp, a young froglok lass watched Rrothmal with great eagerness as she cradelled a wiggling bundle in her arms.<br>
&quot;My brothers and sister!&quot; Rothmal began. &quot;As you know, myself and a handful of others have been working in secret, as infiltraters within the Iksar nation! And finally, our little alliance may have come upon a way to end our brother's slavery in atleast one city, their capitol City. And strike a blow for freedom, for righteousness and all that is good!<br>
&quot;It was only a week ago that a group of Clan Rogpok's brave warriors did catch a group of the hated Iksar Necromancers travelling through the swamp! Immediately and without hesitation, they attacked! Their zeal earned them a victory, as those vile worshippers of evil that did not die fled before Rogpok's might!&quot; At this, a cheer and much croaking of approval rose throughout the camp.<br>
Once the commotion had settled down, Rrothmal continued.<br>
&quot;And their zeal earned them more than just a meager victory over a handful of Necromancers, for one of those Necromancers was actually the right hand man of Duke Xog, ruler of the Iksar City of Cabilis! And on his person, dropped as he fled from our might, was a tome that we now hold in our possession, one that possesses the secrets to many of their vile spells!&quot;<br>
A froglok Shin shaman named Gormon stepped forward with a book in his hands. He lifted it high into the air, its crimson seal reflecting the moonlight eerily.<br>
&quot;Behold,&quot; declared Rrothmal. &quot;The Principals of Pain!&quot;<br>
A deep hush fell over the assembly. &quot;With this in our possession, thanks to the studious efforts of Gormon and his Shin Brothers, we will now be able to counteract their magicks effectively.<br>
&quot;For now, I must tell you of news, both grave and fortuitous. The acquisition of their cursed tome has not gone unnoticed. Lord Xog is preparing to send into the swamp for it, and he knows where to find us.&quot;<br>
The crowd gasped in unison. &quot;We should flee! Organize now! Pull up all our belongings and move on, as we have done before! Disappear into the swamp!&quot; Roars of approval came from the crowd as they began to feel the tugs of panic on their hearts. They began to mill about, as if to flee.<br>
&quot;No!&quot; shouted Rrothmal. &quot;I refuse to run! I refuse to hide any longer! We have the key to their magicks! We can face them!&quot;<br>
&quot;No, we cannot!&quot; One of the Frogloks shouted. He stepped forward to speak. &quot;We all know the might of their armies. We are few! If we stand our ground, we will be crushed. We must continue to run and hide, to build the revolution!&quot; Murmurs of agreeance.<br>
&quot;Before you turn and flee, hear what I have to say,&quot; Rrothmal said. The crowd settled down for a moment, caught by curiosity at his words. &quot;For Lord Xog is not sending an army, he is not even sending a troop of Shadowscale! He is sending one man!&quot;<br>
The crowd scoffed and chattered among themselves. The one that had spoken up before again stepped forward. &quot;How is this so? They will send one hunter out before us? Surely, no matter how powerful this man is, our Shin Shamans and our<br>
Iksar Manslayers shall be enough to overcome him!&quot;<br>
Rrothmal surveyed the crowd, hoping to himself that his next words would have the desired effect. &quot;They are sending a champion of the Shadows, a creature Duke Xog has been training personally, an enforcer and a dread terminator. Think of this!<br>
&quot;If we could slay this man, this monster, and mount his head in the center of our camp for all to see, then the other Clans would gather about and know that it IS possible for freedom to win! They would gather behind us, instead of hiding in the deep muck on their underbellies! They would unite and we would finally stand a chance against this evil!&quot;<br>
The crowd was hushed now, Rrothmal had them in the palm of his hand. &quot;Heed me! The vile purveyor of Shadows they send is named Notuanot, and he is Arch Duke Xog's new enforcer! He is every bit as evil and heartless as Cazic-Thule himself!<br>
&quot;A victory against him would be a victory that could unite the Clans! What do you say, Clan Rogpok? What do you say, Outcasts? Are you with me? Are we going to hide here in the muck and the mire to live out our lives, or are we going to challenge them for our natural right to freedom?!?!&quot;<br>
The crowd roared with him. Outcasts hissed and growled and frogloks croaked and ribbitted their approval. &quot;Long live Clan Rogpok! Long live freedom!&quot; shouted one man. &quot;Down with the worshippers of Cazic-Thule!&quot; shouted another. &quot;Challenge the Scaled God! Let purity prevail!&quot; For a long time, what seemed like ages, the crowd gathered about Rrothmal and cheered. Finally, it began to disperse, and the leaders led Rrothmal into the war tent for a council meeting.<br>
<br>
..........................................<br>
<br>
Late in the night, after the meetings and the planning were finally over,Rrothmal slipped into the tent of a young froglok lass named Ghel. A soft cooing and rattling noise greeted his ears. His daughter lay awake in Ghel's arms, tugging playfully at her mother's eyelid.<br>
Rrothmal carressed his daughter's cheek affectionately. She was the only one of their eggs to hatch. The Shamans had said that it would be impossible for them to have children, that their races were just incompatible. Yet here lay this little miracle. Some of the elders even considered her so. There was talk of an omen, of a prophesy.<br>
Rrothmal awoke his young wife with a kiss. She rolled over and her eyelids pulled back over her huge, dark green eyes. The protective membranes slowly pulled back as she fought the urge to go back to sleep. &quot;Hey.&quot; she said sleepily.<br>
&quot;Hey.&quot; he smiled down at her. <br>
&quot;You did good tonight, my love. You did good.&quot;<br>
He sat next to her and began to remove his leather armor and swordbelt.<br>
Silence for a moment. Finally, she spoke again. &quot;You think we can actually win?&quot;<br>
Rrothmal sat his swordbelt aside and rolled over next to her. &quot;They said we'd never live above water, and we do. We don't swim in the muck with the lowdwellers anymore. We live in huts, and tents.<br>
&quot;They said you couldn't give me a daughter, and you did.&quot; The child cooed softly and held onto his arm. Now that he was here, she was finally drifting off to sleep.<br>
She looked lovingly into his large eyes. &quot;This thing they're sending... its as bad as you say?&quot;<br>
&quot;This Notuanot? His name is from the ancient tongue. I tried to find out what it means, but my sources inside are pretty scared of him. I don't care. I'll meet him just like we've met every challenge. Somehow, we'll overcome.&quot;<br>
The night embraced mother, father, and child. For three hearts so brave, hearts so out of place in this cruel, evil world, sleep finally came.<br>
<br>
..............................................<br>
<br>
A pair of eyes glowed an unnatural red somewhere in the darkness above their tent. The eyes belonged to a creature who did not care about love, or freedom. A creature who's only motivation was that these beings were in his way, and must be swept away like sandcastles before the tide. For nothing must stand in his way.<br>
A pair of eyes glowed malignantly in the dark, as their owner contemplating freedom's end.<br>
<br>
............................................................. <br>
<br>
The Fall of Freedom<br>
<br>
The mist rose up off the ground and hung in the air, as if waiting for something. It curled lethargically about Brahm's webbed feet as he stood guard. He leaned casually against a tree and tried to stay awake.<br>
Somewhere in the night, a sound was made, a sound that was out of place.<br>
Brahm sturred from his position leaning against the tree. He stretched, emitted a contented ribbit, and stepped out a few feet to listen for what he had heard.<br>
Movement, through the trees. There was the sound of twigs snapping and the gentle noise of moss squishing under foot.<br>
Brahm searched the treeline ahead of him. There. Moving through the trees, a figure. Not at all trying to conceal itself.<br>
Brahm's mind went on alert. As the figure drew closer, he tried to remember if any of their operatives were due back. Did they have anyone that was supposed to be outside of the camp?<br>
The figure parted from the trees now. It was undoubtedly an Iksar. It began to approach him. Not now, not with him on duty! Could this be the one they sent?<br>
&quot;Know you the voice of freedom?&quot; Brahm asked as the Iksar was several paces away. Brahm had his hand on his sabre hilt, in case the Iksar gave the wrong answer. And he did.<br>
&quot;My voice is the sound of freedom dying,&quot; said Notuanot as he drew his blade.<br>
Brahm's last thoughts were panic and fear. His sabre had not even cleared its sheath before his chest was split open. A gusher of blood glistened green in the moonlight as he fell to the ground in a heap.<br>
And so it began.<br>
<br>
..........................................<br>
<br>
A see of panic surrounded him. Froglok warriors and outcast Iksar charged at him and were cut down as they came, with a slash of his sword or a few words of magic. Translucent green skulls flew in every direction from him. They cackled madly and where their voices were heard, all ran in terror.<br>
The shadows themselves came alive and wrestled with those that ran. The night was his to command.<br>
Notuanot became aware of casting that was not his own.<br>
Several of the Froglok Shin Shamans had gathered and were beginning to cast spells.<br>
Another Froglok cried out in terror as he stomped on its head and crushed its skull. Then the flames begin to slam into him.<br>
He braced his shield against the flamestrikes. The heat from the blasts rolled around him in waves. He pushed forward towards the shamans, with his shield held in front of him.<br>
From the other side of the shamans, a pile of bones lept up from the ground and charged towards them. The skeleton dragged one shaman to the ground and he croaked in agony as he was impaled upon its ribcage. <br>
The other Shamans had their attention divided for an instant.<br>
That was long enough. Notuanot was among them, blade slashing open stomachs and removing limbs. Their knowledge of his magics was not saving them now. They had only learned enough to understand how he was killing them.<br>
The shadows continued to smother and grab at his foes. The skulls continued with their eerie laughter that turned brave men into cowards. The revolution continued to fall.<br>
<br>
...................................<br>
<br>
&quot;He is a monster! Take the book and run, damn you! We will all die!&quot; The Shin Shaman told his Elder, Foraak, who knealt in the tent with the Principals of Pain open in front of him, desperately trying to glean some last minute miracle from its pages.<br>
&quot;I will not run. Rrothmal was right. We have run for too long.&quot;<br>
Foraak turned the pages desperately, searching for one last rune. He was onto something.<br>
&quot;Rrothmal will die too! Death is upon us!&quot; The Shin fled from the tent to join the rest in their madcap scamper. Foraak no longer saw him. His mind was beginning to tie together several runes from the Prinples of Pain. He could see them forming, understand what they meant. They meant death to Notuanot.<br>
<br>
.....................................<br>
<br>
All about him were bodies. Where he found one still twitching, he would stick his blade into it until it stopped. He searched through the tents and finished any he found there.<br>
A Froglok Shin Shaman darted blindly through the foggy camp.<br>
He ran right into Notuanot's shield. He bounced off and collapsed. Notuanot removed his head before he even realized he had been knocked down. <br>
Notuanot made his way through the tents. From one, he heard the unmistakeable chanting of magic. He also recognized the runes being called forth as some of the runes used in his own magic. He tore the tent flap away and stepped in.<br>
<br>
................................<br>
<br>
Foraak's eyes turned black and darkness poured out of them.<br>
He tried to open his mouth and scream, but darkness poured from his mouth, and when he tried to breath, it was snorted from his nostrils.<br>
Foraak stood, trembling, clutching to his chest the Principles of Pain.<br>
Notuanot did not attack yet. He could have easily slain this shaman while he was reeling from the magics he was trying to summon, but something... interesting was happening.<br>
Foraak collapsed back to his knees. The darkness continued<br>
to pour out of Foraak until it hung all about him in a thick sooty cloud. He looked up at Notuanot, eyes the color of the night sky, and said, &quot;I am the doom of you. I have arisen from the darkest depths of-&quot;<br>
Notuanot cut him off with a boot to the side of the head. He fell over on his side and begin to cackle madly, over and over. &quot;Doom! Doom! Doom!&quot; The power of the Principals of Pain was unfathomable to a creature such as this, barely sentient. It had eaten his soul, driven him mad.<br>
Notuanot did not think touching him was a good idea. Instead, he reached out with his own darkness, and let his own harm touch consume Foraak. Sulpher and brimstone exploded around Foraak, and he rithed in a new kind of pain, as his flesh was eaten from his bones by unseen mouths. The <br>
unseen force tore at his heart, and finally, he stopped moving.<br>
Notuanot picked up the book from his cold lifeless hands. Some of the darkness that had poured out of Foraak clung smokily to the book. Notuanot shook it, and the darkness fell away.<br>
The darkness gathered itself around Foraak's body now, and begin to pour itself back inside him, through his mouth and through his eyes. Notuanot watched for a time, until the darkness was completely gone. This was a worthy lesson. Mere mortals were not worthy to touch the essence of The Principals of Pain. To do so would mean death.<br>
<br>
....................................<br>
<br>
Notuanot had what he had come for. The complete Principals of Pain. He emerged from the tent and continued his killing.<br>
From tent to tent, leaving no thing breathing.<br>
As he neared one tent, he saw a movement out of the corner of his eye. He stepped into the movement, flowed with it.<br>
An Iksar was caught by his powerful arm and fell head over heals. The Outcast scampered to his feet, breathing heavily.<br>
Notuanot recognized this one. Rrothmal. The spy.<br>
&quot;You will not have her! You will not take her from me! Die, you demon!&quot; Rrothmal stood between Notuanot and the tent, and at once, Notuanot understood. He did not care.<br>
Rrothmal lunged forward with his sword in an almost passable form of Lightning in the Hills. Notuanot stepped to the side and merely slapped Rrothmal in the back of the head. The Outcast went sprawling across the ground.<br>
Immediately he was on his feet again. He made a reckless attempt at a slash at Notuanot's chest, and it cost him his life. Notuanot again flowed with the motion, raising his own blade to neck height. He was inside Rrothmal's guard now. He did not apply pressure, merely slid his blade across the tender flesh underneath Rrothmal's throat. It opened up and poured forth life's blood.<br>
Rrothmal did not even realize what had happened. Over and over he made reckless lunges at Notuanot and again and again, Notuanot evaded him as he bled his life away. Finally, as the bloodflow thinned out, Rrothmal fell to his knees, no longer possessing the strength to stand. He collapsed on his side, where the rest of his blood poured out as he whimpered his life away.<br>
Notuanot stepped over his body and made his way toward the last tent.<br>
<br>
................................................<br>
<br>
Ghel heard Rrothmal and the demon from Cabilis fighting outside. That is what he was, a demon. No man could do what he had done. He had slain every last warrior and shaman in the village, she was sure of it. She heard no other sounds aside from the struggle outside. She sat nervously awaiting the outcome. When she heard Rrothmal whimpering, she knew what the outcome had been. She cried to herself and rocked her child back and forth. <br>
The child was more Iksar than Froglok. Rather than cry in pain and fear at what was happening, the child growled and hissed, a high pitched sound, and tried to wriggle free of her mother's grasp.<br>
The tent flap opened and cruel fate stepped in.<br>
<br>
.....................................<br>
<br>
Notuanot looked down at the mother and child. She looked up at him with wide Froglok eyes. Eyes that knew her fate. Fearful eyes. Notuanot took in this fear and smiled in pure delight. At the sight of his lips parting from his teeth so eerily, the Froglok woman's expression became one of horrid resignation. She looked up as the blade was raised above her, and watched freedom fall.<br>
<br>
...................................<br>
<br>
He stood over Ghel's corpse, and contemplated the hybrid child that now crawled free of her lifeless arms. It hissed and clawed at him, crawling forward until it could finally claw and bite at his ankle.<br>
Notuanot bent down and picked it up by the still soft scales at the back of its neck. He held it at eye level and regarded it. He could save it the trouble of this life here and now.<br>
Standing there, however, with this broodling in front of him, he had a sudden epiphany. He recalled how his father had similarly stood there with him, newborn in his arms, contemplating his fate. His father, rather than dispose of an unwanted child, had taken him out and placed him at the steps of the Tower of Death, where Froglok slaves had found him and taken him to their quarters in the aqueducts of the city, where he had been raised, until he was old enough to kill those slaves that had raised him and seek out his own life.<br>
What a cruel trick on this world it had been, for his father to spare him.<br>
He just stood there for a moment, thinking. Then, once the child had exhausted herself, he took one of her blankets from the tent and wrapped her in it. he walked out of the tent, and into the night. The Principals of Pain under one arm, the hybrid child cradled in the other.<br>
<br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
Abandonment Issues<br>
<br>
...Notuanot had killed every Froglok of clan Rogpok and every outcast Iksar in the swamp of no hope. Shortly thereafter, he had walked back to Cabilis. <br>
...He now walked along a section of East Cabilis that housed the caves where the Froglok slaves dwelled. They had, of course, the most basic of furnishings. As he walked down Slave rd., the hybrid child cradled in one arm, the Principals of Pain tucked underneath the other, the wind jingled crudely fashioned chimes together. Ribbits filled the air as the slaves slept. Some did not even have huts, or rudimentary caves to sleep in. They huddled together along the street.<br>
...He came to one hut with a planter hanging by the door. He lifted the child up and set her in the hanging planter, squashing the anonymous vines that grew from there.<br>
...Notuanot reached underneath his cloak and withdrew an ornate dagger. He held it in both hands and looked down at the child.<br>
...He had never known his true parents. He had been left at the steps of the Tower of Death when only an infant. Abandoned. Froglok slaves had found him there. They had taken him deep into the warrens below the city, where only those slaves that were beneath scorn lived out their lives when not in servitude. He had been raised in those tunnels, by a pair of Froglok slaves.<br>
...The knife he now held in his hands was the same knife he had used to slit his adoptive parent's throats when he had come of age. He placed the knife gently in the planter next to the hybrid child. He pulled the blankets over it so that its blade would not cut her as she slept.<br>
...He looked down upon the child with a sense of reverence.<br>
Throughout his life, he had felt this huge hole inside himself, this loathing. He had not been born for a purpose, had not been meant to exist. He existed solely because he was ruthless and filled with hate. Deep down, he had always felt a sense of worthlessness. Now, looking down on this child, he no longer felt that. He had come full circle. The hole inside of him was now filled with rage and hatred, as it should be. Rage and hatred that would drive him forward, and drive his foes before him, cattle to the slaughter.<br>
...Notuanot stepped away from the planter, where the hybrid infant slept, cradling a tarnished dagger. He turned, and walked away. He carried The Principals of Pain to his master Lord Xog, who awaited him in the Tower of Death.<br>
<br>

<br>
The Keeper of the Abyss<br>
<br>
...In the halls where shadows conceal things that mortals should not contemplate. In the halls where fear is taught as a way of life. In the halls where darkness binds men's souls.<br>
...In the halls of the Tower of Death, Notuanot ducks into a storage room and pulls the door shut. He can no longer resist the strange curiosity that has overcome him. He leans back against the wall and slides down to rest on his haunches. He opens the Principals of Pain.<br>
...A cloudy darkness leaps from the pages hungrily and envelopes him. It covers Notuanot's skin. He trembles but cannot bring himself to look away from the tome. The darkness crawls over his eyes. They turn black as night. He convulses as the darkness seeps into his soul. The words on the pages of the Principals of Pain seer his brain like bright flashes of light.<br>
...Unaware of what he is doing, he reads the words aloud. &quot;The giver of life dreads you, but cannot exist without you. For without you, there would be no end, and could thus be no beginning. You who drink from the cup of life. Come. Be the end of my beginning. Drink from my cup. I summon you.&quot;<br>
<br>
..........................<br>
<br>
Across the centuries, there had been only a handful of beings to open the Book and read from its pages. They had all died. They had all been too weak. Until now. This one looked upon the pages of the Book with eyes that understood the meaning of pain. He was the key. He had opened the Book, and he would open the void. The Ender of life, the Ender of beginnings looked across the void and stared straight into the soul of Notuanot.<br>
<br>
.........................<br>
<br>
Notuanot saw the eyes, disembodied, black orbs, floating in his vision, as if come out of the book. They stared straight into his soul. Reflected in them, Notuanot saw...<br>
<br>
........................<br>
<br>
I am Notuanot. But I am not. I am...<br>
Standing over a bed. There are two corpses on the bed. I look at them, but cannot focus, cannot make out details.<br>
My hands are covered in blood. Calloused, fleshy hands?<br>
I look to my left. A reflection. Long, flowing white hair.<br>
Insane eyes. Tanned skin.<br>
I sense something to my right...<br>
<br>
........................<br>
<br>
The vision fades. The disembodied black eyes remain, staring into Notuanot's soul. They bestow upon him another vision.<br>
It is glorious.<br>
Notuanot sees four figures, striding across the globe. In their wake, nothing lives. The body parts of their victims lay scattered at their feet.<br>
One is huge. His great muscles ripple as he walks. His unkempt blond hair ruffles about on his head. Blue fire shoots from his eyes.<br>
The second one is thin and pale. His great magics tear at the minds of his enemies. But his powers have taken their toll on his soul. <br>
The third is an unclean spirit. It seems to be a collage of every forsaken entity known to exist. A poisonous cloud hangs about it. <br>
The fourth... Notuanot smiles. The magics of the book still possesses him. He rocks back and fourth on his haunches, smiling and clicking his forked tongue against the roof of his mouth. The fourth is him.<br>
The magic of the Principals of Pain releases him. Abruptly. It is like being thrown into a pit of ice cold water. Notuanot lurches to his feet gasping for air. He slams the Book closed and clutches it to his chest.<br>
Inside his head, a voice whispers. &quot;Come to me. Set me free.<br>
That I might drink from your cup. That I might end your beginning.&quot;<br>
Notuanot closes his eyes for a moment. Takes it all in. He lifts his hand to his face and opens his eyes. Darkness covers his scaled hand. It crawls down his arm and seeps in between the pages of the Principals of Pain. He watches in wonder.<br>
Notuanot stands there for a moment in the storage room. The forceful impact of all he has seen jars his soul. He feels as if something is out there pulling on him, dragging him away from Thule. What is worse still, he feels as though he wants it to.<br>
With a strange new certainty and thoughts of the visions he has seen floating through his head, Notuanot exits the storage room and takes the Principals of Pain to Arch Duke Xog.<br>
<br>
<br>
...................................... <br>
<br>
Fear and Death<br>
<br>
.....It came to pass that Notuanot grew in power and standing within the Empire. He was Arch Duke Xog's personal enforcer. He was sent out again and again into the Swamp of no Hope to drive the Frogloks and Outcasts from their hiding places in the muck and mire. He was sent deep into the hearts of many dungeons to obtain items of power for the Empire.<br>
.....Wherever there was a hint of disloyalty, he was sent to make sure Thule was feared. Many disloyalists were called out and met their end, bleeding in the streets, to his blade.<br>
.....However, there were dark, sinister forces at work. He had not forgotten what he had seen upon opening the Principals of Pain. The visions had been burned into his memory.<br>
.....Across a great void, a voice called out to him. Deep in the night, he would hear it. &quot;I am the Keeper of the Abyss. I am the Lord of Tears. Come. Let me Drink from your cup. Let me end your beginning...&quot;<br>
<br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
.....Notuanot sat up. The voices once again awoke him from slumber. He could not remember the last time he had slept well. He tossed his bedroll aside and stood. He breathed in the sweet smelling air. Somewhere, across the Lake of Ill Omen, a group of explorers from the flesh lands had made camp. They were reported to be squatting in some ancient ruins. Notuanot considered his mission here.<br>
.....He was to find these Explorers and make sure they were aware that they were not welcome here on Iksar lands. All but one were to be slain. The survivor to be sent back maimed and mutilated, and wearing nothing save the skins of his fellow explorers, draped over his body. <br>
.....Another fear tactic. Scare your enemies into submission, they taught him. Make it so fear paralyzes their hearts at the mere sight of you. Deep in his heart, he felt himself question this.<br>
.....They were a mighty people, with a great army. Why then, did they not simply slay all their enemies and drive them into the ground to rot out eternity? Why rely on fear?<br>
.....This was blasphemy, he knew. He had not voiced these thoughts to anyone. However, they weighed on his mind. Within the pages of the Principals of Pain, he had seen the shadow of another power, greater than fear. He had seen himself standing beside that power, basking in its dark embrace.<br>
.....Sleep had once again been driven away by voices in the night. Notuanot strapped on his armor and took up his sword. He loped off into the night to ponder the principals of fear and death.<br>
<br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
The End of the Beginning<br>
<br>
.....I am Notuanot. But I am not. I am... <br>
.....Looking down at my hands. They are fleshy hands. A healthy tan. They are hands covered in blood.<br>
.....I am standing on a bed. At my feet lay to bodies. The one on top is a blonde headed man. His name is Luthor. He was my teacher. The body beneath him is my mother's. My sword is driven through his back, pinning them both to the bed. There are multiple gaping wounds in his back. I stabbed them until they stopped screaming.<br>
.....I look to the left. There is a mirror. I see... A face. Human. Handsome. I was always proud of my looks. My pale white hair hangs straight down to my shoulders and around my face. There is some blood in it too. My eyes. They look so... strange. So, not mine. They are wild. My chest heaves with the strain I have just put on my lungs and heart. My heartbeat refuses to return to normal. I cannot calm myself or stop the adrenaline from flowing.<br>
.....I had heard them talking earlier. They thought I should be at school. I did not go to school because I had a feeling. A premonition. I came back home, but not through the front door. Through my bedroom window. Quietly...<br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
.....&quot;Calm yourself, woman. No one will ever, ever know.&quot;<br>
.....&quot;Oh, Luthor. I am so scared!&quot;<br>
.....&quot;This was YOUR idea, woman! Yours!&quot;<br>
.....&quot;And your sword that cut him down!&quot; I hear her crying. She always cried when she wanted something. She used tears and other things to get what she wanted.<br>
.....&quot;Yes. I did it for you! I did it so we could be together. And now no one knows. We can be together now.&quot; I hear them kissing. He's kissing away her tears. Like my father used to do. Before he was killed by bandits on his way across the Plains of Balgoth. Bandits... <br>
.....My heart had caught in my throat then. I was kneeling outside my mother's room, listening to her make love to the man who killed my father.<br>
....................................................................................<br>
.....I finally manage to regain control. My arms ache. Why? Did I really stab them that many times? I feel I have changed.<br>
Of course I have. I have to leave now. The militia will find out about this. Luthor was a high ranking officer. They'll have my head for this, regardless of who he killed.<br>
.....I sense movement to my left. I turn to look. I see....<br>
Sauroh.<br>
&quot;Come,&quot; he says. &quot;I am the Keeper of the Abyss. I am the Lord of Tears. Come. Let me drink from your cup. Let me end your beginning...&quot;<br>
.....I let him drink. Its a glorious sensation. My life slips away, my will slips away. I fall. I hit my head on the bedpost. I lay there for awhile.<br>
.....When I come to, I find myself laying at the foot of my mother's bed. The bodies are still there. It wasn't some insane dream. I feel a presence. Inside my head. A blackness. An abyss. I stand up and lean against my mother's vanity. <br>
.....I look up into the mirror. I gasp. My eyes have turned black. Not just the pupils, but the irises, too. I know that I'm not looking into my own eyes anymore. I am looking into the eyes of... something else. I smile. My mouth opens, and words come out. &quot;I have been born. I have come into the world. I am not just a formless entity, a concept anymore. I AM. I EXIST!<br>
.....&quot;I have come about as death always comes about. Through tragedy. Through anothers ending, I begin. It has always been so.&quot;<br>
.....I feel power behind these black eyes. The power of death.<br>
I turn and walk to the foot of the bed. &quot;Lets have some fun!&quot; I raise my hands over the bed. I do not chant. Such is the method that humans and elves use to convince themselves they have power. I do not need convincing. I am power. I don't even need to raise my hands, but even death has a sense of style.<br>
.....The corpses of Luthor and my mother begin to twitch. Luthor's corpse groans. He pulls himself up. The blade pinning them to the bed pulls free of my mother's corpse and remains wedged in his sternum as he stands. He lurches about, not completely in control of his musculature. She rolls over and falls off the bed. She stands.<br>
.....I smile at them as the two corpses lurch about the room. Then I point to the doorway. &quot;Kill,&quot; I say. &quot;Burn.&quot; The bodies of my mother and her traitorous lover lurch out the door and into the streets. Soon, I hear the screams begin. <br>
.....I imagine many guards are throwing themselves uselessly against the Zombu I have created. I gave them much power.<br>
Though, it is as nothing against the power I now possess.<br>
.....I walk out the doorway. The city is on fire. Mullenium will pass from this day. This civilization will pass as well. It will pass like a warm summer dream, into an age of war between Gods and Dragons. When the war ends, I shall remain. I may not be in this body, but I will always remain. Why? Because I am death, and death will always remain. <br>
.....I call myself Sauroh. Its a neat name, really. I call myself that because all beings need a name, and because it sounds good. Death is always born in sorrow. Widows weep over husbands' war ravaged carcasses. Mothers cry over stillborn children. Sons cry over aged mothers who pass silently in the night. And death is born.<br>
.....From your end comes my beginning. From your cooling corpse I spring, filled with vitality and hunger. <br>
.....Come. I am Sauroh. I am the Keeper of the Abyss. I am the Lord of Tears. Come. Let me drink from your cup. Let me end your beginning...<br>
.....Wake up, Notuanot. Time to die!<br>
...................................................................................<br>
.....Notuanot awakens from the dream to hear soldiers in the hallway. Dreadscale boots scrape noisily on the stone floor. He had fallen to sleep in his quarters that night after meditation. As usual, his meditations were filled with the visions of the God of Death. Everything was now. Thule was but a memory. Sauroh, Lord of Tears, the God of Death, was all that remained.<br>
.....Dreadscale boots on the floor outside. Magic made it so that no one could hear as the Crusaders moved into place. Notuanot could hear. He had a magic now that they could never understand.<br>
.....He slipped soundlessly from his bed and picked up his serrated sword from where it lay nearby. He unsheathed it.<br>
.....He had not wanted it to come to this. They had found him out. He was at home here. He was as at peace as he could be. Now it was all about to be shattered. In the vernacular of his people, &quot;screw it.&quot; Let them come.<br>
.....The door burst open and the Crusaders filled his room. He heard their magics begin to go to work. Darkness tore at him. Several piles of bones leapt from the shadowy corners. He began to cut and to slash. Limbs were severed and intestines opened to the night air.<br>
.....He fought for what seemed centuries. His guard was never broken. His defense untouchable even against all the Crusaders that the Empire could throw at him. <br>
.....The Crusaders stopped coming. All around him were piles of limbs and shattered pieces of dreadscale. Even that formidable armor could not stand against his magic and his blade now. <br>
.....He heard the Brood begin to cast and summon just outside his window. Poison rained down on him. It barely made its way through his scales. A great skeletal hand clawed its way up the windowsill. The animated dead began to assault him now.<br>
.....The sounds of bones being shatttered and scattered across his quarters echoed in his ears. His heart beat irregularly from the poison in his body. His muscles ached and twitched, and still he fought. He heard someone outside shout &quot;Fall back! We're out of mana!&quot; The skeletons stopped coming.<br>
.....Then he heard another voice, from out in the hallway. &quot;Put an end to this. I will deal with it myself.&quot; Arch Duke Xog stepped through the shattered doorway. He looked around the room at the fallen. &quot;They died bravely. Will you do the same, traitor?&quot;<br>
.....Notuanot met his gaze. The Duke looked sad. Many of his people had died here today. &quot;Did you think your worship of a false God would go unnoticed? The Heirophants sensed that your prayers were not to Thule. They tracked them to a dark, vile source, and alerted me. I have also noticed that you no longer seek to spread the fear of our lord. Indeed, you seem preoccupied in battle, by dark and vile things.&quot;<br>
.....&quot;You are right,&quot; Notuanot said. &quot;But I do not pray to The Lord of Tears. I TALK to the Lord of Tears. For he is not some distant being on a Plane not of this world. For the Lord of Tears is right here. And he is behind you.&quot;<br>
.....Xog began to turn reflexively, and was shoved by an unseen force. He stumbled into Notuanot.<br>
.....Notuanot tried to cut him down, but the Duke was too quick. He caught Notuanot's sword arm and flipped him over. He hit the floor with a thud.<br>
.....&quot;Die like the traitor to Thule you are, heretic!&quot; Xog clawed his open hand into Notuanot's chest cavity. He pulled back and ripped out Notuanot's heart.<br>
.....Crusaders and the Brood gathered around now. They looked down at the fallen heretic. Suddenly, Notuanot's body lurched into a sitting position. His eyes had turned black. He lunged to his feet and began to swing his sword again. <br>
..... Many more were cut down. Xog looked on in horror. He tossed the still beating heart aside and drew his own blade. It was just in time. <br>
.....Notuanot lunged towards the Duke, but what would have been a killin blow was parried at the last instant. Again and again Notuanot struck, and the Duke parried. <br>
.....Xog watched as the creature, this demon, fought. Slowly he was losing strength. Eventually he made one last useless cut at the air, and dropped to one knee. Notuanot's sword clattered to the floor.<br>
.....Notuanot looked up at the Duke. The unholy creature opened its mouth and spoke. Its voice was the sound of wind blowing through a hollow skull. &quot;You are dead, and you don't even know it. You are all dead. The Lord of Tears is come. I am his enforcer. Know this. I shall walk this world again, and when I do, nothing will save you from me.&quot;<br>
.....And then, Notuanot died. In the corner, where the Duke had cast it aside, his heart finally stopped beating. Notuanot's body fell to the ground and he breathed no more.<br>

It stopped shining on the Mountain Giant's fort, from where they held a deathly grip upon the land. Across the plateaus it stopped shining where Sarnak footsoldiers skirmished with Burynai and Goblin. It stopped shining in the valleys and the gulleys. It stopped shining on the tomb of Notuanot.<br>
...It stopped shining as a pair of ebon wings beat upon the air and drove the clouds away. The wings obscured the sun. The great black dragon circled the tomb below it. From below, if you were unfortunate enough to be in its path, you could hear the fearful cries of the pair of humans it held in its grasp.<br>
...The great black dragon reared its head. It let loose its breath weapon and the valley below was smothered in dark, sooty smoke. Animals and goblins and Burynai scattered to try and find shelter, but it was too late. Once the darkness had cleared away, settling in ephemeral pools and seeping into the ground, everything within two miles was dead. The dragon then began to spiral downward toward the tomb that squatted in the middle of the valley.<br>
...The two humans were thrown to the ground. Male and female, they both began to scramble to get away. The darkness leapt up from the ground and wrapped them tight. It did not crush them. Merely held them.<br>
...The great beast snorted and stomped one last time. Then it began to change. It began to shrink. Its wings were absorbed into its back and its long, wiry body straightened out. It took on a human form. The man that stood where once had the black dragon turned his head and surveyed the tomb in front of him. His long white hair blew in the wind. He raised his hand and casually brushed away some of the ash that had been left floating through the air in his wake.<br>
...He locked his gaze on the male human and his eyes narrowed. He walked to where the shadows held them both tight.<br>
...They whimpered and cried, their eyes wide with fright. He took no notice. Their fear of him mattered not. What he wanted was their lives. <br>
...He gestured lazily and walked towards the tomb. The shadows took on almost humanoid forms and dragged their hostages along. The female wailed loudly before a thick tenticle of shadow clamped over her mouth.<br>
...The tomb was built over a century ago by the Troopers of the Greenmist. They used it to lock within their most hated foe. One of their own that had chosen another path.<br>
...The lean figure with the pale hair cocked his head and frowned. A great set of stone doors barred his way. Doubtlessly warded by magic. Such magic was as nothing to him. He raised his hand toward the stone doors. They crumbled in a flair of magic, their wards tearing apart like paper. The pale man stepped over the wreckage and entered the tomb. The shadows dragged his hostages along.<br>
...Total darkness greeted him. The light from outside only went so far down. A small antichamber greeted him, a set of steps against the far wall leading down into the main tomb.<br>
...From the shadows a skeletal form lurched forward. Magic began to hum in the air about it. This was the first guardian. There would be more. <br>
...The magic of the demon before him poured around him like water upon a duck's back. The pale man snarled and the antichamber shook from it. He raised his voice and a million dead men howled with him from across the void. The sound shook the bones of the Guardian and it shattered. Bone chips flew across the room. The magic that had made it hovered in the air a moment, a red haze. Then it blew away with a sudden gust of air.<br>
...The pale man turned and walked down the stairs. The shadows brought his hostages down.<br>
...The darkness was complete. No light shined from within. He could hear rustling from somewhere down below. The stairs seemed to go on forever. Something drew close. He could hear the humans behind him trying to scream. He stopped his descent, and turned.<br>
...His eyes, dark as the tomb around him, cut through the blackness. They saw a black robed being floating down the stairs behind him. He did not move or attempt to stop it. He merely waited. The creature passed through the humans and they shook violently. It floated up to him. Red eyes burned from under its hood. Its voice filled the tomb.<br>
...&quot;Interloper, what lies here lies not for you... What lies here was buried in ages past for the good of the empire...For the justice of the empire...You have violated this tomb and you have forfeited your life...&quot;<br>
...The pale man looked into the burning red eyes. No emotion crossed his face. His white hair blew across his eyes. &quot;I have no life to forfeit, Guardian. Go your way.&quot;<br>
...The Guardian hissed and a cold, bone chilling wind blew over them. The humans shook from fear. Even the shadows trembled. The pale man did not move.<br>
...&quot;Look into my eyes, Guardian. See what has come here into your abode. Your presence is irrelevent. Deter me, and your existence ends.&quot;<br>
...The Guardian rose up before him and suddenly a great scythe arched through the air at the pale man. The scythe never found its mark.<br>
...The pale man struck out with an open hand. Black magic howled through the air around him. The scythe was sent spiraling down into the tomb below. The Guardian was torn in every direction by unseen hands. It wailed and cried as it fell apart. Finally, its magic ceased to be. A simple black shroud fell to the steps before the pale man, empty. The pale man turned and continued to walk down.<br>
...The stairs led deep into the heart of the undermountains. No light guided them. The pale man did not need it. The shadows followed with their prisoners bound in ebon tenticles.<br>
...They reached the bottom of the stairs. The pale man stepped down onto the cold stone floor of the tomb of Notuanot. He glanced down and where his feet touched the ground, it caught fire. He left a burning trail in his wake. the shadows moved aside and carried the human couple away from harm. <br>
...The tomb was now alight. In its center was a vast pit. Bones littered the pit. The remains of loyal Crusaders who had likely sacrificed themselves to some great magic that was used to bind Notuanot's soul in the abyss forever. The Keeper of the Abyss had found his soul. The Keeper was here now, to bring it back into the world.<br>
...The pit sank down at a slope and at its center it was charred back. They had burned his remains with their magic to seal him here. A single skeleton lay in the center. Its frame was undeniably Iksar. <br>
...The pale man stepped down into the pit. As he did, the bones of the sacrificed Crusaders jumped to life. All around him, they rose up. The pale man smiled. His eyes surveyed the host that rose up against him now, a small army of undead Crusaders. <br>
...&quot;Woe to you sheep!&quot; the pale man's voice boomed throughout the tomb. &quot;Have you not guessed who I am yet? You constantly stand in my way, first the living, then the dead. You are dust in the wind. I AM the wind. I am Sauroh! I am Death! And I have come for what belongs to me!&quot; Sauroh threw his cloak aside. His blood red armor gleamed in the tomblight. He unsheathed a sword of bone and began to cut a path through the skeletal Crusaders. They threw themselves at him and were dissected. <br>
... His sword not only cut at their bones but also shattered the magic of the spell that had made them. The spell that also bound Notuanot's soul.<br>
...Waves of flame shot out from him. Crusaders toppled to the ground from the blows of Sauroh's bonesword. The flames ate their bones until one last Crusader stood. It lurched forward and made its attack.<br>
...Sauroh turned to walk away. As he did, he gestured idly at the last Crusader. Its bones flew apart and its reanimated existence came to an end. Sauroh walked to the center of the pit.<br>
...Sauroh looked down at the corpse. They had buried him as they had slain him, naked. His flesh and scales had long since rotted away.<br>
...The shadows dragged the humans into the pit. Sauroh turned toward them. The shadows let go of the male and he fell forward. He struggled to his feet. Sauroh grasped him by the throat.<br>
...Sauroh looked into his wide, frightened eyes and said, &quot;Do you know who I am child? Because I know who you are. You are Enoch of Qeynos. You were out in the streets when I took you. What were you doing out that late?&quot;<br>
...Enoch gasped but could not speak. His words wanted to come out. He wanted to confess his sins in hopes this dark God would forgive him, in hopes that someone would forgive him and free him of this fate. But he could not. something was inside him and it had sealed off his voice. It was mortal fear.<br>
...Sauroh shrugged. &quot;It doesn't matter. I don't need your words. I don't need your fear. I just need your life force.&quot;<br>
...Sauroh held onto Enoch and rose into the air. He hovered over the corpse in the center of the pit. He held Enoch over the pit.<br>
...Enoch trembled and held onto Sauroh's arm with both of his own. He struggled to look below him, as he was sure something horrible was happening. It was.<br>
...An invisible force, a hungry force, rose up from the pile of bones. It pulled at Enoch's flesh. Enoch's flesh began to tear and come off. He suddenly found his voice and screamed.<br>
...The force ripped and tore away at Enoch. His flesh came off in great bloody gobs and fell down into the pit and onto the pile of bones below. The flesh began to crawl over the bones and fill them. <br>
...More of Enoch's flesh was torn away by the invisible force and as it fell it began to take on the shape of organs. It began to fill the skeleton's rib cage with a heart and intestines. The invisible force tore away at Enoch's exposed muscles now. Enoch went into seizures and frothed at the mouth. He shook horribly as his muscles and flesh were torn away and fell to the pit below.<br>
...The skeletal form below, now with a complete set of lungs, a heart, and a stomach, began to tremble. One boney hand raised up. A gob of flesh fell right onto it and crawled over it. The flesh of Enoch became Notuanot's muscle tissue and cartilage.<br>
...Enoch's legs were now eaten away up to his hips. His blood poured down and joined with the rest. It crawled across Notuanot's skeletal form and became kidneys, spleen. It continued to cover his skeleton in muscle tissue.<br>
...The invisible force tore at Enoch's torso now. His own organs were torn away. He convulsed one last time, his eyes rolling all the way back into his head, as his heart was pulled out and fell to the pit, crawling onto the skeletal form, becoming Notuanot's eyes and the musculature of his face.<br>
...The last of Enoch fell away and was absorbed by the trembling body below. Sauroh cast his skeleton aside. As he did, the marrow oozed from Enoch's bones and dribbled down into the pit. The half-formed creature below lurched and crawled to the edge of the pit. Its eyes had no lids, its face had no scales to cover it. It put its face down into the pool of bone marrow and began to drink of it.<br>
...The female had witnessed all of this. She trembled as Sauroh reached for her throat. She screamed. Sauroh lifted her into the air and hovered out over the pit.<br>
...She kicked and screamed. Sauroh reared back once and slapped her. She moaned and wailed. The creature below rolled back over and looked up. It saw Sauroh above it, with the scared human girl.<br>
...The girl trembled and mouthed the word &quot;no&quot; over and over. The invisible force began to claw at her body. It tore out her hair and scalp and it fell down into the pit...<br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
...Sauroh waited for the marrow to drip down from the skeleton he held now. A piece of cartiladge that held its leg on snapped and its skeletal leg fell into the pit. Notuanot crawled across the pit. He greedily snatched up the legbone. He bit into it and sucked the marrow from it.<br>
...Sauroh tossed the skeleton aside. Before him now, in the pit, he beheld his newly created demon. &quot;Tell me your name,&quot; Sauroh commanded, in lizardman. <br>
...The creature struggled to its feet. It stood before him, naked, whole. &quot;I am... Notuanot.&quot;<br>
...Sauroh nodded. &quot;Come here, Notuanot.&quot; The Lizardman lurched forward on its new legs, formed from the flesh and blood of innocence. It stepped out of the pit that had been its tomb.<br>
...Notuanot ran his scaled hands over his body, as if making sure everything was there. His fingers slipped into a gaping crater in his chest and he pulled his hand away, startled.<br>
...Sauroh smirked. There was indeed a huge hole in the center of Notuanot's chest, where his heart should be. Sauroh lifted a bag in his hand, that hung on a chord around his neck. He reached into it, and pulled something out. It was a heart. Still beating. Blood dripped from it onto the ground at his feet.<br>
...Notuanot took a few cautious steps forward and held out his hands expectantly. &quot;Looking for this?&quot; Sauroh asked him. Notuanot nodded.<br>
...Sauroh shook his head and put the heart back in the bag. &quot;I don't think so. That is the talisman by which I bind you. As long as I hold it, I hold you.&quot;<br>
...Notuanot put his open hands down at his sides and kneeled before Sauroh. &quot;You are the one. You are The Lord of Tears.&quot;<br>
...Sauroh smiled. &quot;Yes. I am the God of Death. Come to me. Let me fill your cup. Let me begin the ending. The ending of all.&quot;<br>
...Notuanot leaned forward on one knee. He spread one hand out open on the ground before him. He had no sword. He rested the other hand on his bare knee in the traditional Iksar bow. &quot;I have come, my master. I am here to do your bidding, my master.&quot;<br>
...&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sauroh. &quot;You are. You are my hand. You are the hand of Death.<br>
...&quot;You will clutch at the throats of my enemies,&quot; said Sauroh. &quot;You will lay them, lifeless, on the ground at my feet.<br>
You will pile them up like kindling. I will start the fire. The fire will burn. And it will burn Norrath to ash!&quot;<br>
...Sauroh raised his hands into the air. Magic began to gather around him. &quot;One more thing. One final step.&quot; Darkness came. It rapped itself around Notuanot and lifted him into the air. He did not struggle. He had been remade. He was his master's tool now, to be shaped and molded as The Lord of Tears saw fit. <br>
...The darkness seeped into his flesh and into his bones. It filled his eyes and they began to glow red. When the darkness was all inside Notuanot, he collapsed to the ground.<br>
...&quot;There,&quot; Sauroh said as Notuanot struggled to his knees. &quot;That shall come to be known as Notuanot's Curse. Whenever you strike down another being, it shall rise again when I call it, to come march in my undead army. You will strike down humans. You will strike down other Iksar. <br>
...&quot;You will kill, without prejudice, without caring, without restraint. When I chose one to be marked for my own, you will take them. Your previous life is gone. I do not care for your previous quarrels. I only care for what you can do for me. And what you can do for me, Hand... is kill!&quot;<br>
...Notuanot held his hand out in front of him and closed it into a fist. He looked up at the Lord of Tears with burning red ember eyes. &quot;I... am. I... kill.&quot;<br>
...&quot;Yes!&quot; Sauroh clasped Notuanot's hand and pulled him to his feet. &quot;Kill for me! Kill for me! Harvest. Go! Go out into the world. Drink from its cup. End its beginning!&quot;<br>
...Notuanot bowed deeply before the Lord of Tears. He then loaped off into the night. He climbed the stairs of his tomb. <br>
....................................................................................<br>
<br>
...He went out into the Frontier Mountains. He killed. He went to the Dreadlands. He killed. He crossed an ocean and arrived at the city of men. He killed. And each time a foe fell before him, they rotted into the ground. Marked by the Curse of Notuanot. One day, the Lord of Tears would call them. And when he did, a great host of undead would rise up, the Bearers of the Curse. They would rise up and sweep across Norrath.<br>
...But until that day, Notuanot kills. And the Lord of Tears fills the abyss with the souls of his victims...<br>

He went first into the Frontier Mountains. <br>
...He stumbled back and forth as if drunk. His new legs did not want to support him. He fell face down into the dirt. He heard the footsteps. Giants. Two of them by the sound.<br>
...He rolled over and looked up. Their huge bodies obscured the night sky. One's visage was framed by the moon. Its voice shook the ground. &quot;Little lizard man. We feed on you, little lizard man. You good food!&quot;<br>
...Brainless. Useless. Giant sacks of execrement! Suddenly his legs would work. He stood up and looked high into the night to meet the giant's gaze. &quot;In my darkest hour,&quot; he said &quot;did my greatest strength show. As I lay in my tomb, did my soul quicken to the dark lord.&quot;<br>
...&quot;Lets play... kick the lizard!&quot; One of the giants booted him across the Dreadlands. He was knocked through a tree. He heard it snap in two under his weight and momentum, yet he felt...nothing. He stood back up, his back broken, and still felt nothing.<br>
...&quot;Kick the lizard!&quot; bellowed the other giant with utter unabashed glee. It charged across the distance and drew back its foot with almost poetic grace. Notuanot shadowstepped.<br>
...The giant's foot cut through the shimmering remains of Notuanot's magic. He was on the other side of it now, and had already begun to cast a spell.<br>
...&quot;Oh, golllllly!&quot; exclaimed the first giant. It stumbled backward in stark terror and fell on its ass.<br>
...&quot;What be wrong with you?&quot; asked the second giant. Notuanot unleashed the shadows. They simmered up from the ground and crawled up the second giant's legs as the first one ran in the opposite direction uprooting the sycamore and oak trees of the dreadlands in its wake.<br>
...The remaining giant struggled against the shadows and reached forward and down toward Notuanot. &quot;Gonnnna get yooou!&quot; it howled. The wind picked up the noise and carried the eerie howl throughout the land.<br>
...&quot;Never!!!!&quot; Notuanot raged into the night air. The Harmtouch he had been taught by Xog himself so long ago manifested tenfold, empowered by the god of death.<br>
The Harm exploded in the giant's chest cavity and blew its upper torso into a thousand bloody pieces. As they rained down on him, Notuanot felt... nothing.<br>
...The Giant's lower body and legs just stood there for a moment, dazed. Then, slowly, it too toppled. Notuanot let it fall toward him. He did not care. He felt nothing. Numb inside. A peaceful numbness.<br>
...Then the impossible happened. As the remains of the giant toppled forward, surely to crush him, Notuanot unleashed a second Harmtouch. It blew the giant to pieces as it fell forward and its remains fell about Notuanot like blood rain.<br>
...He stood there for a long time, drenched in gore. It had begun to snow. The cold bitter wind bit at his scales, but he felt it not. The cold bitter wind sang its lonely song to him, and it comforted him somehow.<br>
...Notuanot, who had just this evening found his new legs, began to run. He ran through the mountains and into a cave. Through the cave spread a vast wasteland sparsely populated by only a few trees. He kept running. He ran past the ruins of a castle that had been built and had collapsed in the time he had been entombed. He ran through snow covered hills.<br>
...His leg muscles tore and bled from within, but he felt nothing. They regenerated as fast as they could tear and he kept running.<br>
...His undead lungs lay dormant in his chest. A pair of useless reminders of what he once was. He did not need them to drive him now. He felt nothing. He ran.<br>
...He tripped over a cliff and fell, bouncing down the side of a mountain. He came to rest with a grunt against something solid and white. He looked up into the eyes of a great white dragon. &quot;Here now, child. Why be you running so? You've been running around here for weeks! You must be tired.&quot;<br>
...Notuanot sprang to his feet and growled at the dragon. &quot;You stupid fat cow! Dont you see!? I feel NOTHING! It hurts no more! It hurts no more!&quot;<br>
...The dragon snorted a halfhearted ring of smoke into the air. &quot;I'm not fat,&quot; she said, and batted her giant eyes shut. The sound was like stone grating on stone. She shifted her weight and huffed, and a landslide started nearby.<br>
...Notuanot took off up the side of the cliff. The dragon called after him, &quot;You ought to sit down for awhile!&quot;<br>
...Notuanot ran. He reveled in the painlessness. Pain is a reaction your nerves have to tell you that you are damaging yourself, or being damaged. The nerves in Notuanot's body were all dead. HE was dead. All his life the sensations that had weighed him down, they were all gone now.<br>
...He felt no fear. For the first time in his existence, he felt no obligation to fear anything. Not Thule. Not death. He had overcome death. Or rather, death had overcome him.<br>
...Notuanot ran. He came to a land afire. He found a giant wasp with a fiery stinger that tried to sting him. He let it.<br>
It's giant fiery stinger pierced his scales. It was the most glorious sensation he had ever felt. There, just barely, underneath the scales, was the ghost of pain. Well buried underneath callouses and decayed scales that were slowly turning to stone.<br>
...Notuanot let the giant wasp sting him again and again. Eventually, the wasp collapsed to the ground. It had torn its stinger and had bled to death. <br>
...Notuanot ripped the stinger from its corpse and plunged it into his belly. The flames tore him apart from within. He pulled the stinger out and watched the scales reknit themselves over the wound. The wound healed itself from within. <br>
...Again, and again, and again, Notuanot jabbed the stinger into his own body, until the fire died upon its tip and it was nothing more than a hardened piece of cartilage. Notuanot tossed it aside and rolled over on his back.<br>
...He looked up at the stars. He looked up at Luclin. He lay there. Not panting. Not exhausted. Just there. his wounds had healed, and always would. His body required no sustenence now to fight off fatigue, no rest, no sleep. All it required was...<br>
...Blood. He would need to feed soon. The fat white dragon had said he had been running for weeks. If so then, how long had he been running now? He felt the hunger burning within him. It was the first sensation he could actually fully feel.<br>
...He panted and writhed on the charred ground. He howled into the night. The sound was the only sound to be heard for miles and miles. Notuanot lurched to his feet.<br>
...&quot;Someone... is going to die now.&quot; He looked up and saw the sun burning overhead. He had not noticed it. It mattered not. He could not feel the sun on him. He could not feel anything but the hunger. He let it consume him and followed it where it led him. <br>
...It led him to Firiona Vie, and to the blood of high elves. There, drenched in their blood, he could feel again. He could feel the hunger ebb and subside as he gorged. He could feel it rise and flow through him. <br>
... He would play games with it. He would starve himself from blood until it hurt so bad he could not move. He would lay where he was and shiver. He would lay this way until something to feed upon ventured close enough. By this time he was in a frenzy and let the frenzy control him. Then, at last, he would feed.<br>
...He would go into towns at night and kill, merely to see the blood flow. He would gorge himself until he could drink no more. Then he would spill the blood purely for sport. <br>
...Ages came and went. Decades passed. They came to know his name. They came to fear him. He did not care for their fear. Only for their blood and their death.<br>
...They sent out a party of vampire hunters, believing that one of Mayong's berserk creatures had somehow found its way into the wilds of Firiona Vie. As their population dwindled, they searched in vain. <br>
...Finally, they caught him. So gorged was he that he lay in a state of torpor, unable to move, unable to care. Perhaps it was more a state of curiosity to see what they would do. What they COULD do to him. Would they be able to make him feel?<br>
...They could not find a way to kill him. His flesh was like stone, unable to be pierced or sliced. Poison and flame washed over him with no effect. At times he howled in laughter at them.<br>
...With nothing else to do, they decided to take him out to sea and toss him into the water in a great sarcophogus. The boat never returned to shore. In fact, years later, a boat drifted and ran aground just south of Freeport near the shores of the Desert of Ro. There were no passengers or crew upon that boat. Only a single sarcophogus sitting on the deck, covered in chains and broken magical runes...<br>
