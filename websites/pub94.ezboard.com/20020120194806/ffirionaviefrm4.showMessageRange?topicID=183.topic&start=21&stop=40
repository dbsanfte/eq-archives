I worked things out with Krystallgold, the halfling druid I gave the page to.  She apologized for the misunderstanding (I would have appreciated an apology for the deception, but I guess that's close enough) and told me the next time Dyllin appears, I can take him.  She also told me when he was last defeated.<br>
<br>
So, I'll put my irritation on hold.  If the Order of the Oaken upholds their word and lets me take the next one, then all I've asked for will have been met.  If, however, I show up when he's supposed to be there and they've farmed him again...  well, my respect for them will most certainly plummet.  (It's hovering pretty low right now, though.)<br>
<br>
So, I guess we'll see.  I do give credit to Krystallgold.  She was well-meaning and wanted to work things out.  None of the others did, though.<br>

<br>
Once again I point out another example why the language barrier is a *bad* idea, even though it seemed neat to start with.<br>
I reckon this would've been cleared up quickly if you could understand each other, with a simple<br>
<br>
&quot;You camping this?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;<br>
&quot;Okay.  Can I get the next one?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure.  I'll send you a tell when I've gotten this one&quot;<br>
(translate to roleplay yourself - I'm too tired!)<br>
<br>
If s/he was half reasonable, he was probably only &quot;farming&quot; this guy for the guild when nobody else was after him (waste not want not), and would take a break from it if anyone asked to have a turn.<br>
But since the language barrier was in the way, that discussion couldn't take place, and all he saw was you taking the spawn from in front of him - not a good impression I guess :/<br>
<br>
BTW I think you did the &quot;nice&quot; thing (not sucker) as I would've done exactly the same.  Usually turns out for the better when you do something like that - does your reputation good as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Shame how it turned out, but you definitely did the right thing IMO. <p>-- <br>

I understood about as much as I understand two native French speakers going at it--one word in maybe five, but that's sometimes enough to piece together the gist, if not the exact meaning, of what was being said.<br>
<br>
I could understand if they were 'farming' it at unusual times.  And, I admit, I was up at 3:00 a.m. Pacific time when the first event happened.<br>
<br>
But she was still there at 7:00 a.m. PT.  And 10:00 a.m.  And 12:00 noon.  Which would be 10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 3:00 p.m. Eastern time.  Not exactly 'weird' or 'off' hours, especially over the Winter Break from school/college.  And the whole guild was swarming the spawn spot, too.  Up to five members of the Order of the Oaken there.<br>
<br>
I still have yet to see if they keep their word.<br>

(ooc)Dude, wtf, they are walking all over you.  What they are doing is crap.  I have decided I will never group with one of them.  They represent Complete Dishonor and this last post from you confirms what jerks they truely are.<br>
<br>
Even if Dylln comes back up, someone else could be camping him.  What then?  How much longer do you have to wait?  You died once already, you took a hard faction hit, and you deserve that damn page.  Especially since they are farming it without a doubt and they do not deny it.  It just makes me sick to hear of such a thing happening to a good guy like yourself.<br>
<br>
It's stuff like what they are doing that makes me sick of this game, but it won't make me leave.  Man, I am a generous person too, but I swear.  grrrr.  This entire thread has touched a nerve with me.<br>
<br>
By telling you that you can get the page next time only ensures that you will have to continue to wait and hope that you do get him.  Eventually you will but it is your time.  Their &quot;less then generous offer&quot; of just saying sorry about the missunderstanding, get back in line, we will hold off farming him if we see you around.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
Woe, to the next person who wants a testament and arrives to a zombie monk standing watch over Dylln's tent.  He will no doubt have to go through all the crap the order of oaken has put you through unless of course they finally get all of the testaments they need and move onto the next farming target...( which is a good possibility by their actions here)<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Of course, what if you are not around and they see him up, do you think they will give you the next page if they get it?  That is what you should ask them.  Of course, you would never know unless they decided to tell you or unless you sit there and waste your time waiting while you should already have that page and be working on other things.<br>
<br>
And there is no excuse for them calling you a KSer.  If they had honor then they would also give you a full apology.<br>
<br>
But honor is not a requirement to play this game and lack of honor does also fit nicely into roleplay.  <br>

<br>
I logged back in, and Runningbear was there.  He was there this morning with Shewina.  I think he's a warrior.  Some kind of Barbarian in banded mail weilding big blunt weapons.  Could possibly be a shaman.  Even with me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I hailed him twice.  No reply.<br>
<br>
Then, after about five minutes (however long it takes a Firefist to sputter out), he comes up and insists I /inspect him.  I do, and in the text-box of his /inspect is &quot;Will u tell me what time u kill him plz and sow me plz?&quot;<br>
<br>
I said &quot;No, and no&quot;, went back to my perch and sat back down.<br>
<br>
Anyone who knows me at all knows a) I only cast blessings like that on the faithful of the Mother of All, and b) only on those who ask for it properly (i.e. *NOT* &quot;sow plz&quot;), and c) what is that, using /inspect to get around the language barrier and roleplaying?<br>
<br>
Anyway, a few minutes later, I get a /tell from Krystallgold, Runningbear's beloved according to his /inspect info, saying &quot;I heard you were rude to Runningbear&quot; or something to that effect.  I told her &quot;I only cast Spirit of Wolf on the faithful of the Mother of All&quot;, and told her she might want to check her guild's website.<br>
<br>
At this point, Runningbear had left.<br>
<br>
I'm starting to see how this works.  Anyone who comes there to finish the Testament of Vanear, if they're not a member of the Order of the Oaken, is &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;kill stealing&quot;.  It's not the Order's behavior that's the problem, but the rest of the universe's.<br>

I'm sorry to see that you're still having difficulties. I've done what I can at present to bring your grievance to the attention of the Order's officers. It's unfortunate that none have them have been able to post here at this point.<br>
<br>
May I ask on behalf of the Oaken that you refrain from further public discussion until one of them has had an opportunity to answer your concerns? Give them a chance to gather information and take appropriate steps, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with the response. The actions of a few misguided members notwithstanding, most of the Oaken are righteous folk and would not knowingly participate in this kind of affair.<br>
<br>
If the problem persists, and can be corroborated by others, I and several other Oaken members will be looking for new guilds.<br>
<br>
Please, give Thymbul a tell in-game.<br>

<br>
Well, if you insist.<br>
<br>
I have two concerns here. <br>
<br>
First, for my own reputation; I want to be sure that my honour is not impugned by the actions of those I associate with. If it is, I intend to cancel that association, since my own reputation is more valuable to me personally. <br>
<br>
Second, I can't be idle while the reputation of my associates is impugned by another. <br>
<br>
I've spent a few minutes in guild chat, and have been privvy to something that to this point hasn't been presented on this board, the Oaken's side of the story. Seems your own behaviour isn't as innocent as you've alluded. Although I can't speak from direct experience, not being present, I'm told some of the others who were there will be along shortly to fill in the gaps.<br>
<br>
Shewina was camping Dyllin, and was waiting on help to take him down. Could she use the page? No. Who cares, many of her guild mates can, and besides, why would you loot the bard's letter when it could serve you no purpose either?<br>
<br>
So after she had been there for 6 hours or so, you come along and make some weak attempts at communication, and while she's trying to figure you out, you jump Dyllin and kill him. <br>
<br>
That's ok, that may be impolite, but PnP guarantees you that if you hit it first, you get to keep it.<br>
<br>
Here's the weird part. In an apparent fit of conscience, you give up the prize to Shewina and her newly arrived assistant, Krystalgold. How wonderful, you seemed to realize that Shewina and Krystal had planned this camp and let them keep the reward. What a nice guy!<br>
<br>
Cut to today, when Shewina and another Oakie have again set up camp for another page. Is it their problem that you feel it is your Tunare granted privilege to show up 10 minutes before Dyllin pops to kill him on cue? Regardless of the issue of quest monopolization, if you ain't got the stamina to stand in line, quit yer bitchin. Now, if there was an agreement between you and Shewina yesterday that you would take over the camp when she left, I have yet to hear of it from an Oakie.<br>

Are the Oaken monopolizing Dyllin Starshine? That seems to be up for debate right now. I and most other members are dead set against camp hogging. Apparently we've been holding that camp for a few days in a row now, and I've asked it to stop. I hope it will. I firmly believe that our reputation is far more important than that stinking book. <br>
<br>
Were you treated rudely? I dunno, the other parties say no, they say that you were rude to them. On a language challenged server, who can tell? I would hope that your role-playing would extend to a better performance than simply barking 'NO' in response to a simple request. <br>
<br>
It's obvious that you feel that you are an injured party in this debacle. I contend that you've mitigated any damages by publicly defaming and libelling the Order of the Oaken. <br>

<br>
Actually, that's the story exactly as I represented it.  Please re-read what I posted.  I did leave out one detail.  The first part of this occurred right before 3:00 a.m. (2:45 a.m.) Pacific, right before the 4 hour patch.  I set my alarm, hoping that no one would be there that early and that maybe Dyllin would respawn.  I get up and get on at 7:03 a.m., 3 minutes after the server went up (presumably).  Shewina was already there.  You told me I should have &quot;got in line&quot;.  That was exactly what I intended to do, but each time I tried, Shewina was there.  I know that your guild acquired at least one and maybe two more pages in the intervening time.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the guild, or at least Krystallgold, adhered to their (or her) word and let me take the site, and I successfully completed the quest.<br>
<br>
Whether your guild is farming this item or not has yet to be determined.  It does leave some troubling questions unanswered.<br>
<br>
For example, why, after I gave Shewina and Krystallgold the page, did Shewina stay?<br>
<br>
Why was she there first thing in the morning, after I'd given her what she was putatively after?<br>
<br>
Exactly how many Testaments of Vanear did she need?<br>
<br>
Why, when I ran into Krystallgold later, didn't she have a Testament, when she was the one who I had given the page to (and, later, she told me she hadn't gotten one yet, and if anyone deserves one, she does)?  I was led to believe that Krystallgold was the &quot;friend&quot; Shewina was waiting for, but apparently not.<br>
<br>
Here's an interesting link: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guildsay.com/boards/view_thread.php?id=5834&type=g&board=310">www.guildsay.com/boards/v...&board=310</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  I think &quot;Kimmz&quot; response about how this isn't farming because of Firiona Vie's Trivial Loot Code is very telling about their attitude about this.<br>
<br>
Lastly, &quot;defamation&quot; and &quot;libel&quot; only stick when the charges are untrue.  I'm reporting the truth, as I know it to be.  Even your account of what occured is in line with my account here.  You admit they've &quot;held the camp for a few days&quot;.  And, according to your words on your guild's message board, this isn't about who's right but about &quot;damage control&quot;.  Spin control.  There's no substantial disagreement about the facts about what happened.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you and your guild look bad, but it's not my behavior that's making them look bad.  It's their own behavior.  If they were honorable, then their actions should speak well of them and here they most definitely do not (or, as my mother used to tell me, don't do anything you don't want on the Six O'Clock News).  They only have themselves to blame for the &quot;pr problem&quot;, as you put it on your guild's message board.<br>

We all pay our dues to play this game, and we are entitled to the same rights under the right circumstance.  I'd say if you are helping a &quot;friend&quot; to camp something that he/she wants, your &quot;friend&quot; best be there as well.  It really ticks me off to see a warrior/monk/shadownknight/int casters standing there as a &quot;place holder&quot; camping for the page which is only helpful to those wisdom based toons.  People really have to remember that we are playing on a MMORPG where thousands of people are involved instead of treating EQ as their own backyard to do whatever they want.<br>

<br>
Nobbwin, your own actions/defense is impecable, I am impressed by your desire to keep your guild's reputation intact.<br>
<br>
That said, if a monk is continually camping the Dyllin spawn, and if said monk is too high to even fight Dyllin.. said monk should leave.  I can't quite figure out what level she is, but the other link was almost indicative that she was waiting on others because she can't fight him without trivial'ing him. So she's acting ONLY as a placeholder camper, which is just wrong on a camp that's highly desirably by a lot of folks.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering.. if the claimant died while first originally killing Dyllin ... why didn't she help him? Did she enjoy his death, since he'd gotten Dyllin?  That part bothered me... if she was afk/asleep, not trying to respond (a simply /boggle would count as a response if you cannot understand it) ... then the camp is not really hers. It's part of the &quot;you snooze, you lose&quot; deal, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
The claimant also returned the page.. that was highly impressive.   There's 2 actions after that that are acceptable.  1. leave the camp, having obtained what was desired 2. return the page, with a little note saying &quot;hey, we are trying to get several of these, so I dont' feel right about keeping this one&quot; ...  <br>
<br>
Keeping it, while continuing the camp, is just cheap.<br>
<br>
In my eyes, Shewina's actions were dishonorable.<br>

If Oaken is  monopolizing a very sought after spawn continuously for days to the exclusion of all others, then shame on them.

<br>
I have been with the Order of the Oaken for about a month now and have found all the members there to be very enjoyable company.   I have also made many friends that are not members of the Oaken and I wish to keep them.  <br>
<br>
I did make a comment about this issue on my guilds private WEB site this morning.  After thinking about it a bit more, I do see how other folks could feel that there is an element of unfairness in our guild getting the page for its members.   Several of our members are beyond the point that they can acquire the page now due to the TLC code and ,as most of you know, there is no economy to speak of.   Getting lower levels to perform those quests is the only option available to our higher level members.   <br>
<br>
Having said that,  I will do what I can to address this issue with my fellow members tonight when I log on.   I wish others to view my guild as a respectable organization and not a bunch of powerlevelers out to conquer the world.  Feriona Vie was made for the enjoyment of all who love to play everquest, not just a few.   <br>
<br>
I look forward to meeting you all online. )<br>

I would like to appeal to Oaken to remember we are on a small server population-wise, and that should be seen as a blessing. On the larger population servers, might unfortunately makes right and powerful guilds exert their ability to camp and hold spawns indeffinately to allow their membership to equip the best stuff. It does not have to be like that here since we are all much more likely to know one another and to have interacted in some way in the past. Camping and holding the Dyllin spawn simply because you can and farming the page for your membership that leveled too fast and missed the window is simply wrong. We can do much better here, and that kind of precident is a step in the wrong direction imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/21/01 5:00:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A guild is like a chain</span><hr size=1> Okay, I really didn't intend to post again in this thread, but I feel I have to.<br>
<br>
The Order of the Oaken members have been launching all kinds of accusations about me here and on their private message board (&quot;Kill-Stealer&quot;, &quot;whiner&quot;, &quot;flamer&quot;, even &quot;cry-baby&quot;).  I guess that's what I get for having done what I thought was the right thing and giving them the page.<br>
<br>
The charge that irritates me the most, however, is that I don't have the patience to wait out the camp.  I do.  The guild was refusing to give me a chance at it at all until Krystallgold, bless her, intervened on my behalf.<br>
<br>
I just spent the last three days (THREE DAYS!  not six hours!) in Blackburrow collecting Blackburrow Casks for the Cloak of Jaggedpine quest.  I even gave the second one I found away to Chase, who had two and needed his third to get the Cloak, setting me back another day it turns out.  I swam, I (the player) read for my PhD exams (got half a book read between Gnoll Brewers), sitting on the boulder right by the Razorgill place, helping out lower-level characters if they got in trouble near where I was sitting vigil (or practicing swimming--moved up 70 points in that time).<br>
<br>
I was expecting to have to wait at this site, too, probably as long as I spent in that bottom level of Blackburrow, but when I got there, Dyllin was up.  I was phenomenally lucky in that, and I don't deny that.  I had no prior knowledge that he was there or would be at that time.  I was just checking in--and for the first time--and &quot;beginner's luck&quot; struck.  Sometimes, people get lucky.  That's part of the game.  In retrospect, I should not have looked that gifthorse in the mouth; I should have just taken my stuff and moved on.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry the Order of the Oaken's guildmembers failed to complete this quest at the appropriate level to do it, but I am the appropriate level to do it and I can also use the item.  I do not see the Trivial Loot Code as a justification for farming any item.  Yes, it's fine to send lower level guildmembers to get the item--but once they've gotten it, they need to let others have a turn at it.  The Order of the Oaken's guildmembers that I encountered there (and there were at least five), with the exception of Krystallgold, refused to let me have a turn.<br>
<br>
I gave them the page as a gesture signalling that I was willing to wait my turn and, yes, wait six hours for him to pop back up.  It's too bad they weren't willing to give me a turn until Krystallgold intervened.<br>
<br>
I maintained here, as I maintained with them, that all I wanted was either my page back or another shot at Dyllin and an apology for the deception.<br>
