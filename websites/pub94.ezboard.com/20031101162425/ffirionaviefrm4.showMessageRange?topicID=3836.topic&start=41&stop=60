<br>
But no, raiding targets or whatso was not the problem. Umk gonna try to give you an example, omiting names to make it as impersonal as possible.<br>
<br>
People brought forth inconsistancies in raid attendances, like folks arriving late getting full raid points etc. <br>
<br>
One asks if anyone has any idea on how to take attendance with more accuracy. A few of us suggested screenshots at regular intervals of the raid window. Well our suggestion was met with anger. Then he asks the first person that suggested it if she wanted to take the screenshots for him. After the outburt of anger we got for our suggestion, she said she was not interested. That was followed by a second outburst of anger.<br>
<br>
Thats only one example of ideas being brought forth only to be treated in similar manners. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=needapallyanyone>needapallyanyone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 11:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3836.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I dont know where else to put this</span><hr size=1> Hum Larraque, in case you have not read the original post, i didnt bring private guild matter here, but something that hapened between me and someone else, and only has a last attempt to get through to him, not to flame him or the guild.<br>

<br>
Ideas and suggestions out of game on a messageboard are fine, it's what it's there for, but please, please, please, for the love of God, do not tells your Guild Leader or Raid Leader with &quot;ideas&quot; in game during a Raid or some such.  They will soon come to hate and despise you!  <br>
<br>
If you have idea's or complaints post them on the guild messageboard.  If you are unhappy with the response that you get then leave, that guild is not for you.  You can try and change things with suggestions and ideas, but if the guild leadership does not share your views no amount of screaming and shouting is going to get them to change, it's just going to introduce you to the ignore list.  /shrug. <br>

Lang fact is i like playing the game, fact is also CT was a family guild firstly, casualy raiding, but as someone mentioned, they tried to switch that around, and for the most part did not work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=haethos>Haethos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 12:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3836.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I dont know where else to put this</span><hr size=1> come on...you wanna cite examples without names...fine...heres  a copy/paste of my reply and the response i got afterwards.  lets see what the soapbox patrons think was angry about my post.  I will change names as you did ray.<br>
<br>
My reply:<br>
&quot;I think it would work out GREAT if you would keep track who comes late for us (name left blank) then make a post in the points forum and we will deduct half points from everyone you post. Much easier than screenshots every hour or having the DKP people write it all down and take logs/loot points etc. For me, thats just too much of a load to keep track of late people while leading the raids as well. (other dkp person) might be able to handle it, but she is not available to raid as often as we do. Would you be up for that? Just write down whos late and by how much, then post in hte points forum should be sufficient.<br>
<br>
I also agree this needs to be done, the attendance thing is out of hand with people showing up so late.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Next reply about my reply(written by the original poster):<br>
&quot;Honestly I throw my hands up with it.. and to be point blank... I don't give a damn anymore. There is no way you can sit and tell me you have no idea who was late last night.<br>
What's the saying. &quot; Frankly dear I don't give a damn&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I will be perfectly honest, my next post on the topic was one of frustration.  It was not the model of great post.  Everyone points fingers and wants change and this and that, but nobody would step to the plate and help get things done.  For the most part everything was a one man show.  There was some help, dont get me wrong, and I thank everyone who tried, but it was very minimal and burned me out fast when I constantly got replies like this.<br>
<br>
On to other things.  Shabba's leaving had nothing to do with the downfall ray, no clue why youd even say that.  He put his heart and soul into helping the guild.  When it was clear he wanted different from the guild he did the right thing and found one who could give him what he wanted.  <br>
<br>
Tartarus, thank you for the kind words despite our last conversation not exactly being friendly.  I have great respect for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
And raydog.  Lets just drop this eh?  There is nothing to argue about, nothing to write about.  I do not want to flame you in here and I wont unless this continues and I feel the need to show people the type of crap I had to deal with from you.  I think theres been enough raydog bashing and wish you would just grow up and learn how to cut your losses.  We both went elsewhere, the guild policies do not concern us nor should it concern you if I do not wish to talk with you about the past in game(that was why you posted correct?)<br>
<br>
As i said before ray, i wish you luck and think you'd do just fine if you would relax a little bit..especially on the grouping/hybrid FT items/paly &quot;dps&quot; <br>
<br>
**On a side note, Clan twisted is still there.  I think down to about 30 members now, most of which are very casual players.  Recruitment is going to be as low as level 20, so it will no longer be a raiding guild persay.  I wish Lithran best of luck keeping it together.  I'm sure he will do fine now that certain people left.<br>

You're telling people that Haethos was demoting officers for defending people. In your first post. Which I never read. <br>

This is not business that the firiona vie community needs to know. It is internal to the guild. You had your board access removed, and you were banned, for the reasons listed earlier. You are bringing shit that doesn't need to be known by the entire community to the soapbox. Why? <br>

Larraque, really, yes, Raydog didn't do CT any favors during that last bout of verbal diahrea(No, I can't spell.) from CT, but neither did several of it's officers. So, please don't lay all the blame on Ray.  Some of it, yes, but Tarin and Shabba both did masterful jobs of adding to the general illusion that CT wanted this board for it's guild board.<br>

I'm fully aware of this. My message telling people to stop  wasn't a post aimed at anyone in particular. And I'm not blaming Raydog fully, but he still did a masterful job during this time. And my post wasn't directed for Shabba, or Tarin, or anyone else who was posting - it was just for Raydog. <br>

During that time I was taking my 'break' from Everquest. And because of it I almost never came back.

Reason he has access Raydog is I let him keep his access. He has done alot to try to keep CT up and going after the leaving of our last guild leader and I know that he can give me pointers. I am sorry to see you both have a disgreement though and am hopeful things will work out for both parties.<br>
