<br>
6 April<br>
<br>
What an uproar there is in the guildhall tonight.  I hardly know how to begin to describe the situation.  The day began normally enough, with a large gathering in the guildhall.  Gray had been planning for some time an assault on Kelethin, with the goal of aiding the Crushbone orc tribe who have long tried to ally themselves with Neriak in exchange for various favours.  While Emperor Crush's deluded little megalomania is laughable at best, nonetheless, Kelethin would be far improved if it were inhabited by orcs rather than the miserable feir'dal.<br>
<br>
So, in the depths of the Greater Faydark we gathered, readying our forces - we were several dozen strong, members of all ranks and professions, united behind Lord Gray and in our dedication to the dark paths.  I summoned armour and weapons for the various skeletons and other minions summoned to accompany us.  Then Lord Regent Gray called for the attack to begin, and we charged to the attack following his battle cry:  &quot;League of Shadows, let us us assist our ally Emporer Crush to overthrow the vile elves once and for all .... for the Dark Path!!&quot;<br>
<br>
With cries of &quot;Kelethin shall burn!&quot; and &quot;Kelethin for the Crushbone Orcs!&quot; we followed Lord Gray into battle.  Guard Silverwind was the first to fall to our blades, and shortly after him, Guard Brookrock felt the bite of Tallonar's sword.  The other guards came running and we had quite a fight on our hands, but we managed to lead some astray into the forest, and slew others, while a party of orc centurions from Crushbone distracted the few young elves who happened to be in the area.  <br>
<br>
We had surrounded the southernmost lift to the city, and were just preparing to put it to the torch, when we heard a shout and a scuffle from the platforms above.  A woman's clear voice shouted &quot;The League of Honour shall defend Kelethin to the death!&quot; and all of a sudden, armoured bodies dropped to the ground around us with a heavy thud.  Face to face with Lord Regent Gray was Meledi Weaver, the leader of the League of Honour and our sworn enemy.  Before she could draw her weapon on Lord Gray, Shaveil leapt between them with a snarl, and engaged Meledi in battle.  Kullgen spun to protect her back from Beniden, Trevlin and Artanis faced off, Mudwart and Fifi sprang to attack Ludin, and then I lost track of the battle as Brevis, now wearing the insignia of the League of Honour, drew his blade and dispelled my magical shielding with a spell of his own. <br>
<br>
We pulled aside from the crowd of battle and fought in a low valley area near an old stone monument.  I had summoned an air elemental to my aid, but Brevis had created an enchanted animation of his own, and as he outranked me by some eight or nine ranks, the battle was very close.  Fortunately, my magic resistance was high, and my elemental managed to interrupt a number of his attempts at spellcasting, which allowed me to blast him with a few bolts of fire that he did not seem able to defend against.  I had begun the battle wounded and fighting at only half my strength due to the attacks of the guards, and after a few rounds with Brevis we were both near death.  It was a very close battle, but eventually I prevailed and Brevis fell.<br>
<br>
In the background I heard confused shouts that Shaveil had defeated Meledi, and other battles continued all around.  I tried to keep track and, so far as I could tell, Mudwart defeated Ludin, Artanys defeated Zoryna, Dekarn defeated Artanis, Ledwyn defeated Aina, Esuna defeated Xerrik, Chasik defeated Stonne, and then Blayze got revenge for Meledi by defeating Shaveil; Icebain defeated Mudwart, Rrome defeated me, Quinnaros defeated Chasik, and Trevin defeated Armill.  I probably missed a lot of what was happening, though - there was a lot more fighting than this going on, and mixed in of course were the attacks of the guards and various of the League of Shadows continuing to attempt to set Kelethin alight.  <br>
<br>
The situation became even more chaotic with the appearance of Shintou - without his guild tags - ranting and raving, and shouting that we were facing defeat because we are weak, that Lightbringers control the world, that our guild was dead.  He was dissheveled and wild eyed, and looked like a madman; I barely recognized him.  Kullgen charged at him, calling him a traitor and a coward and saying that his Feir'dal blood was showing through at last.  Several members of the League of Honour, believing Shintou still a member of our ranks and suspecting some ruse, attacked him also.  I am not sure whether he was defeated or whether he fled; I did see Kullgen badly injured shortly after, I presume from their battle.  Evariel was tending to her.<br>
<br>
In short, it was complete pandemonium, and I was expecting Lord Gray to call a retreat at any moment, but he was strangely silent.  The League of Shadows fought grimly on, but the combined might of the League of Honour and the Kelethin guards were formidable and it seemed unlikely that Kelethin would be placed in the hands of our allies in Crushbone on this occasion, once the advantage of surprise had been lost.<br>
<br>
Evading the combatants still fighting I began looking for Lord Gray, fearing that perhaps some injury was keeping him from leading us either forward or back.  Clearly I was not the only one doing so, for Sumida's voice rang suddenly across the dark forest: &quot;Lord Regent Gray!  Where is he!&quot;<br>
<br>
This worried me greatly, as I had assumed Sumida still guarded Gray's side, as always.  I was starting towards the sound of her voice, when I heard Meledi call out to her troops, &quot;We have Gray!&quot;<br>
<br>
My stomach lurched at the thought that he might have been captured, and soon Kullgen, Shaveil, and many others of the League were calling his name and searching the dense forest in hopes of locating him.  I found Sumida standing in sight of Kelethin, over the bodies of several guards.  Looking up to the platform above her I saw Meledi, weapon still red with the blood of our allies,  laughing at her.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You shall never find him!&quot; she taunted Sumida.  &quot;He shall be turned to the Light!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where have you taken my husband!&quot; Sumida demanded again, but Meledi only laughed once more, while the shouts of those searching for Gray continued through the forest.<br>
<br>
&quot;He is as dead to you, Sumida.  He is with us now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He will drag you into Hate before he falls!&quot; Kullgen shouted from where Evariel was bandaging her arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;We shall hunt down your every last member like the dogs you are,&quot; swore Sumida, snarling up at Meledi, out of reach on the platform above.<br>
<br>
&quot;We shall see how confident you are without your leader,&quot; the bard taunted in response.  &quot;Gray is with us, and he will learn to renounce Innoruuk and see the light!&quot;<br>
<br>
Many were now gathered around Sumida and shouted their defiance, but she merely smiled and said &quot;Find the light, Shadows!  Follow Gray into your salvation&quot; as she turned and vanished into the platforms of Kelethin.<br>
<br>
Bloodrage raised his sword in defiance and shouted, &quot;We shall follow Zanis then, and avenge the foul kidnapping of Lord Gray!&quot;  And Sumida concurred, swearing that all who serve the Light shall tremble as we pass.  &quot;All hail Zanis!  My unswerving faith in him to march on in the dark!&quot; she shouted.<br>
<br>
&quot;All hail Lord Zanis!  We shall rescue Lord Gray!  Let the lightbringers tremble at the shadows!&quot; came the cries  from those gathered around Sumida, and one by one the officers knelt and swore allegiance to Zanis, until such time as Gray can be restored to leadership.<br>
<br>
Zanis signalled the retreat, and we returned to the guildhall to bandage the wounded and plan the rescue of the Lord Regent.  It will not be an easy task, for Meledi and her followers are powerful and deceitful, but he shall be restored to us, we have sworn this. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
