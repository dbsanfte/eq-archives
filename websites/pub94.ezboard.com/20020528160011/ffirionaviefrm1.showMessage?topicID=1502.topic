<br>
Ok, I have posted this info on several other boards and not many people know whats going on... Hopefully, we can figure this out since it seems to only done on our server... that I can verify anyway.<br>
<br>
If you have not ventured into Hollowshade Moor lately... you may want to now. Looks like the war has begun between the Grimlings, Sonic Wolves, and the Owlbears. On a side note Ahom is up on production servers and working.... He asks for your Journeyman cloak instead of your Sonic Wolf bane weapon like previously mentioned. He then sends you with a book to take to Historian Sharar, who is located in the library to the left outside of the Palace in Shar Vahl. Sharar gives you an earring (something of Owlbear) that gives you immunity to Screech and a letter to take to General Avilah. General Avilah can be found near the north bridge on the third floor in the only building that has 3 floors. Search completely for him... I searched about 5 times in that same building and must have just over looked him or something. He gives you a 4 slot box w/combine box and asks for a Owlbear Guardian Talon, Sonic Wolf Guardian Fang, Grimling Chieftain Staff, and your Journeyman cloak.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see any of these drops, so not sure if they are in yet or not. As for the happenings in the Moor, the fort is no longer a safe place to camp... At one point the Grimlings take over the camp. Along with those Grimlings that take over the camp is a Prince... Some of the bodyguards that guard the fort during this time nuke for 200+ and caused problems for level 40+ solo. The Prince himself is pretty tough and cons blue to 41. Once killed he dropped a Dagger, Shield, and Mace... none of which are the quest itmes Ahom asks for. I forget the actual names and stats, but can post once I get home... There are constant attack broadcast messages in the Moor now... We know that Grimlings attack the Sonic Wolf caves, and that the Sonic Wolves have driven out the Owlbears from their cave... We were unable to figure out exactally what to do from there so any additional information would be greatly appreciated.<br>

I brought up track and found a Prince Garzemort on track.  I headed in his direction only to be attacked by a Grimling bodyguard near the guard encampment.  Since he conned low blue to me I figured I could take him out (I'm level 43).  Well I got my butt kicked.  So I was bound at the Nexus and headed back to Hollowshade to see what was going on.  That's when I realized that the guards had been taken over by the Grimlings.  Turns out the reason I got killed was because there were three or four of the little buggers casting on me from the other side of the wall.  So I got a little ragtag group together to try to overtake them.  Myself and three others that were Blue, Low blue and green to me.  Took some careful planning but we took the Bodyguards out one at a time and then killed the Prince.  Don't have the names or stats on me now but one was a 2hs Wolfbane weapon and a 1hb wolfbane weapon.  Neither were the items listed above unless the names above are incorrect.  After Killing the prince I headed back towards T Mountains.  Before I got out of the zone there was a message that the Wolves had taken over don't remember the exact wording.  Anyway near the Wolf caves there were about 5 times the normal amount of wolves roaming around.  Tracking didn't show anything named on track and all the wolves were either low blue or green to me.  I'd like to know more about this quest and I even thought that the weapons I got off the prince may be quest related as a vendor offered absolutely nothing for them.  I now also wish I'd have stuck around to see what was going on with the wolves.  As a side note all of the owlbears were gone from the zone even the caves were empty.  Dazzani I'm not sure if I'll be on much until Sunday night but if you want to see if we can figure out what's going on just send me a tell.  Searching the internet for Garzemort finds nothing so I'm not sure if this is a GM event or a normal event for Hollowshade Moor but I've been hunting there quite a bit and never seen this before.  Maybe the Grimling Chief's Staff is the Staff of living sand.  I have gotten one from him before.  I have killed the chief many times and that's the only staff he's dropped so far.<br>

We heard the the cry that the grimlings had weakened the wolves but thought nothing of it. The chieftan and his bodyguards were long overdue in returning to his hut, so we became a little concerned that the conflict in the Moor might have started.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, a group of five grimling defenders appeared in front of the chief's hut. My friend and I attacked them. Their melee attacks were strengthened with poison and like the chieftan, theycould not be persuaded to move from their standing locations. They would also summon you if you backed too far away from them. In the middle of the fight, a pack of sonic wolves attacked the defenders but were easily defeated.<br>
<br>
We defeated the defenders and waited for what might arrive next. Unfortunately, even after a long wait, there was no extrodinary activity in the grimling camp and the chief never returned.<br>
<br>
Inspecting the owlbear caves showed them to be empty, yet there seemed to be a very strong sonic wolf presence in the area.<br>
<br>
On our way to Tenebrous Mountains last eve, I heard some explosions and grimling cheering. This was heard all the way over by the tunnel to the Grimling Forest. It seemed as though the grimlings had won some piece of land in this conflict.<br>
<br>
/ooc<br>
This is a zone wide conflict that was talked about several times before Luclin was released. There is a four way battle between the vah shir, grimlings, owlbears and sonic wolves. It was suggested that wiping out one faction would cause changes in the other factions that would make them weaker or stronger. Making them stronger is supposed to summon unique npcs for the stronger faction.<br>
<br>
I will see if I can track down the interviews and post the urls here. I also vaguely remember that ther ewas a discussion about the Moor up on the rogue Safehouse message boards. <p><TABLE>

If one faction or race is diminished, then their opposing race will be stronger and more populous and vice versa. This however, sounds like a bit of GM involvement too. <p>Tamerlaine Twosteps <br>

Lately it's just been Meles and I running around the moor trying to figure out what to do. We think we may have figured out some of  what is going on... This is a scripted event (not GM run), and this is how Hollowshade will be from now on... Several different events take place... once one side gains more property they take over the zone... I have noticed that all invaders con &quot;indifferently&quot; when the defenders all con &quot;ready to attack&quot;.<br>
<br>
I beleive once one group takes over one area, they continue to the next area... until the whole moor is taken over by that one group. We as players play a role as to what side we want to win... or atleast thats how I see this after 3 nights of being in the Moor.<br>
<br>
1. Grimling invaders attack the Owlbear defenders at the Owlbear caves.<br>
2. Grimlings invaders attack the Sonic Wolf defenders.<br>
3. Owlbears attack the Grimling defenders in front of the chief tent.<br>
4. Sonic Wolves attack the Owlbear Defenders at the Owlbear caves.<br>
5. Owlbears attack the Sonic Wolf caves.<br>
<br>
These are the battles that I have wittnessed thus far... there still may be even more... I have not seen another group except the grimlings when, and that is when the prince spawns in the outpost.<br>
<br>
I will speak to a GM to see how much information they can give me about these events this evening... Have not really seen anything else about this on the 10 message boards that I have been visiting lately... <br>
<br>
If anyone wants to get together this weekend and figure out the secrets the Moor hides now just send me a tell... I have a feeling that I will be spening a lot of time in the Moor this weekend... <p><center><img src=http://technuhemera.hypermart.net/SharVahl_Logo.gif><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=111337>Dazzani Frostpaw</a> - Khati Sha of the 40th season.<br>

While the owlbears were holding the wolf cave, a group of grimlings attacked. They were handily beaten by the defending owlbears. This immediately preceded the owlbears attack on the grimling cheiftain's tent. <br>
<br>
The sequence I witnessed today was:<br>
<br>
1. Grimlings attack wolves at wolf cave and win<br>
2. Owlbears attack grimlings at wolf cave and win<br>
3. Grimlings attack owlbears at wolf cave and lose<br>
4. Owlbears attack grimlings at chief's hut and it appeared to be a draw with both sides dying or giving up. <br>
<br>
When I left you all tonight, nothing more had happened after that stalemate. The grimling village was still deserted after quite a long time, and the owlbears had given up patrolling the sonic wolf cave. The sonic wolves had also not reclaimed their territory.<br>
<br>
It was a fascinating thing to watch the balance of power in the Moor flex and change. I plan to be there more to witness this and throw in my lot with one of the native groups.<br>
