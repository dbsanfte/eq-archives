<br>
1) the /roleplay tag is obsolete and just gets in the way... I think is should be the other way around, /anon on/off should only be allowed cause everyone is roleplaying, right?<br>
<br>
2) the absence of /ooc forces people to speak &quot;out of character&quot;,  &quot;in character&quot; &lt; --- get it? On a side note, i usually turn off ooc when i rp<br>
<br>
3) Tells are not really rp, how can someone telepathicly speak to a warrior or the other way around, <br>
<br>
/tell rper0 hey you LFG?<br>
/tell rper1 yea what level?<br>
/tell rper0 17ish, hunting over by mudpit....<br>
/tell rper1 ok omw<br>
....when he arives....<br>
/sa Hail sir!<br>
/sa Hail and well met, I have just come from the Outpost, mind if I add my blade to your band?<br>
/sa Of course, brother, All of the Indego Brotherhood are welcome.<br>
<br>
see? whats wrong with that?<br>
<br>
4) human tongue learnable at lv 1  will kinda force human as the standard language, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i was kinda hoping an exotic common tongue like dragon or froglok <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Personally I find the roleplay tag ridiculous.  I have always found it bad roleplaying as nothing changes on EQ.  You do not see the scars on the body of the old, skilled, warrior or the deep wrinkles of the ancient wizard.  The level indication that /roleplay hides should be considered an indication of this, sadly it seems the slow-witted have spoken once more en masse. &lt;sigh&gt; <br>
<br>
2.)Agreed, yet another ridiculous thing.  Certainly I have been in roleplaying tabletop groups where /ooc was not allowed.  I did not find it fun and left them.  Roleplaying should always be fun, and if one cannot relax occassionally and slip out of character for a moment just to talk about how bad work was or how their car was acting up, fun goes out the window.  Again, the zealots and martyrs of roleplay force people to do as THEY see fit. &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<br>
3.)Tells are FAR from roleplaying.  I do not recall reading anyhow on Norrath has psionics.  If you want to remove /ooc and force /roleplay, tells should also not exist by the same lack if wisdom.<br>
<br>
4.)Human, Verant's new Common.  They did a great job with this.  They shut the zealots up whilst allowing those not quite as insane a route to actually communicate.  Personally the one thing that was done that I do like is the whole language system.  Kudos to Verant on that one. <br>
<br>
5.)I am adding this.  My last and final beef is about abusive people who play this game.  I am sick and tired of it.  I know plenty of people that switch between roleplaying and non-roleplaying all the time with nary an ill comment between them.  However now we find that those who were abused by the few morons that attacked roleplaying now are abusive.  Are those of you who do this so small and weak in real life to need to get some form of revenge?  Did those who said &quot;look, a loser roleplayer&quot; really hurt your delicate ego that much?  Certainly I could understand if you were all pre-teen, and to those of you that are I apologize as you have not had the chance to build a resilient psyche.  To those of you that are not, shame on you.  You are a disgrace to the human race and you are the same kind of people that derive great pleasure from the pain and suffering of others.  <br>
<br>
I roleplay on occassion in EQ.  When I WISH to roleplay.  I have perhaps once or twice received negative comments, and this is in a year time span.   I simply laughed at these people and moved on.  I did not waste my time being abusive towards them.  In real life I have tabletop roleplayed for over 16 years.  Most of those years I have GMed, and I am told I do so very well.  Does this make me a better roleplayer? No.  Do I care if you roleplay or if you roleplayer better or worse? No.  I do not need such petty and childish things to justify who I am.  I have nothing to prove, I know who I am and what I am.  <br>
<br>
I allow people to ENJOY themselves in whatever way they wish as long as it does me no harm.  I only hope one day those people I see with a chip on their shoulder, abusing non-roleplayers, quite literally grow up.  I hope they find the guidance they need to one day be good members of the human race.  I also only hope I speak for the majority of people, if nay, then this world is surely doomed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uliusadh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liusadh</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f75.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/01 10:53:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/evermyst/images/chalice.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE:Since its Roleplaying prefered....</span><hr size=1> I agree with all but #4.   <p><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/evermyst/images/liuclose.gif" border="0">

It was Verant's attempt to force people into talking (ie, roleplaying) by asking their classes and level.  But I can't quite see Gandalf running into Bilbo and asking his level and class so that they could group.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
I applaud Verant's attempt, but it is another factor where the game and roleplaying do not mix, and it is another example how 'realism' in the game is selective.  As you have pointed out with /tell... where were we ever given a roleplaying background to justify tells?  Or bind points?  Or dying and respawning at our bind point naked?  How is it that we don't die when we run out of food and water... we just get week?<br>
<br>
I've said it before, but this 'selective' realism just doesn't work.  It was a great plan 2+ years ago, but we've learned a lot since then.  We've learned there are a lot of things that are not realistic (even for a fantasy setting), and those things that get put in for realism are simply annoying.<br>
<br>
I'm in line with the rest of the posts as well.  I also agree that Human is fine, although it seems there are bugs in the redesigned languages anyway.  The only thing I can suggest that seems out of line is half elves in Kelethin should default to elf instead of human, but I suppose that would require more coding than they wanted to do.  *shrugs*  It's no biggy (I just had to switch), just doesn't make sense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueyasfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EyasFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/01 5:29:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE:Since its Roleplaying prefered....</span><hr size=1> I don't think your points are well thought out.<br>

 IF ya don't like the rules that are in place, you always have the option of going back to the other servers that have the ruleset you seem to enjoy.<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
Personally, I like it just the way it is. <br>
<br>
1. Fine the way it is.<br>
<br>
2. if you want ooc, use /tell, as to not interfere with others. Is this to much to ask? Or, if you are really really wanting to talk about your workday with someone...log off and talk to your wife or your friend or go see a shrink if you cant deal, or, there are the other servers to play on.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3. see #2<br>
<br>
4. No language is being forced. You, the character have the power to learn any language you wish. Simple.<br>
<br>
5. We all have differing views as to what Firiona Vie means and stands for.If you wish to RP while in game...FV is the best place right now...if you don't wish to RP; once again, there are the other servers. Leave one bastion of roleplaying...to much to ask?<br>

This server is roleplaying PREFERRED!  No, that does not mean that every second you log your character on you must roleplay or you will be banned.  But the EVIL ROLEPLAYING NAZIS!! will get you and scream your head off if you dare utter ONE question out of character.  However, roleplaying is appreciated.  I know that I joined this server because I looooove to play in character, and my sweet little bard is great to play out!  A lot of people joined this server especially because of this feature.  Verant did a lot to help with the roleplaying aspect of this server by increasing the realism.<br>
<br>
The roleplay tag, for instance, is a great idea.  You know, you don't walk around in real life with a little tag over your head that says your name.  People can't magically tell by typing a command into their little pocket computers what job you have, and how proficient you are.  No, silly, you have to TALK to people in real life.  Now I imagine this is what Verant is pushing people to do here.  We're supposed to roleplay.  Forgetting levels and dings, we're bards of the fifth song, clerics of the fifth prayer, fifth ranks, etc, etc!<br>
<br>
I agree with the absence of Out Of Character, but then again... I don't.  In an ideal world, out of character would only be used for OOC comments.  But you remember back when Everquest was young and everyone roleplayed anyway?  Well, that all stopped because of OOC run rampant.  Now, ooc conversations are bound to happen, but that's what the EVIL ROLEPLAYING GESTAPO is here for.  Sometimes I miss being able to OOC things.  But in reality (hello!), the OOC channel would become the most prominent.  Instead, auction and shout have been used primarily for what they SHOULD be used for.  It's customary to place (ooc) before any out of text comment, which is really helpful to filter through.  If we allowed an out of character channel, there would be too much discussion and not enough roleplaying.  And eventually, all the RPing would go down the drain :*(**.<br>
<br>
I sort of agree with the tells.. but only to an extent.  I think that tells are the best way to clarify OOC and IC.  I also think tells are a helpful way of &quot;whispering&quot; a comment to a groupmate.  Heck, you can consider tells practically shouts to someone.  It's just you're not disturbing the entire zone.<br>
<br>
I don't care about Human Language.. everyone should speak FAERIE, damnit!<br>
<br>
It's hard to roleplay, really, because this is an experience based game.  And let's face it, 99% of the population would rather be stickin' Lord Vyemm in the eye than courting some nekkid wood elf chick in GFay.  But, you know, while the server is young and the idea is fresh, let's enjoy the moment.  I hope to be roleplaying with you all until the spirit dies.<br>
<br>
Which it never will because as long as the Songmistress plays, the spirit lives on!<br>

3) on tells, what i'm saying is that many people use tells in a RP way when its actually a way to (ooc) keep in touch with a friend/partner/guildmate. The example i gave was well thought out. It demonstrates how tells should be used, and says that it is worthless to say<br>

On other matters , you gotta respawn when you die or noone would play.

<br>
There are too many components to this game that are not 'realistic', but game related.  For example, you can only grow stronger (even as a healer?!?!) by killing things or being in groups that kill things, unless you want to deliver mail for 60 levels.  Therefore, you cannot just take in the RP ramifacations of the RP tag.  For that matter /who is not a RP command at all.  I can't just think /who in real life and see the name of every person that lives in my apartment complex.  Therefore, /who is a game command... so why put a roleplaying 'realism' on it?<br>
<br>
/shout Is there anyone in zone that can ress?<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
/shout What great druid here could take the time to port me?<br>
<br>
These are not exactly something I would expect to find in a fantasy world, but the RP tag forces it even more.<br>
<br>
My arguement is the RP tag doesn't promote roleplaying in the least.  Answering &quot;I'm in the 14th circle of power&quot; is duct tape to a broken hose.  What book or movie have you ever seen where people walk around talking about the number of &quot;songs&quot; they have gained or the number of &quot;rings&quot; they have formed.  I would much rather people be able to look it up themselves and just RP your class and name (which people don't do enough of either). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/15/01 11:55:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Since its Roleplaying prefered....</span><hr size=1> Not a single point Jantis makes is invalid.

I have often heard &quot;rpers&quot; shouting &quot;do not use auction for ooc&quot; or &quot;do not say ooc things in shout&quot; or even more moronic &quot;what is this 'server' you speak of?&quot;  If you play an online rpg it is to be with people, and relate to them, not to force them into your narrow-minded ideals.  FV is roleplaying PREFERRED, if I come there to enjoy the new rules set, yet do not feel like rping then you will have to live with it.  Thankfully there is a /report command to report abusive people, and it works well on BOTH &quot;d00ds&quot; and &quot;rpers&quot;.  I hope Verant starts banning abusive people so that we can get to the people who really want to have fun and enjoy the company of others in such a fantastic setting as Norrath no matter what server it is. <p><img src="http://http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

Well, sillies, when I say my bard has learned eight songs, I mean it!  She really has.. learned eight songs. It's not my fault it corrolates directly to the level. <br>
<br>
But, oh well.. nothing is purrfect.  I suppose we have to make do with what we have.  It's not like we have to find realism in everything.  Over analyzing stuff takes the fun outta it!<br>

and for the most part rp'ers do this.<br>
<br>
Under-the-table tools to do basic eq tasks like, find groups, find binds, find players of similar class/race/intrest should not be underminded for rp sake, mostly how I roleplayed in a blue server was with my /rp tag off and rp in say, and shout, and sometimes /gsay.<br>

<br>
However I argue back the point for a warrior class  How many warriors in books add a notch to their weapon after some great accomplishment?<br>
<br>
Whereas my character (Enchantress) adds a Seduction everytime she feels she has progressed she goes out and tries to Seduce something a bit harder than before  when I hit 60 (yeah right) she will attempt to seduce Trakanon (again LOL). <br>
<br>
Personally I would like two more changes to make it harder on knowing level and items.<br>
First no examining other characters.  You gonna let someone come up and grab your hand and look at your rings or tell them the name of your Robe?  Hell how do they know I have a necklace without trying to take off my robes?  I am the seducer not the other way around.<br>
<br>
Second make pc's unable to con others.  I have already seen some light characters and dark characters getting buffed and trying to find people blue to them and challenging them to a duel.  Whereas I accepted a duel from someone conning yellow to me right after I noticed his cleric buffing him up and after he was healed there was a dark elf cleric friend of mine that tried to heal but think of it there was almost no chance of me finishing the fight after I used my mana on him.  He eventually left after I went to med invised <p>Teir'Dal Enchantress of the 11th Seduction.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufelishannasecretlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Felishanna Secretlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 6:48:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Since its Roleplaying prefered....</span><hr size=1> OOC.<br>
1) Yes it is a little strange that level/class is forcibly hidden, and this is in the aid of RP. I don't think it helps RP or hinders it, but I do think it makes gameplay harder. But we will manage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2) 'OOC' chat inside hunting groups, or in tells or guildchat, can be part ofthe fun of the game. Sure, I love to Roleplay, but not every second, and not in the technical moments of communicating during a group fight. OOC spam in whole zones from strangers is just anti-roleplay environment, I feel. So I am happy with Verant's call to get rid of it. Now if they can just reduce the range on /auc in zones like GFay, and I'll be even happier. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3) /tells are fine. They can be RP or not RP, depending on the circumstances. Mine always start RP, but if needs must (or its a games mechanics issue), we can switch to ooc when needed. I'm happy.<br>
<br>
4) Human is too easy yes. It should be no easier than the other languages. I am enjoying the fun of the language barrier for the most part (yes I know it can be frustrating at times, but thats the challenge, I think). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So although I would prefer if 1) were different, I'm happy with 2, 3 and 4 as they are.<br>
<br>
As for Kaludram's number 5, I agree totally that, abusive language and behaviour is totally unacceptable, for whatever reason. I stress I exclude that from what I am about to say, as there is ZERO excuse for the personal harassment of others who are keeping themselves to themselves, absolutely zero.<br>
<br>
This stated, I am personally pleased to see roleplayers exert some pressure on the community to conform, in the way non-roleplayers pressure roleplayers to on other servers. We want to shape this place, and we want it to meet our dream. This is a positive thing for most of us, not a negative one. Stick and carrot can be used here, and I fully intend to use both. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And I congratulate and encourage fellow roleplayers to do the same, so we can make a world we can be proud of. Non-roleplayers should *never* be harassed for their choices, but if they find they are in the cold somewhat, they at least have so many others servers to choose from. We don't. Think about it before giving lectures please. <p>------------------------------------------------<BR><BR>
