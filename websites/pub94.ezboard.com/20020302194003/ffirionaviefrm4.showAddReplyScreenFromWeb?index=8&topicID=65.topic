align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: how to level fast from 10 to 17 in 2 days</span><hr size=1> I agree... levels 10 to 20 are REALLY boring.  I don't think the fun in the game starts until 20.  I'm a happy bouncy chatty person, so naturally, I flock to groups as often as possible.  Where's the fun in grouping at level six?  And the dungeons aren't really that fun below level 20.  I guess Unrest is, but that's about it.  Mistmoore, Cazic Thule, Splitpaw, SolA, SolB, Perma, Chardok, KC -- I love them ALL.  As soon as I can hit dungeons, it gets fun.<br>
<br>
Oh, but wait.  This server isn't about leveling.  The primary concern is roleplaying.<br>
<br>
I think ALL levels are fun.  Heck, my little level one self zooming around Greater Faydark was so cute.  I ran over to Butcherblock Mountains to rid the world of the foul-smelling skunk population.  I managed to chat with those around me, further my RP storyline, and gain a little experience all at the same time.  I've had a ball since I began on this server.<br>
<br>
Now I'm level ten... Usually, this is my least favorite level.  Untwinked, you have to group.  Grouped, there's not a lotta stuff to kill real fast.  I don't care now, and that's the beauty of it.  Why, my little level 10 song mistress roams Freeport, city of men, trying to become comfortable in her surroundings.  She's already explored the Karanas and Erudin and has loved every minute of it.  That's why this server is so awesome.<br>
<br>
I think I'm going to defend him here... On our other servers, where we romp about with our little level 50s, we've seen powerleveling in our days.  Whether we powerleveled others or received help from a high level cleric or druid, we've probably been helped one way or another.  If you haven't, excuse my blanket-statement.  It, uh, doesn't apply to you.  Almost everything is fixable... except defense.  And dr00ids don't need defense anyway because they just sit around and farm stuff.  But not anymore because there is a TRIVIAL LOOT CODE!  HAHAH!  Which reminds me, has anyone else noticed a lack of druids? *GRINS*<br>
<br>
He came on this forum trying to suggest ways to level fast if you didn't like 10 through 20, and he got yelled at.  I feel some pity for the little guy, he was only trying to share a secret.  You may not like what he did; I wouldn't do this.  But isn't this just like buying belts from orcs and turning them in?<br>
<br>
I guess I just pity the guy for trying to help out and getting burned for it.  I don't like powerleveling; my cleric doesn't do it and I don't accept it.  I like to take things slow.  This doesn't mean that I'm going to go out and burn everyone who feels differently.<br>
<br>
Solkin, that's awesome you found a quest that helps you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just watch out and you might want to damage-shield yourself a million times in a row to catch up on those spells.  Good luck, buddy.. but ya better slow that leveling down or ya won't have anyone to group with you.<br>

<br>
I feel the same way Jenelle.  I actually did a quest on Vazaelle that a guildmate said would get a person from 20 to 29 on three days.  I tried it for maybe 2 hours all together throughout three days.  I went from 26 to 27 1/2.  The experience was good, but it was too boring and I found myself tiching it and going back to grouping.<br>
<br>
When I hunt alone or with a partner, time seems to drag by.  When you are in a group and the fighting is constant and everyone is enjoying themselves time flies and it's a lot more enjoyable than quest.<br>
<br>
However I have nothing against people who do quest.  It's up to the person...People do quest over and over for faction.<br>

My original post was meant to be seen as a small quip, a minor 'funny' to make anyone who has grouped with people who have PL'ed and NOT caught their skills up smirk, or smile a bit...In retrospect, I suppose I should have elaborated in that post, I seem to have ruffled some feathers. Again, This was not my intention.<br>
<br>
In my second post I was stating facts as I have personally experienced them in the past, on other servers. I too have played casters through the levels stated, and not had any problems either solo, or grouped. and (IN MY OPINION)saying theres no place to fight at these levels is silly(again, my opinion) There are plenty of places to go and hunt. If you don't know where, look around on the web, or just ask someone, I'm sure everyone thats played the game knows at least one place. <br>
<br>
It is a fantastic Quest, and in other situations I might do it as Solkin has, but as Jenna says above, and I quote;&quot;Oh, but wait. This server isn't about leveling. The primary concern is roleplaying.&quot; Me, I'm just having fun playing my warrior, killing Kobolds left and right, and Roleplaying when I get a chance.<br>
If anyone got the wrong impression, I appologize. Feel free to contact me on FV. <p><embed width="300" height="40" src="http://home.teleport.com/~jbritt/galeinsig.swf "></EMBED>

It takes me one yellow bub to max out my skills soloing.  from there on it's just killing for XP to make the next level (not counting in RP).<br>
<br>
I have, therefore, been known to max out my skills and then quest to next level... especially during the lower levels.  The point to remember is that you need to max out your skills first.<br>
<br>
A good example of this is the bone chip quest in Kaladim.  Up till level 6, this is a good quest for XP, armor and plat.  Generally one can save up stacks of chips, max out skills (as a rogue I have to work up defense, offense, 1HS, Piercing, &amp; 1HB, along with my thiefly abilities) <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>

However, defense as a druid has been the bane of my existence.  I have always had trouble getting this skill up, because all my melee skills raise rediculously slowly, and I do think it's important to keep defense up if you are any kind of healer or an enchanter, you will get agro at some point, obviously not an ideal situation, but higher the defense skill, the longer you'll survive.  I have spent much time purposely leveling slowly by meleeing low blues and maxing out defense.  I agree that levels 10-19 are kinda boring for a druid, it's hard waiting for sow and those self ports, and the only dungeon I was able to find a group in on my old server was Crushbone.  Everyone sticks to the boring easy zones to level fast.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/01 12:10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: how to level fast from 10 to 17 in 2 days</span><hr size=1> For me,it was all about getting to 9th so I could seriously start working the cats for my studded leather armor. :P<br>

Suppose, for instance, that you need to work your Evocation up.  Suppose further, that you PL'ed to 40, and have to work it up from 0 (yeah, I know, but it could theoretically happen).<br>
<br>
Here's the answer:  kill something like a rat.  Now, target the corpse.  Now, cast your level 1 evocation spell over and over on the corpse till you're out of mana.  Sit down, med, repeat.<br>
<br>
Not that I suggest this as a viable method, as you'll spend several hours just working up your spells.  Nor do I ever want to group with someone who PL'ed up to 40, as they'll be fairly clueless.  But this is exactly the method I used as a wizard after each level, just to make sure my spell schools were maxed.<br>
<br>
Actually, if you have the bolt line of spells, you don't even need a target.  Find the zone wall, face it, and start casting bolt spells over and over.  That way you won't hit anything and your evocation skill still goes up.  The other skills require much less finagling. <p>Fritz Darkweaver<BR>
