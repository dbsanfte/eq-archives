<br>
And anyone who supports the people who do, are even more stupid than the person who blames the games.<br>
<br>
People have problems in RL. Each and everyday, we are faced with either reoccurring problems, or new problems, both of which can take its toll on a person. <br>
<br>
People need &quot;Escapes&quot; to help give themselves &quot;alone time&quot; so that they can collect their thoughts, or set aside their stress, so that that may be able to enjoy themselves for a short time.<br>
<br>
These &quot;Escapes&quot; can be 1 of a number of things. Having a few drinks. Going to the movies. Working out. Restoring old cars. Painting a picture. Playing Everquest.<br>
<br>
People know, that &quot;Escapes&quot; are just a temporary way to feel good until they can resolve their RL issues. Just like you need a break at work, at times, you need a break from life. Life is hard work. Trust me. I know how tough life can be. And I have needed many breaks. And without those breaks, I would have surely gone insane. Too much of anything can be overbearing, and push people to new emotions, and actions that are not normal for them.<br>
<br>
You are in control of your own life. No one holds a gun to your head and demands that you play Everquest. There is no pusher standing next to you, telling you &quot;Just one more hit, you will feel better, I promise you&quot;.<br>
<br>
You bought the game of your own free will. You subscribed to the game at your own free will. Everquest was placed (Alphabetically in most places) among a vast number of other computer software titles. So its not like anyone forced it upon you to pick that game up and take it home. Nope. You did all that on your own.<br>
<br>
If problems arise because you play too much Everquest (or any other game for that matter) its your own damn fault. <br>
<br>
On a different note, people can become attached to their characters, or to other people who play the game. Critics say that, that kind of attachment is not healthy. Hmm. I know a lot of people who are attached to their cars, a comic book collection, sports trading card collections, autographed photos or a teddy bear they got when they were 3 years old. <br>
<br>
We attach ourselves, to things that mean something to us. Our characters that we play, have real time invested in them. And through those characters, we have forged friendships, some that stay in the realm of Everquest, and others that move into real life. I myself have both of those. <br>
<br>
Can we become too attached? Sure. But it's up to you to recognize that, and to rectify that problem before it gets too far out of control. When people start depending on their characters, for all of lifes needs, then sure, it has gone too far. But I myself have yet to run into anyone who relies entirely on Everquest to fulfill all areas of their life. <br>
<br>
Out of the 400,000+ who play this game, they found 1 of the 50 people who struggle with determining Everquest from Real Life. <br>
<br>
I am sorry he felt the need to take his own life.<br>
I am sorry his family lost a loved one.<br>
<br>
Did Everquest play a role in his death? No. His state of mind was already on the brink before he started playing Everquest. <br>
<br>
I could go on for days about this kind of thing. But the bottom line is that nothing, in this world, is to blame for the course your life takes, except yourself.<br>
<br>
You control yourself, and all your actions and emotions. Take responsibility for your actions.<br>
<br>
Don't blame others.<br>
<br>

While obviously not a perfect analogy, if we were to compare smoking, and its addictive aspects we might be able to extend that line of reasoning.  The &quot;addiction&quot; to smoking is not in and of itself the killer, it is the side effects that ensue from that addiction that create problems.  Trying to create this cause and effect spin might be damaging to some extent.  The way in which we frame the concept of &quot;addiction&quot; and its role in the casuation of a &quot;specific injury&quot; would be for me, the crux of the plaintiff's argument, and the grounds by which Sony could be viewed negilgent in its duty to product the consumer.<br>
<br>
I look forward to the next round ).  I ain't no stinkin lawyer so I may have a simpler view of how the law works, but the way in which the the terminology is established must have some bearing on all this.<br>

You bought the cigarettes of your own free will.  You went to the convenience store at your own Free Will.  Your brand of choice was placed (Alphabetically in most places) among a vast number of other cigarette brands.  So it's not like anyone forced it upon you to pick up that cigarette and smoke it.  Nope.  You did all that on your own.<br>
<br>
Same arguement stands, cigarette companies (admittedly evil) are getting ravaged by law suits.<br>
<br>
I don't think the case has any merit.  However, just because something is legal and you don't *have* to buy it doesn't mean it isn't harmful.  And if you are the maker of the item in question, you better have your ducks in a row, because the second someone burns themselves on a hot iron and feels like it, the jackals will come running.<br>

Cigarette companies now know their products are harmful. They now know they are addictive. They said they did not know this &quot;back when&quot;. But, of course they did.  They were caught lying, and are being made to pay for it.<br>
<br>
The question is, did/do Sony know EQ is harmful ? Did/do they purposefully manufacture (code), package and sell EQ so that it's addictive ? (As opposed to just marketing their product).<br>

<br>
They played this game wih D&amp;D ... hell the gave the 700 club somethin to call the devil for a while.<br>
<br>
But seriously..<br>
<br>
and i quote a friend from a long time ago when they were badmouthing D&amp;D many moons ago for the same exact thing happening .. &quot;You wanna hear about a game that has ruined millions of lives, put people in the poor house and left hem in ruins or to suicide ..its called poker.&quot;<br>
<br>
This guy was obviously manically depressed and had no love for anything .. something i think we all can relate to at least at some point in our lives. Pretty sad 8(.  <br>
<br>
A question you may daringly ask yourself .. could this guy have been me in another life or do i relate to him .. cmon everyone has asked themselves that ... are you playing the game or is the game playing you?<br>
<br>
I believe in my own personal experiences that you have control over your decisions. Though the tides may affect you ultimately you bring with you what you wanted to prepare for. No matter how drunk you are.<br>
<br>
Like the bible says without love the rest is meaningless.<br>
This isnt &quot;agape&quot; love but true love for thy brother and goodwill toward men.<br>
<br>
I may be a jobless bum.. no goals .. no real aspirations ..<br>
and i can't say playing Roleplaying games now for the last 20+ years since i was of 9 yrs of age starting with D&amp;D was a good thing .. but i can say that i have the ability to change who i am (God willing) and that roleplaying games in no way takes that away from me, its simply a choice i make. With a grain of salt however ... ive also seen that taking a time out like i have this last month and a half from Everquest was something i probably needed to do .. its a good thing to try new things. Im not an advocate of worldly wisdom such as &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot; but i do believe that life is greater than this game so hey take time to dwell on those things that are actually important, no matter how much you love this game vs. other things. And believe me folks on this what you spend the most time on in your life is what you truly in your heart love over anything else.<br>
<br>
I may never come back to EQ or i may be back in a month .. and maybe no one will read this post because ive been out of the loop for a while this site may be in its last days i dunno . In any case peace out and if i do come back to EQ to play ill be working on a regular basis again YAY!<br>
<br>
On a final note and im writing this because i cant get into the member only area now. Id just like to say that when i left i was angry but it wasnt any of your faults you all treated me so well even those as i could tell my personality grated on .. and thank you even for those 3 short weeks i was able to be a part of something great!<br>
<br>
Take care yall!<br>
Your friend,<br>
