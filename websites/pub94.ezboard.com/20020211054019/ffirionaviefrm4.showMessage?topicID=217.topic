<br>
I've looked elsewhere. I've done something that is very unchararistic of myself, for those that know me from the OLD OLD days. I kept silent.<br>
I said nothing. It would be alright. It would be okay.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.aol.com/FistOfMalice/PLing.html">members.aol.com/FistOfMalice/PLing.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
That Sh*t ain't okay anymore.<br>
<br>
I have had enought of seeing this type of BullSh*t on this server.<br>
Level up with normal hunting and fighting groups. Thats okay.<br>
Not follow the Traditional ways of Dark to kill others. Thats fine. I'm not going to tell people how to RP, if you are even RPing, but I'll get to that later.<br>
Take advtange of the fact that this is a low population server so you can stomp on unmolested grounds and feel good about yourself as you Uber up.<br>
Thats alright. Its not hurting anything, yet.<br>
<br>
Power level.<br>
<br>
That shit isn't going to fly here. And you know what? Its not just Fire and Fury, ANYONE that wants to F$%#ing powerlevel on THIS server can just PACK IT UP and go to where the hell you belong.<br>
And where do you belong you ask?<br>
<br>
www.innoruuk.com<br>
<br>
Okay. Thats fine. Thats just fine and Dandy. Flaunt your epics.<br>
<br>
They do it to! Thats were you belong! To use a Dr00id Acro..<br>
<br>
GTFO.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying Preffered. Only because VI doesn't have the balls to admit that they FAILED RPing on every other server in this game.<br>
<br>
This IS the Roleplaying server.<br>
<br>
Don't give me anymore of this Bullshit, because you DO NOT roleplay.<br>
<br>
DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT.<br>
<br>
I'm not FV.com. I'm not one of the Moderaters here, or one of your little buddies, who you can just toss a little loot to and they will turn the other cheek.<br>
<br>
I planned to talk to Sliver about how I felt about alot of things, but we just cannot seem to get together.<br>
<br>
So enought with this waiting. I'm not waiting anymore.<br>
This is how I, the one Behind Shintou Shinai feel about all of this Non RPing crap on OUR.<br>
OUR Roleplaying Server.<br>
<br>
This is all OOC by the way. First before I begin lighting up the fires, let me introduce myself.<br>
I won't tell you my name, but I'll tell you that I am a Roleplayer.<br>
I started RPing when I was 15, back in AOL Chatrooms Ironically enought, to a Popular Japanese Anime known as 'Dragon Ball Z' and 'Ronin Warriors'.<br>
It was a Chatroom Scrolling based RPing, actions contained in brackets, like so.<br>
::Backhands VegitaXSSJ into a wall::<br>
<br>
RPing died down there after three years of GREAT roleplaying.<br>
Then I found Everquest.<br>
After a short stint on Cazic Thule, I found myself on Innoruuk with some friends from AOL.<br>
And I RPed. My EQ Box said EQ was an ROLE PLAYING GAME.<br>
I played on Innoruuk for about 2 years.<br>
Relation that EQ was not an RPG assulted me for 55 levels of Hard fighting.<br>
I started my ShadowKnight back when the EXP penality was noticalbe, for Tier'dal and Hybrids.<br>
But I RPed as best I could every single level.<br>
PLed by none, and I RARELY accepted Items I did not fight for.<br>
But Innoruuk is a POWERGAMING server.<br>
It will always be a POWERGAMING server.<br>
Their is no room for Roleplayers on Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Then, as if it was an Omen or something, Fronica Vie came up.<br>
Roleplaying Server?<br>
A place where I will not get funny looks for NOT wanting the Druid to teleport me?<br>
A place where Evil guilds conduct Guildwars and acually RP out their Characters.<br>
A Place where Loot is NOT Number 1...<br>
<br>
&quot;An effort to Unite Roleplayers for the cause of ENJOYMENT&quot;<br>
<br>
So you know what I did?<br>
<br>
It was hard, Yes.<br>
I worked very hard on the Original Shintou.<br>
Whoever says that EQ is just a game, they never really known what it was like to play ONE SINGLE CHARACTER throughtout MOST of the game.<br>
The only other characters I ever played I deleted quickly.<br>
Warrior. First Character, got it to 13. Deleted.<br>
Wizard. Got to 12. Deleted.<br>
Shintou was a product of my Mind. He was my Imagination.<br>
He was my story, and I loved telling it. <br>
<br>
I ended that story. I packed up my stuff.<br>
And I came here.<br>
For the cause of Enjoyment.<br>
<br>
And I enjoyed myself. I loved it here.<br>
<br>
The first time I heard of Banegrivm, I MARVELED in his knowledge of Everquest Lore.<br>
You know what, I've learned so much about Everquest from Banegrivm, Thanks Bane.<br>
You helped me Enjoy Everquest in ways I never imagined how, for finally I found someone that made my knowledge of Everquest Lore lore VERY small.<br>
<br>
And I salute Banegrivm, for he is the Best Roleplayer on this Server.<br>
<br>
And I salute Banegrivm, for he is the Best Roleplayer on this Server.<br>
<br>
And I salute Banegrivm, for he is the Best Roleplayer on this Server, and maybe the ENTIRE GAME.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I said it. What?<br>
<br>
But then, I saw my enjoyment slowly start to fade.<br>
<br>
I started to hear the same lame ass shit I heard on Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you grouping with that Ranger?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just uzing him lolz&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you in a Party of Barbarians my Trollish friend?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just using them, hehe&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The hell are you doing saving that Highelf?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't understand Young Fool. I'm just using him for my evil purposes Bwhahaha&quot;<br>
<br>
To Quote Chris Rock..<br>
<br>
&quot;Cut the Fu^king sh^t, okay?&quot;<br>
<br>
Why do you group with Druids?<br>
<br>
BECAUSE THEY MAKE YOUR LIFE EASY. SCREW RPING, DRUIDS CAN HELP ME LEVEL FASTER SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS DRUID MY FRIEND AND PRETEND THAT HE'S BEING USED.<br>
<br>
Now its gotten to the point to where I'm asking..<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you PLing that Woodelf&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://members.aol.com/FistOfMalice/PLing.html">members.aol.com/FistOfMalice/PLing.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Dante Inferno, of Fire and Fury..<br>
<br>
WHY ARE YOU POWER LEVELING PEROID.<br>
<br>
No, Dante, shut up I have no more time for lies.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you why.<br>
<br>
Because BARDS HAVE MAGIC RESISTANT SONGS AND YOU WANT TO HAVE HER AROUND FOR DRAGON RAIDS TO FURTHER YOUR POWERGAMING NEEDS.<br>
<br>
Thats how it is.<br>
<br>
Thats what FV is reduced to.<br>
<br>
Power Leveling.<br>
<br>
I stood by and watched Innoruuk turn into a hell hole.<br>
<br>
You think this Rants board is Bad? This is a CAKE WALK<br>
THIS IS A BABY LITTLE MATCH<br>
<br>
I challenge you. Go to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
The First thing you should notice, they have MORE RANTS THEN THEY HAVE GENERAL POSTS.<br>
<br>
Thats how bad it is.<br>
<br>
What do those Rants say?<br>
<br>
&quot;SO AND SO KSED MY UBER MOB!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
50% of them, at least.<br>
<br>
And you know what? With Guilds like Fire and Fury around, thats what FV will become once everyone gets around the same level.<br>
<br>
I like this Server. This server has been like a breath of fresh air from the Innoruuk that stressed me out to no end.<br>
<br>
Their are some VERY good RPers on this server. I've already mentioned Bane and the First Fist of Light..<br>
But Silver Griffons, also a very good Light aligned RP guild. Circle of Sisters, a VERY good NEUTRAL. NEUTRAL aligned Guild, as is Band of Brothers.<br>
I give a Salute to all of you.<br>
For you are what the Froniva Vie Server Represents.<br>
<br>
In an effort to Unite Roleplayers across Norrath for the cause of ENJOYMENT.<br>
<br>
To tell you the Truth, I once throught about making a Paladin just so I could join First Fist or Silver Griffons. <br>
But I'm a ShadowKnight..<br>
And I like Shintou, way too much.<br>
<br>
As their are good guilds, centered NOT on loot like Fire and Fury, but Centered on ROLEPLAYING.<br>
<br>
Guilds like Fire and Fury are only about one thing, and one thing alone.<br>
<br>
Greed.<br>
Why do you lust over Items so?<br>
<br>
I call it, Pokemon Scydrome.<br>
<br>
They don't play EQ Characters, they play EQ pokemon.<br>
<br>
Their EQ pokemon must be better then your EQ pokemon or they cannot play EQ at all.<br>
<br>
And they will do ANYTHING to make it so.<br>
<br>
Fire and Fury? Greedy? But Shintou, you dumb F^ck! They gave me Semi_Uber_Item_01!<br>
<br>
/smack dumbarse<br>
<br>
Why did FnF give you that crap?<br>
<br>
Its simple really.<br>
<br>
How do you Passify people raising up against them?<br>
<br>
Hand them Items, and they shut their mouth.<br>
<br>
Just as I expected Sliver would try with me. But I'm not sure if he had that in mind, or not.<br>
<br>
As the Title of this Long Thread says, I have had enought.<br>
<br>
I have come to FV to roleplay.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
For the cause of ENJOYMENT.<br>
<br>
So, Fire and Fury.<br>
<br>
You want to Turn your back on RPing.<br>
<br>
Oh, don't say you Roleplay, because you know what?<br>
<br>
You DONT.<br>
<br>
You don't like it? Tough.<br>
<br>
So Fire and Fury, I have one thing, and one thing to say to you in Final.<br>
<br>
You want to be Uber? You want Epics, Phat loot, and High levels?<br>
I hate to break it to you assholes, but YOU are not Uber.<br>
Not in the least.<br>
Oh yeah, you are the most Uber guild on this Server, yes.<br>
But that doesn't make you Uber.<br>
You want to know what the hell you are?<br>
Posers. Pretenders. You want to see what a REAL Uber guild looks like?<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.legionsofdarkness.com/">www.legionsofdarkness.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
THAT is a Uber guild.<br>
<br>
On a Powerleveling Server. Not an RP server. You say you come here for challenge?<br>
<br>
THEIR IS NO CHALLENGE FOR YOUR KIND HERE<br>
<br>
When you are the only big Dogs in the House, its easy.<br>
These guys are the BIG DOGS of BIG DOGS.<br>
<br>
FnF. Pack up your shit, and get off this Server.<br>
<br>
Go to a Powergaming Server, and see if you can survive. If I wanted to see Powergamers, I would of stayed on Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>
Hell, I havent gotten a good rant off in 4 months. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif">Shintou Shinai, A Follower of the Life, and Words of Lanys T'Vyl.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 11:57:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I have had enought.

<br>
Hmm...my thoughts on this are varied.  I'll just say a few choice things.<br>
<br>
Shintou my friend, I must commend your courage on saying these things.  There are alot of people that would not have the testicular fortitude to rant in the way you did (myself included) and I must applaud your bravery.<br>
<br>
I agree on your points as well.  While I myself don't have any bone to pick with Fire and Fury, I do fail to see why others come here if they never intend on roleplaying.  If they want a low server population and a challenge, I'd say go to Sullon Zek, where if you make it to high level you have earned some respect (or fear) whether you are powerleveled or not.<br>
<br>
There was a thread in the OOT forum about DAoC having an RP-enforced policy, and I'd really like to see if they stick by it.  I wish Verant had the juevos to do that.  Leave or take the TLC, no matter.  Leave or take the language barrier, no matter.  Take away the ability of non-RP'ers to play here and I would enjoy it so much more.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see a server with a couple of GMs that actually run dynamic quests (which involve more than &quot;spawn this monster-drop this loot&quot;).  GMs that run storyline quests.  GMs that actually chastise people with ridiculous names (saw a wood elf in commonlands named Doomz once).  I'd like to see it ran more like a MUSH environment, actually.  Let people coming here have a developed character before you let them log on.  Let people /report use of d00d speak and have those people chastised or even removed from the server.<br>
<br>
I could care less about server population.  Wah, there aren't 200 people in EC that I can buy bone chips off of.<br>
<br>
I wish RP were enforced, instead of simply preferred.  I won't play on any other server because if I wanted an action game I'd play Half-Life.<br>
<br>
Hell, turn Sullon Zek into an RP-enforced world and I wouldn't even complain.  A group of dark elves hunting dangerously in Lake Rathe because some light elves may swim around the corner and cut them down.  I might even really enjoy that, if you took out the language barrier.  Calling enemies out of the keep in Karana.  What more could a man ask for?<br>
<br>
In the end, I'm more apt to blame Verant's fear of losing customers over the actions of a guild(s), but the blames lies in all corners, I suppose.  I'd send comments to them, but I already know how they treat most of those comments... <p><center><font size=+2><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bmaidensfancy">Shiden Kaidan</a></font>

<br>
This is also my server. I have made a name for myself here. <br>
<br>
Who are you to judge. Your no better than any other person on this server.<br>
<br>
Comparing anything on this server to a much older server's guilds is plan silly. Its like saying &quot;give up&quot; because we don't have what they do.<br>
<br>
We have high hopes for ourselves, same as all should. Thats why were here, for the fresh start, the challenge, and to see our high hopes through.<br>
<br>
We shared what we had done, because we thought we had friends here after all the crap was over. It takes alot of hard work to get what we got, ALOT of HARD work, to get it, and we thought we'd share that we got it done. You don't have to like it. But none of us, none, come here and flame your crappy Role playing. its the same thing, you work hard at your role playing, it would mean the same thing if I started a post and cussed and cussed about your crappy role playing and how i didnt want you on MY server.<br>
<br>
This is our server. Not mine or yours, ours.<br>
<br>
This is old, everyone had a say on this months ago. None of us run over and yell at you while your role playing. <br>
<br>
There are reasons for everything that happen, you just do not know them. And even though we don't have to, I will explain Alesa the Bard to you.<br>
<br>
Dante is helping Alesa because she was one of our closest friends on another server. We all came here together, Dante, Bako, Cassimus, Caparelli, Rosiel, Alesa and Me. a few more joined us but that was our main group. Alesa had bad computer troubles at the opening of the server and has been unable to play. Now after all this time, a good damn friend of ours is back. A better friend than you will ever be. And Dante offered to help her catch up to us, so we can group with her again. We have all we need to do anything we want already, we don't PL anyone just to get that class in our guild. Dante helped a damn good friend and thats the truth.<br>
<br>
I don't tell you how to run your life, where to live, where to eat, who to date, but you and all your cussing are doing that very thing. Telling me where I can and can not play a game, how silly. <br>
<br>
So there, have at us. I won't carry this more, just wanted to get my one word in before everyone works up the flames against us. <br>
<br>
Judge me and us by what we've done to you, and give this a rest. There is room for all, more than enough. We don't want to be the &quot;Uber God's gift to EQ everyone bow before us&quot;, we just want to have fun playing the way we want to.  <p><br>

<br>
Shint you made it to 55 on inny, you know the ammount of time and effort and teamwork it takes to do a an epic.<br>
<br>
I've roleplayed with you, and enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
I've talked with Gore and he was polite and roleplayed a small bit, I've yet tp run into someone with the Ub3r L33t attitude on this server. Every FaF member I've talked to has been curtious. That's all i ask. I'm here to roleplay and have fun. If you want to interigate my back story I've got one.<br>
<br>
But you have to know that no matter where you go this is a game it's 0 and 1's, some folks are going to see it that way. They will play accordingly. Guess what if they are doing it yelling at them won't make it better, it will make them wantto not interact with folks though so then you start to get your split the Uber attitude starts to show up.<br>
<br>
So when they say ! we got our epics ! I nod they put in alot of work to get them. If i wanted an epic now I'd log back into Cazic and stoke my snake. Each to there own. They are here for low pop and fun and don't go out of there way to ruin the atmosphere so why yell at them ? FV will never be a big player on the Uber scale. well perhaps the could be but they have alot of catchup to do. <br>
<br>
So while I respect you and your roleplay. This flame was rather rude and uncalled for.<br>
<br>
*sarcasm*<br>
Of course I'm just sucking up to  FaF and Reso to get PhaT L3WtZ because that's what suck ups get right ?<br>
* and I'm spent *<br>
<br>
Any way while I didn't like the idea of an Uber guild or 3 on the server when it started. FaF at least in my experience has gone out of their way to minimize it's effect on the roleplay climate.<br>
<br>
As for PL'n *shrug* get em out of my zone faster, and then they get to pay though the nose for TLC'd items. Also It's not like you get 16 slots with two accounts you get 2 so it's a cost issue as to what to do on this server. <br>
<br>
That's my take on this anyway. <br>
<br>
Oh and the cussing was funny but there was to much of it to effectively illustrate and key points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/15/02 3:48:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I have had enought. (Long)</span><hr size=1> I agree, i disagree. <br>
<br>
not all of us are hardcore RPers. and this is roleplaying PREFFERRED... not required. and why stomp on FnF? it was their choice to get to the high-end game right away. the high-end game is MORE FUN to them. that is what matters. i prefer the mid-end? game... <br>
it's not what you think is right that matters. it's what makes EACH PERSON happy that matters... to an extent. (if KSing, training intentionally, camp stealing, etc makes you happy... i'll show you the true meaning of shishkabob). <br>
<br>
and ya know what? this IS a different server. its a whole different game compared to other servers. I personally think that it WONT be FnF vs everyone else like you say. I think it will continue to be the way i have seen it... FnF will help others, and in turn be helped by others. i think sometimes the server willunite for a common goal regardless of what guild name, if any, flies above their heads.<br>
<br>
beyond that, i can't say it much better than Gore.  <p><BR><B>Veloxia Voluptuous <Clan Werre></B><BR>

Well said, Gore.  <br>
<br>
Shintou..this hostility of yours towards those less inclined to roleplay is truly unneccesary,   i've read a bit of your roleplaying and have actually been brought to follow some of your thoughts and ideas in-game.. because i find them interesting and very appealing.   But for those who's attempts at roleplay fall short of being &quot;flawless&quot; by your standards..  they should not receive floggings by you or anyone.  <br>
<br>
As far as FnF being a so called uber guild..  how are they gettin in your grits?..  its just a guild .. ppl trying to achieve things and see things that many in their eq careers never get to see..  what is wrong with that?    IMO FnF.. grats for what you've accomplished.<br>
<br>
So stop trying to lead a &quot;peasant's revolt&quot; against non-roleplayers, twinkers, powerlevelers,etc on the server..  because like it or not..  short of making every item no drop.. no pc targetable by spells.. and creating a god-sized chatfilter to screen out all non-medievil language..   there isn't jack you, me, or anyone can really do about it.   You like roleplaying?..so do i..   but yours seemingly is an obsession.. which is disrupting a harmonic atmosphere...     <br>
<br>
Live and like what you got..  or take it elsewhere and hope for better..    if all else fails..  go play Playstation or something *shrug*   .. as myself and many others find your rant unwelcomed (as mine is, i am certain).    <br>
<br>
I dig ya as a roleplayer Shin, your work is good..  but it aint good enough to let you screen those who try to enter *your* server. <br>
<br>
Take it light all.<br>

Much as I would love to use this excuse to get the final word in on the topic at hand, I won't.  I'll just say that despite the support and the generally mild replies of the people thus far on this topic, I can't imagine anything positive coming out of this.  There are more than enough threads already on the topic of who should and shouldn't be on FV and most of them manage to do without this kind of provocation.<br>
<br>
Feel free to restate in more civil terms, Shintou.  You've been active and contributed positively to this board a lot in the past, and anyone can have a bad day, but try to post when you are feeling a bit less hostile.  No degree of participation on these boards gives anyone the right to pop off to this degree, and I'd expect to have my own thread locked if I did anything like this also.  Sorry, in advance.<br>
