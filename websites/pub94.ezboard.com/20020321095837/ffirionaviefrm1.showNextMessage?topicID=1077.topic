An example would be Kurrpok Splitpaw, a level 15 gnoll who spawns in a room full of level 30+ gnolls.  Or the Iksar child (level 1) who spawns in the plane of Fear (assuming it's impacted by TLC).<br><br>2) Items whose rarity prevents enough of them from being collected in order to complete the quest before they become trivial (been hearing some reports of this happening with some Vah Shir newbie quests).<br><br>3) Quests intended to be done multiple times, but items become trivial before this is possible.  An example would be the spirit stones quest in Stonebrunt Mountains (note that I confirmed that although the stones are labelled MAGIC ITEM, they are no longer impacted by TLC, just wanted to use the quest as an example).  <br><br>   For some items, such as the blackburrow cask or the hearts for staff of temperate flux, there's nothing preventing people from going in there at the level they gain XP from the monster and aquiring them, so as annoying as it might be that they fall under TLC, I didn't wanna report them as bugs.<br><br>   Trying to avoid turning this into a discussion of ways to get around TLC, or the validity of it, but just items/quests which are pretty much broken now because of it (and I don't consider having to buy an item from a newbie broken, just annoying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br><br>- Syllestrae Silverblade<br>Warchanter of Rallos Zek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 6:14:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> I think maybe we should be a bit careful about what's being reported as impacted by the TLC.<br><br>Unless the Blackburrow Casks were originally No_Drop, there's no reason they should be affected, for example.

Gnoll fangs are definately gnoll drops on other servers.  They're tradable here, but still get caught by TLC.  I can't think of any other items which lost all their flags coming to FV (ie: planar armor used to be NO-DROP / MAGIC, now it's just MAGIC).  Since Kobold molars are the same way, maybe there's a bug where items which used to have a flag on other servers, but don't on FV, still get caught by TLC?

He very very rarely appears.   <br><br>I was level 25 when I attempted this, the tiny skeletons were all green to me and were very very hard to kill!

Anyhow, it was trivial so I couldn't complete the quest.<br><br>I do feel like this is possible to do, but only for a group of players that are low enough for the skeles.  it would be very tough.  I suppose asking to have this exempted would be justified by usefullness of the boots that are charged with SoW, something handy to have at any level.  Pair that with the rarity of the watchman showing up... I'd think that noone will ever complete this quest unless they wait for many rl hours or even days, with a group, for the watchman to appear<br><br>I can do without these boots, as can many.  But I do feel it's a quest that people of all levels could benefit from.  if you want to add it to the list, feel free to do so.<br><br> <p><b><i>Casben Lightfoot</i></b>, Grumpy ol' Rake from Tunare<br><b><i>Sabbik Silvertongue</i></b>, cleric of the Tinker's Pride</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:07:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> Syll:<br><br>I think someone had established that No_Drop items had a &quot;ghost flag&quot;.

So let me put it another way. When verant built FV they had rules and a framework laid out that would basically describe the progression of this server. To do this they would need to make some assumptions. This isn't any different than how any business would operate. Some call it forecasting or projections.<br><br>For Verant's premise to work, that is for FV to work, some of these projections would need to materialize. For any EQ server, the most important projection that would need to materialize is the player count. Not just for revenue, but to create and maintain the social and economic dynamic of the server. In FV's case this also has an impact on quests. I am not privy to these forecasts, but I do not believe FV has met its projected player count. I don't think anyone would dispute that. The unexpectedly low population count is making it unreasonably difficult to accomplish a number of quests.<br><br>Now some would argue that, missed projections or not, Verant is not going to change anything because a &quot;handful&quot; of quests have been adversly affected by TLC. They might even be right. But this is a problem that will continue to grow as new expansions and new quests are released. So at what point does Verant need to do something? How many quests have to become &quot;unreasonably difficult&quot; or impossible to do before they take action? <br><br>Now before anyone accuses me of being a power gamer or impatient please consider where I have just come from. I have just spent the last year on the Test server.  When you come from an environment where they can bring down the server at anytime (no notice), wipe gear from you as you zone or worse with NO recourse, well... I think thats about as patient as you can ask a player to be. I didn't whine when they broke all the fear and Feign death spells on test a little while ago. I didn't whine when I zoned into NFP and discovered all my equipment had been wiped. I didn't even whine when I entered my username and password but wound up logging into another persons account. I just pointed out what I thought were problems and thats what I am doing again now.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/02 4:57:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC bug list.</span><hr size=1> Syll wrote:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  A quest that REQUIRES that you hire other players of differing levels should be considered broken.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Unless I am mistaken, the Trivial Loot Code was put in place partly to encourage players of differing levels to interact with one another socially.

Here's a snippet from the patch message when TLC first appeared (I love news archives):<br><br>&quot;The first issue addressed in the Warrens is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that 'outclasses' a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP. All other loot will drop. 'Outclassing' a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill. This can happen if, for instance, the foe is 'green' to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.&quot;<br><br>Everything else (that it increases interaction between high/low level players, encourages grouping, etc) is just a side effect.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not against TLC (I'm a fan of it).   And I do like that it encourages interaction between high and low level players (when some level 40 guy goes &quot;DOH!  I forgot I need some bandit sashes to raise my temple of life faction&quot;).  But a quest, in an of itself, shouldn't require high level mobs be killed, in order to spawn LOWER level mobs, with such a difference between levels that no one person or group of people can complete it.<br>   If the diseased shark were level 1, and the babies level 11, then you could do it.  You'd kill the diseased shark as a newbie, save the item you needed from it, and could then come back 10 levels later and whack the babies.  A lot of multi-stage quests work this way.  The Lower level mobs should come FIRST, followed by the HIGHER level mobs.  When they're run in reverse (Killing level 35 gnolls in order to spawn a level 15 one), it's stupid, and means you have to go draggin a newbie all over the place and into places they shouldn't be.<br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1010.topic&start=41&stop=57>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1010.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1010.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1010.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1010.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
