<br>
No, I got my page because Krystallgold (again, bless her--the next Testament the Order farms should go to her) went to bat for me and let me take the next spawn (which occurred at 7:30 p.m.).  As it turned out, I got killed again and my ranger buddy (who, in a stroke of serendipity, was on his way to do some Gnoll Hunting and zoned in just as Dyllin popped up) wound up taking the faction hit (so, at least I only took that once instead of twice, but I did lose XP over this twice.  That's fine.  I expect to lose a lot more when I go for the Disciple Symbol of Tunare).<br>
<br>
No one from the Order of the Oaken was there at the time I took Dyllin the second time, although another halfling druid was and he did try to take him after Dyllin killed me.  He got swarmed by about six smugglers and, predictably, did not survive.<br>
<br>
The page was not given (back) to me by any member of the Order of the Oaken.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I believe I went the extra mile afterwards by letting Krystallgold know what time Dyllin dropped.<br>

If our guild was not there, some other would be. When I was tring to get my ToV. There were other guilds farming it. I had to wait a long time.

Quite frankly, saying you will see into this AFTER you put up a thing in YOUR OWN BOARDS INSULTING HIM!  Your words are hollow, and don't you point fingers at other guilds for farming.  You have a monk camping Dyllin.  A MONK, FOR CHRIST SAKE!  He/she can't even use the damn thing!  It shows how low you are willing to go just so you can get the &quot;ph47 13\/\/7$&quot;.<br>

By KSed, I mean that I was there for hours before the other person arrived, engaged Dylin before the other person engaged him, but the KSer still nuked Dylin silly/looted page/immediately camped out. Of course a petition did exactly nothing. This upset me greatly, but I got my page later anyway.<br>
<br>
I bring this up to point out that I am sympathetic to those who are having problems getting their ToV. It's a pain in the butt on a TLC/anti-NoDrop server, and that's a fact.<br>
<br>
However, here's another couple facts we should all keep in mind. Just because a person in a guild gets a page, it doesn't mean that another person in that guild can't get the next page. If the Order of the Oaken wants to position a member at Dylin's spawn 24/7 for the next two weeks...that's their prerogotive. Would it be rude if they did that? Yes, I think so but not illegal or dishonorable.<br>
<br>
Also, if a class that wouldn't use the ToV wants to camp it for a friend or for sale, that's their right. If a warrior shows up, no one is there, and he waits for and kills Dylin...hurray for him. He has a nice piece of gear for his trouble to trade for something else. Is it a little rude, considerring how important that item is for many clerics, shaman and druids? Yes, I think so, but it is not illegal or dishonorable.<br>
<br>
Let's face it folks, there are two points here that are valid. If someone has already engaged Dylin and someone else intervenes and steals it...that is actively against the PnP. If someone is there ahead of you waiting for Dylin to spawn, and you jump Dylin while they are buffing/harmonizing/waiting for bandits to walk out of range....that is &quot;legal&quot; but rude as hell.<br>
<br>
However, anything beyond that is just plain setting yourself up for a fall. If a guildmate kills Dylin...of course they are going to tell their guildmembers when he died and when he'll be back. That's what guilds are for. I'm sure the Order of the Oaken has many druids and clerics that want the ToV and don't have it. If a few people in their guild try to get it for them, then they are being nice, helpful, normal guildmates.<br>
<br>
I have not interracted with the Order of the Oaken. I don't know anything about this particular situation. But, if any guild decides to organize a 24 hour per day Dylin-a-thon for a few days in a row, to outfit their members with ToV...that is their right and it is wrong for people to call them a bunch of dishonorable, farming, jerks. The members of a guild have just as much right to be there as anyone else.<br>
<br>
If they monopolize the spawn for several days, and we start seeing them selling ToV's, then that becomes just plain rude. But I haven't seen anyone claiming that yet.<br>
<br>
I sympathize with the plight of the orginal poster, but I think it's unfair based on the information in this thread to start flaming an entire guild based on a few days activity. Tempers are starting to grow out of proportion to the actual events here. I would hope we could all get along a bit better than that.<br>

<br>
One problem with this camp is that (for most classes) if you are young enough to kill Dylin and not be affected by TLC, then you are young enough to get your butt handed to you by all the smugglers.<br>
<br>
So, let's look at it this hypothetical way. You've been there for quite some time waiting for Dylin to spawn. He finally spawns, but you know you can't kill him without getting killed by smugglers, so you notify you're druid guildmate that Dylin is there and ask him/her to gate to highpass and Harmony the smugglers. Maybe that seemed reasonable to you, because then both of you don't have to sit there for hours.<br>
<br>
Right before your druid guildmate friend arrives, someone logs in, sees that Dylin up, and kills him. Would you be upset? Now be honest Lasgalen, would you be upset under those circumstances? Would you consider it &quot;cutting in line&quot;?<br>
<br>
Sure, that person wouldn't technically be KSing, since you hadn't attacked yet, but would you still consider them rude if you had been there waiting for Dylin for hours and someone else popped him while you awaited your reinforcements? This is an ugly camp thanks to a combination of TLC and the proximity of high level smugglers.<br>
<br>
Technically, the monk and druid had no right to call you a KSer, because they hadn't gotten their attack organized before you jumped Dylin. They should have both been there waiting for hours if they wanted to make sure they had the manpower to kill Dylin in spite of the smugglers. But I can understand if they were disappointed and frustrated with your actions. And I think it was very nice of you to give them the page.<br>
<br>
But after that, I disagree with you. There is no &quot;being in line&quot; for this spawn and &quot;taking turns&quot; if YOU don't stay there. If you left and popped back in 6 hours later saying &quot;my turn, my turn&quot; to the people that had been sitting there for hours, then I'm not surprised you met with very little cooperation.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the only &quot;fair&quot; way for such a contested spawn to be dealt with is for whoever is physically there first, should have first shot at Dylin when he spawns. If there are people already there and you want a &quot;turn&quot; you should be willing to sit there in-game for six, twelve, eighteen hours until the people ahead of you have gone. Better yet, just check every once in awhile when you have some time ahead of you, and if no one is there, plant your butt and wait for him to spawn. Sure, it's a rough road, but that's what happens when demand vastly exceeds supply.<br>
<br>
IF the Order of the Oaken is there 24/7 for many days, then that is rude. But not against the PnP policy. Sharing the spawn with you when you're not willing to sit there and wait for it is unreasonable. And it doesn't even sound like they monopolized the spawn that badly.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my opinion, for what it's worth. To answer your original question? Yes, I think you were a nice guy (not a sucker) for giving up the page to the people that were there ahead of you. For your actions afterwards... I think you have very unrealistic expectations. If you expect people to step aside for you without you sitting your butt down and waiting in-game for the spawn, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.<br>
<br>
My experience was: <br>
Stage I: get there and someone was ahead of me (no problem, I'll wait); wait a few hours; person ahead of my takes his spawn and leaves (congrats, adios, my turn)<br>
<br>
Stage II: wait another ~6 hours; someone showed up, sat around an hour, and then KSed my pop (after I had begun my attack, taken damage and dealt damage); leave for an hour to eat something and scream.<br>
<br>
Stage III: come back and a young hobbit is there ahead of me (sigh); I decide to wait again, cause she's obviously too young to take out Dylin; Dylin spawns and the young hobbit starts casting harmony on the smugglers; an ogre shaman runs outta nowhere, tries to kill Dylin, and dies; I asked the young hobbit if she was taking her turn now, but she decided she couldn't kill him, so I asked if I could take him and she said &quot;yes&quot;; so I killed Dylin and finally got my page. After approximately ~15 hours online with only one ~hour-long break.<br>
<br>
The camp is a pain, and anyone trying for it has my sympathy.<br>

No answer within 10s or so equals not camped.  It does depend on the spawn a bit, though.  If the area is wiped clean of MOBs, obviously they're keeping spawn down and could just be med'ing AFK.  Still theirs in that case -- they're the ones that put the effort into clearing it.<br>
<br>
My typical approach on a camped item is to chat with the  campers on arrival.  So far, I've not run into anyone that thought they were &quot;camping&quot; something with an AFK mule -- lol, what a concept!  Why not treat this like Faydeydar?  You can put as many spotter mules as you want at the site, but it's the first one to start the attack that gets it.  Obviously, if someone real is there and ready, it's theirs.<br>
<br>
BTW, I hope both Lasgalen and Oaken realize that this particular thread is not showing either in a very good light.  Staging a protest even when you seem to be in the right is a bit whiny.  Using an AFK mule as a spotter is rather common, but seeing a guild tacitly endorse using one to &quot;claim&quot; camps is a level of greed that is pretty astounding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/22/01 10:18:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An afk mule does not a camp make</span><hr size=1> Bjond:<br>

The protest was designed to make sure that those who wanted to complete this quest could do so without having to contend with farmers.  That's all.  It was meant to give people who've been denied access to this item because of monopolistic farming practices a shot at it.<br>
<br>
And, as it turns out, one, and maybe two, people got what they need to complete the quest while I sat watch.<br>

In fact, using farming as derision and assuming it's all an Oaken plot to deny it to others is what's got you looking bad.  Whoever puts in the effort deserves to reap the rewards no matter what purpose they wish to put the end result.  Your work, your decision, not mine.  I think there are far better things to do than endlessly camp rare items, but that's just me and I'm not going to try and force that on anyone.  You've basically decided that *you* know who is worthy to work for an item and who is not. <br>
<br>
Playing spawn-god is a lot worse than what that Oaken member did.  If you weren't there, the same number of people would have completed the quest.  The only difference is that they might not have had your approval. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kimmzdenfineste>Kimmz Denfineste</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/23/01 11:51:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Nice guy or sucker?</span><hr size=1> I apologize for evrything said and done by myself.<br>

<br>
I give everyone their fair chance to impress me or not, in person (save for a few close friends who's word against someone is usually enough to convince me sight unseen) but Lasgalen, Kimmz, and to a lesser extent the whole Order of the Oaken, you should all know that the next time (or the first time) I see any of you I'll be thinking about all this in the back of my mind.  Even if I've forgotten the details, I'll still have the nagging idea that some serious mud was flying around with your names attatched to it.<br>
<br>
This isn't a threat, it isn't an accusation, and it isn't even a condemnation.  I've gotten into a public mess or two myself, in my day.  It's just a reminder to all involved that no one comes out of a mud-slinging contest looking clean.  Pick your battles carefully and rarely.  Reputations are worth more than any camp, in our small community.<br>

<br>
Although there is nothing wrong with helping a friend/guildmate with obtaining the page, I do think it is distasteful the way that some members of The Order were farming it. Yes, is was being farmed. The Oaken were there for at least a few days and i dont know if they have desisted even now. Now why i speak out about this is...whether it is known or not...the book is VERY VALUABLE...whether you are a Cleric/druid or not! Why i say this is, i was able to sell one for 300pp and a very nice shield in trade!  Share the Wealth Order of the Oaken! Allow others to camp as well....<br>
