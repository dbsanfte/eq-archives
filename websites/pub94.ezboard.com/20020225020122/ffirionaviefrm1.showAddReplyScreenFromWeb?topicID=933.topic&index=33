I hope everybody gets their book.  I still say it was nice to give up the page - not being a sucker.<br>

<br>
Actually, that's the story exactly as I represented it.  Please re-read what I posted.  I did leave out one detail.  The first part of this occurred right before 3:00 a.m. (2:45 a.m.) Pacific, right before the 4 hour patch.  I set my alarm, hoping that no one would be there that early and that maybe Dyllin would respawn.  I get up and get on at 7:03 a.m., 3 minutes after the server went up (presumably).  Shewina was already there.  You told me I should have &quot;got in line&quot;.  That was exactly what I intended to do, but each time I tried, Shewina was there.  I know that your guild acquired at least one and maybe two more pages in the intervening time.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, the guild, or at least Krystallgold, adhered to their (or her) word and let me take the site, and I successfully completed the quest.<br>
<br>
Whether your guild is farming this item or not has yet to be determined.  It does leave some troubling questions unanswered.<br>
<br>
For example, why, after I gave Shewina and Krystallgold the page, did Shewina stay?<br>
<br>
Why was she there first thing in the morning, after I'd given her what she was putatively after?<br>
<br>
Exactly how many Testaments of Vanear did she need?<br>
<br>
Why, when I ran into Krystallgold later, didn't she have a Testament, when she was the one who I had given the page to (and, later, she told me she hadn't gotten one yet, and if anyone deserves one, she does)?  I was led to believe that Krystallgold was the &quot;friend&quot; Shewina was waiting for, but apparently not.<br>
<br>
Here's an interesting link: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guildsay.com/boards/view_thread.php?id=5834&type=g&board=310">www.guildsay.com/boards/v...&board=310</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  I think &quot;Kimmz&quot; response about how this isn't farming because of Firiona Vie's Trivial Loot Code is very telling about their attitude about this.<br>
<br>
Lastly, &quot;defamation&quot; and &quot;libel&quot; only stick when the charges are untrue.  I'm reporting the truth, as I know it to be.  Even your account of what occured is in line with my account here.  You admit they've &quot;held the camp for a few days&quot;.  And, according to your words on your guild's message board, this isn't about who's right but about &quot;damage control&quot;.  Spin control.  There's no substantial disagreement about the facts about what happened.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you and your guild look bad, but it's not my behavior that's making them look bad.  It's their own behavior.  If they were honorable, then their actions should speak well of them and here they most definitely do not (or, as my mother used to tell me, don't do anything you don't want on the Six O'Clock News).  They only have themselves to blame for the &quot;pr problem&quot;, as you put it on your guild's message board.<br>

<br>
<br>
oh, come on....this is a game.....let's treat it as one....we all got what we wanted.....let's move on....<br>
<br>
having said that....I really can't find myself agreeing to anybody's right to &quot;own&quot; a spawn.  We all pay our dues to play this game, and we are entitled to the same rights under the right circumstance.  I'd say if you are helping a &quot;friend&quot; to camp something that he/she wants, your &quot;friend&quot; best be there as well.  It really ticks me off to see a warrior/monk/shadownknight/int casters standing there as a &quot;place holder&quot; camping for the page which is only helpful to those wisdom based toons.  People really have to remember that we are playing on a MMORPG where thousands of people are involved instead of treating EQ as their own backyard to do whatever they want.<br>

<br>
Nobbwin, your own actions/defense is impecable, I am impressed by your desire to keep your guild's reputation intact.<br>
<br>
That said, if a monk is continually camping the Dyllin spawn, and if said monk is too high to even fight Dyllin.. said monk should leave.  I can't quite figure out what level she is, but the other link was almost indicative that she was waiting on others because she can't fight him without trivial'ing him. So she's acting ONLY as a placeholder camper, which is just wrong on a camp that's highly desirably by a lot of folks.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering.. if the claimant died while first originally killing Dyllin ... why didn't she help him? Did she enjoy his death, since he'd gotten Dyllin?  That part bothered me... if she was afk/asleep, not trying to respond (a simply /boggle would count as a response if you cannot understand it) ... then the camp is not really hers. It's part of the &quot;you snooze, you lose&quot; deal, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
The claimant also returned the page.. that was highly impressive.   There's 2 actions after that that are acceptable.  1. leave the camp, having obtained what was desired 2. return the page, with a little note saying &quot;hey, we are trying to get several of these, so I dont' feel right about keeping this one&quot; ...  <br>
<br>
Keeping it, while continuing the camp, is just cheap.<br>
<br>
In my eyes, Shewina's actions were dishonorable.<br>
