And I've been blessed to have grouped with some higher level clerics (or folks who have played higher level clerics) who have been invaluable in offering advice and tips in how to be a better cleric.  I've listened to those folks, and have learned a great deal.<br>
<br>
Not one of them was pushy or rude in offering their advice.  None of the were &quot;forceful to instill introspection in others&quot;.  They simply and humbly offered advice to help me become a better cleric.  So, inspite of your assertion that one needs to &quot;appear 'dickish' or rude at times&quot; to be a solid player, you are quite, quite wrong.  As a matter of fact, I would assert that people would be more likely to take your advice if it were offered in a less forceful manner.  It's just human nature.<br>
<br>
So keep trying to defend being a &quot;dick&quot; all you want.  It's not going to fly around here.<br>

I have a room-mate who plays sometimes. He has never made it past about level 14.  Inevitably he gets bored with any new character and rerolls or starts up somewhere else.  Getinng &quot;metal armor&quot; (his term) is a big accomplishment to him.  But he has fun.  Lots of it.  So I can't criticise how he plays even though, by your definition, he's an idiot.<br>
<br>
If people can park at one level and have fun I'm happy for them.<br>
<br>
If they can become a grandmaster baker at level 1 without ever leaving one zone (might even be possible for a Wood Elf who gets Brownie parts from friends) more power to them.<br>
<br>
If they are here more for social interaction than advancement hip, hip, hurray!<br>
<br>
I don't even mind if they weigh in on message boards to explain their thoughts on an issue from their unique point of view, in fact I encourage it, they are paying just as much to Verant as player with a level 60 character and hence just as responsible for keeping the server open.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to explain things to me Heagen.  I think I took some of your earlier statements to a greater extreme than you may really feel (which I hope you'd admit is a potential drawback to your manner of presentation) but I think I have a better handle on where you are coming from now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usliver123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Political Piggies</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/19/02 3:39:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=971.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About Heagan</span><hr size=1> Guys, you've only seen Heagan in action when he has limitless time to type what he thinks in a post.

I'm sort-of-kind-of starting to understand what's going on here.  If you'll notice, in the real world, there is a huge trend going on I like to call the &quot;Extreme Lifestyle Trend&quot;.  Pretty much translates to everything from television and radio to cereal boxes has to be X-TREME.  <br>
<br>
One of the things included in this new X-TREME lifestyle trend is the addition of &quot;attitude&quot; to everything.  Drinks have attitude, foods have attitude, bands have attitude, televsion shows have attitude, and just plain ordinary people aren't &quot;trendy&quot; unless they have a brazen, brasch, harsh attitude.  Ever see one of those MTV interviews with a band or artist and all they do is say &quot;F this group&quot; and &quot;F the world&quot; and &quot;F you!&quot;.  It's becoming such a prevalent outlook among the younger folks that it's downright scary.<br>
<br>
So, in the real world, Heagan is trendy and X-TREME.  Just imagine if Heagan had a television commercial.. the dialogue would go something like this :<br>
<br>
*flashing lights and some kind of obnoxious techno looped music*<br>

then again, they were eight year-olds, and knowing myself how the idiotic adult responds to a child's questions when cornered, they might've tried to pare it down for the kiddies and thereby skewed the meaning.<br>

the domesticated animal industry is disgusting, and unnecessarily cruel.  you can't dress up those facts, nor garnish over them dismissively either.  show kids the actual truth, and let them decide.<br>
