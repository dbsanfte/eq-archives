As we got off the ship, he said something unimportant, then said to follow. I followed behind him. As we were about to leave the docks, we were stopped by Dwarven customs. I knew nothing of their droll language, but they attempted to question me. They gestured to me, and poked at my clothing. I tightened up, and prepared to draw my dagger and kill one of them. There was no way I could take them all on in a fair fight, though. Fortunatly, the idiot elf covered for me. We continued on, and soon came to the forests. I could feel adrenaline rushing through my veins as I knew a fight was about to arise.<br>
<br>
The dirt-elf must have sensed my nervousness, and asked me what was wrong. He said something about my clothing, then surprised me and pulled off my veil. His eyes widened in fear as he realized my race. I think I smirked, as his terror was so entertaining. I shoved him against a tree and kneed him in the crotch. With my forearm I held his chest against the tree and drew out my dagger. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out. I had rammed my dagger through his throat, which impaired his ability to speak. And live.<br>
<br>
I had recieved instructions on how to reach the scarred tree as part of my briefing, and it took me only a few minutes to get my barings. I conjured up my memory of the map I had shown, and within a few minutes had reached the tree. The five of them surrounded the tree and were looking out in all directions. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Praises to Innoruuk, God of All Gods!&quot; An orc said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Praises to Innoruuk, for he will empower you and I,&quot; I replied, completing the code phrase so we recognized each other. I had to resist rolling my eyes. I don't worship any gods, as I don't believe in any of them. No one has ever seen them, except in 'visions' and other trash. Priests and the like were only channeling magic in another fashion that healed. I especially despised Innoruuk, as the belief in him had turned my race into fanatics. If my kin hadn't been worked up into a frenzy and spent their time sacrificing each other for some dellusion, we would have conquered the elves already.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who's the leader of this pack?&quot; I said in their language. I had been taught it until I knew it fluently.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am,&quot; Another orc said, stepping forward. &quot;I am...&quot; He then said his name, which I won't embarass myself to repeat, and introduced his friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, you're not. From now until I leave this group, I am the leader. You'll be called Laranis. I don't care about the rest of your little followers. How far to the portal?&quot;<br>
<br>
The orc looked surprise for a moment, then quickly recovered, &quot;Six miles.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All right. That should take a couple hours. When we're half a mile away, I'll continue on alone.&quot; <br>
<br>
The orc nodded, and we marched on through the bushes. The orcs told me of their skirmishes with the tree-elves, and how they had fled into the trees. They then explained that they had made an outpost near their village, and were being set back there. They also detailed how they planned to hack down the trees and knock the tree village down. I stopped walking for a moment and boggled at the stupidity of the orcs. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't you imbeciles just set the trees on fire? It's less work, there's no nearby large source of water, and it'll be unstoppable.&quot; <br>
<br>
It caught the orcs off guard, and they stopped walking for a moment. They then exchanged glances with each other, and started walking again. They didn't try to talk to me again. A little more time passed, and the orcs stopped again.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're here,&quot; The orc grunted, &quot;Follow this path, and you should reach the spires.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded, and began to slowly stalk through the brush. I began to blend in with my surroundings, and slowly fade in. I saw a few patrols of orcs going by, which I snuck by for the fun of it. I also snuck past a troop of dirt-elves. <br>
<br>
&quot;One minute to teleportation!&quot; The scion yelled out once again. I must have missed her other announcements. <br>
<br>
Where was I? Oh, yes, I was just sneaking to the spires. Well, I crept past some dirt-elves. I realized the scion was one of those, heh, fancier dirt-elves, the one who stole our secrets of magic. I put my back against a spire, and waited, listening to her. I listened to her counting of the minutes, until she finally yelled, &quot;TELEPORTATION TO LUCLIN IS BEGINNING!&quot; I leaped into the center of the spires, and was instantly teleported. <br>
<br>
I've been teleported a few times before, and I hate it. The uneasiness, the way that your fate rests in some crazed magic-user's hands, who could easily send you to some place you won't survive more than a minute in. Suffice to say, it gets me sick. The teleport to Luclin was different than the others. I could feel my dissolving into tiny pieces, and rushing to the sky. Gravity had no effect on me, I was free, yet confined to a certain corpse. I then felt the gravity of Luclin, and my body coming back together.<br>
<br>
I stumbled for a moment as I reached Luclin. I felt dizzy, then sick. I vomitted on the ground, and rubbed my stomach. I leaned against a wall for a moment, until I recovered my bearings. I then looked around to see if anyone saw what I had done. No one seemed to be around me. The whole area was pretty empty. Now, it was time to explore.<br>
