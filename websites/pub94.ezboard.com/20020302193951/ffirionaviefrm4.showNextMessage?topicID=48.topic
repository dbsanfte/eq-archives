Someone's using /auction line to talk about how there's 300 people in Greater Faydark.  What ever shall you do?  If only there were this command that let you ignore them.  They could just call it /ignore, and when people were impacting your experience you could just ignore them.<br><br>Oh no!  Even worse!  There's just too many people to ignore.  If only there were some way to turn the ooc channel off.  If only Verant would set it up so you could click options, channels, and turn OOC channel off until the newness of the server dies down some and people shut up.<br><br>The Horror!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br><br>What's this now?  People aren't running up to you and regailing you with stories about how they were kidnapped by a band of gnomish gypsies, abandoned in Kithicor forest, and raised by a dread wolf as one of her cubs?  Oh god, please tell me it isn't so.  You might have to actually approach other players and INITIATE a conversation with them.  AAAAAHHH!!  NOOOOOO!!!!!<br><br>God, can you all whine a little more?  Sheesh.  <br><br>I started off in Qeynos, city of men.  Of all the cities in the world, it's probably the least hospitable from a roleplaying standpoint (players there don't share a common background, it attracts a lot of new players who can't find their way to the bank / figure out how to use channels / etc).  Here's what I saw...<br><br>Groups of people milling around by the rip-off merchants kinda near the bank just chatting with eachother about their character's histories n such.<br><br>Some guy fishing who'd worked in some emotes to use when he cast his line.<br><br>A ton of half-elves speaking in elven, referring to eachother as brother &amp; sister.<br><br>More people referring to their diety when they cast a spell than I could count (ie: May Karana watch over you, etc)<br><br>A few erudite caster groups who sailed over, refusing to speak in human because it was beneath them.<br><br>A lot of players grouping, tearing up the gnoll population, and just having fun.<br><br>Sure, there were a few kill stealers, and a few people who had no intention of ever roleplaying, but God, how freaking old are you if you can't ignore that?<br><br>I have TWO people on my ignore list right now, and NEITHER one of them are Kewl-d00ds.  Ya know who they are?  Spazzed out roleplayers who can't shut the hell up.  They sit there screaming on the zone-wide channels &quot;So-and-so shouts: STOP USING THIS FOR OOC!  This is the roleplay server!  If you don't want to roleplay, WHY ARE YOU HERE?!?!&quot;  etc.  <br><br>My apologies, but that ruins my roleplaying experience a hell of a lot more than some guy who goes /shout Ding!<br><br>So, I guess it's MY turn to be bitchy.  If you can't handle the fact that people are as people do, and won't ALWAYS be roleplaying, why don't you march your lazy ass on down to Target and pick up a copy of Dark Ages of Camelot so the GMs can babysit the server for you.<br><br>Thanx.<br><br>- Syllestrae Silverblade<br>Drunken Bard of Rallos Zek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uanklesdirtyfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ankles Dirtyfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/9/01 4:53:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quit yer bitchin!</span><hr size=1> Well said!<br><br>My theory has always been: if you don't want to hear it, don't listen.<br><br>I've found that a lot of the roleplayers are shy, and unsure of who is open to RP and who isn't.

I don't think it's too much for people to use auction for its intended purpose, and that purpose only.  The auction channel is not the ooc channel, nor should it ever be.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with out of character in a roleplaying environment.  Even sitting around a pen and paper rpg, you occasionally have to say &quot;Hold on a second, phone&quot; or &quot;Gotta take a wiz, anyone need anything while I'm up?&quot;<br><br>I think the dumbest element in this server is the removal of the /ooc channel.  I loved being able to turn it off.  What I hated was the lack of respect for people that wanted to use /auction for more than /auction and /shout for anything other than in-character shouting.  I turn of /ooc for a reason.  It is there for a reason.<br><br>To remove it from this server is COMPLETELY counter-procuctive.  That being said...<br><br>There is no /ooc.  That doesn't mean /shout or /auction is your new /ooc channel.  If you don't like it, then complain to Verant.  If you want a petition to put /ooc back in, I'd love to sign it, for reasons stated above.  But for now, there is no /ooc channel, so don't complain to other people that are using the channel for appropriate use to get angry at you for going around the rules, which is what you are doing when you don't use the proper channel.<br><br>It's no different than getting caught speeding.  If you drive over the limit, don't blame the policeman that caught you or the person that lives in the neighborhood for reporting you.  Go to the city council and argue that the speed limit needs to be raised... but it was you that decided to break the rules and it's you that needs to suck it up if you get caught.<br><br>Of course, it's a 90% moot point, since most of the time the policeman just shrugs and lets you off with a warning... if they even bother stopping you.<br><br>p.s. I agree 100% that the people that bitch about it in the same channel are just as guilty.  It annoys the hell out of me as well, and I cheer your complaints of them.  I don't agree that they should have to suck it up, but they certainly gain nothing by spamming the channel even more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uliusadh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liusadh</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f75.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/9/01 11:42:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/evermyst/images/chalice.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quit yer bitchin!</span><hr size=1> Liked your reply, Jantis, in fact, sent a copy of it to Verant.   <p><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/evermyst/images/liuclose.gif" border="0"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhalarus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halarus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/10/01 12:01:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quit yer bitchin!</span><hr size=1> I think Gfay is the exception to the rule.  99% of my experiences have been good so far on the server.

I was merely applauding the sentiments of being pro-active roleplayers, and to refrain from returning volleys of &quot;why arent you roleplaying&quot; in the channels at hand.<br><br>I know that /ooc was removed, and I agree, it was a big mistake doing so.  Heh, you may want to switch to decaff or something ...<br><br>I think the /auction issue is only bad in GFay - or is at its worst there.  They should consider (as has been suggested on these boards) disabling /auction in gfay, if they cant muster the arguments for restoring /ooc.  It would be a shame, as /auction is indeed used at these low levels (for patchwork, ruined skins, etc).

I rarely saw a mob that didn't have a swordstrike, an arrow and a couple of blasts hitting it at that same time.  That being said, with 321 people I thought overall the abuse of anything was fairly minimal.  I did do /report twice last night because of completely out-of-bounds /auctions.  Certainly two out of over three hundred is better than you could dream on a normal server.<br><br><br>Liusadh,<br><br>*blush*  Thank you for that, and I would love for it to do some good.  I wish more people on both sides of this sent petitions and feedback and emails to get them to re-establish /ooc so we could turn it off if we want to.  Even if they just put it in city zones.  How in the heck do they think people can ask questions?   In the meantime, there is no /ooc and people just need to remember that /auction and /shout are not for ooc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zsuzsanadracul>Zsuzsana Dracul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 7:18:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quit yer bitchin!</span><hr size=1> Everyone here advocating the return of /ooc has made some good points about that there are times when you need to say hey someones at the door or hold a sec gotta wiz .... but I have one huge question for you did you ever without meaning it to be comical /ooc Hey I will BRB gotta go pee   ?<br><br>And Must a /tell or even /gsay be in character at all times?

I mean come on is your idea of Roleplaying that of the kind of zealots that play Vampire near me.  They go out to the lake get all dressed up and hit each other with foam covered swords and where I could see it as fun I get a lot more roleplaying accomplished table top.  I think there is a problem with people stating That's NOT ROLEPLAYING and I will refrain from the use of the word Nazi as it is very childish read my other post if you want to know why. <p>Teir'Dal Enchantress of the 11th Seduction.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujantisconstanceeorle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jantis ConstanceEorle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 7:49:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.warghoul.com/images/CoSS/jantis_head_ez.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quit yer bitchin!</span><hr size=1> Not quite sure exactly what you are getting at with the post above, but I'll try to address it..<br><br>Basically, most people seem to be in agreement that /ooc should be reinstated.  I even used the peeing or getting pizza example elsewhere.  The point is that without an /ooc channel, nobody is supposed to have any means whatsoever to discuss things that are out of character.  That includes game mechanics.  That includes assistance with problems that you can't put into roleplaying terms without sounding stupid.  <br><br>I personally would have no reason to use /ooc to tell people that I'm going to the bathroom, considering the whole zone could care less.  The only time I can imagine using /ooc for that would be a full zone raid, like Hate or Fear.  Even there, you can tell your group and put the /afk tag on.<br><br>That being said, yes there are a lot of jerks that are going overboard with their idea of roleplaying.  So are there dewds and griefers breaking the channel usage of /auction and /shout.  Verant took out /ooc for this server not for others to spam the other channels with ooc discussions.  If you have a problem with that, then talk to Verant about it.  Maybe they will listen to us and reinstate /ooc so I can turn it off and the problem is solved.<br><br>I've said it before, if someone is spamming a channel for a use other than its purpose (shout = in character zonewide communication, auction = in-character merchant-type activities) then /petition them.  This includes /ooc conversation of any kind, which includes people bitching about people not roleplaying.<br><br>To me, spamming the /ooc channel with &quot;THIS IS ROLEPLAYING, STOP USING THIS CHANNEL!!!&quot; is no different than a librarian constantly shouting for people to be quiet in a library.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>As for zealots... there are different degrees of people who roleplay.  I have met many wonderful people that do live action roleplaying as well as are involved with such groups as the SCA.  I used to, but kept moving around and got tired of keeping track of things.  Just because someone enjoys something that you don't understand doesn't mean they are zealots.  My only problem is when people don't know what to stop.  There is a time to roleplay and a time to be in real life.<br><br>Would I have a problem with you saying you have to go afk?   No.  AFK is an ooc term... my character would never tell someone they were going away from keyboard then stare into the distance for five minutes.  Personally, I enjoy a relaxed environment and would adapt to the people I am with.  If people want to stay in character in group, then great!  If not, that's cool with me too.  Very specifically, this is a roleplay preferred server, not a roleplay enforced server, so you don't have to be in character at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukorraisashadowsgate.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Korraisa Shadowsgate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bonecollecter</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 8:22:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quit yer bitchin!</span><hr size=1> OoC: Personally I just ignore or seethe behind the screen.
