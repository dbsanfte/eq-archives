I think I have a fairly strong grasp of the economy of Firiona Vie, and I know by now what the appropriate prices for most things are.<br><br>I had an encounter today with a certain high elf, who shall remain nameless for the moment (at least until I catch her trying to discourage people from buying from me again) because I caught her reselling not only my jewelry, but quite a lot of other things as well, and at prices that make me cringe.  She seems to spend quite a lot of time auctioning and is very industrious about it.  But I have to disapprove of what she is doing, and I told her as much.  I don't think it's honorable.  I won't buy from her, and I won't sell to her either, unless I think it's for her actual use.  I don't think I'll have to worry about selling to her at all anymore, regardless.<br><br>What I would like to ask people is if they think this activity is honorable.  Is this a reasonable trade activity?  I know she is buying items from high level people who are giving her a break because she is still quite a low level, and then selling them to other people for every copper she can squeeze.  I get particularly offended when she tries to resell jeweler I have made, or might have made, at more than I sell it for.  I offer jewelery at the best prices I can (on gold now, and selling that at a loss, technically, because I am still skilling up on it) and I don't why someone else should gouge people for it and make a profit off my work just because I try to give reasonable prices.<br><br>Here is another example.  Crude Steins are a hot ticket item on FV.  I've been wanting one for ages.  The other day Stormwynd sold me one for 70 plat, giving me a deal because I wasn't very liquid at all.  I could probably sell it for more with little trouble.  But aside from the fact that I am using it anyway, I feel that would be an abuse of his generosity.<br><br>I want people's opinions on this subject, because I'm not sure now where I should stand.  If people are firming against this kind of &quot;ninja trading&quot; (just invented that term) I am fully prepared to start and update a public list any time I catch people at this.  If not, I'll just keep my notes to myself and have a personal little &quot;no buy, no sell&quot; list.  Please offer feedback.<br><br>Valquiss Silverpalm<br><br>P.S. If the elf in question should read this, and you know who you are, stop even trying to affect my reputation.  Even when I'm not around to defend myself, my reputation is far better than yours, and you'll only hurt yourself by setting yourself up against me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usliver123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/01 5:49:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Buying Low, Selling High</span><hr size=1> Well, I dunno. If people are willing to sell to her, and others are willing to buy from her, then its just enterprise. Enterpirse can be a dirty word, but really I think all this does is serve up a wake up to higher level players to be wary of who they help out. Personally I give most of my lower end stuff away, because I am in a guild that looks after its members pretty well. If someone sells this gear for their pony fund and doesn't use it, so be it ...

All they would do is buy and sell items, all day long.  They would set the prices and wouldn't budge... but if you tried to sell an item you had, they would undercut you or offer much less.  I tried doing this every once in a while, but it got very boring, and it's not exactly nice.  I was also a rogue, so it was in my nature to fence smuggled goods at times.  I don't think I've ever sold anything on Firiona Vie, but I do barter and exchange services for services.<br><br>Perhaps they are enterprizing, or being a crafty tradesman.  But most of the time they are taking advantage of the kindness of others, and then selling the item to those who don't care how much it costs. <br><br>On Firiona Vie I'm content with gathering my own items, crafting my own goods, and staying out of the haggling.  The less looted items are bought and sold, the less &quot;farming&quot; occurs.

Face it folks want items, and after a hard day at the frost giant, or any other nice cash dropping mod they're more than happy to pay a little extra for them. Prices are only as high as folks are willing to pay. As to reselling, well in jewlery's case your prices are pretty defined, everyone knows what those bars and gems cost. &lt;with the exeption of Diamond/Blue Diamond stuff&gt; I'm really not bothered by foks sitting around trying to make a profit as a merchant, I'd recommend a different server as this one doesn't have nearly the cash, bank space, or set area for auction. If they want to do it that badly they will, even if it means buying another account strictly for a sale's person that gets wiped every week for a new name.<br><br>Anyway if she is buying stuff at cost then reselling it higher. Either ask her for a cut, or riase your prices to her so that you can recoup. As the number of 250 jewlers increases you'll notice that most guilds will have one that makes jewlery at cost for there members.<br><br>So to wrap this up, I'm not suprised that those folk are about, they are what makes a servers economy though. I'm sorry that your trust was broken.<br><br>my 2cp not that they are worth any thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/01 12:11:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> If your jewelcrafting's been resold at a profit....</span><hr size=1> ...then ya set yer price lower than ya need it t'be.<br> <br>Stop givin her t'profit and make it yerself!<br> <br>-Morgrist Vanadil (League of Shadows)<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/01 3:27:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Buying Low, Selling High</span><hr size=1> Valquiss:<br><br>First, let me say that of all the people I've met on this server, your name is the most respected in my mind.

That's free market capitalism for you.  Either you lower your prices to compete with her, or you rely on your reputation and clout to maintain your prices (and probably lose some customers to her).<br><br>If you spent some time selling at just above cost, turning only a slight profit, you might be able to undercut her efforts.

I sold a certain someone, who I now have reason to believe is the same certain someone you're talking about, Raw Silk back when it was still not trivial to me.  I went by the rate the Traders Union person next to me told was the going rate for Raw Silk (1 platinum per AC minus 1 platinum per piece).  I'd sold it at that rate before, and I've sold it at that rate after, with no complaints from anyone about my price.  Sometimes, I offer a &quot;free lunch&quot; with it, sometimes not.  At any rate, she thought the price was fair enough when she bought it from me.<br><br>A few days later, I log on, and this certain high elf sends me a barrage of /tells about how I &quot;ripped her off&quot; and how the next day she'd gotten the rest of her Raw Silk for 5 gold a piece.  I said &quot;Good for you, sounds like you got a deal from that other merchant, and I'm sorry you feel you were ripped off by me but my price is what I understand to be the going rate.&quot;<br><br>I wonder, now, if she got so mad (and apparently remains mad, as she sent me /tells about how I &quot;ripped her off&quot; just yesterday before I put her on /ignore) because she tried to resell my Raw Silk at a higher price.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Lasgalen <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/24/01 1:57:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Buying Low, Selling High</span><hr size=1> I do not find it truly dishonorable unless she is giving you a story to get items off ya...Valquiss...i find you to be a very honorable gentleman. It sounds like you might have been swindled this way or misunderstood her. I know her not and cannot be an accurate judge. All i can say is that beware to the buyer is not only the case, but beware to the seller to because you may have met a con artist if they are trying to get you to sell for less than you would normally. I admit, when i give good items away, its only been to those i have faith in or am taking a leap of faith for. But i have never given away what i cannot afford. I am hoping that this is the case and only your feelings have been stepped on. talk to ya later.<br><br>Dhugal (Xelissen) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/24/01 2:17:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Buying Low, Selling High</span><hr size=1> Hail!<br><br>I'd like to thank everyone for their responces on this issue, and it's really helped me to clarify my position.  Ah...clarity...if only.  Well, soon.  Sorry, brief enchanter reverie.<br><br>After reading everyone's thoughts, I don't feel there's a need to throw this person (or anyone else) on any public blacklist.  As has been pointed out before, and wisely, we benefit from the low server population and it has been amply demonstrated that reputations get ruined very quickly with no one in particular attacking them constantly.  Word of month spreads quickly.  If anyone of the higher end-gamers seeks my in-put on who might not be worthy of great generosity (such as Windroll has already requested) I'll be happy to provide, but only on an individual basis.  I do tend to notice the auction channels more, if only because I spend a fair amount of time hawking jewelry.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Regarding my trade practices and pricing, I'll just clarify (sigh, clarity) what I meant when I said I was pricing gold jewelry at a loss right now.  I'm skilling into it, which means I fail often.  These same prices will bring me profit later on, which is the pattern I followed with electrum.  I have a whole website dedicated to fair jewelcraft pricing at www.tradersjewelry.freeservers.com.  Check it out, if you wish.  It explains all my pricing, as well as making it publicly available for scrutiny.<br><br>Finally, let me thank everyone for their kind comments towards the Traders Union.  It is wonderful to see the good reputation we established along the way, and all the people who remember us after only one or two transactions.  That's all it takes to make all that auctioning worthwhile.<br><br>I am about to post another thread regarding the Traders Union, and rather than hijack this thread (which seems to be drying up of natural causes) I'll just ask everyone interested in the business of my guild to read that post.<br><br>Thank you all again.  Good travels, and best wishes.<br><br>Valquiss Silverpalm<br>First Officer of the Traders Union (in transition, please read the other thread for details)<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessage?topicID=951.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessage?topicID=942.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=908.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.firiona-vie.com/images/arfv.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=908.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=908.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=908.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
