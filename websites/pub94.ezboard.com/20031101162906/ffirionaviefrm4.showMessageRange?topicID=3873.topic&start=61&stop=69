I don't mena to denegrate, belittle or dimiss people who joined FV recently with the intent to role-play.<br>
<br>
I recognize they're probably totally unaware of the original set-up of FV.  And there's really no reason they should accept it when Sony removed the in-game affects of the setting.<br>
<br>
But that doesn't mean I can role-play with them.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a few examples:<br>
<br>
My Dark Elf meets a Dark Elf and High Elf together.  The Dark Elf claims to be the parent of the High Elf.<br>
<br>
Well, first off I can't accept this is possible at all... getting past that I ask them how it is they have not been hunted to death by both races.  They express confusion as to why I would think they would be...<br>
<br>
My head explodes.  Well, not literally.  But at this point I have to excuse myself OOC because I can't RP with people who aren't playing in the same setting that I am.  I don't blame them I blame Sony for totally abandoning any commitment to fosterng RP on this server.  Yes I realise the May 8th rules were restrictive.  But Sony threw the baby out with the bathwater,  Instead of leaving the /alignment system in place and removing the restrictions caused by alignments they took the easy way out and just wiped the code entirely.  Of course they never said they were removing alignments, just the in-game affects.  What does this lead to?  Well over a year of a subgroup of players on FV (role-players) being divided over what constitutes role-playing on the server that was intended to be their refuge!  Can I blame people for giving up role-playing when many attempts at it lead to OOC debates over what works in the world of Norrath and what doesn't?<br>
<br>
So please, don't think I'm insulting you.  I blame Sony. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caillougna>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/dot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pebble with a bow</span><br>  Posts: 1842<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/03 5:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3873.topic&index=64>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newcomers</span><hr size=1> I had only used the word &quot;clique&quot; in absence of any better word.  The circle of roleplayers does expand, but it is made harder on the new roleplayers because of things like the bigotry vs roleplay thread(s) which make the RPers reluctant to RP with anyone new for fear that new person won't take it well.  Back a year ago, there wasn't the fear someone would rip your head off OOC for saying something to them IC.<br>
<br>
I agree in part with Kreelos that SOE has done us a disservice by not having in-game &quot;marks&quot; to indicate the connection to the world.  It doesn't help that the world backstory is disjointed in places or down right impossible to find now.  <br>
<br>
For example... I remember reading something back a while ago and then want to go find it and it is as if it never existed.  I wanted to find the info on the Vah Shir, Luclin, and the Combine Empire.  Nada or nearly nothing.  I will confess I haven't looked in the paper RPG yet for the info, but it used to all be online in one place or another, easily accessible to those who are playing in the world.<br>
<br>
This means... those who start in the world today have no connection to it, no knowledge of what or how the world of Norrath functions, how the races feel about each other, what the races think about themselves, etc.  Yes, this is not the only thing governing RP, but it does give a foundation.<br>
<br>
In life.... do you really think any person is so completely and utterly divorced from his ancestrial past?  It influences how one is raised, how one's parents were raised, how one's grandparents were raised.  It influences not only choices made in support of that up-bringing, but also the ones contra to it.  For example, my heiratage is central European, mostly German.  This gives me a different way of looking at things than one whose heritage is southern European, mostly Italian.  There are different attitudes about family, familal obligations, etc that is prevalent in those different societies.  Further, I was raised in middle-class neighborhoods which further affects how I see things, contrasted with how someone in a poverty striken location would see it.  I might be more frivolous with money than one who has spent most of her life without.  Even in the places I am directly opposite my up-bringing (religion and politics), the seeds of my childhood and youth are still visible.  This is a foundation which a character, a fully rounded character, will also have.  He will know, if not directly than peripherally, how he fits in society or doesn't.  He will know why he does or does not fit and how that makes him different.  It's not a matter of &quot;cookie-cutter&quot;, it's a matter of layers.<br>
<br>
I started a new character to play with my boyfriend to whom I just introduced the game.  Trying to find backstory now, on which to build the character, is... well.. depressing.  So much is gone.  That said... does anyone have info on the Combine Empire, Vah Shir, and Luclin?  <br>
<br>
It is still possible to RP on FV, it must be or I would give it up completely.  <br>
<br>
For me, the worst thing, though, is those who stand and say &quot;if you  RP -with- the backstory you are a cookie-cutter character&quot; (and have no clue what the backstory even is) or &quot;if you RP race conflict you are a bigot in RL&quot;.  The mixing of OOC and IC is what I find distressing and off-putting and why I am hesitant about RPing with anyone I don't already know.... even as a new character (without a connection to my other 2).<br>
<br>
But I am jsut rambling here... don't mind me.  *sigh* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhatha>Rhatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Animist of Shar Vahl<br>Swiftclaw wants fish!<br></span><br>  Posts: 1305<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/03 8:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3873.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://darklance.freewebspace.com/images/rhatha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Does -anyone- believe RP is as alive on FV as it used to</span><hr size=1> *shrug* When I started, I felt that I could go up to a random person, and expect to be able to rp/receive rp back... when I finished, I didn't. <p><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,<br>

The problem is that it's found as drops and as parts of quests and other dialogue and since nobody cares about lore (Or has an interest in speaking to NPC's without quests), the drops are destroyed and the dialogue forgotten.<br>
<br>
Remember my pirate grammar manual? Most people has never heard of it before and yet everyone who has quested for ice forged shackles has owned one, after all...it's just a worthless quest item you turn in for phat lewtz hehe (Allakhazam said so! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
The in game lore is very very rich, especially that of Kunark and Luclin, but it's not something most people care about so it remains forgotten.<br>
