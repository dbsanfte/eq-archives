He said he would pay me a lot of money and give me his gear because he would not need it with his new character.  I agreed, so he said we would go to the Bazaar so he could give me his stuff to hold while he created a new character.  I wondered why we had to go all the way to the bazaar, and he said he would help me sell my equipment that his would replace, and that was the best place to do it.  Sounded too good to be true, but I went along with it.  After talking for about half an hour, we finally went to the Bazaar, and he told me to put all my stuff in bags so I could bank it and take his stuff and wear it.  I did that, getting more suspicious by the moment.  He then told me to put my stuff in the trade window and he would hold it for me while I took his stuff because I did not have enough spots open.  That was the moment I knew he was definitly trying to scam me.  I said forget it and walked away.  I didn't even bother acusing him because I new it would be a waste of time.  After I zoned into the Nexxus, someone sent me a tell saying Hopebringer was shouting in the Bazaar that I stole from him.  I sent him a tell saying I was petitioning a GM and we could get this all straightened out.  He logged off.  <br>
<br>
Now, I will probably never see the name Hopebringer again, unless he is a very stupid person, but I am going to follow through with this GM investigation.  By looking at the conversation him and I had it will be obvious he was trying to steal.  My word to everyone is to keep an eye out.  He will probably return under a different name, but once evil, always evil.  And remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it IS!!!<br>

<br>
ran into him yesterday in everfrost.  he practically tried to get me killed by mammoths.  then again, i didn't have to play the gullible good samaritan, and i'm fully aware that i brought it on myself by doing so.<br>
<br>
this guy runs up to me, invites me to group without speaking a word.  i can see he's low on health, and being a bard i figure i'll group and heal/mana him up, then take off.  <br>
<br>
he says &quot;oom&quot; and sits down.  i sit to load clarity, as i don't have it loaded unless grouping (which happens rarely).  basically, he'd already aggroed a mammoth and it finally caught him up and gored the crap out of me due to bard aggro i guess.  regular mammoths are red to me, by the way.<br>
<br>
so now we're both low on health, and i'm running around trying to keep this mammoth occupied and off his hands while (i'm assuming, yes..i did assume too much)  he meds for the killing shot.  he stands up, says he dotted it, then disappears.<br>
<br>
basically, this was more than i'd signed on for.  by this time, every other mammoth in the zone is after my blood (this crap was pulled at a major mammoth intersection).  so i took off for the guards, and after reaching them said &quot;sorry, gotta run.&quot;   /disband<br>
<br>
did a /who on him right then &amp; there and he was already in highpass, probably just beginning to run whatever scam on you he was trying to pull.<br>
<br>
by the way, another person was grouped up with us at the time.  an enchantress who was nowhere in sight, but had two bubbles of health left when i joined.  i'm assuming (again) that she had already suffered from his insane behaviour and had run off in search of the guards.  as soon as she reached them, she disbanded with a similar excuse and logged.  it would be interesting to hear what she has to say.  her name was Saladdilla, if i remember correctly.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A> at: 8/11/02 9:17:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uralkorravenblood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ralkor Ravenblood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 5:33:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: my brief experience with this person</span><hr size=1> I met Hopebringer yesterday and he is now on my ignore list. I met him in Solusek's Eye, and not having read this post, I trusted him. <br>
<br>
I grouped with him for a while and while he surely was not a roleplayer or someone I would go on vacation with, I had met worse (hi Maladil). Things went slow with the goblins, so he proposed to port to Steamfont and kill the minotaur Meldreth for some Hero Bracers. He said we two could do it (low 30s druid, 27 rogue.. yeah I know now), and since I did not know anything about Meldreth and that he would easily wipe us a few minutes later, I agreed. <br>
<br>
No problem so far, but when I returned to get my corpse, Hopebringer, instead of sowing me or helping otherwise, had invited a local gnome for language lessons.. nothing more enjoyable than groupchat-spam on a corpse run. I got my corpse without his help, and when he called me 'dude' a few minutes later, he had earned his place on my ignore-list.<br>

<br>
I was grouped with him once when he was ML and he went LD. He looked me up the next day and gave me my split, that seemed pretty straight.<br>
<br>
However I was in a group with him last night in HHK. <br>
<br>
btw he was shouting a hero bracer for sale so I guess he got the Minotaur. (Meldrath is a gnome necro and a very nasty little critter - also nothing to do with the bracer)<br>
<br>
Anyway after a while in group he says &quot;have to go to the moon to sell something&quot; <br>
<br>
Next thing the entire group is dumped in NK. The idiot used group port without disbanding. He disbands and runs off without a &quot;sorry&quot; or anything.<br>
<br>
So I don't know about his honesty but don't group with him unless you are into magical mystery tours.<br>

<br>
He ported me to Butcherblock from Sol's Eye and told me to hurry to Steamfont (so that I would not bind and need his porting help should we die? Possible). When I later died deep in the minotaur caves, having told him that I did not know the area at all, he said something like &quot;I did not know I could track corpses&quot;...<br>
<br>
Of course I had pressed &quot;/loc&quot; before I died, and of course I had bound in Kelethin.<br>

This is a screenshot I took of Srir a week after he was disbanded from his last Guild.  I guess we know what happened to him, now.  Please don't look down on the guild noted here, I do not know if they disbanded him or not, but I'd be willing to bet they did.<br>
<br>
Please make careful note of the LAST NAME of Srir, and you can draw your own conclusions.  My opinion is that Brother Kuue is Srir's latest victim in new 'toon.<br>
<br>
Which answers two questions:  Why hasn't Srir Been On, and What Name Did He Choose To Change To?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.datazap.net/free/feylin/images/Srir.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I find it JUST A LITTLE TOO CO-Incidental that Srir's SURNAME here Just Happens to be the name of the current scam artist.  I cite his behavior as further evidence, as well as the fact that he was trying to cheat ANOTHER MEMBER of the Clan Of Brothers.  Guess Srir took it hard when he found out about my activities.<br>
<br>
Well, as this still shows, he deserves it.<br>
<br>
So Srir is now Hopebringer.  Gee, that's a stretch.<br>
