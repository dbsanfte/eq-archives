So if you're trained : Petition! Smear them! Tell a GM! Tell the Guild Leader! Whine like a schoolgirl about PnPs and how their honor is gone!<br>
<br>
If your harassed : Get over it, use the /ignore command.<br>
<br>
That's just lovely. Snout, you must be a cool groovy guy in real life...er, kid. Let me guess, you're one of those stains that say &quot;Well, if she didn't want to get raped, she wouldn't have worn that dress&quot;. Get laid much? Outside using a nifty date rape drug that is. Oh, your mom doesn't count either.<br>

Well, I am not a child, but from what I guess you're probably a sweet young lady. The apple of your father's eye (you probably have your mother's lips, bitch). <br>
<br>
No, the victim is NEVER to get blamed. Where do you get that from my posts? I am saying that getting a ''rude'' emote or /tell doesn't really mean you've been sexually harrassed. <br>
<br>
If anything, it is the ''cartoon'', not the person behind it, that is the object of some kid's &quot;lust&quot;.<br>
<br>
If anything, saying you were sexually harrassed in game really does bring down the seriousness of true sexual harrasment. But you folks just don't get it, so I'm not gonna draw you a picture.<br>
<br>
Besides, Saiba, what are you doing back? I'm shocked you took your finger out of your husband's hole long enough to type a paragraph. <br>
<br>
By the way, hope you never have kids... the thought sends shivers up my spine... with a bitch like you as a mother... eeek.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, see you next Tuesday, Saiba.<br>

Well! Looks like I touched a sore spot with your poor dry willie, Snout! Sore spot...dry willie...oh hahaha!<br>
Actually, this board has become something of a humor column with us...nothing like coming home all drunk and reading about what virtual adventures you virtual people have. Snout is our favorite.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I thought 'true' sexual harassment was defined when the one on the recieving end was made to feel uncomfortable from unwanted and unsolicited advances. Seems that the sister in question was. And regardless of EQ or any other game, there is a person behind the cartoon. So you can downplay it all you want...I bet you are one of those pricks though...judging by the tone. YOU are the one that doesn't quite get it, tard.<br>
<br>
And yes, I do have my mother's lips sweetie. Not really sure where the insult was, but oh well. Something along the lines of oral sex, i'm sure, but not really very well thought out. Anyway, I am proud of having my dear old mother's Irish features.....and at least I knew who my mother was. I'm sure that haggard toothless bag took one look at you and hit the bricks. A shame really. Here's my hankie. Dry those eyes.<br>
<br>
Finger out of hubbies hole? Is that what they teach you little wonder boys in school nowadays? Back in my day, they just used to flush you little nerdlings heads in toilets...guess it's gotten worse. But even if I was given to tickling the little pucker, at least I have a little pucker to tickle. That's on another...humans...body. <br>
<br>
Is that all you got, Pig? Bitch as a mother, bitch as a wife, bitch bitch bitch? I had thought since everyone was so proud of your flaming abilities I'd be in for something more....creative.<br>

You mentioned GPA before. I thought it was for college, but I guess it was Bitch Obedience School. Oh, never mind, that is one diplmoa that should be nailed to your forehead or your wall. Either/or works, but I prefer the former. ANYHOW: consult a lawyer for your state. Sexual Harrasment is a legal defination. Only. Each state it is defined. So, know a definition for whatever state that is misfortuned enough to have you as a resident.<br>

Can his sister speak for herself? From what I can gathter there is NO sister. There is NO culprit. I think he was just making this whole mess up. Anyhow... yes, there is a person behind the cartoon.

I'd explain it further .. but you know what I meant, but just in case you don't, I won't say any more... I'd hate to bring up traumatic memories for you, dearie. But I will say this much:<br>

Your husband is a great guy and totally understands you and your family. He didn't get pissed a bit when at your wedding during the father &amp; daughter dance your old man grabbed your ass for the last time. It takes a good husband to let that go.

All the comments about the liver, the husband...all that stuff...so very funny. What it all boils down to is this, really.<br>
<br>
At least I'm not some pathetic loser whose idea of fun on a Saturday night is playing some fantasy role-playing kids game. <br>
Even if what you say is true...I'm an aborted fetus bitch who needs to be taught as a woman where my place is, abused by her father and whose husband has a small package...even if that 'was' true, I'd STILL be better off than you.<br>
<br>
I wonder if EQ and FV and your....&quot;community&quot;...is a great consolation? Virtual nookie a good substitute for the real thing? Do you look out the window and see real people with real friends going to do real things in the real world? I bet you do, and honestly I fucking pity you. I can almost see the tears of shame and pain flowing down your cheeks as you watch life passing you by...<br>
<br>
But hey, at least you're King of the FV Soapbox. A big bad-ass on the board and in-game, feeble and weak and non-confrontational in the real world. LOL. Making mother proud. I'm sure you could get dressed up and go to the next Fan Faire, though. Haha.<br>
<br>
I've seen your type at school. Blinking stupidly at the sun as they emerge from their dorms, pasty-faced, nervous, ill-adjusted to life. Trying to get in on conversations, but just being awkward and providing jokes for other people for days to come. At parties, standing in a corner, watching as noone notices them. <br>
<br>
Me, I can and did leave this loser game because I have other things.<br>
<br>
You, you will never leave...because it's all you have.<br>
<br>
And whatever other insults or name calling or flaming you have is really irrelevant. At the end of the day, I end up in the plus column, with a life.<br>
You...well, you don't even matter enough to be put in any column. Sleep well tonight, sweetie.<br>
<br>
And I still don't get the Tuesday thing. Are you threatening me In Real Life? ROFL! Going to come and 'get' me? I'm sure you'll pose a big threat, you 98lb weakling. Think mom will let you borrow the station wagon?<br>

Real classy people.Someone &quot;dares&quot; post a complaint on the Soapbox forum. Someone was harrased by another player in the game, and tries to let the community know about it, and you put her down. Oh, I suppose NONE of you ever posted a complaint about anything that's not 100% EQ technical problems. I used to have some respect for the opinions of a few of the posters here, from what I've read in the past, but not anymore. Go ahead and flame me for &quot;daring&quot; to speak out against all you super cool people. Go ahead and keep posting witty remarks show everyone how great you are.<br>
 To the Sella35, who started this post. If you're still out there reading, I'm sorry you had to meet all the jaded, losers of this server.<br>

<br>
I play EQ only a few hours a week.. and she acts as if she has never played the game Har! ahahahahahahahaa <br>
<br>
Yeah, riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight!  She probably is one of those 80 hour a week EQ addicts running 3 comps... but never mind.. not important....<br>
<br>
Anyhow, not that it is her business, but I do have a life, plenty of friends, a significant other, a home, and an automobile... EQ and this message board (woo hoo 10 minutes of posting/flaming is such a time sink!!!!)<br>
<br>
Well, well, doesn't matter.. this thread got way off its original direction, even if there was one... <br>
<br>
Saiba, I highly suggest you get back to real life. It is OBVIOUS you are the one with the &quot;addiction&quot; to EQ.. remember, you quit? Then why are you back here? I know.. because you STILL play. YOU (love how you do the ''you's'') are lying your ass off saying you don't play EQ anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyhow, you are so full of shit. I think it is hilarious that an ass clown such as yourself even remotely takes yourself seriously. I have said it a million times I don't take a damn thing I type here on the Soapbox seriously. I just have fun banging away at the keyboard and I don't give a rat's ass. It is just a message board for some video game. Woooohpppiee doooo dah! But you, m'lady (LOL!) are genuinely serious. That is fucked up LOL har!<br>
