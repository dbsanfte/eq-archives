I was drawn here by the prospect of actual roleplaying with individuals who took the time to develop interesting characters, both light and dark.  My name is Dvek, and I am a Tier'dal Rogue who is still very new to the game.  Yesterday I learned that quite a few of my brethren in the evil guilds see me as a spy and a trickster, and would have nothing to do with me.  Until yesterday, I did not realize this, and went about my business and interacted with anybody I came across.  Now I know that I am NOT well liked, and knowing this hurts,and makes me very uncomfortable around people who I used to talk to freely.  I have been trying to make amends ever since I found out.  Allow me to explained what may have caused people to see me in a bad light.<br><br>   Three weeks into my career, I spotted an Iksar killing guards in Nektulos.  I am an historian by training, and an avid roleplayer, so I wanted to help defend my home from its enemies, and shape the history of Norrath.  I was not in a guild at the time so I went to town and asked around.  I found out that Lord Gray of the League of Shadows was there along with most of his guild mates, so I contacted him.  I didn't know he would bring his entire guild with him, but I RP'ed to the best of my ability, and I had a blast interacting with him and his guildmates, even those who threatened me (Azmoden *wink*).  Having never been in a guild, or such a close knit community as FV, I didn't realize how professional some guilds are.  It seems there was no threat after all, and I was relieved, as well as happy I was able to RP with the League.  From that moment on, I was labeled as a &quot;trickster&quot; and a &quot;spy,&quot;  though I didn't realize it.  My name is mud now, and many evil guilds even refuse to deal with me.  <br><br>   I would like to apologize to anyone who believes I am bad news.  I was brand new to the game and the server, an my eagerness to get involved made me fall flat on my face it seems.  At the time, I was a &quot;newbie&quot; who stuck his nose where it didn't belong.  Had I known earlier how people really felt about me, I would have apologized earlier.  I did not mean to offend anyone, or disrupt the play of others.  As most people know, this server is a close knit community, and reputation means a lot.  I can not play knowing how my own people really feel about me.  I know better now than to involve myself in political matters without any backing, and I assure you all, it will not happen again.  <br><br>   I hope this misunderstanding can be fixed.  It really hurts to be threatened by hostile guildmemebers, and to not be able to group with anyone who fears to associate with you.  Hopefully, people realize that what I did was a &quot;rookie mistake,&quot; and done with the best of intentions.  I am eager to rejoin the community.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Dvek<br><br>P.S.  Get to know me by asking my history.  It is fairly well thought out, and interesting (at least I hope others will think so).
