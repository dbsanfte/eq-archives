class=m><span class=title>   Re: My first asshat report: Effect the Ranger</span><hr size=1>   Well, If I were an outsider like you all are besides a few of you, I would be feeling and thinking the same way as you all are.. but being that this is directly about me and flaws about me I'm going to  see it in a different manner. Let me start off with the first  post by &quot;Kreelost the Hunter&quot;<br>
and i quote..<br>
((I had been reticent to invite him because I had seen him in Karnor's the previous night where his group had decided they could fight in the entrance way where my group was already fighting and kept pulling through us while then repeatedly begging us for Haste spells. But I believe in second chances)).<br>
<br>
I was not in any group..  I was there infact.. yes i was sitting by the zone shooting my arrows on pulls that they SAID was ok and they also hasted me.. things got  bad... there were mobs all over the place, so I decided instead of running i would help out and try to keep some of these people alive. BUT i guess some people don't get their stories straight and like to accuse other people.. ya?<br>
<br>
As far as the group I was in with her.. I made some mistakes due to being stoned... witch i told the group beforehand.. she and the other say i wasn't snaring.. I was snaring and allot of the time I was being resisted which i didn't understand. Me stealing aggro?, I wasn't trying to but you take a 44 ranger with blood sworn and swifblade of zek.. then a warrior with some really slow delay 2hs weapon see who does more damage.. the only thing i asked him to do was possibly change to two 1hs weapons.. because it seemed to me that his skill in 2hs want really that good, also if you remember him saying his taunt sucked.. as far as it's skill level<br>
<br>
I warned you i was not all there.. but you still had me be the puller.. that was your fault NOT mine.. next group that is flaming me ...<br>
<br>
Feed Ravens.. that mask you won, with the +8 wisdom.. I didn't want to roll on it, the only reason I asked if we were going to roll on it was because if it wasn't going to be an upgrade for you then it should be rolled on by all members of the group .. as soon as we established that it was an upgrade for you . the subject was dropped and we went on.. I find it really sad that  people have to flame someone about things he supposedly has done without coming to him and asking about it. I find this matter extremely accusatory and not enough facts to  have any sort of evidence to come anything........<br>
<br>
 ok  referring to ..&quot;Dauun earlylight&quot; i don't remember telling you i was a Shadow Maji~ but i was duel wielding weapons.... you think mages can duel wield swords? Fast forward a few weeks in LDoN ... let me try and explain my &quot;bossiness&quot; When I start groups.. or an asked to be the leader. which is asked of ME allot of the time.. I give out certain rules.. usually like these.. first off we establish a ML,MT.. slower/healer. I then give some guidelines .. like.. if im puller/lead Don't go ahead of me.. people like to do that and allot of the time they will aggro the whole room and not take blame for it so i'd rather just  not have anyone  go ahead of me, that's all.. Oh I'de also like to add in this particular group... it was a rescue adventure..  i said in the beginning.. that we have to kill all the mobs in our pathway because when we hail the  captive, she will follow us until she get close to  a mob then will stop and warn us... they didn't want to kill everything.. so we have the captive and are on the way back.. i say STOP don't go ahead... they kept running.. got me and the captive agroed and i died along with the captive and it was all blamed on me...whatever<br>
<br>
Bladsking.. your post: I have been told that this guy may be niomial by a source of mine.<br>
I asked the little ranger straight out in a tell when I saw him in KC as my guild were doing a druids VSR epic part.<br>
<br>
He did not reply 'who is niomial' or 'no way you idiot!' or some other kind of reply that i'd expect from an innocent. The reply was 'who told you that, I need to know' or somesuch. The reply of the guilty who have been found out IMHO. <br>
<br>
I don't know who &quot;niornial &quot; is at all.. im rather new to this server and I personally think it's really funny that you would put me up to be his alt or his new second account... that's really sad.. YOu sent me a tell saying i was told by someone that you are a re-rolled &quot;niornial&quot; i said no then I asked you who told you... you NEVER replied or anything.. that's sad . once again you people aren't letting the source of this post explain himself.. nope you just run to the boards and cry about allot of things that mean nothing.. im tired of trying to explain myself.. one more thought comes to my mind.. if i were such a bad ranger .. then why do i get tells all day long of people i have grouped with allot in the past asking me to lead their group and pick the adventures.... im rather new to the server and i think ive made quite a few friends for the little time ive been here.. ive asked some people about this and they don't seem to see it in me.... To be honest this is a game and you all can think how you want to about me, i don't care if you don't want me in your groups.. there are hundreds of people in this game that are cool with me im sure of it... respond to this how you want to and ill respond accordingly  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garios>garios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/03 6:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4070.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My first asshat report: Effect the Ranger</span><hr size=1> well to post something positive i have grouped with effect numerous times and he doesn't have that type of attitude that everyone warms up to but not everyone is likeable.  as for coming here and posting that he is a bad ranger that is a person opinion but as far as i have seen he has not horrible screwed anyone over just gave them a bad day.<br>
<br>
in my groups he has always been fair with the loot in my eyes things that are rolled on are only rolled on by people that can use them not rolled on for greed.<br>
<br>
as a response to the elven blades guild one i dont mark a whole guild by a single members action and two as far as i saw maybe i didn't see it but i saw no mention of his guild until someone from the guild came here and said something about it which to me makes them look paraniod about it.<br>

I'm not sure when this was said as I certainly wasn't aware of it and I was group leader.  I would not have invited you had I known.  It is possible to play EQ while stoned but LDoN requires serious focus.<br>
<br>
And I don't know what drugs you were on because you were certainly not being mellow which I would associate with marijuana.  Were you on speed?<br>
<br>

You don't understand resists?  You don't know to keep trying?<br>

<br>
You didn't think to stop swinging sometimes?  I think I saw you kicking too which adds more aggro than the damage it inflicts justifies in sitatuions like this<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the only thing i asked him to do was possibly change to two 1hs weapons.. because it seemed to me that his skill in 2hs want really that good, also if you remember him saying his taunt sucked.. as far as it's skill level<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope, he said his taunt didn't seem to be working well enough.<br>
<br>
By the way taunt works like this.  Either it succeeds or it fails.  If it succeeds you move to one point higher on the mob's hate list than the next person.  Taunt is not going to help if other people continue to draw more aggro after you succeed.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, you were in no way polite about it.  You did not &quot;ask him to switch weapons&quot; you said &quot;i you have other weapons USE THEM!&quot;  This is a paraphrase as I did not log but my groupmates all agreed you were being pessimistic, impolite and a jerk in general.<br>

<br>
I sent you a tell inviting you to the group.  You most certainly did not warn me you were not all there and if you said it at any point in group chat it spammed past in the heat of battle.<br>
<br>

The problem for me boiled down to the fact you acted like a jerk.  If you wish to attribute this to being stoned, which I again never saw any statement of such at the time, I recommend you stop playing stoned.  I don't think you'll get a lot of sympathy from that defence.  Depending where you are you probably just admitted to a crime...<br>

I won't group with you again.  I doubt you'd want to group with me again.  But I'm quite willing to let the issue die.  I never intended to bring your guild into this, didn't even know you were a in a guild.  I am not recommending any action to them either way.  They can weigh all sides of the issue and do what they will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sumrrose>Sumrrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/03 7:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4070.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>as a response to the elven blades guild one i dont mark a whole guild by a single members action and two as far as i saw maybe i didn't see it but i saw no mention of his guild until someone from the guild came here and said something about it which to me makes them look paraniod about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's entirely possible that I may well have misinterpreted your comments when the mask dropped.  &quot;I want to roll on it&quot; could either be interpreted as &quot;I want it&quot; or &quot;I want there to be a roll for it&quot; equally, so perhaps I was presumptuous.  However, you did make several comments along the lines of &quot;I'm a wis caster too&quot; and &quot;we should roll&quot; before our ML pointedly commented directly that you couldn't wear the mask.

Bossiness I'm used to. (waves at Suometar and grins teasingly) However, there's a way to be bossy, and there's a way you shouldn't be bossy. Generally, Suometar's competancy will more than make up for the fact she's barking orders at us. I like the fact Suometar gives us instructions, it keeps things paced correctly and puts everyone on the same page. Communication is essential. The fact that she often appologizes later for having to be so gruff doesn't hurt either.<br>

Snare gets resisted, not often, but sometimes. Not sure why your snare was being resisted unless you don't have your caster skills up as high as they can be. Might wanna work on these if not. If it gets resisted once, you should keep snaring. Try snaring yourself repeatedly to work up your skill <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

(Maybe go do it while in them middle of a camp of ferocious monsters, that's fun!) (Anyone who has accidentally snared themselves can have a good laugh at this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

I would be very embarassed, and I'm sure Dorvum would be too if Pericles (our bard) thought he had to twist snare into his songs when we're along. It'd mean that Dory or I wasn't doing our job. :P<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong though. I am often grateful for bard snare. Like: If My snare is getting resisted by a high level mob, and Peri's running behind, and his manages to catch it, giving me a little extra time to get one of my snares to stick, which will last longer anyhow. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I often find myself walking a line between getting aggro and missing a snare.  In high DPS groups, if nobody is debuffing MR, it's particularly tough.  To ensure the critter doesn't run, I sometimes have to snare at 60%.   And again a few seconds later, after the resist.  With a warrior tank, that WILL get the critter's attention.  Of course, at 65, you also have the tools to lose aggro -- Jolt, Cinder Jolt, or wait 2 seconds for the wizard to land the next gigantic crit ,then search the critter's corpse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Hunter Gyre Redbranch<br>

I don't know the ranger in question. I do group with a very competent ranger on a daily basis; it's very rare that he misses a snare (if he does, it's due to multiple resists), and aggro generally stays where it should. I love grouping with a good ranger, and I find them a huge asset in LDoN. They can track, scout, root park, offtank, take aggro and ditch it as necessary, slow if epiced (or with Swarmy), snare, and add some impressive DPS to the group. Oh yeah, and they can heal. Sorta. Or like to think they can. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There's a lot of sucky rangers out there, but if you find a good one, don't let em get away.

I'm assuming from this you have group chat in the same window as battle spam. Group chat should be in a separate window. No chat channels - especially group or raid, i.e. those that potentially carry important messages about the combat situation - should be in the same window as battle spam.<br>
