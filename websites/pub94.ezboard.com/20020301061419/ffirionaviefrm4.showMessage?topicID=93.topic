<br>
We will have our fun with our roleplaying.  I do not expect to have any problems from F&amp;F as they will soon be completely out of my reach but due to certain circumstances that may cause it I will reserve the right to /petition.<br>
<br>
And just now I can see people laughing at the idea of GM's actually doing something.  Well for those of you that have been around any of the GM's or had any contact with them on this server they seem more interested in the rights of the people IMO.  As such during the time when the F&amp;F was pulling everything including things my group was in midst of pulling I did do a /petition about the Halloween events.  I received some information and decided that since they would be this way until at least the weekend there was no point in having him come there even though the GM offered to come and have the groups make sure they were sharing.  I am not advocating /petition whenever you see a F&amp;F member but just voicing the opinion that if you get walked on by any guild the /petition is open and for once it seems like GM's care enough to do something about it.<br>
<br>
Another refreshing comment is when a GM forced a group to share a camp and did it completely roleplaying as a troll.  I thought it was very well done and would like to so far commend our gm's for making FV a very enjoyable experience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukriticalcondition.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kritical Condition</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/2/01 4:36:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What is going to happen?</span><hr size=1> I have found the GM's on this server to be much quicker and efficient on their response time and situation dispute.  Let's see the disputes:<br>
5 name infractions (regarding mine mostly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
1 loot infraction<br>
<br>
All were handled in less than 1 hour, which from previous experience is wonderful.  <br>
<br>
Now, regarding your statments when you say, my group was in the midst of pulling, ect...  Do you mean they were going to pull a certain mob but was taken just before they happened to engage it?  If that's the case, well, it's too bad.  Any non-engaged mob is open.  However if the pulled mobs you speak of were already engaged by your puller, then it's a different story.  Also you have to take into account of aggro and the mobs in question.  For example, undead.  These mobs &quot;typically&quot; whether engaged or not will attack the nearest PC and social with another mob of its kind in a pull path and aggro even if it was pulled by another party.  <br>
<br>
I was at the Halloween events, however, do not remember the &quot;incident&quot;, maybe because I was late.  So, in this dispute did you contact any FaF to resolve the &quot;apparent action&quot; or go directly to /petition?  Going directly to a GM would be ridiculous without trying to reslove the matter with the other party.  One, it shows your ignorance.  Two, you become just like the accused seems to be in everyones eyes, &lt;insert appropriate slang adjective for describing actions of FaF here&gt;.  <br>
<br>
To me, what everyone &quot;says&quot; about us and how we have horribly wronged them and created a negative environment on the server is a bunch of @#%$.  All it really is, is heresay.<br>
<br>
Ohh FaF just trained me on purpose.  How do you know?<br>
Ohh FaF pulled my mobs purposely.  Really?<br>
Ohhhhh that FaF person is such a jerk, he doesn't answer my tells or has time to talk to me because, well, because, well, just because!  Umm, sometimes people are busy or afk and don't have the message, or in battle, or too much spam and they don't see it.....ect.<br>
FaF want to be uber and get items and lvls quickly, screw them, that's not how you're supposed to play this game!  Ummm, says who??<br>
<br>
PnP:<br>
Never been affected by it in all my time.  Really don't think I'll be affected by it here either since I guess as some say our members are ahead of the curve.  Will I share a &quot;camp&quot;?  Nope, highly doubt it.  Example, my group broke the AoF last night in CT.  Your group walks down and says PnP this.  Sorry but f-ck that.  Not wasting my time and effort on controlling an area as hard as that at this lvl to another group that didn't contribute to it.  Petition me all you want, I keep pullin and pullin and pullin.  Oh well, like I said, I highly doubt I'll have that here.  There are getting to be so many zones in this game, go find another.  Sound familiar, &quot;there are 40 other servers, go play that way on another, not here!&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't know.  All of this negativity towards us is generated by a guild advertisement a month ago I think.  No one really knows us in game, nor will anyone ever give a member a /tell to actually know the person behind the toon, just by msg board retalition, kind of like this one if you may.  Although this is not a flame or anything of the like, just a reply and a few questions.  Take it as you may.  <br>
<br>
By the way, what guild do you lead?<br>
<br>

Hell no because the first time I made any comment about it to a F&amp;F that was passing by they thought it would be funny to do a /laugh and /rude and do I have their name no because at that point I thought okay one jerk so what.  <br>
<br>
What I meant by taking pulls is because of the Halloween gangbang you would have to pull from near the middle of the zone.  For us that don't have 3 groups in one place we pulled to the zone line.  Well our puller would stay close to the things they were pulling to make sure that they didn't lose them and all of a sudden boom 1-3 F&amp;F people would come and blast it and take the agro.  I actually took back the agro on one by tashing it 10 times.  Yes it even pulled away from your uber stealers.  I made one comment to a passerby F&amp;F and he did what I related at the top.  At that point I said screw it because if you aren't going to regulate your members I shouldn't have to do it for you.<br>
<br>
As for what guild I lead it is the Blackened Roses.  As for getting upset because someone ignores you I don't care if you ignore me when I speak to you unless it is about something your guild does.  Maybe this person will stand up and remember doing it but as for your large population of members I do not know who it was. <p>Teir'Dal Enchantress of the 11th Seduction.</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=93.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=93.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=93.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=93.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
