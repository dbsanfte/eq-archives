Yet to get a response.  I am new to on line games.  I started Everquest about 1 month ago.  I read up on each class and the healers just appealed to me.  So I tried a human cleric to 10, a barbarian shaman to 10 and a wood elf druid to 10.  <br>
<br>
While resurrections seem like a nice skill and porting people is fun (never had either), the shaman seems to be a nice blend of group and solo.  I think I can solo at any level when I want and yet groups will still welcome me.  Is this an accurate thought?<br>
<br>
Originally, I was considering a race between barbarian, iksar and troll.  I chose the troll as I just love his area and the looks.  One more thing is before starting the troll, I created a character in every city to check them out.  <br>
<br>
My laundry list of questions are as follows:<br>
<br>
Does it matter that I start out on this server?<br>
<br>
Noone in my zone (rarely).  Where do all the Trolls go?<br>
<br>
What cities am I welcomed in?<br>
<br>
I chose Cazic as my deity.  I heard there are Erudites that follow that faith but I never could find them  Where are they?<br>
<br>
Am I welcomed in the city with lizard people since we both follow Cazic Thule?<br>
<br>
Shaman Questions:<br>
<br>
I just got to my 4th season and finally obtained all my spells from the 1st season.  I did get a shield from a merchant but do I worry about armor or bank my coin for spells?<br>
<br>
What should I look out for as a shaman?  Anything usual about this class?<br>
<br>
I noticed quest for armor in Kelethin but none in lovely Grobb.  Is the netted my armor off the tadpoles?<br>
<br>
Is there a quest for a spear or some other weapon that is magical I can do by my 15th season?<br>
<br>
Some nice little tasty looking dark elf gave me a steel mace and another gave me a chalice with wisdom on it.  Very nice of them even though we have different gods.  They can go in my town so I assume I can go in theirs?<br>
<br>
Stupid questions but answers to any of these or just tips in general are appreciated.  I feel like I picked the right race and class.  I am reading the eq shaman and crucible boards for information as well but most people there are talking about things at a higher level or gear for a new shaman with lots of money (how do they get lots of money if new?).<br>
<br>
Thanks to all that respond kindly and those that don't, may I eat your children.<br>

<br>
I’ve noticed a lot of first time players on the FV Server. Just remember the server is roleplay ‘preferred’ so you will prob. fare better by creating a persona for your Shaman and then staying in character.<br>
<br>
Also realize that as an ‘evil’ race, you may find yourself excluded from various ‘good’ groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Noone in my zone (rarely). Where do all the Trolls go?<br>
<br>
There probably aren’t a lot of folks making new Trolls. A lot of times, new Trolls will go to the Dark Elf City and hunting grounds of Neriak.<br>
<br>
You can reach Neriak by exiting the swamp into South Ro, passing through Oasis, passing through North Ro, passing through East Commons, and entering Nektulos.<br>
<br>
It’s a dangerous journey for a new player. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- What cities am I welcomed in?<br>
<br>
You will be KOS (killed on sight) in all Norrath cities except: Grobb, Oggok, and Neriak<br>
<br>
On Luclin you will be safe in Shadowhaven and Shar Vahl without doing faction work.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- I chose Cazic as my deity. I heard there are Erudites that follow that faith but I never could find them Where are they?<br>
<br>
Erudites that worship Cazic start in the evil Erudite city of Paineel located on the continent of Odus – a long ways from where you are starting. They are also KOS in your homeland, so don’t expect to see too many around.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- Am I welcomed in the city with lizard people since we both follow Cazic Thule?<br>
<br>
Nope – Lizzzardsss hate evvveryone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You can do faction quests much later in life and perhaps gain dangerous admittance to Cabilis – but for now, stay away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

- I just got to my 4th season and finally obtained all my spells from the 1st season. I did get a shield from a merchant but do I worry about armor or bank my coin for spells?<br>
<br>
It’s hard starting out as a Shaman. You probably will do better not to buy all your spells at first. Definetely get your healing and disease / sickness spells.<br>
<br>
Save as much money as you can so you can by player made &quot;banded armor.&quot; (You'll need size Large)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- What should I look out for as a shaman? Anything usual about this class?<br>

As far as I know, there are no ‘baby’ Troll Shaman specific quests for armor. Wear the netted armor until you can afford to start buying banded.<br>

<br>
Regarding spells, do I need to keep coming home to buy them?  Any progression of zones around Innothule?  I saw South Ro Desert, Feerott and Upper Guk are connected to my swamp.<br>

As for my persona, I shall not talk like my uneducated warrior and knight bretheren.  I am a shaman and thus much wiser.  <br>

The rest are sold in the cities of anyone that can be a shaman, Grobb, Oggok, Shar Vahl, Halas (killed there) and some in Shadowhaven.  So if you do go to Neriak, you would have to get back to Oggok or Grobb for spells.  I would suggest either relocating to Neriak or Shar Vahl.. Neriak would be better for getting groups and meeting people, and Shar Vahl would be better for levelling and more convenient to buy spells.  Whichever place you go to, you'll need to learn the language first.  It would probably be best to go to Neriak, I'd think, grouping with others is the best way to learn about the game.. just let them know that you're new at this.<br>
<br>
As for armor, there are many smiths that will make it for you at the cost of materials, been a while since I did any, I think it's about 50 platinum?  I forget... at any rate, your best bet is either to get to the bazaar, or try to find a higher level person in Neriak to help out with that.<br>
<br>
If you happen to be in the same area as me I'll gladly teach you another language and do some smithing, but I am very rarely in those areas. <p><HR><BR><A HREF='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438' target=new>Rhatha Sha`Naya</A> and Swiftclaw<BR>

That said it is often more fun learning the early ropes yourself.<br>
<br>
Not saying you should change, but often Troll Shaman start following Innoruk,  the reason is it gives you access to the initiate, adept symbol quests in neriak.  One of these has a snare type spell (engulfing darkness) which can be quite handy for runners and is more reliable than root.<br>
<br>
As a new shaman you have a double role.  First off for our first 20 levels or so we are fairly dependent on melee.  We have small mana pools and inefficient spells.  <br>
<br>
Best bet is to buy the most necessary spells first, damaging spells, healing spells, summon bag/food/water can save you money in the long run as well.   Many of our early buffs are less than effective, if money is tight skip these until the second tier spells.  Slow is our eventual forte, but until walking sleep (lvl 14) you may as well save the mana and coin.  Your best healing spell until level 19 is actually inner fire... Its the most mana efficient, still good to load minor or light heal as well because they cast faster though.<br>
<br>
Save money towards armor.  You should try and get into a suit of banded armor by level 20  or so at the latest, and it will be easier for you the earlier you can do it. This will cost you about 75 to 80 pp.<br>
<br>
For damage a two hander will be your best bet until the early 20's, when you fall off the melee curve.  Most of the better weapons for shaman are either spears (including epic) or two hand blunt.<br>

Questions now are since I can use it, am I as a follower of Cazic Thule welcomed in Paineel as a Troll?  Iksars can't use it.  If I follower Cazic Thule, can I still go into Neriak?  I read about a zone called Warrens which is near Paineel.  Any advise on this?  <br>

Fear is mostly useful in conjunction with snare though, and shaman dont get that unless they are innoruk trolls with the adept necklace. <p>
