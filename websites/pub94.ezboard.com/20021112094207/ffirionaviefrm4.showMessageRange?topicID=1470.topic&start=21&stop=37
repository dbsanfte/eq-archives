We had just cleared the queen's room and all of a sudden the zone crashed. I was booted to character screen and whenever I tried to login it said zone unavailible. Took about 15 minutes and finally I got back in. But now all the spiders had repopped and I died quite quickly. I put in a petition and waited about 15 minutes but ofcourse no GMs are on. So I log and do an email petition and go to bed. Well next day I go to work and when I get home I submit a petition in game. About an hour later a guide sends me a tell. And this is what he says:<br>
&quot;Sorry you died, but its been more than 3 hours since you died so I can't rez you.&quot; <br>
<br>
hmmm, I sent him a tell asking him what I should do. He said all that could be done was that he could drag my corpse to zone in so I could loot it. <br>
<br>
Well, I told him the 3 hour thing didnt make sense because I had only been online maybe and hour and a half since I died. (Not to mention the fact that he is a guide and should be able to get around those things). He says that that does not matter it is time from the death so even if you are offline your timer is still running. I told him that in the past when I died I was able to log back in and get rezzed the next day. He says fine, and he will go down and check my rez timer. What do you know he can still rez me. So in the end I get a 100% rez but was left totally confused by the whole situation.<br>
<br>
The guide did not know the way the game worked, and a said a GM rez had the same 3hr time limit as other rezzes. &lt;boggle&gt;<br>

They are GM's because they get paid..not because they enjoy doing it..Pretty much how anyone that is underpaid and overworked treats their job.

*Officially*, the res timer is supposed to be 3 hours from time of death, not 3 hours online time.  There is, however, a happy bug that allows only online time to count quite a bit of the time.  It doesn't always work, though, so the guides are all taught to say 3 hours total time.  If it was a fairly new guide, he/she may not have known about the &quot;undocumented feature&quot; that allows resses after that.  Always ask the guide to at least *try* to res, even if they don't think it'll work.

<br>
With guides you need to understand that they aren't really paid and I know what it's like to have a shitty customer service job with people that expect more of you than you are allowed to do.  Just be glad we have them at all.  The guides take time out of their lives to do what they are limited to do to help you.  GMs are their own story... they get paid... which is at least in my opinion better off than the poor guides.  <br>
<br>
You all know that shit happens after patches.  And because of this they are more than likely bombarded the whole time.  You've gotta just be patient most of the time. It's not the guides fault Verant/Sony changed the way they have GMs deal with stuff...and it's not the GMs fault either.  They are just doing their job.  Now if they don't understand the differences of our server compared to others that's their own fault cause the info is out there.<br>
<br>
It's a game people.  There's no real reason to get so pissed off over a game.  Don't like the game?  Then leave... no one's keeping you here.  I just get upset when volunteer help gets dissed along with the paid help.  You've got a problem with the way Verant/Sony changed the amount of GMs we have or how they work, email and bitch them out.  Don't trash the GMs because their bosses haven't done their job right.  Get your friends to email and bitch too.  Who knows... it may or may not help... this is a company that in my opinion seems in it all for the money... lets see if they will listen to those that pay the money for the services they claim to offer us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 1007<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/29/02 3:40:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1470.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:Oh the Customer Support</span><hr size=1> GM's can get around the 3 hour rezz timer but it invovles some &quot;work&quot; for them to do it.

<br>
Guides are just unpaid volunteers. They are players just like you and me that volunteer their time so alot of them really don't know a whole lot about the game. We had one guide who didnt know the zone in to chardok was one way for example, and had some of our guild on luclin zone into a big train.<br>

You have to take (at least you used to) a fairly extensive test to be allowed to begin the guide program. You used to have a minimum amount of time you had to play the game, and would serve as a guide. I don't know about the rest of you, but the basics of the game for me were pretty much mastered the first month. The biggest complaint is that these people have no CLUE what they are talking about half the time. I don't care if they are volunteers or not. Volunteers coach thousands of teams across this country, and they know the freaking rules of the sport. These guides don't even know about the three hour ticker on the body??? I can understand the frustration guides feel. In every business across this country it's do more with less, and this is no different. I do expect them however to know the basics of this job. They are players, they should have an understanding of the game. They used too, no reason they shouldn't now.<br>

Way back at day one, there was no time limit.  People left their corpses lying about for weeks just so they could one day get a rez on them.  It was a huge laggy mess zoning into sol-b, for instance.  So, they added a 2H online limit.  Yes, online.  You could log off to preserve it and this was exactly how it was supposed to work.  Recently, this was upped to 3H.  It's always been online time and not real time.<br>

Even more recently, VI added some bugs that permit people to use an exploit to get a permanent 3H corpse; ie. the rez-timer will always say 3H and never tick down.  If there are any changes to rez-time, likely it's due to VI trying to fix this bug.  BTW, you can't get xp back from multiple rez's on such a corpse; they're typically used for bind-sight hopping and rez/coth tricks at the high end to leap deep into a raid zone and bypass yard trash. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 2:40:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1470.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.atlantic.net/~tukka/glowhand.jpg height=44 width=44></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh the Customer Support</span><hr size=1> I have no high opinion of Verant customer service, but it seems to me what the GM was asking you to do was go on another server with the same account and create a character there to attempt to log on.  This would seem a logical troubleshooting procedure, as your problems might have been one with your account or Internet connection, not your connection with Firiona Vie specifically.<br>
<br>
Though if it was a case of a GM not being familiar with Firiona Vie's ruleset, I have seen that a few times, like the time I was told by a GM that TLC applied to all items, even if they weren't MAGIC or LORE.<br>
<br>
There aren't any disclaimers or warnings anywhere on their web site or anywhere else that says that you will receive limited or restricted support like they do for the Test server and Sullon Zek, so I think we're entitled to the same level of CS as the other servers, as low as that is, and I think that they should train/verse all the GMs and Guides in FV's unique ruleset. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

<br>
If you need a world boot you can't log on to another server because the game thinks &quot;You have an active character on another server&quot; already.<br>
<br>
The ONLY solution according to verant is for you to call a buddy and have them petition for you, petition via e-mail or log onto another account and petition from a different account. E-mail is checked constantly up till 9pm PST. But as more and more players need to resort to this method of petitioning don't expect the e-mail to be read till the next day.<br>
<br>
In the end it doesnt matter though. Currently verants policy is GM's in chat will not do world boots for anyone, no matter what server you're on. Even if you could get a petition in, the average responce time is over 5 hours for a reply during peak hours.<br>
<br>
Really, the only thing you can do if you need a world boot now is turn off your computer, modem, router etc and pray.<br>
