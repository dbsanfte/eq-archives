And if so, to what extent, and is there a requirement for a &quot;reason&quot; ?<br>
<br>
My personal opinion (and this relates moreso to the ruleset of the server, and perhaps the 'RP enforcement' thread posted earlier) is that you can and should roleplay accurately -- meaning, no Dark Elves and Wood Elves fighting the good fight, hand in hand -- if at all possible, but I don't think that it should be a mortal sin if you want to play the game with friends of opposing race / class.<br>
<br>
I love roleplaying, and I love EverQuest -- but sometimes the limitations of the game don't make for the best RP experience. Yeah, go to a blue server if you want to be the best d00d in town with a set of Ravenscale armor at level 3 1/2, come to Firiona Vie if you want to roleplay; I know this. I'm not going to walk around and disrupt roleplayers with inane chitchat, but it's not a felony to /tell someone without the (OOC) tag, or to speak OOC in an isolated area with someone else. I also think that it's not that big of a deal to group with someone you personally wouldn't, if you were your character. If you find offense to this last comment, though, I have this to say; what does it really matter what other people do as long as it doesn't affect you even in the slightest bit? RPer or not, we're all human beings with personal lives, and in our spare time, should we want to play EQ (and we usually do), why do we have to be bound by unwritten laws that prohibit even the tiniest gesture of non-roleplay? In contradiction to my previous statement, say that a Dark Elf and a Wood Elf grouped together and went around fighting monsters. Who's the victim?<br>
<br>
Yeah, like I said, FV is the roleplay server; but there are more reasons than that to come here. It's not as crowded as other servers, there's a lot less twinking, and the economy is still better than the alternative(s). And yes, like I said, roleplay should be encouraged -- but just that, encouraged. It's an RP preferred server. And it's that for a reason.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is (as incoherent as it may seem) that there's a time for roleplay and a time where it doesn't really matter. If you're around people that are roleplaying, for God's sake, don't kill it with OOC. If you aren't, who cares? Given the choice, I'd rather RP; but people who verbally assault those who aren't as uber- and dedicated to the pastime as they are should think about this. Or not, I don't care. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uryaeldaggerfall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryael Daggerfall</A> at: 6/20/02 3:24:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uryaeldaggerfall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ryael Daggerfall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Looter</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/02 3:35:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2167.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How far can you push the envelope?</span><hr size=1> And by the way, in case you're up for changing my mind, I'm willing to listen provided that your response isn't just telling me how stupid I am. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/02 3:42:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2167.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How far can you push the envelope?</span><hr size=1> <br>

It would take time to overcome the perception that a typical 'blue server uber' cross race/alignment combo was really a roleplay thing, just because it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> so common to pick the 'best' characters and group them regardless of roleplay reasons on blue servers. It can be done, and wanting to play with RL friends is a decent OOC reason, if everyone has strong opinions on what they want to play.<br>
<br>
If you are willing to put in a bit of extra effort, you'll be OK. It may not be fair (life isn't, generally), but it is true that most people are going to assume the most likely scenario when they encounter such groupings. Good roleplay can change most of their minds, over time.<br>

<br>
totally unrelated, but:  tonight i logged in with my newbie ranger on my old server (zeb) and instantly put the roleplay tag on in Kelethin.  i got more roleplayed responses in the few hours i was there than i have in three days of running around on FV!<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Somtimes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I will stay in character when using /tell, but not normally.<br>
<br>
My reasoning is simple: one tool is to aid Role Play, while another tool is to aid <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> GAMEPLAY</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
/ooc, /acution, /tell, /guild, and any other channel that doesn't require my character to be in the same group, or more importantly the same zone, are gameplay tools, and RP doesn't need to be used there. Indeed, someone who always speaks using /auction, but stays in character the entire time, will annoy me FAR more then someone in my group who talks OOC all the time. The point is, there are tools for RP, and tools for gameplay.<br>
<br>
Likewise for this issue concerning grouping. I play a Halfling Paladin, and I am in a very supportive guild made up of only small races (includes Wood Elves). I never intentionally try to group with Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres, or Iksars, but I HAVE been in groups with them, and have even invited them when I was leading a group. This is a gameplay issue, period. If I CAN do without them, I do, and when I do group with them, I use emotes, etc. indicating my unease of the situation. Indeed, some of the best RPing I've encountered comes from this very situation...how boring does RP become when you simply LOVE everyone in the group? It certainly takes alot less skill.<br>
<br>
Either way, if the choice comes down to accepting that Dark Elf or that Ogre into the group, or be forced to solo or limited to hunting blues/greens, in my opinion, it isn't even a choice. That is the same thing as choosing between playing or not. If advancement isn't important to you, then to each their own. I fail to see how anyone who plays this game can think this way, but that is their choice.<br>
<br>
So, as to &quot;pushing the envelope,&quot; it is all a matter of gameplay. If you can still play the game, AND group in a manner that makes &quot;sense,&quot; GREAT! However, choosing to limit your gameplay because you &quot;don't like&quot; Dark Elves is a bit ridiculous in a game like EQ. Grouping is hard enough, and getting a GOOD group is that much more difficult; why put meaningless limits on yourself? After all, you ARE paying for this. Finally, as I stated previously, grouping with races you have a dislike for opens up FAR AND AWAY more RP opprotunites then grouping with races you would obviously have little problem with. Indeed, what is there to really RP in that situation? All you see is the &quot;good&quot; side of the character...bring in that Dark Elf Shadowknight, and prepare to see a very <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> different</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> side of this normally lovable Halfling Paladin...THAT is Role Playing...and yet we can still play the game. What a concept.<br>

Good and Evil are so tinged with preconceived notions that we are almost unable think outside those patterns. If there were three groups called the Circles, the Squares and the Lines we might have an easier time of it. <br>
<br>
No one could say &quot;There is no way a Circle could ever group with a Square, everyone knows that. If you do it you are not RP&quot; withtu looking a little foolish. You and I could rationally differ in opinion on what the motivations of a Square was. It is very hard when we all &quot;know&quot; how a good should behave. <br>
<br>
Since we all intrinsically know what &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; mean it is too easy to jump down someone's throat for departing from our own notions of how they should play.  This limits the ability to roleplay to a very narrowly constrained set of acceptable actions. The world is much to complex to be bound by these limits.<br>
<br>
EQ puts us into groups and then precludes us from doing what that group would do. What truely &quot;good&quot; person would not step in to help their local militia when an enemy attacks them. We are not only powerless to help, we are subject to punishment for doing something that might help (i.e. guard training, etc). What &quot;evil&quot; person would not find a lower level person and delight in torturing them for the pure enjoyment of it? Not only would that person be blacklisted, but it is really not even possible to do. <br>
<br>
If RP is simply defined as leaving the &quot;real&quot; world behind and jumping into EQ then most people would go along. It is only when someone attempts to impose a set of expected behaviors onto us that most of us object. If your necro wants to group with a pally go for it. Human motivations are far to complex to put into simplistic little niches like &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;, why should our toons be any different?<br>
<br>
So, if we throw off the notions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; and think of circle and square then perhaps more people will have the freedom to get outside their constrictive bounds and have some fun.<br>
<br>
Or, we can just kill giant rats.<br>

It is a RP perfered server.<br>
<br>
Yes there are a lot of variations of RP.<br>
<br>
There are *put large number here* other servers that are not RP perferred.<br>
<br>
The better economy and smaller population are because it is RP. If you wish that to change by all means encourage NON-RP and discourage those that are trying to create something more than a hack, slash, zap and my weapon is bigger than yours game.<br>
<br>
I for one dislike intensly the ease of language training now. I am neutral and a rogue so the alinment penalties hadn't affected me pesonally but does affect the way non-RPers can corupt the concept even more so I find the loss of the alignments very detrimental also.<br>

And you would be suprised how much time and effort goes into creating and shaping scenarious so good and evil characters can team up in RP.<br>
<br>
Most of us are here because we like the roleplay and we like the challange if you are not here for those reasons then why are you here?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usventyrsouldestroyer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sventyr Souldestroyer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/02 11:35:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2167.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: warning!  this may be yet another pointless aside</span><hr size=1> The fact that people see things as good and evil will always be a problem, becuase it is left to the interpratation of the individual and how his society views such things.<br>
<br>
Lets take Dark elves to them they are Good and well the Wood elves are Evil. While the Wood elves see themselves as Good and Dark elves are Evil. But who is right....<br>
<br>
Well both of them of course. To the way the Dark elf thinks his way is the right way, the Good way, the same for the Wood elf.<br>
<br>
Now I am a Wood elf would you find me grouping with a Dark elf ..... possibly if RP could justify it. Lets say I am on a mission to kill the Bandits in the Paludal Caves making travel easy on people to and from Shadowhaven I find some fellow adventures and decide to join forces with them. There happens to be a Dark elf caster (No Necro's or Shadowknights no way to justify it in RP) in the group... do I disband or should I see the larger picture.. granted he\she is a Dark elf but what is the bigger threat at the moment one Dark elf that seems to be helping me accomplish my mission or the bandits that are making travel difficult for others. &quot;The enemy of my enemy is a friend&quot; so I use the Dark elf to further my good intentions. Would we be friends? No! After all he\she is a Dark elf and my understanding of them dictates that I mistrust them so we could never truly be friends.<br>
<br>
So it is possible to group with Evil (in my case) Players. Do I do it... to date no. To me the question of Alignment grouping is not a serious consideration unlike Class grouping. I could never see myself grouping with a Necro or a Shadowknight ever. To me there is no RP justification for me to even contemplate such an alliance.<br>

<br>
I disagree entirely.  This view comes from subjective modern thoughts of good and evil.  <br>
<br>
This is not the modern world.  EQ has active Gods.  The evil Gods proudly proclaim themselves to be evil.  The races they created and the classes which draw power from them are expected to be evil.  If you are a member of this race and not evil your god will destroy you, or manipulate events so that you are never even conceived.  These are Gods after all, not factory supervisors or politicians.  Some Gods are more flexible than others.  Most aren't.  That's why the /alignement system was so rigid.  And, since Verant never publcially removed the /alignment system (only the grouping restrictions) as far as I'm concerned it's a bug and they are still there.<br>
<br>
Yes, people can RP reasons why good and evil work together.  How many times does this happen in fiction?  That Superman and Lex Luthor work together to stop a greater foe or some such.  But they can't stay friends because their views oppose too much.<br>
<br>
And, if I am wandering around and see a Paladin and a Dark Elf fighting together I'm going to react.  Would you react if you saw a police officer helping a gang of thugs rob a bank?  Probably you'd at least be shocked.  This might lead to great RP, certainly, but if I make a comment and people blow me off by giving OOC excuses then my RP environment (and hence my enjoyment) are harmed.<br>
<br>
&lt;sigh&gt;  Maybe circles, line and squares would be better... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urosemariebrambleweed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rosemarie Brambleweed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/02 2:02:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2167.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Too modern a definition</span><hr size=1> &quot;Would you react if you saw a police officer helping a gang of thugs rob a bank?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is not a very good example, however, because here the *action* is evil, regardless of who you are. Sure, you are shocked the police officer is helping, but it is because of what he is *doing* and NOT who he is &quot;grouped&quot; with.<br>
<br>
What if the gang of thugs helped the police officer *thwart* a bank robbery? They probably have ulterior motives, but in the end, the robbery WAS prevented with their help.<br>
<br>
Either way, I still insist it is a matter of RP tools vs gameplay tools. If there were something in the game (less XP, whatever) that rewarded/punished you for grouping a certain way, or for RPing or not RPing, then I would agree with you. However, there isn't. Unfortunately, this issue comes down to are you needlessly limiting your gameplay tools for some romantic notion that it will foster RPing? Can you not RP regardless, and STILL use the gameplay tools provided?<br>
<br>
In the end, of course, it is up to the individual to decide. Still, ridiculing a Paladin who groups with a Shadowknight in order to hunt in Lower Guk is silly. Maybe there are only 2 or 3 other people even in the zone. So what, you just don't play, or spend wasted downtime to go elsewhere, when all you had to do was group with the SK? Please...most of us actually have limited playtime, believe it or not...and the RPing opprotunities there are endless. Now, if that same group decides to go kill Dwarven Guards, THEN your point has merit. Regardless, there is no gameplay tool available (except faction) that can do *anything* about either situation. Should something like this be implemented? That would be GREAT! Until then, this is the game we have. Discrediting people for doing something the game allows is ridiculous in my opinion. ALL you can do is decide not to do it, and move on.<br>
<br>
To the point, behind that evil Dark Elf Necromancer is a REAL PERSON who would rather be *playing a game* they PAY for, just like ME, then worrying about who to group with because the game doesn't consider certain factors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usventyrsouldestroyer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sventyr Souldestroyer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/02 2:28:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2167.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Too modern a definition</span><hr size=1> Your opinion of things are interesting if alittle misguided Keelos.<br>
<br>
If the gods were so powerful as you state would it be possible to be able to Banish them for awhile from our plane? It may seem that they are so powerful when compared to us but in the end we make our own decisions not them. I choose where I go, I am no puppet. If my god asks\orders me to do something I have the free will to do or not to do what is asked of me. If Verant had givin us a true RP atmosphere to play in then we should be able to pick any God you would like not certian ones because of the race you picked. But they did not so we must play with the rules we have and RP what we would like to have. <br>
<br>
It is only natural to react if you saw a Paladin and Dark elf fighting together in a RP setting, but the question is what action would you take?<br>
<br>
As to your superman and lexx statement I do not understand why you used it since it is just stating what I said in my first post. That you can find common ground but that in the end we still would not be friends.<br>
