said the spider to the fly.</span><hr size=1> Like Whatever,<br>
<br>
   I need to thank you for perfectly illustrating the point I was making with this entire thread.  Sarhea caught on pretty early, but she's my twin so that's to be expected.<br>
<br>
   Before we go any further, I suppose I have to clue you in.  Ever watch Saturday Night Live?  Ever see the skits where Jon Levitz plays &quot;the thespian&quot; and does something silly, and someone asks if he's okay, and he says &quot;Acting!&quot; and they go &quot;Brilliant&quot;!<br>
<br>
   Well, that's what just happened.  I was just roleplaying a bad roleplayer.  She was kinda young, not terribly bright, but pretty nice.  She doesn't have a lot of friends at school so she enjoyed playing in a fantasy world where she could be a beautiful princess, and have some fun interaction with other people playing the game.<br>
<br>
   But when all is said and done, she was the internet equivalent of a hand-puppet.  A character in a play that I was putting on.  I only hope you can fathom the extreme irony of disparaging my roleplaying abilities, when you just spent all that time doing real life arguing with a fictional character.  Kinda akin to the 3 year old who walks up to the puppet show and yells at the dragon puppet to give the princess back.<br>
<br>
   Okay, so now that we've dragged ya kicking and screaming into the right frame of reference (with you know, the rest of us), it's time to explain what the play was about.<br>
<br>
   The play is about the fact that everyone has a different idea of what roleplaying is or isn't.  Some people find strict adherence to the established background roleplaying; they'd be offended to see a &quot;good&quot; dark elf or a half-elven princess, because these things don't really fit the provided scenery.  Other people are much more liberal in their interpretations of the backstory; it's a nice enough setting, but if they have a character concept that differs greatly from it, so be it.<br>
<br>
   You, and so many other people on this forum, consider yourselves to be the owners of Firiona Vie.  You define, in your own limited scope, what is roleplaying, what is not; who should be allowed to play on Firiona Vie, who should not. <br>
<br>
   The irony of the play is that the main character, a really poor roleplayer (comically so), is screaming and ranting herself that some non-roleplayers should leave.  It's a simple premise, I suppose.  People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  Pots shouldn't call kettles black.  You get the picture I'm sure.<br>
<br>
   Everyone comes to this server with a different idea of what they want the world to be like.  They all pay their 10 bucks a month, and they really all do have just as much right to be there as anyone else.  <br>
<br>
   Some people, the grown up ones, learn how to recognize that fact and just ignore people who aren't conforming to the roleplay experience they wanted.  They try to involve them, or assist them, but if it doesn't work out, they just shrug and go on enjoying the game.<br>
<br>
   Some other people (you would be one of these) become snide and condescending.  They consider themselves to be &quot;True&quot; roleplayers, and to hell with everyone else.  If they can't cut it, they should leave.  And if they won't leave, then Verant should throw them out the door.<br>
<br>
   You all sit up there on your high horses looking down at anyone who doesn't meet your criteria of roleplayer, and filling up this board with nonsensical &quot;@#%$ lists&quot; and other garbage.  <br>
<br>
   It's just plain elitism, and frankly, it's REALLY annoying.  If you don't like the way someone roleplays, DON'T GROUP WITH THEM.  If you think their stories are idiotic, DON'T READ THEM.  If you think their guild concept is laughable, DON'T JOIN IT.<br>
<br>
   It's not your place to decide who should be playing here, and I can't even begin to comprehend the can of worms Mythic is opening by trying to police roleplaying on their RP server.<br>
<br>
- Syllestrae Silverblade<br>
<br>
PS: My REAL in-game character is a half-dark elf bard.  She doesn't know any of her history as she was abandoned as an infant.  She grew up an outcast, on the outskirts of society.  The tier'dal consider her an abomination and an insult to their bloodline, and would kill her as soon as look at her.  The humans can easily recognize the taint of dark-elf in her skin and avoid her, if not outright torment her.<br>
<br>
   She was raised in the Qeynos aqueducts by a few of the smugglers who took her in.  Even they didn't know anything about her past as the smuggler who originally found her was eaten by a shark before Syllestrae was old enough to speak.  She was an angry youth, and has grown into an even angrier adult.  Some people think it's the evil seed of Innoruuk, the burning hate that grows within her.  Others think she just drinks too heavily and has a hard time dealing with liquour due to her elven nature.  <br>
<br>
   Whatever the case, she was easily drawn into worship of Rallos Zek, as it's only in the heat of battle, adrenaline rushing, fighting for her life, that the din in her head finally dies down.  Questions about her past, and her future, all melt away in the immediate concerns of the now, of living to see another day, another battle.<br>
