<br>
I awoke beside the campfire, the gypsies had moved on, but left their fire burning to keep me warm. The air was calm with a slight breeze skimming off the waters of the Oasis of Marr.<br>
<br>
It was not quite dawn, the sky was a deep purple with the slightest tinge of red as the sun began to creep up along the waters edge.<br>
<br>
Yawning and stretching I began to prepare for the day ahead. I reached into my pack and pulled out the tome in which contained my guild's plans for the day.Flipping to the final page, I saw that we were scheduled to find the large rock statue named Rumblecrush. I have explored the Umbral Plains many times, but his presence has always taunted me, forbidding me to draw nearer to his temple. I avoided it many times, and this time we were to charge the very place which has haunted my dreams since we first spoke of abolishing his existance from the Plains.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, lets get on with it.&quot; I thought to myself as I closed the tome and placed it back into my pack, gathering the rest of my belongings and wandering down to the waters edge. Still clad in my nightdressings, I bend down at the shore and scooped up some of the cool refreshing water, splashing it on my face to awaken my senses. I needed to have a clear head and be focused if I am to be at my best. As I knelt, I felt as if I were being watched. I shivvered a bit and glanced around cautiously, but no one was there. &quot;Not even the Sand Giants are up this early...&quot; I shrugged.<br>
<br>
Scooping up another handful of water, I drank cautiously, still feeling eyes upon me, this time from under the waters below..... <br>

<br>
Going for my morning swim in the Oasis of Marr, I noticed a familliar face along the beach. She was one of my guildmates, one of my best priestesses, and one of my best friends.<br>
<br>
'What would Caballis and Thule think, me being such good friends with a human?' I thought to myself. 'Bah! I have forgotten that life a long time ago! Much more has become important to me.<br>
<br>
'I chuckled to myself as I swam closer. ' Lets give her a little start this morning.' Grinning under the water, I emerged only enough so my eyes were above the surface. I swam slowly closer, mocking my inferior reptillian brothers that inhabit this part of the Oasis. My tail propelling me ever so slightly with ease through the water. <br>
<br>
I approached from the side, she was turned with her back almost to me. 'This is far too easy..' <br>
<br>
I waited for just the right moment, still emerged as much as possible in the shallow water, I reached out one scaly claw and lightly scratched her exposed back..... <br>
<br>
~Bako Emberfist<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Restoria: <br>
<br>
I felt a light touch to my back.<br>
<br>
I let out a scream that would pierce the God's ears, and whirlled around falling to my bottom. <br>
<br>
&quot;Damnit Bako! You nearly made me jump out of my skin!&quot; I exclaimed, smacking my dear lizard friend on the arm playfully.<br>
<br>
He laughed heartily. Grinning always looked odd on a lizard, but Bako did it well. &quot;I'm sorry Rest, you were just such an easy target.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you doing here anyway?&quot; I asked as I gathered my armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just going for a little swim to clear my mind for today.&quot; He said, concerned as he handed me one of my bags.<br>
<br>
I pulled on my boots and nodded. We both knew he would be the first to step into the temple and that he might not return.<br>
<br>
I finished gathering my things, a strange silence between us said all that was needed about our concerns for the day. We walked through the oasis and crossed into the grassy area surrounding the druid ruins in the Southern Desert. <br>
<br>
I tried to change the subject to move forward. &quot;Gauging from the position of the sky, he should be here any moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bako nodded and we sat in silence awaiting the arrival of the Champion of Magic.<br>
<br>
A flash of light burst from the sky and out plopped a pudgy halfling with orange hair and a disturbingly reflective shield. Disturbing, because the sun was placed in just the right angle and it reflected right into our eyes blinding us temporarily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Kurley... can you point that shield elsewhere?&quot; I winced.<br>
<br>
&quot;Haha! Sure thing... I just got done having it polished.. sure did a splendid job, didnt they?&quot; He said, as he turned and showed off the shield again, blinding us.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, great.. &quot; I sighed, sqinting more obviously, but it was Bakos lizard eyes, barely noticeable at all now, the slits nearly a straight line that made the halfling realized how he was torturing us. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oops! Did it again.&quot; He giggled, now getting a sadistic thrill from it. &quot;You two ready? I have more pickups to do yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, ready.&quot; I patted him on the head. Bako was too busy desciphering the notes Kurley had handed him regarding the observations he had made on our target to even acknowledge.<br>
<br>
Kurley began chanting and soon a portal opened beside us. I tugged Bakos tail to get him to look up from his notes and step through the portal. <br>
<br>
~Restoria Fallenheart<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bako:<br>
<br>
'Ouch! That's sensitive!' I mock shouted standing up and walking through the portal.<br>
<br>
We entered the wastes known as The Dreadlands, a place infested with drovalargs, yetis and mountain giants. The castle of Venril Sathir looming just through the icy tunnel. 'Poor Venril, he will always cower in my presence now.' smiling smugly to myself with no fear whatsoever inside.<br>
<br>
I motioned for Restoria to follow as we walked the few paces from the ruins to the spires. Arriving at the spires, I see that the rest of my officers have arrived at the Scion before me. 'Gah! I'm late. Now I have to listen to that damn wood elf school me on the Golden Rule.' I thought to myself. 'Bah! he has the Spirit of the Wolf at his disposal.<br>
<br>
''It's about time, lizard!' Cloude exclaimed as he reached out to shake my hand.<br>
<br>
'Yeah, yeah, yeah, dont start with me Ranger!' I sneered.<br>
<br>
Rosiel laughed and nodded in our direction, waving her arms and blessing us with the Spirit of Bih Li.<br>
<br>
I shook my head, &quot;Thanks, I could have used that a while ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;We collected our shards from the Scion and waited for the signal that the spires were about to open the portal. <br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  A mystic voice shouts, &quot;The spires will become active in 3 minutes, prepare accordingly if you wish to make the journey to Luclin.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The black hooded figure loomed in the shadow of the spire. He stepped into the light, revealing a spectre. Reaching out his bony fingers, he touched my hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;How are you today milady?&quot; He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Humle, you are much more attractive with skin, my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
An eerie laugh erupted from the cloaked spectre and a few words were uttered as the floating skeleton flopped to the ground and in a puff of smoke a friendly little gnome appeared in his place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you.. Gods, I hate that spectre form!&quot; I exclaimed and patted the gnome on his balding head.<br>
<br>
He chuckled and handed me a small purse filled with tiny green gems. &quot;Ahh, peridots.. thank you.. I was meaning to pick some of those up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not a problem, I had to get a few things myself and figured with the way you spend those things you might need a few more.&quot; He smiled.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  A mystic voice shouts, &quot;One minute till teleportation to Luclin, be prepared to step into the spires if you wish to make the journey.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  the Kunark Spires begin to cast a spell.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Instantly a cloud forms around the spires and it feels as if we are spinning. After a few turns we settle and the aura fades. We are standing in the Nexus.<br>
<br>
I take out a few blank parchments and an inkwell from my tinkered bag. I dip my claw into the ink and begin to scribe notations upon them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here are the strategies for today's raid.&quot; I hand the parchment notes to each of my officers. They all take them and look them over, nodding in agreement as they turn back to me. Gathered in a circle down the steps I see many more of my guildmates, engrossed in conversations of their own.<br>
<br>
A brother monk and fellow lizard spies us first and runs up to me, pulling on my arm and motioning for me to step away from the others for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I do it, Bako?&quot; Qixx whispers to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do what?&quot;&quot;I want to be the one to get him, the one to enter the temple first.&quot; he replied, his eyes wide with anticipation of my answer.<br>
<br>
I tilted my head to the side in thought, my eyes shutting momentarily as I contemplated the scenarios in my head. 'He has become a powerful monk, but he lacks the experience of pulling... Especially one of this magnitude.' I shrugged. 'Well, he has to learn sometime.'<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me a moment, Qixx.&quot; I said and motioned for him to stay where he was as I reapproached my officers to discuss his request.<br>
<br>
A few nods reflected their approval, and I turned to the anxious monk. His eyes grew wide at the sight of my glance. I nodded once in his direction and he lept, nearly stumbling off the steps. <br>
<br>
~Bako Emberfist<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Restoria:<br>
<br>
I giggled slightly watching the excited Qixx bound down the steps toward the others.. It was obvious he was anxious to tell the others.<br>
<br>
I turned and looked down the other set of steps and saw a figure sitting alone at the bottom step, sharpening his blades. Even with his back to me, I knew it was him.<br>
<br>
&quot;My husband!&quot; I exclaimed at the top step.<br>
<br>
He stood, turning around with a smile. Like that of a giddy child I slid down the banister and he caught me in his arms. He placed me gently on the ground and hugged me tightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I missed you.&quot; He smiled, kissing me gently.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Krit, would you cut that out already?&quot; Gore teased.<br>
<br>
Kritical laughed, turning toward the approaching lizard, still with one arm around me. &quot;Bah, you're one to talk, scaled one. You and your 'harem'.. Don't even give me your mock modesty!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't know lizard's could blush, Gore.&quot; I chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gah!&quot; He exclaimed. &quot;Lets just get there.&quot;<br>
<br>
~Restoria Fallenheart<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bako:<br>
<br>
I saw Kritical and Gore walking up the stairs toward me, and I nod, as they are not just my guildmates, they are also my friends. <br>
<br>
The Nexus is now filled with many of my guildmates and I shout for us to depart.<br>
<br>
&quot;Meet you all there, let's head out!&quot;<br>
<br>
As if it were a race, a rush of lizards, humans, dark elves, gnomes, and even the occasional halfling and elf fled into the Netherbian Lair. This area of Luclin posing no threat to this force.<br>
<br>
The stream of people wearing the insignia of Fire and Fury fled through the tunnels and hallways knowing exactly where they were going. This had been familliar stomping grounds for many in these groups, and we soon were gathered en masse at the entrance to the Umbral Plains. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are 27 strong today.&quot; I mused with my officers. &quot;What are your thoughts?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think we can do it.&quot; Rosiel and Cloude said in unison.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm nervous, but I think we can pull it off.&quot; Restoria uttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lets do it.&quot; said Humle.The pale faced token high elf broke the silence with what has become his battlecry. &quot;WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!&quot; Still unnerving coming from a priest though.<br>
<br>
&quot;And it's a good day to die!&quot; Cassimus shouted back, passing out summoned rings and bracelets.<br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare! The battle is immanent!&quot; I shouted.<br>
<br>
A flurry of chanting and spell casting followed, as the crowds became blessed by different protections, talismans and enhancements to increase the statistics in our favor.<br>
<br>
I assigned each person their duties and patted Qixx on the shoulder. &quot;Careful out there my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
Qixx nodded and inhailed deeply, swallowing the last of his anxieties and sighed with a final calming breath. <br>
<br>
~Bako Emberfist<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Restoria:<br>
<br>
I laid a final blessing on Qixx as he sped away aiming for the temple to pull the large rock lord.<br>
<br>
He ran right up to the temple with abandon, no fear visible in his scaled stern expression. <br>
<br>
The tension mounted for those of us outside. A single drop of perspiration ran down the side of my face as I waited for his return with baited breath. 'Karana, protect him. I am fearful I cannot.' I thought silently. I rarely doubted myself, but this was no ordinary foe. He was the biggest challenge we as a guild had faced thus far.<br>
<br>
I looked around at my friends, my family, gathered beside me poised for the battle that would test our abilities. I stepped closer to my husband, giving his gloved fist a final squeeze and he nodded. He was in 'battle mode' now, his grip never relaxing off his gleaming swords at his side.<br>
<br>
To much of Qixx's surprise, the large rock beast known as Rumblecrush came storming out of his temple.. alone, as if he had forseen our coming. He appeared angred, and rightly so as our intentions were to rid him of his existance in this realm.<br>
<br>
Gliding quickly through the blades of grass as if on air, Qixx lured him around the corner to the hoarde of Fury awaiting him. <br>
<br>
~Restoria Fallenheart<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bako:<br>
<br>
The ground trembled beneath us as the creature drew near.<br>
<br>
Everyone stood poised in preparation of his arrival. The sky darkened as his large form took shape, blacking out the light. Qixx fell to the ground at the feet of our newest monk, and Tasker engaged him with a whirlwind of strikes to distract him from those who were weakening him.<br>
<br>
I lowered my head as the young monk fell to the ground crushed under the rock beasts feet.<br>
<br>
I nodded at Kritical and he engaged without hesitation as his weapons clanked against the rocky mass.<br>
<br>
An arrow whirred by my head, impailing the monster with deadly accuracy. I turned in the direction of the shooter. Nodding in approval at Cloude, for I knew of no one else with such precision in archery.<br>
<br>
&quot;Charge!&quot; I exclaimed. The sound of weapons unsheathed and chizzling into the granite of the beast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now YOU die!&quot; Gore exclaimed as he rushed into battle. <br>
<br>
~Bako Emberfist<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Restoria:<br>
<br>
I watched tearfully as the youngest of our monks was crushed under the rubble that the rock beast crushed him with.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm giving Kritical da juice.&quot; Kzan stated, waving his rattlesnake topped staff in his direction.<br>
<br>
Then came the nod that made my heart skip a beat. My husband was to go next. Without even a glance back, he rushed from my side, his swords high in the air, swinging swiftly at what seemed to be an indestructable foe.<br>
<br>
I began chanting immediately, hoping my heals and those of my fellow priests would be enough to save him.<br>
<br>
Just then, Rumblecrush stopped swinging.. or so I thought. He then lazily swung again, missing Kritical in time for a heal to cure his wounds completely.<br>
<br>
I knew exactly why the large statue had become so lethargic. Tears welled up in my eyes with gratitude as I looked at Rosiel, who was lowering her arms as she had finished casting. I mouthed the words 'Thank you'. and she nodded, noting that she had done nothing more than her job.<br>
<br>
&quot;Charge!&quot; Bako exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now YOU Die!&quot; shouted Gore through the clanking of steel against stone.&quot;I'm out!&quot; Shouted Kritical and my husband was safely backed from the beast as the stone's gaze turned toward the lizard 'stomping' his foot to get his attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;The Kerg is STOMPING on Rumblecrush!&quot; shouted the lizard, and my attention turned to chanting spells of protection and healing him.<br>
<br>
Even with all we could do to weaken the stony beast, he was still incredibly powerful and some of my friends could not be saved. <br>
<br>
~Restoria Fallenheart<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bako:<br>
<br>
Seeing so many of my friends fall at my side, even though we had done everything exactly as planned made me have doubts that we could defeat such an enemy.<br>
<br>
Only a third of those who had come to encounter the rock beast were still standing.<br>
<br>
Just when I thought we had done all we could and we were going to have to retreat...<br>
<br>
The dark figure in the back arose, fire dancing on his fingertips he chanted and launched the biggest ball of flame I have ever witnessed. As the sorcerer struck the beast, flaming stones flew everywhere, raining dust upon those within range. The critical blast forcing Rumblecrush to unleash flurries upon Fuvi, striking him down.<br>
<br>
That was the opportunity we needed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Finish him!&quot; I shouted, flying into the air to kick at the battered hunk of stone remaining.<br>
<br>
With everyone pushing the limits of their magics and training, the rock beast known as Rumblecrush fell in a landslide of rubble and dust. <br>

<br>
When the dust settled, I looked around, surveying the damage. <br>
<br>
Kritical picked me up and hugged me, setting me back down and joining the other standing members in victory. <br>
<br>
I knelt down, sifting through the ashes and dust for the remains of the fallen, chanting prayers of Reviviacense to restore the lives of those who gave it for the cause.<br>
<br>
&quot;Was it all worth it?&quot; I thought to myself.<br>
<br>
Just then, Cloude knelt beside what once was the head of this gruesome foe. He dug through the rubble, and picked up 3 items.. the bounty of our victory.<br>
