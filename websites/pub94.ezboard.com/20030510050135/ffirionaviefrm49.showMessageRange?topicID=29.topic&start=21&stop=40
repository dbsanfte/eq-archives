Lasgalen's is new, recent, so how would it have been taken to task with the others?  I remember the dead horse uproar about Apep's and the nipple almost showing (and then looked for the nipple cause I missed it at first).  You know what... there is less showing in Lasgalen's sig, just the &quot;impression&quot; the guy behind is naked (but there is actually a thin line on his hip indicating a g-string perhaps.  So why is his more offensive than Apep's?  <br>
<br>
Oh... and Lasgalen's sig does -not- show any &quot;private&quot; parts, but a penis instead of a man's head (or on his head or whatever) does.  THAT is the difference between those two.<br>
<br>
I don't see how there is a double standard except a homosexual image might offend those who are rabidly hyper insecure hetrosexual.  Oh wait... those same people might not be offended at all if it were two females showing a similar amount of skin (but boobies covered).  THAT is a double standard. <p><br>

I find your Deux Coeurs sig horribly offensive!  Clearly, the swarthy looking assling is grasping the golden dragon's berries with his left hand...or worse yet, giving him a DHJ - the latter being more likely as the dragon's head is reared back in pleasure whilst it's left arm flails akimbo.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the lovely elven lassie appears to be joining in and fondling the dragon in a hitherto unknown reptilian erogenous zone...I say appears because it is merely suggestive and you cannot clearly see what in fact she is molestizing - but she IS doing something dirty!<br>
<br>
I would rename the sig DeuxDHJ or DeuxCootchiecoo...now there is your DeuxStandard.<br>

<br>
Bullshit.  People were flaming FnF / Reso for coming to FV with no interest in roleplaying.  No one ever gave a damn that they were raiding, it's something everyone who plans on being high level at some point plans on doing.<br>

<br>
Um, earning a living?  Tradeskills have always been a nice alternative to money making than raiding.  It also makes a viable source of income for people who hit the high levels but want to play in smaller tight-knit guilds -vs- joining uber ones.  Can just farm a few items here and there, and hang out with those ya like to RP with.  <br>
<br>
I don't recall anyone going off on &quot;Farmers&quot;.  I recall people going off on Camp stealers, kill stealers, etc, but that's an attitude, and not intrinsic to hunting for treasure.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> when a few people first sold a few Hate items (and lemme tell you how hate gear is crap on the scale of gear) people flipped out about how wrong it was.

<br>
Bullshit again.  The &quot;People&quot; that flipped out = you.  The only people really throwing shit around about planar sales were Reso &amp; FnF (generally lobbing the insults at eachother and AS).  The rest of us were hunting in Paw and crap, what the F*** did we care if you were selling it?   Hell, I bought some myself.<br>

<br>
Open raids still go on.  And a lot of people who participate in the open raids still have no intention of joining the ranks of FnF / Reso.  You guys do a damn fine job of taking down big mobs, but I mean no offense when I say that I doubt either guild is the pinnacle of the FV experience in most people's minds.<br>

<br>
Did you ever consider that the people complaining tend not to run into the uber-crowd as often?  And it's nice that you assume that the few people arguing about it in Soapbox represent the entire RP community.  And while I'm mature enough not to be &quot;driven crazy&quot;, yes, I think all the names you listed above are stupid ass names for an RP server (some worse than others, I didn't even get the Restoria thing at first).<br>

<br>
This is Jebbar's highest level character ever.  Syll is the highest I've ever gotten a character.  It's not surprising that some people who came here to RP, and created (to them) very successful characters, want to participate in parts of the game they've only heard about on their old servers.  It shouldn't be surprising that some of them apply if they're not having any luck forming raid-level forces within the RP community.<br>

Because I can turn on NYPD blue and see male butts.  I can't turn on any channel on basic cable and see giant penises.  The closest you can come is educational shows on TLC/PBS/DC about human sexuality.<br>

It's not about who Xarp is, it's about posting links to X-rated humor on the website.  Xarpolis is more than F***ing welcome to e-mail Lasgalen and ask him to photoshop him up a homoerotic masterpiece of a signature to use.  As long as it's not worse than other sigs or what's on Cable what the f*** do I care?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Everyone started flaming him and /ignoring AS as soon as xarp posted that first recruitment about not RPing. Everyone used that to hate that guild and that person. Like i said above Reso's RP section is 31 posts deep ~ guess what they aren't RPers, they just never told you that, so it's ok with you. FnF didn't have an RP section till Ayida joined, and she's the one who used it most, there's like 1 post from a few other members. guess what, FnF doesn't RP, they just never said it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
FNF &amp; Reso basically said &quot;We're not about RP but we respect it&quot;.  AS basically said &quot;RP SuXXoRs&quot;.  I'm sorry if ya fail to see the distinction.  For the record though, I never really had any problems in-game with Awakened Souls.  I thought whoever was your Public Relations officer sucked ass at their job, but I got along with everyone fine in game.<br>
<br>
What problems I have with Xarpolis stem from the way he acts on the boards, doesn't have squat to do with the guild he was in.<br>

<br>
I am uncertain how you are defining &quot;double standard&quot; here, and even more uncertain how you are applying it.  You've already stipulated that there are other erotic signatures, some even used by moderators of this board.  It seems to me that the double standard would be if the moderators asked me to remove my signature when some of them use signatures that are erotic in nature themselves.<br>
<br>
I'm even further uncertain why you've singled me out in particular.  Again, you've stipulated that others, including moderators, have erotically-charged signatures.  Why pick mine out specifically?<br>
<br>
Even more, I think you're just dead-wrong about your assumptions about my relationship with the moderators and the administrators of this board.  I do not believe any of them would allow me to get away with anything they would not allow others to get away with.  I do not believe there is any kind of favortism on their part working to my advantage, as you imply.<br>
<br>
This signature is not pornographic in nature.  Shocking?  To some.  Offensive?  To some.  Erotic?  Definitely.  But if you think it's pornographic, then you haven't seen pornography.  Unfortunately for me, I cannot demonstrate the difference without knowingly crossing the line.<br>
<br>
While there's implied nudity in my signature, there's no actual nudity.  There is in others', yet I don't see you objecting.  Is that because actual female nudity is acceptable to you while implied male nudity is not?<br>
<br>
Who has the double standard here? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/LasSig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

If it were not a drawing, but &quot;real life&quot; (remember that?), it'd be a very rigid piece of leather creating the illusion of size.<br>
<br>
However, even if that weren't the case, it's not all that impossible.  If things are flipped up instead of down, they tend to look bigger--much bigger--than they are, even in a normal state. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 2087<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/27/02 10:16:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  re: Sig</span><hr size=1> It's a potato.<br>

See, the angel was like &quot;Wow, look at that package!&quot; and was so impressed, he abandoned the heavens, stripped off all his clothes, and headed down to hell to get some action.<br>

<br>
You know this is exactly what Lasgalen wants to see happen. He gets to feel like the martyer while still managing to force his opinions down everyone else's trhoat. He gets to apprear to be injured while preaching his intolerance (not a personal attack, more of a comment on all the links, books and quotes he has posted over the months). He continues to practice posting-intolerance to any that will not completely conform to his views.<br>
<br>
He promises not to come into the soapbox but like a sad, cowardly lurker he pops up all the time. I am sick of his whining and complaining about being misunderstood and picked on. JUST STOP COMING HERE LIKE YOU KEEP PROMISING<br>
<br>
Sorry to the rest of you, but I just popped.<br>
