<br>
The raid post stated Need Before Greed.  In addition, I was asked in the raid channel what the loot policy was and I reiterated that it was Need Before Greed.  Thus, it should have been clear to all who rolled that it was Need Before Greed.  I was not asked for an explanation of what Need Before Greed meant, and there was one item that nobody rolled on which was awarded to Cyraen  because they were the only one who needed the item.  Thus, at the time, it appeared to me that everyone knew the meaning of the term Need Before Greed. <br>
<br>
As to awarding the shield to a warrior, there is a rune IV effect on the shield (I love clicky things meself) and sometimes warriors like to play pally and bash things with shields to interrupt spell casting.  Did I think Knor would use it everyday and at all times?  No.  Did I think that he would use it?  Yes, otherwise I would not have allowed him to claim the shield in the first place.  <br>
<br>
Although there would certainly seem to be &quot;more need&quot; among other classes, I don't think that a loot policy can be that refined on an Open Raid.  (Syll has an excellent post on &quot;inventing fake need&quot; in another thread that is relevant to this point).  For example, we looted a Mithril Torque (+13 WIS and INT) and I (as a struggling smith who is convinced that high str does not help skill ups) rolled on the item because I need a great set of INT gear to help me skill up (195 and climbing).  I recently spent over 1k revamping all my INT gear and the best I could do on the neck slot was a +7int necklace.  Perhaps other classes would complain that a human warrior doesn't &quot;need&quot; the item as much as they do; but after spending thousands and thousands of pp to skill up in smithing (and other trade skills), believe me I &quot;need&quot; this neck piece. (Note to Jarkell: NO THIS IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELL ME SOMETHING <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  If this were a guild only event, the Mithril Torque would have likely been awarded to another class.  However, on an Open raid, it seems the best we can do it state that it is Need Before Greed (or Can And Will Use) and rely on the honor of those involved.<br>
<br>
Open raids are (among other things) learning experiences for all involved.  As the leader of this raid, I have learned that it is perhaps better to call the loot policy Can And Will Use (to make it clear that only those who can and will use the item are allowed to roll on the item) rather than Need Before Greed.  Perhaps I can avoid a similar misunderstanding in the future by using this term instead.  Similarly, it is possible that Knor (and others) will learn from this experience.  For example, last week a member of Tribulation misunderstood the meaning of Need Before Greed and also rolled on (and won) a Mithril Torque.  After announcing that he had won the roll in guild chat and asking if anyone could use it, we informed this person that where the policy is Need Before Greed, you should only roll on the item if you can and will use the item.  This person returned the Mithril Torque to the raid leader, Tarin of Clan Twisted.  We all make mistakes (especially those who are new to Open raids) and before we crucify Knor and deem him &quot;Knor the Loot Whore,&quot; we should give him (and his guild) a chance to set things right.<br>
<br>
If Knor misunderstood the meaning of Need Before Greed, I am sure the posts on this board will serve to inform him of the meaning of this term.  Moreover, if he refuses to return the shield or invents a &quot;need&quot; (such as I &quot;need&quot; the pp), I am sure the damage to his reputation will also teach him a lesson.  <br>
<br>
Upon learning of this incident, I posted a message on Clan Twisted's board and asked them for their position on this matter.  I am awaiting their response and will keep everyone up-to-date on this issue.<br>

If it happens in the future, I'd recommend hanging on to it until you can ask the raid leader what to do with it.  They might just tell ya to sell it, but they might ask ya to hold it so they can add it to the treasure pool on the next raid they run.

The Naggy raid was not &quot;sponsored by&quot; Clan Twisted.  As you know (from attending the Naggy raid), I lead the Nagafen raid and I am a member of Tribulation.  There was no official &quot;sponsor&quot; of the Naggy raid; I simply hosted it for the open community as Findra (also a member of Tribulation) has done in the past.  I called, scheduled, organized, lead, and paid for all peridots used on the raid.  If Clan Twisted was &quot;sponsoring&quot; this raid without my knowledge, can I send CT the bill for the peridots? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is only a joke, Knor and CT; I use some of the lower end drops to pay for the cost of the peridots as I announced in the original post.<br>
<br>
Two small points:  First, I assume the &quot;lost corpses&quot; you are talking about are those of your guildmembers who were not in attendance at the raid; there were only two deaths when we took down Nagafen and there were certainly no lost corpses that needed to be found at that time.  Second, I attended the Vox Raid that Clan Twisted hosted directly after the Naggy raid and did not receive a tell from you about the shield.<br>
<br>
At any rate, Knor please send me a tell in game and let me know where we can meet to so that you can give me back the shield.  I will go through my logs and find out who had the second highest roll and award it to them.<br>

<br>
Seriously - I agree that (besides DKP which don't work for open raids) it's probably the best and only system that works, but here's just another case of abuse that makes people's faith in the system weaken.<br>
<br>
NBG isn't about trying to see if you can rationalize a tiny bit of need so you can get in on an item, it's about thinking &quot;Hmm, if I win this item, will I be F-ing over classes or players that could use this item better than me?&quot;. Rolling on a big INT or WIS item to raise your skills is total BS, but since it's hybrid only, it really doesn't matter (except I heard they added Beastlord as a useable class on the Torque which would make thsy an instant BST award every time, but can't verify that change). If an Eyepatch dropped on a Vox raid and any non-caster classes tried to roll (yes, I mean PAL, SHD, RNG and whatever) I would have a serious problem with that no matter what screwed up reasoning they presented as to why they &quot;absolutely needed&quot; that +INT +WIS item over the needs of casters.<br>
<br>
Kinda like someone rolling on a Berserker's BP when they have a Vindi BP so they can complete their fashion collection.<br>

Do you see anyone saying &quot;give me my shield&quot;? No, people are upset because you rolled on an item you were not even going to try and use, and took the chance for someone who would use it away from them. And how exactly were people who found out you were selling the shield hours after the raid supposed to contact you while you are AFK? If you really wanted to help the raid leaders with costs, why not just give them the shield back at the time? Maybe you thought you'd save them some time in the bazaar? And to make things clear, i wasnt at the raid so the loot itself is not relevant to why i posted this. I dont like seeing people abuse those who take the time and effort to do open raids. <br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT - seems someone else at the CT raid decided to sell nbg loot too - very sad indeed.<br>

Over the past months, you shuld know that if you sell open raid gear you'll end up here, on the rant forum.  No matter whether you were in the right or wrong, that part is irrelevant.  Your rep will be pounded here, on the soapbox.  You guys should know this by now, come on...  I'm not here to discuss whether what Knor did was right or wrong, because i wasn't there to know the details, and frankly, it's none of my business...  What I am here to say is... if you are going to sell open raid gear...wait..here it comes! PUT IT ON A FREAKING ALT FIRST!!!  Otherwise, dont complain about your rep being chiseled away here, because you *KNOW* that's what's going to happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udaliondveldrin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalion DVeldrin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I put the inky in kinky</span><br>  Posts: 456<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 5:48:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.animationlibrary.com/Animation11/Animals/Rabbits/Realistic_bunny_2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Knor the loot whore</span><hr size=1> /agree Tzaroth. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=209679><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/teneel/Dalion.jpg></a><br><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/teneel/Nagafen2.jpg><br> Harbinger of Vengeance<br><i> ~* He who follows his heart will find that it will bleed *~</i><br><a href=http://www.ebonstorm.com/index><b>Knight of Ebon Storm</b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukathatlafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KathatlaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 5:55:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hey now syl</span><hr size=1> &quot;Bronze Breastplate of DOOM&quot;<br>

13 wisdom is a LOT of wisdom for a ranger or paladin and 13 intell would do wonders for a shadowknight as well.
