<br>
Anyways, I started playing again last week to check out Ldon, and make sure my account wasn't deleted. And well, EQ has gone through alot of changes, but the one change for the worse I see, that everquest is no longer hard. I mean, it used to take a WEEK to level, now, I can easily get a level a day 60+ or 2 aaxp points, in SUCKY pickup groups with no class balance. <br>
<br>
Does it irk anyone else that SoE has basically dumbed down the entire game to nothing now. Everquest no longer has any kind of skill, all it is now is a game of time... the more time you play, the better your stuff, now with Ldon that is set in stone. No longer if you know what your doing, and play better than any other person will you be able to be one of &quot;the best&quot; all it comes down to now is time. All the high end raids now have timers, because the stuff is TOO EASY now. <br>
<br>
Tanks having 10k HP, casters having 7k, Hello what has happened to EQ,  has it devolved into nothing but a giant timesink that you pay for ? <br>
<br>
Mana is no longer even a worry. I remember when I played a cleric in the end game(pre SoL) I had to time my dam cheals to get the most possible healing and mana effieciency. Now, nothing like that even remotely comes close to that, clerics fire off a bazillion different heal spells anytime they want without having to worry about not having enough mana. Every character is so stacked to the gills with HP items that wizards have 4000 unbuffed HP, remember when freaking furor and only the big guild warriors had this much?<br>
<br>
No longer can the casual players compete with the heavy players, because now more than ever time <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>TIME = EQUIPMENT/SKILL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Sure, it was always like that, where the people who played the most would have the best, but for the average guy who wasn't in the uber guild of the server, if you were good, and knew the quests, knew the zones, and weren't a nooby you could compete with those guys by using your knowledge.<br>
<br>
Now, with LDoN that has been taken completely away. Basically now all it comes down to is, how much you play, and what items you buy with your points. Whats even more sad is that now, those adventures are an utter joke of ease. I mean honestly, these aren't dungeon crawls, they are time sinks with EXP that is so easy to get. Dungeon crawls have a sense of danger, this is just a sick joke, a half assed unbalanced group of schmoes, with at least 1 healer can easily beat any of these adv, time is the only thing that even comes close to defeating anyone.<br>
<br>
Maybe its just me, but who else would like to see actual PLAYER SKILL have some visible effect on the game. Right now the only thing that matters is time and to be honest I don't think anyone should have to spend 40 hours a week playing this game to be able to compete. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=irexes>Irexes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scythe matters<br>

<br>
original EQ level 50 ! go ! remeber the nasty spell quests that ook all your friends to do ? and research and ..<br>
<br>
then there was Kunark , huge time sink leveling , then VP key quest, and epics<br>
<br>
then Velious , VT key , pharming  ToV over and over and over and over.<br>
<br>
Luclin oh look huge AA to grind though then more key quests and weapons to be made.<br>
<br>
PoP more levels sure they are easy just to open up the old world content and seal players away from it, oh and more AA !<br>
and ! more key quests and flagging.<br>
<br>
Gunthak ? what the  hell was that ? trade skills . no time sink there<br>
<br>
LDON 300 wins to max out your stone, extra upgrade bits for your current equitment, and a bigger draw for a balanced group to be able to actually get mobs , not a problem on this server but else where ?<br>
<br>
Sure it's a time sink, the game is a time sink we sit on our rear have some fun and hopefully get our 12$ a month woth of enjoyment out of it.<br>
<br>
but just like every level 50 when kunark came out if you want to compete in the rat race you'd better atleast be on the same playing field as the folks you're trying to complete with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tiestooakey>Tiesto Oakey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadowknight who says Ni!</span><br>  Posts: 403<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/03 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4101.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So like, anyone remember when EQ was actually hard?</span><hr size=1> Wow, thank you for adding something constructive to my thread.<br>

Ya what is this competition you are talking of?<br>
<br>
The leader board for LDoN?<br>
<br>
<br>
IMO, the game was fun before many of the changes, and the game is more fun after the last few expansions.<br>
<br>
IMO, there was so much more downtime before SoL and the portal system it brought, then PoP and the book portal system it brought.<br>
<br>
Though you didn't mention it, I welcome the transportation systems, and I welcome the alternative ways to earn very nice loot than raiding (LDoN).<br>
<br>
Yes points are earned faster for higher level players, and it would make sense that it would considering some of the very nice gear you can buy with a decent amount of points.<br>
<br>
EQ was always a time sink.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have not mentioned how &quot;hard&quot; the game was. because honestly, the game was not a &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; thing.  <br>
<br>
Coordinating people for a raid and trying to keep peace with people are the hardest things for many in EQ.  Sure there are many who do not know how to play there class.  There always were.<br>
<br>
None of this has anything to do with the workings of the game, but rather communication and organization with strangers, and the ability to put up with people who do not know how to play their class.<br>
<br>
It is game, sometimes its more fun than other times.<br>
<br>
Perhaps they raised the reward systems so that you can get better gear with less periods of waiting and camping.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you, a larger factor to the prevalence of really nice gear to lower level players is the lack of No-Drop on this server, and not what you consider &quot;dumbing down the game&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you really like the old zones so much, they are still there.  You don't have to play LDoN or PoP.<br>
<br>
And believe it or not skill (or cooperation) are still needed to do well in LDoN.  If you don't play your class well or don't work well with your group, you may get your group killed or not complete your mission in time.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I had a Larraque picture to stamp this thread.  I would dub this rant, weak and not very well thought out.<br>
<br>
You are pissed off at something, but if the changes are that crappy, you also have the option not to play.<br>
<br>
I personally don't miss taking boats to continents, and spending hours or days on a quest to get a crappy weapon that is underrated for the creatures you should be killing at your level.<br>
<br>
I believe the game is moving away from that, but I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
I like change.  It's what keeps life interesting and fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysteweave>Mysteweave</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hug the Druid!<br>

And, it took one whole minute between each hit for your screen to scroll by because it was so lagged, so that by the time you saw the second hit, you were probably already dead because you know your damn whimpy command (Hard coded command that made you run out of the room when you were below 50 pct hp) probably didn't work, and you had no time to run out of the room anyhow because you know the monster's actually probably hit you 10 times though you've only seen two.<br>
<br>
Stop your bitching :P I'm so sick of it.<br>
If you don't like it, don't friggan play it. Enough people get enough enjoyment out of it, that we don't need to hear the whining about the good ole days. I really, honestly and truely think that a lot of people's memories are fuzzed and hazed out, and they only remember the good stuff, and not all the problems there were.<br>
<br>
Sure, I fondly remember my first mud: Pixiemud (Hiya Syll <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) But that doesn't mean I want to play it. It was so lagged, and so buggy, but the people were cool, we were all just in college for the most part, and we didn't know the meaning of the word: Addiction to internet, yet.<br>

All the high end raids now have timers, because the stuff is TOO EASY now&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree. Even augmented, nothing buyable competes with Time gear. I've seen the 100/100 bp from Takish with a hp mod in each of its 3 slots for a 210 bp. Very impressive, but my usual tank has an unmodified 250 hp breastplate, with almost twice it's ac, an aggro gaining effect, and probably will mod it to 290 or higher. No player without at least elemental gear is going to be able to augment themselves to be on par with someone heavily Time geared, and that'll stay the same until Time-level guilds start beating the hard LDoN raids.<br>
<br>
As for things being too easy- raid forces can be worn down, and are, but not in the same ways they were back in velious. As a cleric, mana can get pretty tight on extended AE fights if you have to try to keep a group up, and the timing you talked about still exists and is probably a lot more important in the high end of PoP than it ever was in Luclin (especially with pre-nerf mod rods). And as someone that's organized raids for years, from kunark dragons to Quarm, high end PoP is vastly more difficult to coordinate and organize than it was during velious. Guilds with massive manpower but no coordination tend to stumble, hard, once they reach Plane of Time, but very tightly organized ones tend to burn through the first 3 phases and most of the 4th in their first week. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm just a lurker here, since I only play FV with lowbies alts, but thought I'd chip in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=larraquemeleagrance>Larraque Meleagrance</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.rogers.com/fvresidents/smile.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Radical Dreamer</span><br>  Posts: 2326<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/03 2:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4101.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ajmyatt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/avatars/homerofborg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Say what?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But you obviously quit before the expansion where they added the sense of humour. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I remember when you could be in a group for a week to get level 52 ..... then level 53 was harder still.  <br>
<br>
I watched a Druid in our guild solo his way from 51 through 65 in about a week and a half without even really trying too hard in the PoN.   Bah!  How can you respect a player like that??  At least in the old days when you saw a level 60 player you knew they had busted their ass to get there.  <br>
<br>
The game has changed so much since then, and personally I think it's a lot more interesting now than it was then with so many more zones to explore, and dungeons to crawl .... but I can see the original posters point about how easy it is now to be 'ubah' ... especially on Firiona Vie where you can buy Vindi BP's and better in the bazaar if you farm enough plat.  <br>
<br>
The content has moved on so much now that it is saddening to hear about people soloing Vox and Naggy because of the gear they have.... heh.   <br>
<br>
They have also, however, increased the difficulty in a number of places like Velks and Sebilis so that you can go deeper in at level 65 and enjoy a romp that isn't simplistically easy... at least for a level 65 Bard with only a few aa's and who doesn't have a million hp's .... lol... and where you can also gain experience. <br>
<br>
If the game hadn't moved on from the old days of pre-luclin, then how would people keep moving forward onto harder and harder things?  The level 60's of old would have quit and Sony would have lost a bunch of subscriptions!!!  <br>
<br>
This said, I do agree that it's too easy to level 60-65 ... it would be nice if they could have more solo/single group questable items that were actually worth getting.... and it would be nice if experience wasn't sooo good in PoP so that people were encouraged to journey around the world some more! <br>
<br>
(Oh, and I also miss boats... and think the spires and more recently the books have been hugely detrimental to the EQ experience).... <br>

In the early stages of the game, there were no class boards or spoiler sites.  Those didn't become prominent until later when folks discovered EZboards.  So for the most part, your knowledge of how the game worked was limited to what you had actually experienced for yourself.<br>
<br>
I played a bard as my first character.  At the time, there were not that many enchanters around because folks hadn't yet realized how powerful crowd control was.  Folks also did not really understand how aggro worked.  As a result, I ended up dying quite a bit.  Bard songs that affected the entire group were major aggro magnets. On every pull that had 2 or more mobs in it, all of the adds ended up attacking me.   As a result, I would die on average at least 10 times between levels.  I remember level 25 very clearly.  It took me like 2 months to get through it because I died close to 20 times (Mistmoore trains are the best).  <br>
<br>
It wasn't until folks learned how aggro worked and discovered the power of enchanters that I stopped dying on a frequent basis.   So I started gaining levels faster since I stopped dying so much.  The game world itself didn't change much in terms of difficulty, the players just got smarter.<br>
<br>
Some of the recent features (ex. PoK portal system) that folks complain about that dumb down the game are just smart moves on SOE's part to retain their customer base.  I don't think their purpose was to make the game explicitly easier, but instead to make it less frustrating.  I know that if I still had to catch a boat to get from one continent to the next I would no longer be playing.  Been there done that too many times.  When I log in now, I just want to hunt with my friends and have fun.     <br>
<br>
There are still numerous places I and my guild can go that provide a difficult challenge for either an EXP group or a raid.   So by no means is the game too easy in that aspect.  However, there are many easy places I can go now if all I want to do is EXP grind for levels or AAs.   However, the same can be said 4 years ago for the original content as well.  Folks will play the game however they want to.  If they want to be challenged, the game provides for that.  If they want a relatively safe ride all the way to 65, the game provides for that as well.    <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
