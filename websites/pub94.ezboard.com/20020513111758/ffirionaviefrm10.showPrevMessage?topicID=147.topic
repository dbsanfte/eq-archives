Sorry.. By The Way, all of this really happened.))<br>
<br>
...Shintou spun on his heels, sending the blunt end of his weapon across Guard Ledshin's helm, denting it greatly, and knocking the Guard over on his back. Shintou rose his Lance, this time with the blade pointed downwards in a attempt to send it directly into his Gut, but Ledshin did stay aware, rolling to his left and forcing Shintou's weapon to piece the Sand of Freeport. Guard Ledshin faught throught the effects of his blood simmering, and his cramped stomach thanks to the Young Tier'dal, sending his blade across Shintou's Lockjaw Tunic, the leather providing little protection from the slash, sending Shintou staggering back a bit. Ledshin then rushed him, sholder ramming Shintou's small frame into the wall, allowing it to bounce off of it like a Que ball to the Center Pocket. Shintou did not get up.. in fact, he stood on the ground.. wincing a bit. Guard Ledshin then did slowly walk to the Samurai of Shadows, looking down at him with Hateful eyes..<br>
<br>
&quot;Foolish elf! I knew you were trouble from the first day I saw your scrawny hide wander past the gates. I'll crush you now, then maybe find me a nice Tier'dal Whore to warm me bed.. heh.. heh.&quot;<br>
<br>
And that drove madness into Shintou's eyes. No words, just madness.<br>
He barley got to his knees.. just enought for him to Lunge at that Foolish Guard of Freeport, his Lance striking deeply into his chest, his blade piercing thorugh the Man's spine, and redened metal ripped free of the muscles of Ledshin's back, impaling him completly. His lips did not speak words of Mockery now, but cries of pain and suffering..<br>
His suffering was not over however, that rage had sparked something.. new..<br>
Shintou lost control of his Harm Touch energies, the same that give him the ability to call forth the 'Dragon Slave', the power slipping down into his Lance, running up the wood and finding the blade.<br>
An explosion. Horrid Horrid Horrid..<br>
That blade deeply implanted within Ledshin's chest let Shintou's energies enter his body.. and they caused his body to..<br>
Well, explode. Flesh and blood flew about the Area, as well with the metal of his armor.. it knocking Shintou back against the wall, and to the ground..<br>
Shintou did survive however, able to struggle to his feet once again.. and he saw a area covered in human blood. Even Malloy the Songbird was complaing about his hair being wet.. and the gruesome sight before him. That bard would have a nice new story to sing about.. one day. <br>
Shintou knelt down, picking up the helm he damaged.. it surviving the explosion in tack..<br>
And then he turned, gathering shadows about his body.. and left.<br>
<br>
~East Freeport Docks~<br>
<br>
And this is where Shintou reapeared, dripping wet with blood.. he saw Braellar, an old Friend and former Guild Mate of His. The two Exchanged Greetings and such, but their was little time to talk.<br>
The boat had finally arrived, so they, and many others Boarded..<br>
<br>
&quot;Velve, its two parts fairy dust, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Shintou. 2 parts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright.. got it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Velve was on that boat.. somewhere. A Senior Knight of Selquar, seemingly one of the Best of those Knights that were up and comming.<br>
<br>
That boat ride was well, boring. Shintou could not sit still for every long, after a while he was pacing about the Deck, trying to keep himself occupied doing.. something! He could not believe he had to sail across the Ocean to slay some worthless Faries. How utterly..<br>
Boring. But Shintou had never been to the lands that the Tier'dal formally placed their capital of Carthage, where that bloody battle that the 'Face behind the Mask' tells about.. that created the Forest that grew out of the corspes, this 'Faydark'. The forest of the Elves.<br>
Faydark, that was where the Faries were, right?<br>
<br>
And that Boat finally made its way through the waves, and to the docks owned by the Dwarven folk that led to the Butcherblock Mountain Range.<br>
<br>
These short annoyances stood ready to cut down anything that would bring harm to their part of the Island. No evil would slip through..<br>
<br>
Unless they could gather Shadows. And Shintou did use this ability to rush past the guards without a single worry. Running his way down the path, kept save and hidden by the Magic that he just learned..<br>
He even got the pleasure of watching a Elf fall to his death to a Goblin. How delightful it was to watch those weak bastards die, without the ability to run from the battle with a swift tounge. Ah well.<br>
Other then that, Nothing Interesting happened in those Mountains to keep Shintou's attention, so he made his way to the Forest.<br>
Greater Faydark. And to him.. it was hell on Norrath.<br>
<br>
&quot;WTS #%$$%$#&quot;<br>
&quot;WTTF #$%#% TS @#$@#$% pst!&quot;<br>
&quot;WTS #$@$@ 5/19, #$%#$# +5 Str, +3 int, @$@#$@ 10/1, +10 Str, +10 int, +10 agi, +10 Dex, +10 wis pst bst lf #$$%@@$%&quot;<br>
<br>
Guah! What annoyance! These Elves and their worthless language! Shintou would curse to himself as he traveled down the path, covering his ears so he would not have to hear that nonsence anymore..<br>
<br>
Then he saw one.<br>
<br>
A Fairy.<br>
<br>
The small scantly clad fairy flew by him, her small wings emitting a bit of her fairy dust as she fluttered by. <br>
Shintou simply sighed, and put forth a half effort to slay the thing.<br>
And to his shock, a swift poke of his Lance was all it took to kill this Fairy..<br>
&quot;What a waste of effort.. that was no fun at all!&quot; Shintou said as he knelt down, squeezing and shaking at the corspe to gather her dust for those Skeletons of Ro that wished it, for the Armor..<br>
<br>
WTS: #$%$%#$ 670pp pst!<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey B4by!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh?&quot; Shintou looked up to see a Young Halfelven Bard it seemed, she was standing before him wearing a simple Guild Tunic, .. without any pants.<br>
<br>
She rolled her hips as she looked down towards him.. and spoke again..<br>
<br>
&quot;Do u hav eny pp for mez. plz plz plz!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shintou simply sighed at the annoying Elven Whore, his weapon ending her with a swift slice to her neck, letting her fall to choke on the pool of her own blood that was swiftly forming on the grass where she laid in her deathrest..<br>
<br>
Shntou did run foward a bit more.. and then he found something new..<br>
Just like in North Karana, spiers. Great Towers of Marble extended high into the Trees.. a Heiroglyph in the corner of each tower. A Nexus Scion stood in the center of the Spiers, as always. Shintou walked towards the Area.. looking towards a certain one.<br>
<br>
It had a small crack into it. One that seemed to be slightly old..<br>
About 18 years old. He knelt down to eximine it closer.. but then reguarded it as nothing. He rushed foward, not even knowing that he just ran past the place where he was acually created.<br>
Ah well, thats a story for another day.<br>
<br>
The Lesser Faydark, finally. The Acual home of the Faries as he had heard.. This is where he would have to hunt them.. So he ran about the Edge of the Forest.. <br>
He also heard about Powerful beings that Roamed this Area, and a Free Trip back to his Bindpoint in Neriak would not be his Idea of Fun on this day.. So he made his way along this Border under the cover of his shadows, footsteps being silenced by the carpet of grass under his heels.. running behind a group of Shadowmen.. and..<br>
<br>
&quot;Tier'dal!&quot; Shintou let his shadows up as he rushed toward the Camp. Maybe he'd find someone to point him to the faries at that camp..<br>
<br>
&quot;Its him! The Follower Tier'dal turned Follower of that Traitor Lanys T'Vyl! Slay him!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;!! $@#%!&quot;<br>
<br>
Elite members of the Indigo Brotherhood lept out to fight Shintou, three of them sending their blades against the Follower of Lanys, So Shintou did the only thing he could.<br>
<br>
He died. Flopping to the ground after a well placed strike to his side by one of the Tier'dal, the Three looking down at his 'corspe'. <br>
<br>
&quot;He is dead. Defy the True Path of Innoruuk and the Indigo Brotherhood, and you welcome death. Worthless excuse for a Tier'dal. Come on, back to the Camp Men.<br>
The Priestess Calls.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Three gloated over his corspe shortly, before returning to the camp, standing their usual guard..<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, I still can see his worthless corspe.. .. Wha! It just uped and Disapeared!&quot;<br>
<br>
..And Indeed.. it seemed Shintou's corspe had poofed in Thin air..<br>
<br>
<br>
Gearheart tried to strike down the Elven Paladin, but her sword was too strong for it, striking a mighty blow against the Mechanical Annoyance, sending him to the grass in pieces.<br>
The Princess of all Faries, Princess Jolenya put her small fist against the side of the Paladin, and a spell from the Gnome Magician came flying towards her, burning her flesh and sending her to the ground in Shamables.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll go bring them once their sprits return to that spot.&quot; The Elf of the group said, sitting down and taking a load off, resting against the carpet of grass.<br>
&quot;For now, lets take a quick break.&quot;<br>
&quot;Alright, I need to gather my Mana anyhow..&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
And the Tier'dal reapeared.. across from the Mushroom Home of the Faries, away from the Fighters that were slaying their leaders. His weapon cut down a Fairy Guard, taking her dust as well.<br>
He had completed his Task. Two parts of Fairy Dust.. now, one more task on this Island to be completed..<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey.. isn't that!&quot; .. Shintou said, looking across the Field and seeing the face of that Elven man..<br>
<br>
&quot;I've seen him before.. In Nektulos.. He.. he didn't want to fight .. I'll make him fight this time..&quot;<br>
<br>
Naturally, Shintou rushed over to challenge the Elf. Threating the Female, which he noticed will bring even elves to the battlefield with him, he tried to use her to bring him out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Elf, You will fight me, this time. It is over for you, the battle is now!&quot; Shintou shouted towards the elf, quickly bringing up a Skeletal Pet and Preparing to put this elf down into its grave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, so sorry. I don't have time to Whipe you off of my feet, Drow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again, he was denied. ..Oh well.<br>
He had to complete his Quest anyhow. He'd see that elf again..<br>
<br>
So he left. This time..<br>
The Steamfront Mountain Range, Home of the Gnomes.<br>
<br>
Gathering his Shadows once again, he ran under the cover of the rising sun, it being early Morning as he made his way towards the Caverns..<br>
<br>
What Caverns? The Minotaur Caverns of course..<br>
<br>
But Shintou looked across the Horizion, and that blasted orb of light, the Sun was rising..<br>
His trek was long and Tiring anyhow.. he could search for the Minotaur Hero after he got some sleep..<br>
<br>
He allowed his shadows to drop, finding himself a suitable place to sleep.. <br>
He gathered some rocks, building himself a small place to hide himself from passing guards..<br>
Using some of the Grass, he camoflauged this place so that it would blend in with everything else about him..<br>
<br>
When it was suitable, he sliped down into his hiding place..<br>
<br>
And he let his eyes close.. falling swiftly into his Dreams...<br>
<br>
His own Chaotic Nightmare.. of that day when battle will run across Norrath..<br>
<br>
And that fighting will be the only thing that matters in this world..<br>
His dream was shared however.. shared by one other that wished to destroy all things..<br>
<br>
That dreamer everlasting..<br>
<br>
The end of us all. <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif">
