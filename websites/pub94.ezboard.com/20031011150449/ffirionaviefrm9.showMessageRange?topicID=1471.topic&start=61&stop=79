Gord the Rogue found two blades, a chaotic evil one called Blackheartseeker and a lawful good one called the Crystal Sword, that could be fused together to create a neutral blade (the blade of balance) called Coureflamme.<br>

Regarding Gamma World:   TSR's Gamma World was under-developed SciFi garbage.  Game Designer's Workshop's Traveller universe was far superior in those days.  <br>
<br>
GDW's Traveller had ZERO competition in the area of Sci Fi RPGs in that time period.  Traveller was then the undisputed best selling and most talked about SciFi RPG ---- they had their act together.  The universe of the Third Imperium (the official game world of Traveller)  was the most sophisticated and most developed literature and RPG universe in that time.  It rivaled the World of Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms as far as history and depth.  <br>
<br>
By the time of the late 1980s and early 1990s, GURPs as well as the Star Trek and Star Wars role playing games were starting to take the Sci Fi RPG genre by storm.... and roughly at the same time Traveller was on its deathbed.<br>
<br>
There are still over 2 dozen nostalgic websites/fansites devoted to the Traveller universe today.  I dont think you can say the same thing about Gamma World or Boot Hill. <br>
<br>
And if not playing D&amp;D or Traveller back in those days.... then me and my friends/brothers were playing either Car Wars the original edition, or Illuminati the card game (also the plastic bag original first edition) <br>
<br>
For me there was also those Avalon Hill wargames.... <br>
<br>
I never did get into the Cyberpunk-ish RPG games.  Tho we tried out some of the silly silly beer and pretzels games like the Milton Bradley plastic army men games ---- Fortress America, Shogun, Axis and Allies.  And of course Risk and Diplomacy. <br>

Bane, this was so very true!  Traveller was one of the few RPGs in the ancient days that officially endorsed the idea of character permanent death.  If you die, you die.  No magic, no resurrections.  Even all the high technologies of the Third Imperium (roughly circa 2,900 AD) could not bring dead people back to life.  <br>
<br>
Then again, rolling up a character and &quot;skilling up&quot; in Traveller was far far easier and less time consuming than typical D&amp;D or fantasy based games.   Traveller was not an experience level  based game.  It was purely a skill based game.  You pre-selected your preferred skills and template career at the start.  Then you eventually trained more and developed mastery over time.  Some skills could be unlearned in order to learn others, or even make a career change. <br>
<br>
So a &quot;brand newly rolled character&quot; in Traveller would already begin adventuring as a battle-hardened space marine, or a veteran asteroid miner and prospector, or an already experienced scout ship pilot, or a veteran of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps, etc, or a seasoned thug and space pirate, or even role play as a middle-aged gray haired and retired Commodore of the Solomani Navy. <br>
<br>
The average AGE of a newly rolled character in Traveller was roughly a 35 or 39 year old man or woman.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It was almost impossible (or discouraged) to roll up a young adult character in Traveller, because young characters had less career terms, and thus they begin adventuring with LESS skills points behind their portfolio.  Hence, the average character on Traveller was a middle aged man or woman who possessed tons of skill points to back them up.  It was so completely different from D&amp;D character generation. <br>

While I was and remain a huge H.P. Lovecraft scholar, I never had the opportunity to play Call of Cthulhu.  I read the source books and some of the modules and was really impressed by the depth and mood.<br>
<br>
Mal:<br>
<br>
Traveller ruled - no question.  I was only explaining how Spelljammer arose (to kind of tie D&amp;D to Gamma World and Boot Hill).<br>
<br>
Now...you've mentioned some SERIOUSLY oldschool stuff.  CAR WARS!  Hell, I'm looking over at a book case that has the original Car Wars black plastic game pack filed on it.  Beside it are Truck Stop and Crash City.  That game kicked arse.<br>
<br>
I was a fan of all Steve Jackson games actually...particularly Man to Man (the precursor to the Gurps system) - gladiator combat was never so good.  Eventually I was playing full blown Gurps, and then converted a group of D&amp;D playing friends over to fantasy based Gurps and got them hooked. <br>

Gurps is the best system (imo) hands down.<br>

Although when in play, I really disliked the thought of what happened without anagathics if I was unable to find them again LOL. Traveller was a kick ass game the way it was designed. Alot of the newer games could really learn a thing or two about game design off of it, good god.<br>
<br>
As to Call of Cthulu, a guy in my area used to run a Call of Cthulu game religiously. Whenever we would play he would start the session by telling us about real 1920's lore that was printed in his book to help get people more in an eerie mood. Not fantasy lore, REAL lore about real strange occurences which happened. Very eerie. The guy also used to go to places, map them out, and then design adventures around the places. After the adventure was over he would then take his group out to the site where their characters had the adventure in.<br>
<br>
My one friend that had the liberty of going through this, was telling me about this cave complex in a rural setting where they went against some cultists. After the game they were taken out to the actual site and my friend said how unnerving he felt when he saw where his character leaned against this tree to shoot a ghoul by a nearbye cave entrance. And yes, this guy was that good of a DM. He used to really sucker people into the mood. We used to run games at cons together, and for Call of Cthulu, he was the best. What is more eerie about Cthulu, is the facts behind the Lovecraftian stories. Theres more fact to some of what Lovecraft put to pen then most people even realize, very eerie stuff.<br>
<br>
OMG Car Wars rocked! I still have the deluxe set up stairs. My only complaint about that game was they never made more rules for outside of your cars :/ I always thought how cool it would have been to actually play in a more RP fashion with it like how Battletech did when Fasa came out with the Mechwarrior RPG.<br>
<br>
Paranoia rocked! OMG talk about an insane game. I refused to play after one day of losing two clone families all in the same session LOL. As funny as it was, it was also very sucky. Although I did get some good payback as my friend had a clone named &quot;Bubba&quot; and I got to help him crash the computer by crashing his jet into its main data banks ahahaha. Afterwards they built a shrine there and called it &quot;Bubba's Breakaway&quot; LOL.<br>

Facts? Please do explain these facts. If you mean his use of imagery from places he has visited or real life events at that time, then yes I agree with you, he used them very effectivly.<br>
<br>
If, however, you are refering to anything occult, such as the Necronomicon being an actual tome, then you are mistaken. That book was entirly created by Lovecraft himself, and the Mythos he uses was also created by him and, over time, other writers (August Derleth was the one who coined the term &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, HPL never used it). <br>
I've known people who believe this book to be real, mistaking the Simon &quot;Necronomicon&quot; for such. That book is hoax, mixing Crowley's idea with Sumerian mythos with Cthulhu mythos added for flavor. <br>

It is nice to see a few folks who recognize Lovecraft and appreciate the Cthulhu mythos.  I became a fan of Cthulhu in Grade 9 and made a point of getting everything he wrote that was published.

There have been some really bad attempts at bringing Lovecraftian materials to the screen and you'll find his influences in a number of movies...but I wanna see the real deal.  His material would also make a great television series - turn of the century explorers and scientists battling the unseen forces of the occult to bring Cthulhu back!<br>
<br>
This reminds me.  There was this first person computer game that came out, back when Wolfenstein 3D was all the rage, that borrowed HEAVILY from the Cthulhu mythos.  I think the game was called &quot;The Legacy&quot; or something like that and it was very innovative for its time, although it didn't really take off.  As I recall, you could roll up a customized investigator and allocate points in the areas of strength, agility and psychic powers.  As you advanced you could increase your status in those areas and gain new powers.  It was very cool and I've been looking for a copy of it over the last while, but to no avail.  If anyone recalls the game, please lemme know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=banegrivm>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 563<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/30/03 11:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1471.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_star.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: More trivia...</span><hr size=1> Yep, and the Traveller that got reprinted wasn't the goody Mega Traveller or Traveller the New Era...it was the original Traveller <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As to Cthulu mythos, Its been said that it can be traced all the way back to ancient Babylon. There is a deity there who encompases all the same things that were spoken of in the Cthulu Mythos and if I remember correctly they include the description. Scholars have said they believe that may be the source and origin of the Cthulu mythos.<br>
<br>
Then there is the &quot;Mad Arab&quot; who was said to have preached the edicts of Cthulu for the first time, as Cthulu. The full spelling of his name escapes me however.  <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>

As for a Lovecraft movie, you should check out &quot;Dagon&quot;, it's kind of a mixture of Shadow over Innsmouth and Dagon, but is by far one of the better Lovecraft inspired movies I've seen yet, along with &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot;, not based of a story, but heavily Lovecraft influenced.<br>

<br>
Wrong! Cthulhu Mythos was entirely invented by Lovecraft, and he never once used any Babylonian references (many other writers also used Cthulhu mythos in their stories, so maybe one of them used said references I'd have to check.) <br>
<br>
The Mad Arab you refer to is named Abdul Alhazred, which was a name that Lovecraft invented after reading The Arabian Nights when he was 5 yrs old. That's what he called himself when playing.<br>

No serious parapsychological entries at all. I will try again later with another search engine, as I only had time at the present to do the one. If it's so easy to find these sites you mention, how about posting a few links? <br>
Also I have done the library searches many moons ago, the only references to Cthulhu I had found in the occult/parapsychology sections was the Simon Necronomicon, which as I said before is an admitted hoax.<br>
When I get home from work later tonight, I will try that search on a few more search engines, just so that I can see your information first hand. Untill I see it myself and have evaluated and validated said information, I still will stand by the facts I have seen...that Cthulhu mythos has no more philisophical or historical basis than Superman or Mickey Mouse.<br>
<br>
edit: fianlly able to do more searches: have not found one site which you describe as having the information you describe. In fact, the ones I found that weren't game related were merely about the what Lovecraft and other writers had written and about the authors themselves. You might want to provide some URL's to back your argument seeing as my searches turned up nothing. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balthur@firionavie>Balthur</A> at: 5/4/03 10:52:43 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1471.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1471.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1471.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=1471.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=1471.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1471.topic&index=79><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=1471.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1471.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1471.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
