<br>
<br>
this was written by a Benjamin Casper, APPERANTLY, connected to the films/W Brothers. It sums up the complete story and not yet shown facts, up until the end of Reloaded.<br>
<br>
<br>
!!!!!!WARNING! IF YOU DON`T WANT ANYTHING SPOILED FOR YOU AND WANTS TO THINK FOR YOURSELF, DON`T READ THIS STUFF!!!!!!!!!! <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A human Designer created AI (artificial intelligence) without the programming instructions to compute pi (3.14). This was done as a safety measure (anomaly) to ensure human survival over the AI. The anomaly and the solution for it are present in the AI and inherited by everything they create. They are, however, unaware of it and would be unable to comprehend it even if they were aware (see notes-A). <br>
<br>
The AI seize control of the planet. They place humans into pods as a new fuel source.<br>
<br>
The AI create the program, Architect, to design the Matrix. He is the representation of the Designer. The Architect naturally also doesn’t comprehend that he contains both the anomaly and the solution for it, they having been passed on to him by his AI creators. The Architect designs the first Matrix. In his mathematical computations, it is the vision of perfection. The anomaly and the solution that were sown by the Designer, were imprinted into the Matrix coding language. The first Matrix crashed. Being the humble program that he is, the Architect said the fault lies within the humans. “I gave them too perfect of a Matrix. I will design them a version based on the ‘varying grotesqueries’ of their nature.” It also crashes, he thinks because he has based it on our “imperfection.” He is logical and wants to solve the problem, as he is the caretaker. <br>
<br>
An intuitive program, Oracle, was called upon to investigate the problem. The Oracle, being an intuitive program, discovers that the anomaly does not lie within the humans, but within the AI language itself. She realizes the anomaly is in everything the AI has created including the Architect. She also realizes that it is unadvisable to tell the Architect, because he would be unable to comprehend this explanation and this would cause the Matrix to crash.<br>
She informs the Architect that he needs to create a Matrix with choice, and allows him to think it is the humans with the anomaly (see notes-B). She knows that this will create Zion, which she will need. The AI implant a seed of truth in the minds of the humans in the pods, “…a splinter in your mind.” For some, “...driving you mad…,” they require the exit option (red pill/blue pill). Those who don’t accept the reality that is given to them are flushed out of the Matrix and are allowed to form Zion.<br>
<br>
Enter, “the One”. The Oracle convinces the Architect to inform the AI that they must recreate the Designer from the genetic level (human being), who is fated to be the One. The Designer created AI in a structure that only he could access and reload. Herein lies the need for the One to reset the anomaly to the default computation.<br>
<br>
So the newly created version of the Matrix is calculated, also based on recent human history. At the necessary time in the Matrix, the future One is designed and born. He becomes a computer programmer and designs artificial intelligence. Being the creator of artificial intelligence in the Matrix environment, he contains the solution, the anomaly, and the reload code that serves as a bridge between them (symbolic key). At that point he is contacted by Zion Freedom Fighters who were sent by the Oracle. They free him because allowing him to stay will cause a cascading loop. The Freedom Fighters take him to Zion where he is trained. The Freedom Fighters are contacted by the Oracle to bring him to her. She sets him on the path of becoming the One.<br>
<br>
At some point the future One has to die in the Matrix. It’s at this moment that the Matrix sends the future One the unbalanced equation (anomaly), and only the future One will respond with pi (3.14), which opens a symbolic window. The Matrix reloads the future One, which transforms him into the reload code, 101. Now he knows he is the One, because he can see the Matrix encoding. He is the one needed to reload the Matrix, as he has become one with the code.<br>
<br>
The One returns to Zion until the Oracle contacts him. He follows her instructions to the Source, where he disseminates the 101 code or reload code. The Matrix is reloaded and the artificial intelligence program that the One has created within the Matrix is deleted, thereby eliminating the chance of a cascading loop. The anomaly resets to the beginning, Zion is destroyed, and the One rebuilds Zion as instructed by the Architect. This cycle repeats five times in this manner. <br>
<br>
Then Neo is born into the Matrix. He’s genetically engineered to be the One, version six. He is freed from the Matrix and taken into the Nebuchadnezzar (hovercraft). Events occur as with the previous versions of the Ones- but for Neo its going to be different. This time the Oracle has decided the Matrix will not be reloaded. She accomplishes this by telling Trinity that she will fall in love with the One and Morpheus that he will find the One. <br>
<br>
As usual the security protocol Agents are called upon to protect the Matrix and the Source from all. They fight Neo and kill him as with the previous Ones. This time while the question is being asked and the reply given, Trinity kisses him and cements their attachment of love. He is reloaded with the code as before, arises, and knows he’s the One. With his new powers he now fights Agent Smith effortlessly and enters him. This corrupts Agent Smith causing a failure to his program. <br>
<br>
Now the sixth destruction of Zion is in progress. The Freedom Fighters of Zion meet to discuss how to prevent it. Smith comes to inform Neo that he has set Smith free. They return to Zion leaving a ship behind to await communication from the Oracle. Smith, no longer an agent of the system, replicates himself into Bane and enters Zion. Neo receives his instructions from the Oracle and goes to meet her. Neo enters a room and encounters Seraph, the Oracle’s protector, who confirms that Neo is the One and takes him to the Oracle. She was late in communicating with Neo because dangerous programs are searching for her, including Smith, who wants, “everything.” She had also been inquiring about the missing Keymaker who Neo will need to get to the Source. On the surface the Oracle is fulfilling her usual role, her purpose, so as not to be deleted. She’s saying and doing what she’s always said and done, except for subtly pulling information out of Neo. She wants to know if Neo sees Trinity die after he enters the Door of Light in his dream (the Oracle can not see past this door). He did not. The Oracle now knows that Neo will choose to save Trinity instead of reloading the Matrix. She has succeeded!! She says no more about this and proceeds to tell Neo where the Keymaker is. She hands Neo instructions for a place and time to meet the Merovingian who has abducted the Keymaker.<br>
<br>
The Oracle makes a hasty exit, as Smith is approaching. Smith wants revenge. He wants to take from Neo what was stolen from him, purpose. Neo learns that Smith has replicated himself many times, and he tries to replicate himself into Neo but fails. Smith has an arduous time trying to beat Neo, so Smith recruits more replications. Neo reaches a point where there are too many Smiths to fight and feels compelled to leave.<br>
<br>
Neo exits the Matrix and returns to the Nebuchadnezzar where he assembles the crew to go visit the Merovingian and obtain the Keymaker. Then Neo and the crew enter the Matrix once again. They follow the Oracle’s instructions and journey to the Merovingian. They speak with him and he declines to hand over the Keymaker. As they are leaving without the Keymaker, the elevator door opens on a different floor, and there stands the Merovingian’s wife, Persephone. She offers to give them the Keymaker in exchange for a kiss from Neo. He kisses her and she leads them to the Keymaker. The Keymaker states, “I have been waiting for you,” and starts to leave with them. As the Merovingian returns to see what Persephone has done, a fight ensues. Morpheus and Trinity escape with the Keymaker in tow. Neo is forced to fly to the center of the city to save Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agents. They meet with other Freedom Fighters in the Matrix, close to the Source, and the Keymaker instructs them on how to gain entry to the Source.<br>
<br>
The Freedom Fighters follow the Keymaker’s instructions. Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker find themselves in a hallway where they run into replicated Smiths. A fight occurs and during the 314 seconds when the symbolic window is open, the Keymaker opens the door. Neo enters and stands before the Door of Light. He inserts his key, which was given to him by the Keymaker and is instantly transported to the Architect.<br>
<br>
Neo stands before the Architect who proceeds to ramble on about the imperfection of humanity and his own perfection. He tells Neo that Trinity has entered the Matrix to sacrifice her life to save Neo’s life. Then he gives Neo the choice between two doors. The first door leads to, “the Source and the salvation of Zion” (meaning Neo will have to rebuild it). The Matrix is reloaded and the anomaly is reset to the default computation. This is the door chosen by all of the previous Ones. The second door leads “back to the Matrix, to her (to Trinity and the chance to save her), and to the end of your species,” as not reloading the Matrix will crash the system, killing not only Zion but also the humans living in the Matrix.<br>
<br>
As a non-intuitive program, the Architect is distanced from the outcome. However he makes one more attempt to influence Neo to reload the Matrix, as the Architect is designed to sustain the Matrix. Neo exits through the second door and tries to save Trinity’s life. He arrests her plummet toward the ground to no avail. She dies from a gunshot wound inflicted by the Agents, however, Neo resuscitates Trinity by infusing her with the reload code. <br>
<br>
Neo and Trinity exit the Matrix and return to the Nebuchadnezzar. Neo informs Morpheus that Zion will be destroyed in 24 hours and that the Oracle’s prophecy was a lie. “The one was never meant to end anything. It was just another system of control.” The sentinels destroy the Nebuchadnezzar, but as the crew flees Neo exclaims, “Something’s different. I can feel them.” He turns to face the sentinels, extends his arm, and releases a pulse of energy destroying them. Neo collapses and falls into a coma. A hovercraft rescues them and then we see Neo and Bane (Smith replication) lying on two separate gurneys in the medical bay, as Bane is in a coma also.<br>
<br>
TO BE CONTINUED...<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
<br>
A<br>
<br>
An electronic device can contain a question and an answer, and not be able to bridge the two without a key or a password. For example, an electronic lock contains the password 1138 (solution). It also contains the question allowing you to type in the password (solution). Due to its parameters it is unable to bridge the question and the password (solution), even though it contains both. It requires someone to introduce the password (solution). This acts as the bridge between the two. <br>
<br>
B<br>
<br>
This is the issue the Oracle is having with the Architect: <br>
<br>
<br>
Example: Imagine you are at work. Your boss comes in and tells you to solve a problem. You find out your boss is wrong about the source of the problem but you cannot tell him he is wrong. You are forced to solve the problem anyway. What’s worse, you still need your boss’s help to solve the problem. <br>
<br>
The Oracle needs to find a way to fix the Matrix anomaly for the Architect. She believes that the AI have this anomaly also. She must use the AI to begin the process, while allowing the Architect to believe they are fixing a human anomaly. Therefore the Oracle allows the Architect to believe the anomaly is in the humans and that they are rejecting the Matrix. She allows him to believe that the humans are causing the unbalanced equation (anomaly).<br>
<br>
<br>
Example: Your problem is how do you get your boss to help you to solve the problem when you can’t tell him the true source of the problem. The only solution is to make him believe that what he is doing is solving the problem the way he sees it. When, actually, what he is doing is solving the true problem and he never knows it. <br>
<br>
The Oracle tells the Architect she requires a One (the Designer) in flesh and blood form to correct the anomaly. Simulations will not work in this instance. She requires Zion to be created to remove the One from the Matrix and to train him. She tells the Architect that to fix the “human” anomaly, he needs to give the humans the illusion of choice. So a, “splinter in your mind,” of “something wrong with the world,” is implanted into the minds of the humans on a, “near unconscious level.” She tells him this will lessen the pace of the anomaly growth but this is a lie.<br>
<br>
The Oracle tells the Architect that some will still not accept the Matrix and to release them, not to kill them because she needs them for Zion (which she covertly stays in contact with once it is formed). She emphasizes to the Architect that the AI need to create the flesh and blood One to reload the Matrix (to correct the supposed human-caused unbalanced equation). <br>
<br>
The Architect believes this reloading is fixing the human-caused <br>
anomaly. It is actually fixing the anomaly injected by the AI when the Matrix was constructed.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enheduannalia>EnheduannaLia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/2/03 9:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.redhills.com/img/annapix.jpg height=150 width=78></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Matrix Reloaded</span><hr size=1> Um...wow.

Everyone hasn't discussed a very important scene! I can't believe you all missed it.<br>

Spoilers ahead... just in case...<br>

The kiss<br>
<br>
Its very obvious, to me, that the french woman infected neo with something. I mean, her husband just gave that woman a cake that made her randy, and she stands there, puts on some lipstick, and then kisses Neo. <br>
<br>
I am calling it right now. If agent smith can do things to rewire the real world selves of people, then whatever she had on that lipstick is going to play a big part in the third movie. I am not so confident to say that it gave him the power to Emp the seekers, but I definately think it will do something between him and Trinity.<br>

I have played Mage, the WW tabletop rpg for years and to me the Matrix is on a very close parallel to that wonderful setting's view of reality and perception. The similarities between the two are enough to leave me wondering if they've ever flipped through a Mage book. Of course the whole reality twist has been done many times throughout literature.<br>

<br>
If you listen carefully during that scene, apparently you can hear a sound similar to the &quot;modem&quot; sound that occurred when the trace program in the first Matrix movie was replicating on Neo (ie. the mirror covering him).  Notice also, the redness of her lipstick, which correlates to the &quot;red pill&quot; Neo took to activate the trace program and the &quot;red candy&quot; the Oracle offered to Neo.<br>
<br>
There's definitely something to the kiss, outside of the device of showing Trinity's affection for Neo and the fact that Persephone has lived without true love and passion for a long time.<br>
<br>
Now for the symbolism of the Merovingian and Persephone.  The Merovingian's were Frankish nobles who believed they were the direct descendants of Jesus Christ.  The Merovingian in the Matrix is a highly developed program &quot;from somewhere else&quot; outside of the Matrix, who came to the Matrix with the aim of controlling it, believing that he is a descendant of the &quot;singular artificial intelligence&quot; that humanity spawned which lead them to where they are now.<br>
<br>
Persephone is a persona in Greek mythology who was duped into entering the underworld, wherein she was imprisoned until the God intervened thereby allowing her to escape for half of the year (spring and summer I believe).  During fall and winter, Persephone was relegated to entering the underworld again.  <br>
<br>
Through this myth, the Wachowski's portray the Merovingian as the lord of the underworld (which is he quite clearly in the movie) to whom all things of darkness pay allegiance and find safety - evidenced by the werewolf, ghost and vampire exiled programs in his employ.  The lord of the underworld symbolism is made even clearer, as the &quot;lord&quot; in the Persephone myth kept her imprisoned by retaining all of the keys to the underworld - in the Matrix he has control over the Keymaker.<br>
<br>
There is some talk about Persephone being what is known as &quot;the Engineer&quot; of the Matrix.  Whether this is true or not, is a matter of speculation that'll be resolved in Revolutions.  The kiss must have some relevance, but I'm skeptical that it has anything to do with Neo's &quot;real world&quot; powers (ie. his disabling the squids)<br>
<br>
Which brings us to the supposition that Zion exists in the real world.  I've looked at both sides of the arguement, that Zion is indeed the real world and that Zion is simply another layer of the Matrix (the scorched earth Matrix as it were) and I honestly dunno - there is strong evidence for either arguement.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel that layering the Matrix would be rather complex and hard to tie-off in one movie, but the Wachowski's are clever.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had not picked up on the 314 seconds being Pi, cool. And yes I found the subtle use of werewolves/vampires comical. I loved the keymaker *smile*&quot;<br>
<br>
The Pi thing is neat and makes sense.  The Matrix was created with a lock and a key, or a puzzle and a missing piece, which represents Pi.  The Architect knows about the missing piece/problem &quot;the anomoly&quot; but doesn't know where to look for the solution/missing piece.  The Oracle knows what the missing piece is, but doesn't want to tell the Architect because that would completely enslave humanity.<br>

<br>
If so Neo does retain his powers in the real world. To me this symbolizes that our dreams really can come true.<br>
<br>
I got the Merovingian/Persephone story pretty much as the last poster suggested, but I am still baffled by the use of the Merovingian as the name for the lord of the underworld.<br>
<br>
From &quot;Holy Blood - Holy Grail&quot; and on the use of the Merovingians in modern conspiracy theory is very conspicuos. Most often they are portrayed as the descendants of Christ. Why would the genetic inheritor of the Christ role be &quot;evil&quot; while the spiritual inheritor (Neo) is &quot;good&quot;.<br>
<br>
Must be lacking som piece here.<br>
<br>
And that said we are still lacking the single biggest piece of them all. WHY is Morpheus' ship named Nebuchadnezzar? Nebuchadnezzar was the Babylonian king who held the Jews in slavery, why would the name be used to denotate something used to defend Sion?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also a small prediction: Morpheus will be shown to have greater powers inside the Matrix than we so far have been led to believe, he is after all the God of Sleep.<br>

Robert Anton Wilson then REALLY gets into 23 alot. As does some bands, like They Might Be Giants.<br>
<br>
So, to use it in Matrix is a joke about jokes about conspiracy theories, made in a movie which is about the unreality of reality, while the movie is a fiction which includes almost all elements of modern conspiracy theory.<br>
