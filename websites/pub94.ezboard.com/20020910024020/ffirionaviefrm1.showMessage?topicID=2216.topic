I have returned several times since, only to find that the issue had not been addressed.<br>
<br>
Now, after being let-down by Asheron's Call, Anarchy Online, Dark Age of Camelot, Horizons, Archaean, Shadowbane, Atriarch, Warhammer Online, and Neverwinter Nights... I am now staring at my old EverQuest and Ruins of Kunark CDs... trying to resist the siren call... wondering if it is worth it....<br>
<br>
Is Firona Vie truly a roleplaying server? If I played Taranis Thilandrae, my Human-hating Elven Druid, would Half-Elves wonder about my stance toward them? If I played Aurindel, my High Elven Wizard who wishes the Wood Elves be outcast, would the response of some Wood Elves be violent? If I played Vehn Shataan, my Human Monk who dreads being a Human and admires the Elves to the point of obsession, would his own race call him mad and curse him on the streets of Qeynos?<br>
<br>
I am honestly disgusted by the representation of Elves with the new Shadows of Luclin models, but I fear that I may be able to look past them and perhaps grasp the magic that I had originally hoped Norrath would hold....<br>
<br>
Tell me... should I risk the possible waste of a monthly $10.00, or should I return to Neverwinter Nights -- which seems to dislike my beautiful and beloved Kyro II chipset? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellestor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellestor</A> at: 6/30/02 11:58:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udalninilvenorsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalninil Venorsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/1/02 12:14:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2216.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A New Hope?</span><hr size=1> There are alot of folks that roleplay, there are some that don't.

You still have what every other server in EQ has, however here you had better not outright disrespect the roleplay community ~ although it does happen and if you view the soapbox forum, i'm sure you'll get the idea.  The preferred term has been largely debated since the day Firiona Vie opened, as there are people who made the move for reasons other than to roleplay (different rule set).  <br>
<br>
As far as your story lines go, I'm sure there are people better versed in that area than me....i've nothing nice to say about it =)<br>

Those who stay here, probably do because we love the server ~ be it for roleplay, ruleset, whatever else have you =) and i like to think since the dawn of Firiona Vie all have grown to accept each other.....or at least try to...and when all else fails ignore /shrug <p>Sydia Vishious<Br>Enchanter 55<Br>

<br>
Hearing that makes me miss my old (now disbanded) guild on Tallon Zek. Those higher in rank (who I spent most of my time round) were truly memorable characters when they did choose to roleplay.<br>
<br>
I am still wary of Shadows of Luclin, however... I really do hate the new Elf models, and they make me worry about what EverQuest 2 will be.<br>
<br>
Although, I also do not wish to play without Shadows of Luclin, because otherwise I have a hard time bearing the landscape and non-Elven models. I value roleplaying above all else in roleplaying games, but--oddly enough--graphics come second. The better the latter, the better I am with the former. For instance, I once started a conversation about a scar on the left arm of a Gnome I met in an old MUD. I have yet to be able to do this in a graphical game....<br>
<br>
[Shrugs] I will use the free 30-day account I received by e-mail last week, and connect to Luclin, and see what happens....<br>

What has driven you away from so many MMRPGs?<br>
<br>
If you played Taranis, Cylria (half-elven) would wonder why you didn't like her, but this would be perfectly normal for her (you'd be the first anti-human wood elf she's met). I would understand that you are roleplaying though. So would most other people.<br>
<br>
You would need regular friends to pull off those three though. If you left groups when humans, or wood elves joined, poeple would understand that you're RPing, but you would still get a bad rep (but this is also realistic, and RP justified as your character wouldn't be trusted by friends/members of the unliked race). If you just grumbled at their presence in a group, most PLAYERS here wouldn't take offence, but their characters might. Just to be safe, though, you should probably send them a /tell to make sure they understand that you're just RPing.<br>
<br>
Also, even on FV, the game engine or environment hasn't really been changed. Thus NPC humans would like you until you killed your faction with them. A high-elf only guild would loose out in the high end game without any warriors. As would a wood elf/ogre/half-elf/etc... guild (with no clerics). Anything releted to the engine itself will be the same as you remeber (Except for No-Drop and Trivial Loot code). It's the players that make this a role-play server.<br>

Maybe it won't....<br>
<br>
<br>
There are a number of things that irritate me about Everquest. In fact, my list of cons is much larger than my list of pros.<br>
<br>
So why do I play EQ after I've long since abandon other games? <br>
<br>
Because the few pros in EQ have so much weight to them... <br>
<br>
What it comes down to for me is friendships and large group events. No other game, anywhere, gives you what EQ does. The ability to clear a plane with 24+ people. The ability to attack numerous dragons with large raid forces. The chance to work together as a team and win!<br>
<br>
Sidebar: I love dragons. Other games that have come out have purposely avoided putting dragons in their world for a variety of reasons (designers don't personally like them, or they don't want to clone EQ, or whatever). Me, I love dragons. And the chance to fight so many different types of dragons, and to have them be BIG encounters... is very appealing to me. <br>
<br>
But back to the main idea: Why do I keep playing EQ? <br>
<br>
People and events. I've enjoyed the people I've met playing this game. I've enjoyed my time playing EQ, even if the game itself often drives me mad. <br>
<br>
In the end, the friendships I make, and the events I've participated in, completely outweigh anything else. <br>

2) Community<br>
3) More Atmosphere<br>
<br>
I simply love sitting under a large tree in the Greater Faydark with my Bard companion, Delanie, and listening to her music -- my Druid making stories out of her music for her. The moments are priceless.<br>
<br>
Then again, I also remember my stereotypical Dark Elf Necromancer killing High Elf maidens on the roads of the East Commonlands, only to be ambushed by a group of her unusual Halfling friends... and killing them, too.<br>
<br>
Ah... missed days of glory....<br>
<br>
Ahem.<br>
<br>
Anyway, as to the Elf models... I would play a female character just to ensure that I was not so damned bulky, but even the female Elf models are 'bulky' with their breasts being as large as their head. [Sighs]<br>
<br>

This happened because the people of Firiona Vie (the players AND characters) are creative, mature folk.They have a balance that I have not found elsewhere. They truly are able to swap a night of hunting with a night of play and roleplay without a twinge of dissatisfaction. <br>

Racism is a favorite ploy used by many on FV to build a character.  In fact, I'd say it's hard to find any RP'er on FV that doesn't RP a racist. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

Two things though.<br>
<br>
1] Not everyone follows Verrant's lead. Neutrals almost by definition are non-judgemental, and thus not prone to such beliefs, and there a number of people of polar alignments who wrestle against the system of faction and the beliefs of their brethern.<br>
<br>
2] Those who do chose to RP as part of the racial and moral conflict should not be condemned for doing so. As has been pointed out many times elsewhere, good and evil are tangible in EQ. Unlike the real world, the two sides are very clear cut. Thats part of what appeals to people who emerse themselves in the genre of fantasy... Yes, there are shades of grey on FV, but light and dark are easy to see here, formidible opponents lined up, snarling, against each other on the battlefield of life. <br>
<br>
The word &quot;racism&quot; has such intense and immediate implications in the real world, that by using it--whether you meant to or not--you cast a shadow on a lot of people that wasnt really fair. <br>
<br>
Making judgements on people based on their race or religion is a frightening mindset when taken into reality... but EQ isnt reality, and RP shouldnt be mistaken for that. <br>
<br>
Elves vs Iksar = not racism<br>
<br>
humans vs humans in real life = racism<br>
<br>
Its a fine line, yes, and Im sure that there are people who cross it, but it is a line nonetheless, a line worth taking the time to understand, least you judge everyone who plays the game as &quot;racists&quot; based merely on the fact that they play the game in the first place... <br>
<br>
...which would be, a great deal, like racism.<br>
