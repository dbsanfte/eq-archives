<br>
The Childs screams echoed through the tunnels of Neriak commons, an excited clamour could be heard over the babies’ wails. <br>
<br>
“She has the mark, the sacred mark! Quick summon one of the elders! Hurry, hurry!”<br>
<br>
The clamour of many voices talking excitedly soon reached the ears of Grave Lord Grach, at the lodge of the dead. He quickly rose to his feet as a young Teir’Dal burst through the door of the lodge, breathless with excitement.<br>
<br>
The grave Lord spoke “One of the sacred mark has been born?” a swift nod from the messenger was all it took to send him running from the sacred lodge to the commons.<br>
<br>
And thus it came to be that the child, Romsca, born of the scared mark was accepted by the Lodge Of the dead as an apprentice Necromancer of Innoruuk.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The tomb was dark. Cold. Lonely. Shuddering, Romsca looked around her, the smell of rotting corpses hung in the air all around the crypt. This was the final test. The test that would prove to one and all that she was worthy of the sacred mark she wore. That she was a worthy Necromancer. Glancing down at her ankle where the symbol of Innoruuk was emblazoned on her she smiled to herself. If she completed this test she would be highly important in Neriak society. She would be guaranteed a high position in the lodge of the dead and have a mate of her choosing. She smiled to herself, having this mark had certainly made life easier for her she had been trained to be a Necromancer but because of the mark had suffered little of the hard ships other apprentices did. She had been treated well, as the mark showed she was a true daughter of Innoruuk. Looking around the crypt with the cobweb ridden corpses, some rotting, others deformed she couldn’t help but chuckle. This test, designed to test an apprentices stomach and nerve was easy. All she had to do was to stay in the crypt with the dead and the undead, two things she had been around all her life anyway. All she had to do was stay there for one day.<br>
Soon, as night fell the undead would wake, but she could control them.<br>
She wasn’t scared.<br>
This was going to be easy.<br>
Just easy.<br>
<br>
Romsca glanced up from her perch on a stone coffin, something had moved. <br>
Strange, she thought, surely it couldn’t be nighttime yet? Then again you couldn’t tell what hour it was locked in this crypt.<br>
Grasping her unholy staff she arose, watching the spot where the movement had caught her eye, it was over by a gold ornate coffin, rather grander than the rest. Approaching cautiously, staff at the ready she examined the coffin’s markings quickly.<br>
“Interesting” she whispered to herself, “a great Teir’Dal Lord who died at sea, his body washing up in a shipwreck…<br>
Approaching still closer, Romsca gagged at the putrid smell that rose from the coffin. She gasped, as she saw water escaping from the base of the coffin. The coffin had been down here for hundreds of years. How could there be water?<br>
Confused and shaking her head, she began to back away. When a pink, mangled soaked arm raised itself from within the golden coffin. <br>
Romsca immediately drew her staff and began to chant…loudly and commanding. <br>
“Rath, Rath!, usstan quarth ol!  Back I command you to go back! I control you!”<br>
The blast of energy shot from Romsca’s staff surrounding the golden tomb making it glisten magically. Blinded by the light Romsca shut her ruby red eyes for a moment.<br>
A moment later she reopened them to inspect what she hoped would be a lifeless corpse sent back to sleep by her magic.<br>
She almost choked with fear.<br>
<br>
<br>
The creature stood about six foot tall, it had long pink arms, and the skin stripped bare revealing just bone and muscle. The creature’s ribs were choked with seaweed and algae. One eye remained on its face, the other dangling lifelessly on its stalk, worms and maggots darting in and out of his nostril. The stench was not like normal death. It stank of salt water and fish and almost overpowered the terrified necromancer. She had never seen an undead able to withstand her spells.<br>
<br>
<br>
“P..p..Please she stammered”, backing away from the abomination, her feet slipping through the soft tissue of bodies on the floor. I command you not to harm me. I COMMAND YOU!<br>
<br>
The voice was like death itself, a faint whisper. The creature was speaking, its toothless mouth contorting into a maniacal grin with a half a tongue protruding from the patches of worm ridden flesh on its skull. <br>
“I have been waiting fro one ssso worthy to joinnn mee here in undeathh, a pretty littlee one likee you that bears such a saacredd mark will beee an ideal companion.”<br>
<br>
A scream so quiet as it was choked by fear erupted from Romsca’s throat. She was scared. She had never been scared before. The zombie beckoned to the ornate coffin, which Romsca could see was full to the brim with dark murky water. <br>
“Waterss lovelly my deearr” the abomination wheezed, his hand shooting out and grabbing Romsca by the throat. He pulled the trembling necromancer to the coffin, and forced her head underwater. <br>
“You willl sooon bee quite at homee here…” the creature grinned.<br>
<br>
Blackness, nothing but blackness. Romsca was overcome by fear and terror as the water flooded in through her facial orifices. The water was salty and stuffed up every sense with its putridity as she was held under. She was going to die. She could tell. An untimely death for one chosen by Innoruuk. She thrashed about vainly. The powerful grip of what would seen be her undead husband holding her down like a vice. She could hear his cackles through the clinging water.<br>
 Then blackness.<br>
Yet more blackness.<br>
She was drowning.<br>
<br>
Suddenly there was a light. Bright. Glowing. It erupted all around her feet. She could see it through the murky depths of the water. The symbol on her leg was glowing; she thrashed about wildly as she noticed the creatures grip was loosening. Forcing her head up out of the water, her thick black hair matted across her face, she looked around. The symbol on her ankle was glowing red as she turned to face the zombie. <br>
<br>
The creature was backing away, what remained of his eyes transfixed on the glowing emblem on her ankle. He looked across at her his face contorting even more than it already was.<br>
“Y.y.you are blessed…” he choked, sea foam oozing from his face.<br>
A deafening shriek soon followed as the emblem flashed brightly once more and the creature was consumed by unholy flame.<br>
<br>
Romsca sat. Shivering in the coffin. Alone in the darkness. She was unsure what had happened but she new something. She had to get out. She was not staying here. Something else might awake. Clambering swiftly across the corpses and coffins she reached the exit of the seperechul dragging herself out of the crypt. She had failed the test. She would have to leave Neriak, and go out into the world. She was alone.<br>
<br>
Stumbling wildly still full of fear, Romsca staggered out of Nekultos Forest where the crypt had been located and into Lavastorm mountains. Here, she collapsed on a rock. It was dark, lava crawlers slithered across her, as she lay paralysed by fear at the events in the test. Suddenly a light caught her eye, a door like orifice nearby. Slowly dragging herself across the rocks, which dug into her skin. Looking up she saw a sign on the rock face. A sign, which read..,<br>
<br>
“Fireforge Keep”<br>
<br>
