<br>
I read the threads about class roles and what everyone had to say about them and what would be the best group composition.  I must say I learned many things from it.  It was all very interesting, even the disagreements (well, especially the disagreements ;-).  But it all seemed very... hmmm... Theoretical to me :-)<br>
<br>
I hunted with a group with a &quot;correct&quot; composition only once so far, and it was in a well-organized guild raid in Runnyeye.  We had a wizard, a cleric, an enchanter, a monk and two rogues.  That's the closest I ever came to the group composition suggested by some notable scholars and theoricians visiting this board :-)  I'm level 30 now and a rogue.  I pulled and tanked for a group made up of me and three clerics a couple times.  Yesterday, I shared the meat shield job (tanking) with a shaman for a full group made up mostly of int casters.  Who said rangers should not try to tank? ;-)  Advices on class role and best group composition are hmmm... interesting :-)<br>
<br>
Now, I know this post has to sound like a rant, so I would like to add a few things about what I consider to be &quot;The perfect group&quot;.  <br>
<br>
1)  No freaky loot hogs.<br>
People who loot corpses before the fights are over are the worse.<br>
<br>
2) People who learned languages beside their own.<br>
I am getting tired to have to translate for the elves and humans who did not bother to learn each other languages.  I think by level 30, any good elf who does not speak human and any human who does not speak elvish should stop whatever ther are doing and learn a second language :-)  I don't know if this is as common a problem with the dark races.  I know most gnomes and dwarves I met knew a couple secondary languages.  Maybe the elves and humans just have it too easy from the start and never see the point of learning languages until much later in game though... <br>
<br>
3) A leader.<br>
I'm not even asking for a good leader, just to have one!<br>
What I mean by leader is someone who is in charge of deciding with the puller when it's time to invite critters to the party.  I also mean someone who will confront the loot hogs about their greedy behavior.  Once, we had this druid in the group who was leader.  He was in charge of calling the names of people whose turn to loot it was.  Alpha loot with a hall monitor ;-)  But it worked well and the casters had a fair share for once.  <br>
<br>
When I think of what would constitute the perfect group, that's the first things that come to mind.  Group composition is not something I expect to be worried about before I'm level 45 or more.  Until then, I will enjoy the new challenges and opportunities unusual group mixes offer.  I say let us be creative and original while we can.  I say let's try new things every day :-)<br>
<br>
But thanks for the advices everyone :-)<br>

<br>
&quot;The Perfect Group&quot;:<br>
The core of a perfect or well balanced group finds root in what is sometimes called the &quot;golden triangle&quot; or the &quot;holy trinity&quot;:  a Warrior (meat-shield, aggro-manager, damage dealer), a Cleric (hp and ac buffer, damage healer, and ressurecter) and an Enchanter (crowd controller and buffer (melee haste and caster clarity).  <br>
<br>
The &quot;trinity&quot; slots can, to a certain extent, be subsituted for other classes:<br>
Warrior - paladin, monk, sk, ranger, rogue, bard - not necessarily in that order;<br>
Cleric - druid, shaman, paladin, necromancer (yes smart necros can keep a tank alive);<br>
Enchanter - any class that has root or mez/stun can sort of stand-in for an enchanter...but in truth there is no real replacement for an enchanter.<br>
<br>
The problem with substitution is that the further you stray from the core classes (particularly with the cleric and enchanter) the more inefficient the group becomes (i.e. more downtime for inefficient healers to med up and the more time spent trying to &quot;pull singles&quot; without the benefit of safe crowd control).<br>
<br>
With a solid trinity built, the remaining 3 slots are all about tweaking or &quot;greasing the wheels&quot; as I like to call it.  As an example, a necro is an excellent &quot;wheel greaser&quot; in a group:  he can give mana to the cleric and enchanter (or any other caster for that matter), his low cost dots add efficient damage to each mob, his pet likewise adds more melee damage without sacrificing a group slot, he can perform very efficient damage reduction (by the way of dot heals), he can help split and control very mess pulls by way of mez, root, invulnerability and feign death and he can also ressurect in a crunch to cut down on corpse recovery time.  <br>
<br>
This is true of almost every other caster class, althought they do it in different ways (shamans have excellent dots, their massive slows reduce the amount of mana spent by clerics healing, their buffs enhance the damage dealt by tanks, their regeneration decreases the amount of damage taken by tanks, etc....)<br>
<br>
Aside from the social perspective (grouping with nice people), the perfect group is whatever you feel comfortable with in a given situation.  For example, if I was in deep chardok or howling stones, I would want a necro with me who could res as in a wipeout situation (assuming the necro was able to FD safely) he/she would cut-down on corpse recovery dramatically.<br>

<br>
Especially on this server, where groups can be hard to come by, the only real perfect group is one that doesn't get you killed too fast.<br>
<br>
I'd say a healer of some type is pretty critical, as is someone who can swing a weapon (but, then, I'm an enchanter and prone to die quick without either, so I'm biased)<br>
<br>
I agree that Loot Hogs are lame, but don't agree that looting while a fight is going is the lowest of lows. Often in the groups I'm in (especially in a dungeon, like Permafrost), the corpses start to pile up, which can make it hard for me to target stuff. I'm guilty of looting while the fight is going, in other words, but I'm anything but a loot hog. Split on, fair share on merchant muck, need before greed but throw something in the pot if you win the roll (i.e. if you win a better weapon than you have, throw the one you have in and let everyone roll) has always worked for me.<br>
<br>
By the time you've got to 30, I agree you ought to have learned Human. Far as I know, hardly anyone speaks Elvish in groups anymore, but it might be all the halflings and dwarves I'm partial to hanging out with <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Good group leaders are a bonus, but too often the leader attitude spills over into bossy buffoon, who is all to quick to order folks around and ruin the fun. I know that sounds hypocritical coming from your typically bossy enchantress, but there's a difference between someone telling the numbskull tanks when to assist (to keep us all from dying) and the bossy warrior telling me when to meditate (figured that one out about level 4 when I got the skill, thanks...)<br>
<br>
Number one criteria for me is people who aren't afraid of a little adventure. Give me a dungeon over a dreary outdoor experience grind any day.<br>

1 Enchanter<br>
5 Wizards<br>
<br>
Simple strategy:  All the wizards syncronize their biggest nukes, and the enchanter times his/her Memory Blur-type spell to hit RIGHT after the wizards all hit.<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOOOM!!  Major nukes landed... then half a second later the mob forgets about it all, and it's time for the group to wait until the next round of nukes.  I've never seen Memory Blur resisted, and I don't even think it's possible.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is the potental for KSing after the mem blur.  But... if someone Kill Steals from this group, they better be ready for MAJOR payback.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, did you just spend all that time, health, and mana knocking your mob down to 1/4th health?  Sorry if you mind, but we're going to mem blur then NUKE THE LIVING PISS out of your mob.  PS - Don't ever KS us again, ok?&quot;<br>
<br>
Enchanter mezzes adds.  If it's close quarters and you can't back far enough away to use mem blur after a hit (then you shouldn't be using this strategy!) you can always have two people time Root to hit right after the nukes (just incase one is resisted)<br>
<br>
There'd probably be a lot of downtime from medding, but BOY HOWDY would it be fun!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   One could always pull less than super-strong mobs and get all the wizards on small scheduals so some nuke while others med.  I wonder what the kill-time ratio would be on that?  Probably pretty good, seeing as battles wouldn't last any time at all.<br>
<br>
Who the heck needs any lousy tanks or healers?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uspringelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spring Elf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/25/02 7:10:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The perfect group</span><hr size=1> Sounds like something done alot. AoE Bombing. Take some wiz and druids...add an enchanter or two. Can add some other classes for whatever reason. Cleric, warrior..etc. Go to Sebilis(etc)...have someone...here is where a warrior is nice...pull as many mobs as ya can...get them all to the group...enc chain cast stun....wiz/dru chain cast AoE DD. Boom boom boom....lots of dead mobs...lots of exp. 2 Enchanters is nice in case some resist one of the stuns...but can be done with one enchanter. But in that case I would say a cleric is a must. I suppose a group of 4 Wiz, 1 Druid, 2 Enchanters....would do very nice doing that...especially outdoors where you can run if need be. I have done it a few times on Luclin on MT and worked out well.

You'll spend too much time trying to pry the gnome away from the troll and once you do, you'll find parts are missing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthraallfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThraallFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/25/02 9:02:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The thing about gnomes that ..</span><hr size=1> Shaman + Bard + Monk = lots of dead mobs, and if monk is powerful enough ditch the bard.<br>
<br>
Shaman slows everything monk takes so little damage shaman almost never has to heal, and by the time monk gets hurt  MEND, Well thats some of the best XP i have ever had.  if  u wanna hit a fun dungeon with full group i say, Monk, Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Rogue, chatner, we got damage to pull no stop, and if u really are afraid ditch a rogue for druid for evac, extra damage, and backup heal.  yeah so i left myself out, opps but well i dont make killing go faster, just save the tank from dying, so depends ont he situtation and who u can find<br>

Bard     - Boh/Symphonic Saber - Twisted 4 songs flawless while mezzing and fighting at same time. Only bard I seen do this and was the puller. She was 57/58<br>
Ranger - Epic'd - Snarer/Back up Healer =)<br>
<br>
Highest Level was the paladin at 59.. lowest roughly 54<br>
<br>
5 Melee'rs<br>
5 types of healing (counting monk mend)<br>
1 Mezzer class (weak but trains should not be big anyway)<br>
3 Class's that can tank if necessary<br>
<br>
Its a messed up group but you get all the right gear and skilled players.. you can rock a zone like no other I have seen in the game done with exceptions of the fun AOE kill teams for fear.<br>
<br>
why a a paladin.. why not.. they dmg and at least can REZ when ya should have had a porter in the group or somebody got killed when they shouldn't have plus no cleric was on server at the time =) that we all knew when made the group up out of boredom.<br>
<br>
We Killed Every Single Mob from D1/D2 and up to Pulling Temple back to D2 in Sebilis... <br>
<br>
Gotta Love Oddball Groups everyone got 3 good items minimum in less than 2 hrs of play. Not alone speaking of the xp that was obtained.<br>
<br>
But what makes a good group.. depends on situation and skill of players and how they communicate with what they are able to do. Most of all... have fun and experiment and enjoy the game.<br>

enchantress (me) <br>
2 wizards <br>
2 magics<br>
cleric<br>
<br>
The other five were all gnomes.  This was in the high teens, in the warrens.  Nothing ever *touched* us.<br>
<br>
I have had a group described to me as one of the most &quot;efficient&quot; for dungeons, that I'd like to try.  It was: <br>
<br>
warrior<br>
cleric<br>
enchantress<br>
3 wizards.<br>
<br>
The perfect group to me is made up of people who work well together.  Everything else is secondary.<br>
