If we both spend about the same amount of time doing each, in the end you end up with my money...I get your beverages...but have no money to buy other gear with...which you can then go buy with my money, as well as buying supplies to make more beverages. I can try and hunt places where gear drops...but if I do that, they are notorious for not dropping much in the way of money. Which then makes it difficult for me to buy any of your fine beverages. <br>
<br>
I think that what I shall do is patronize those I believe are selling at a fair price in MY mind, not theirs. Personally I don't care how much something costs you to make. I have a price that I think is fair for that item. If you are above it, and some one else is below it....guess who I will buy from?<br>

No shit.  I had about 120k Banked a few weeks ago I think I'm down to like 25K now.<br>
<br>
Shelling out 1-3k a day for regeants sucks.<br>
On the POM raid I bought 10 Stacks of Pearls and 20Stacks of Dots....That wasn't exactly fun. On an avg raid We probably spend somewhere around 2k or so.  Now Times that by 5 or 6 and you have where are money goes.  Spending 15-20k a week on regeants is not fun.<br>
<br>
Not to mention various other things you'll wind up buying that you may see.<br>

<br>
The simple fact is, SOE designed tradeskills so that to reach the upper echelons, you have to pay huge amounts in both time and cash to skill up.<br>
<br>
Someone starting from scratch has an interest in seeing that prices remain at a rate so that one can skill up and making enough in return to at least defray part of the skill up costs.<br>
<br>
Someone who has a boat load of cash and is willing to blow it to skill up doesn't have the same goal.<br>
<br>
This process is exacerbated by Mudflation.  Try selling a Tradeskill Item, like say, a 3AC 35HP Ring, for anywhere near the Cost to make it.  I doubt you'll find a buyer.<br>
<br>
There is only a market for a tiny subset of Tradeskill Produced items.  Tradeskillers generally hope that profits from the select few will cover the huge losses incurred during the skill up process, which seems a reasonable hope.<br>
<br>
Price Fixing is perfectly fine if you can manage it.  This is a Video Game, not the stock market.  Capitalism doesn't exist in EQ, there are no Business Ethics other than don't lie, cheat, or steal.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bippinfv>bippinfv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elf-hugger</span><br>  Posts: 1215<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/28/03 5:22:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2856.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A trip down memory lane...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We have managed to stabilize the brewed item market for damn near a year<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yup, as pointed out, this is called a cartel, or price fixing, and is illegal in most places. And you come here to complain someone is lowering your profit margins? <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What the world needs to understand is that profit in EQ isn't like profit in RL.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
First, I'm not sure the world really needs to understand this. I have a few other things in mind the world might be better off understanding first.<br>
But nonetheless, let me address the argument as well. Profit in EQ is exactly the same as profit in RL. All the things you mentioned, e.g. time to farm ingredients, cost of skilling up, have completely equivalent costs IRL, such as the cost of buying or producing ingredients, the cost and time of education and training, etc. All that, is completely irrelevant to how prices are determined. Prices are determined by two things, and two things only: supply, and demand. Where those two meet, is the price point. In actuality, this works less than optimally on EQ, and FV in particular, due to the lack of equal and freely available information. Let me elaborate a bit.<br>
Different people will have different value from the same product, and different amounts of disposable cash. Therefore the price they'll be willing to pay will be different. Sellers will likewise have different value for their production. Yes, the base is probably the cost of ingredients, but the profit margin they expect on top of that will differ. You will want say, 400% profit, to cover your skill ups, and reagents, and equipement costs. Someone else, who also hunts for their gear, for example, will only need to cover skill ups and reagents, and will settle for 200% profit. Those that don't value the product as highly as you, will not pay your price, and will buy from that other guy.<br>
If you think enough people are willing to pay your prices, heck, just buy him out. I dislike the practice, but enough people do that - buy him out, and resell in your marked up higher price. If you're wrong, then, tough. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You should charge what the market will bear; percentages of profit vs. cost to produce are meaningless. Selling out of a difficult item to make overnight is an indication that your price is too low. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Oh, now really? That's the new World according to Chase? There might be other ways of how people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>should</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do things than what you propose?<br>
You know, the RL market has many strategies to offer, and one of them is selling more in volume, for less profit per unit, but with a higher total profit. If you're not selling overnight, that might mean you're pricing too high, can't it?<br>
Plus, not everyone is trying to maximize profit, like you are suggesting. Their value function might be different than yours. Maybe they gain satisfaction from selling at what they think is a fair price (I didn't see you accusing anyone of selling for a loss, yet, even, so they are still making profit, just less than what you would have, had you sold). Maybe they want to move the stuff fast, and make more tomorrow - shooting for volume? <br>
<br>
Summary: It's a free market, everyone can sell at whatever price they deem fair, and buy for whatever price they deem fair. Rejoice in the profit you made already, and in the fact that you can still make a profit. And hope it isn't Bend that you're up against *chuckle* , as he might take to heart your ranting and kill your market, as he did with tinkering, he does have strong views on what he deems unfair profit margins.<br>

As someone already stated, this is absolutely false. I am not level 65. I will probably never be level 65. However, I am not so naive as to think that you stop needing money at any level. There are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> expenses.<br>
