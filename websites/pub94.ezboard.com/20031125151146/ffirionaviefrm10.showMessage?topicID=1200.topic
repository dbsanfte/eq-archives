She had sent the letter with reasonable confidence that he would be interested, and wish to hear more. It had read:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Zildrax,<br>
<br>
There is a plot to asassainate you. I am not wholly unsympathetic to your actions. Come to Kurns tower, I shall divulge the details. If I lie, you can kill me.<br>
<br>
Seuinye</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She had written it in Dark Elvish, and sent it to intercept him in the Plane of Knowledge. She took a risk coming here alone, but knew it would pay off. From what she had learned of the Iksar, he was very strong, and would not fear coming to find her alone, on his home turf.<br>
<br>
She felt his eyes long before she could see, or even hear him. They seemed to pierce her very soul, and she could not help but smile lightly at the inspection. She remained hidden in the shadows, hearing and seeing the abnormally large scorpions as they wandered by, unaware of her.<br>
<br>
Finally, he came padding over the dunes, the spectral wolf almost drifting next to him, it's steps making no mark, no sound. The Iksar moved with amazing grace, and rapidity. The whisps of the spirit world could be sensed about him, their powers imbued within him.<br>
<br>
He stopped a good ten paces from her, the ghostly companion ever by his side, emotionless. &quot;Why did you contact me, softskin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For protection. Our houses are at war... I want mine salvaged... and I have information you could use,&quot; she replied, both using the Teir'Dal tongue, both with equal ease.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would I bargin to save the life of a softskin, to save the house of one who has killed one of my brothers?&quot; he replied, his tone even, almost joking. &quot;I can protect myself against any asassain... any who might succeed in killing me would merely bring the power of the Empire down upon them, their family, their house.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To save your life. I have information which will do so... Your <br>
asassain is a strong one... wiley. You would do well to fear them.&quot;<br>
<br>
He considered her words for many moments, and nodded. &quot;Give me your information, and we will... discuss... your house. Who is this asassain?&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed, as if wanting to discuss the terms first, but shrugged lightly, not having the tools to bargin against him. &quot;Me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zildrax frowned slightly, looking at the Teir'Dal with something <br>
nearing bewilderment. At that very moment, one of the skeletons which wandered the Field of Bone dug two daggers deep into Zildrax's back. The black daggers were poisoned, he could tell, and quickly he felt his torso going numb.  Wordlessly, the spirit companion lept into battle, toppling the skeleton, tearing at the bones which made up the animation.<br>
<br>
Zildrax snarled at the Teir'Dal, who's skin was quickly peeling back from her bones, another skeleton jeering back at him. His spells were fast and true, poisoning and diseasing the Teir'Dal as the numbness entered his limbs. She quickly countered with her own spells, and he braced himself, expecting to feel the essence drained from him.  Instead, he heard a howl, the essence of his companion spirit flowing across the air to fill Seuinye's life force, repairing the damage his spells had done.<br>
<br>
The two continued like this for a few moments, until Zildrax could no longer move, the poison having taken full effect. Seuinye's animation was dead, but the spirt companion had too been sent back to it's domain, having it's life force sucked wholely into the Necromancer. Seuinye's skin returned, and she fell to her knees, panting from exhaustion and pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well fought, Iksar. I knew I could not beat you face to face... so I cheated. Now, it is time for you to listen to me.&quot; She pulled a wicked dagger from her leathers, and approached him. &quot;I have not yet lied... you are not dead, Zildrax. For two reasons. My instructions indicated that death was a secondary consideration to your pain. And, as I mentioned in my letter, I am not wholly unsympathetic to your actions against the Necropolis. Still, you are Iksar, and your kind has killed a very good friend of mine. Perhaps it was even you... I know not.&quot;<br>
<br>
She began to make a cut from the top of the Iksar's head, carefully only piercing the skin, leaving as many scales as possible intact as her slice continued. &quot;In any rate... you will know pain, Zildrax, and the Necropolis will be appeased by that pain. As will my goddess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her cuts continued down his body, as she began to skin him alive, using little bits of her life force to keep him from dying. &quot;And if you retribute against me, or my house, I *will* return. And I *will* kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zildrax's cursed himself for allowing this to happen, his own overconfidence had gotten him in this situation. The pain registering but forced back with sheer will. 'Filthy blueskin whelp, I’ll rip off YOUR flesh!’ he wanted to scream, yet the poison prevented him from doing so. He stifled a scream as she pealed back half of the skin from his head, the right side of his face nothing now but muscle and cartlidge.<br>
<br>
The physical pain of the experience was excruciating, but it was only a twinge to the sheer humiliation that he felt right now. He was at the mercy of this pitiful lesser beast, and he had fallen into her trap so easily. He was an Iksar Hierophant, how could he possibly have let this happen, how could he possibly lose to this animal!? No, he would not lose, he could not lose. With this poison in his blood he likely couldn’t win a fight, but he would not let this creature get the satisfaction it desired. As if sympathetic to his struggle to regain his pride, the spirits within Kurns let out a whispered moan. Zildrax began inwardly processing the thoughts to call on those very spirits.<br>
<br>
The poison’s effects began to leave him, obviously much faster than she had anticipated, as she began work on his stiff arm. If only... he focused all his will on moving his left hand a bit. Slowly his hand complied, finishing the somantic component of the spell he carefully focused on.<br>
<br>
Seuinye caught on too late to his actions, the blast of poison knocking her back into the tower base, her vision turning grey before recovering.  ‘Next time, blueskin, it will be me skinning you. And I'll be sure to repay the rest of your house in kind, as well.’ The pain he felt uttering those words was obvious in the somewhat tormented tone of his voice, but he clearly felt the threat was important enough to endure it.<br>
<br>
She heard him say, followed by the incantation and magical flash of a gate spell. She sighed, upset with herself, but knew there was little more that she could do at this point. She too cast for a gate, the skin she had managed to remove from him bundled before her.<br>
<br>
She arrived in New Taanan, and made for the freeport stone. After a few hours of tortorus journey - her body still rent from his last blast, she found her destination. She walked past the guards of the dark city, not completely exiled from the halls though many wished she were. She stood in the center of the courtyard, and called out. &quot;D'ron Kar.&quot;<br>
<br>
She waited, and as the Teir'Dal walked out the shadows into the courtyard, she painfully tossed the skin to him, the scales on it rattling slightly. &quot;As per our agreement, he has been given pain...greater pain than he has ever known before. But he is strong... stronger than I could handle alone. He lives still.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seuinye could sense his disappointment, and smirked quietly. &quot;No - I will not hold you to the rest of our agreement - as I was unable to kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned and walked out of the Necropolis, casting for a gate and disappearing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/23/03 12:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1200.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Zildrax's Pain</span><hr size=1> D'RonKarr bent down and picked up the scaled piece of skin.   He fingered it as Saryrn's Hand spoke to him, and nodded.   <br>
<br>
&quot;You have done more than any of the others that were sent after him in the past, I believe.  He is a mighty iksar in his prime and well versed in his studies.  Failure in taking him out is not a disgrace, only not trying would have been.  <br>
It is a shame that there could not have been there to assist, but then if there had been, I suppose he would have sensed it....and known immediately.&quot;<br>
<br>
The half breed watched as Seuinye walked away and then added, &quot;And if you should so desire, you can still ask for that favor in the future.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He fingered the trophy in his hands as he walked back into the depths of the city, <br>
  Too bad it wasn't the whole hide that was going to be nailed to the wall,  preferably with Zildrax within it,  but at least he had not been able to kill his would-be assassin this time.  <br>
<br>
D'Ron rummaged through  a crate in his room.<br>
<br>
And maybe, just maybe, he would not be so enthusiastic about attacking the city again.  If he did, there would be another price to pay.  And maybe the whole hide.....<br>
<br>
D'Ron found what he was looking for, and proceeded to streach out and nail the hide section to the main door of the new Necropolis.<br>
<br>

&quot;A dish best served cold....&quot; she thought as she began to walk back to the temple.  When D'Ron Karr had told his plan she had hoped to see the death of the minion of the Empire. But in other ways, this was a better outcome.  Death is such a temporary matter, the wheel would turn and Zildrax's soul would be reborn.... better this.  <br>
<br>
This way she still knew the name of her enemy. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well done D'Ron Karr, &quot; she whispered, &quot;The Lord Thule is pleased this day.
