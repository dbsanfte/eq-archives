The assassin was wearing new armor, ravenscale from the swamp, he was sure if the shack had a mirror he would be preening in it. <br>
<br>
“It is most profitable.” Malingrad reached into his pack and brought out a small leather sack. He slid it across the table.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth picked it up and looked inside. Gemstones winked back at him in the dull light of the room. “You have done well indeed.” The necromancer replied giving the pouch over to his mother. He knew she would be placing it in the family vault upon their return to the League Mansion. He got a bit of amusement at seeing the momentary flash of emotion rush through his brother. <br>
<br>
First there was his usual smug satisfaction when he handed over the pouch, then surprise as it was given to his mother for safekeeping, this emotion was followed by anger, when he realized he would not be getting his reward back. Finally fear washed away anger. Tithing was something all house members did. This was the first time he had ever contributed something personal to house Waes’Harventhar. He got a curious sense of satisfaction from it.<br>
<br>
“Where is Bliss?” Malingrad had heard about the run in his sister and younger brother had. <br>
<br>
“She is on an errand for us. Something in second gate.” Naelaelayle growled.<br>
<br>
Malingrad looked at his mother carefully, he had hoped to see her open the chest that had squatted in the corner of their shack for years, and perhaps get a peek at what lay inside. He had tried to open the chest once as a young rogue, he still had nightmares about the pain. Now the chest was gone. He had the good grace not to ask about it.<br>
<br>
“You have something for me to do?” Malingrad asked carefully. He still had an assignment to carry out for the Ragar’Golhyrr. It would be an easy one. He had already discussed the details with some of the other assasins involved in the house war. It really was laughable how these houses thought they controlled affairs. Both had contracted outsiders to do much of their dirty work and those they contracted with had already planned out who would die and when. The Ebon Mask pulled the strings of the houses now. Their destinies lay in the palm of the Rogue’s House. It had already been decided that the Ragar’Golhyrr would win this war since they paid better.<br>
<br>
“It shall be a small matter.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
Malingrad was beginning to learn about his brother’s sense of humor. It was as if someone entirely new inhabited the shell he had grown up with.<br>
<br>
“Speak the words and you will shall be done.” Malingrad replied in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
“We have been discovered, you are responsible for our security. Find out who knows and report back. Take no actions on your own.” Mael replied. He watched his brother turn pale with fear.<br>
<br>
Mal was afraid. He had two very good reasons, the first being that if an enemy house knew of the Waes’Harventhars their lives were in danger. The second was that he was ultimately responsible for the security of the house. It was his fault. His brother could order his death by torture.<br>
<br>
“The invitation.” The assassin was kicking himself, he had not taken its arrival seriously. He had always been better at planning offensive action than defensive. He realized he had not even asked to see the note. Suddenly he felt foolish and alone. He had placed his family in danger because of his interest in personal gain.<br>
<br>
“Exactly.” Naelaelayle replied. She was angry that her son had not put the information concerning the letter together on his own. It pleased her to see he was at least aware of the enormity of his failure.<br>
<br>
“May I see it?” Malingrad asked using the old tongue, using the most formal and submissive of tenses.<br>
<br>
“Pay particular attention to the coin that accompanied the invitation.” Maelgroth said handing the letter over.<br>
<br>
“None of the others were accompanied by such a trinket?” The date on the coin stood out. Such coins were scarce in Neriak, it would not be too difficult to find out who might have a supply of such old currency. Of course it could have come from a collector, or the vault of an old house.<br>
<br>
“I take it you have taken steps to protect yourselves?”<br>
<br>
“We have removed the vault and ourselves to a new location.” Naelaelayle replied. Nothing else would be shared with Malingrad until he redeemed himself.<br>
<br>
“House D’Vir knows some but not all.” Malingrad mused.<br>
<br>
“Now you begin to think.” Naelaelayle chuckled. Maelgroth was silent.<br>
<br>
“A third party, who left the coin knows our identity.” The assassin continued.<br>
<br>
“Now that you have caught up to the rest of us, find out who, how, and what they know.” Maelgroth ordered.<br>
<br>
Blisshadow stood outside the gates of house House Vlos’Shannaal (the Blood Chalice). The building bore all the marks of a shrine to Innoruk converted into a House mansion. It was a small house by any standard, but a wealthy one. She knew from her family history that this shrine had once been the property of the Waes’Harventhars, a showcase for their wealth and loyalty to the Maker. <br>
<br>
This building should have been hers, now their enemies slept in rooms meant for worship and danced where they should kneel. A cold but certain fire of hatred burned in her heart, and she knew that what she did, was with the tacit blessing of the god. Never had she felt so close to him, not when she had transcribed hymns, and written reports, not when she had groveled before her superiors, not once had she felt the sure touch of her god, but now that she embraced her family, she felt the strength of her faith growing. Innoruk was near and he whispered his will in her ear.<br>
<br>
“I seek entry into the house.” Bliss shouted. Inside she could her raucous music.<br>
<br>
The door burst open as two drunken Teir’Dal stumbled out. Their tongues stained a dark black from the wine they were besotted with. It took a moment for her to realize that these elves were the guards.<br>
<br>
“Why you wanna enter?” the first guard leered at her skeptically. He was sloppy drunk, and swayed on his feet.<br>
<br>
“This house has not paid their tithe to the church.” Bliss replied. It was true, in fact practically none of the houses paid tithe to the church anymore. It was a tradition that had lapsed out of favor. Indeed the Vlos’Shannaal had begun their rise to prominence as cup bearers during church ritual. That role had slowly moved from one of serving the church to serving themselves. All the great houses had shrines of their own, or had them at one time, they were a good place to send lower ranking family members. Over time many shrines became petty houses in their own right.<br>
<br>
“Well, you are welcome to come in and state your case to our Matron.” The other guard burped, gesturing for her to enter.<br>
<br>
The Vlos’Shannaal (Blood Chalice) might be their name, but the Xuil’Z’hindar (Wine Trippers) might be more apt a description. Security was totally lacking as she stepped over passed out house members and their insolent slaves. No one asked her why she was there, though a few made half hearted attempts to lure her into their rooms. When she asked where the matron might be found she was usually greeted with blank stares followed by a pointing finger up stairs.<br>
<br>
No doubt this house curried favor with others through entertainment and the occasional bit of blackmail. At last she found the door she sought. She knocked loudly.<br>
<br>
“Come in, and bring some more wine!” came a giggling voice.<br>
<br>
Bliss opened the door, inside the sanctuary, the most holy place in the shrine lay the quarters of the Matron of house Vlos’Shannaal. It was a disgrace. The holy chalice, a relic from the earliest days of the Teir’Dal lay upon the floor, a discarded drinking vessel, still holding the dregs of some wine, instead of the clotted blood of their enemies.<br>
<br>
“You are in violation of church law!”<br>
<br>
“Sure, sure, I will tell you what, when you can get the Chath’elg’Caress, the Ragar’Golhyrr and the Sol’Calar to pay your tithe then we shall do so, and gladly.” The matron laughed.<br>
<br>
“Very well, I shall have to post a notice of your delinquency.” Bliss said.<br>
<br>
“Post it where you will, we use them as toilet paper.”<br>
<br>
In reality, the notice had little power of its own. It simply stated that the house was not in the good graces of the church and was not under its protection. The church had never offered protection to any house at the detriment of any other, it could not act in such a manner without loosing its tenuous position of authority. As it was, the church had given up on even posting the notices, since they had become something of a joke, as houses flaunted the will of the church willfully collecting the postings.<br>
<br>
Bliss was eager to leave that den of foolishness. She had carefully tacked up the notice next to the front door, though she had her doubts it would be there for long.<br>
<br>
“It is done, master.” Bliss announced when she returned to the shack. It was quite nice, actually to come home and see her family seated around the new table she had bought. Malingrad looked like he had swallowed a tadpole though.<br>
<br>
“I take it security was lax?” Maelgroth asked.<br>
<br>
“It was non existent.”<br>
<br>
“We have acted indirectly with the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr, now we act together as a true house. We will enforce the writ of Innoruk on the Vlos’Shannaal.” Maelgroth laughed.<br>
<br>
“No one has enforced those writs for centuries.” Malingrad chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Exactly. They won’t be expecting it, and house Waes’Harventhar is within its rights to enforce payment of the writ if they so wish.”<br>
<br>
“When was the last time they paid tithe?” Maelgroth snickered.<br>
<br>
“I checked the records, they have never paid tithe, and they took possession of the shrine unlawfully.” Bliss replied.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean, unlawfully?” Malingrad asked.<br>
<br>
“Lands once given to the church always remain in the church’s hands. They cannot be passed from house to house.” Bliss replied.<br>
<br>
“So, you are saying they have stolen this land from the church?” the assassin whispered.<br>
<br>
“Indeed.”<br>
<br>
“What’s the penalty for stealing from the church.” Malingrad mused, already aware of the answer.<br>
<br>
“Death…”<br>
