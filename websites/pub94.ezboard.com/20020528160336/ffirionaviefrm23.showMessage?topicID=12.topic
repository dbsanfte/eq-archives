He has absolute control.  Of his emotions, of his body, of his magic.<br>
<br>
From a loving, compassionate boy... to a feral child, nothing but raw emotion and natural needs... to this apathatic-faced, remorseless killer, with burning passion in his eyes.<br>
<br>
It was all their fault.  The Koada`Dal.  That rare Teir`Dal was the product of two rare parents, hatred having no place in their hearts.  Then General Jyleel came, with other High Elf raiders, and the boy's parents were slain.  He killed for the first time that day, and he enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
Ironic, that a being with no hate in his soul was twisted into the Prince of Hate's greatest paradigm by the hatred of those who sought to remove a force that, without his childish ignorace, would've apalled the young Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
Now he is a Master of that force.<br>
<br>
Is Innoruuk truly evil, are the High Elves right?  This thought does not even occur to him.  For Tunare and Mithaniel and Erolissi's champions destroyed all he held dear, and it was the Prince of Hate who brought sanity, purpose, and even love back into the his life.<br>
<br>
Love?  Indeed, for he has a woman he calls his dearest, special to him beyond all other things.  She worships Innoruuk also, as a priestess, and the two are bound by the passion of their single overwhelming purpose.<br>
<br>
To destroy those who cast their once-happy lives into oblivion.<br>
<br>
The High Elves.<br>
<br>
Tunare's followers.<br>

Hands are gloved, but obviously slender, and what the hood of his black garb doesn't hide of the man's face, a veil of the same fabric does.<br>
<br>
When he speaks, his voice is soft, but with a razor edge.  His Common is even and precise, but his inflection is overly harsh.  &quot;Wine.  Chilled, if you are capable of such.&quot;<br>
<br>
The oddly-garbed fellow slumps into the nearest empty chair after speaking, seemingly exhausted.<br>

She bristles a bit at the hint of a suggestion that she can't offer whatever would make one of her customers comfortable.  She takes it as a matter of  pride that no matter what race enters her bar, it takes someone determined to be unhappy to leave without a pleasant time.  She poors the wine out into a crystal goblet normally reserved for weddings.  She wants to make sure that he is satisfied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here is your wine, sir.  Would you like some food to go with it?  You look as if you may be tired from a journey.  Or I could also reserve a room for you to rest...&quot;<br>

The man lifts the drink upwards, sliding it beneath his veil and tilting his head slightly, his features remaining concealed.  After a few sips' worth, the goblet is placed on his table, he turning to face the barmaid.<br>
<br>
His Common is, as before, precise.  The speaking is somewhat slow and deliberate, with a harsh inflection, but the dark-clad man does not stumble over any words.  Those which are mispronounced are said wrongly with the same lack of hesitation as those correctly spoken.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have nothing here I require, but for this drink and a brief respite.  The first is taken care of, and I needn't waste my time with a room when this table will suffice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Without so much as a 'thank you', the slender figure turns away from Drixa, relaxing in his chair.  The wine goes untouched.<br>

Epicurus calmly walks through. He's a tall elven man with strong features. He comes partway through and then stops. Behind him comes his brother Keliose noisily laughing and goofing around, he stumbles in and falls onto Epic's shoulders. Epic smiles at him and then looks around the bar. He quietly walks towards the table he's selected with his brother. Keliose's attitude changes drastically when he notices the dark figure in the room. Epicurus restrains him when he lunges at the figure, giving him a calming stare. They proceed to their table and have just about settled down when the door is thrown open. Standing in the doorway is a large barbarian with a sack thrown over his shoulder. He laughs and approaches the table. Epicurus greets him with a smile as he drops his knapsack down with a rattle and pulls out a bottle of blackburrow stout.<br>
&quot;Gimme somethin strong!&quot;, Keliose remarks to the Barkeep who has by now made herself known. <br>
&quot;And what do YOU want?&quot;, she asks Epicurus.<br>
&quot;Oh, Water is fine.&quot;, says Epicurus, snapping out of a daze. <br>
&quot;So anyway, Welcor...&quot;, Keliose starts as he turns to his Barbarian companion. They start joking around, a few times trying to get Epicurus to join in. But Epicurus wasn't paying attention to them... His gaze was fixed solely on the dark figure across the room. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrixa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drixa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Barmaid</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/20/01 11:39:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hatreds Champion</span><hr size=1> Drixa hurries back to the table with a strong, dark ale, a glass of chilled water, and a silent prayer that there will be no more battles within her bar....<br>
