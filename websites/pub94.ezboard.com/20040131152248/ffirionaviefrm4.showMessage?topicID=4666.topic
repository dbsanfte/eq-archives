You were so stupid, I felt you needed your own thread. <br>
<br>
Let's apply some simple logic and answer a few questions.<br>
<br>
1) Were the slaves freed by the North, or did they revolt and win freedom on their own?<br>
<br>
2) If the North was not against slavery, why didn't they have slaves? <br>
<br>
3) Why did they free the slaves if they didn't care?<br>
<br>
4) Where the hell did you &quot;learn&quot; your history?<br>
<br>
5) Slaves were set free. How was this possible if the people in power didn't want to free them? If the voters didn't care and the people in power didn't care, who the hell decided to set them free?<br>
<br>
And the South did not win. Sorry to break it to you, but the South will not &quot;rise again.&quot; I don't care where you were born; it's your own words that make people want to slap the Racist lable on you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=themadhatter106>The Mad Hatter 10 6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 247<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/03 10:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4666.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Xerazia</span><hr size=1> Actually, I would say it is his own words that just make people want to slap him.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

&quot;1) Were the slaves freed by the North, or did they revolt and win freedom on their own?&quot;<br>
<br>
What I said was: the Civil War did not free the slaves.  And it didn't.  Use google if you don't believe me, because I don't really feel like citing that which I deem common knowledge to anyone who graduated from high school.<br>
<br>
Abraham Lincoln did not free the slaves.  The emancipation proclamation did not free the slaves.  The thirteenth ammendment freed the slaves.  Now look at the date of when the Civil War ended, and when the Thirteenth ammendment was made.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying the South won.  However, the North had far more casualties.  My point was, stop trying to act like everyone who lives in a certain state is racist or incompetant.  I am tired of people trying to use someone's location to disprove anything they said.<br>
<br>
As already stated, if it matters, my ancestors did not even live in this country at the time of the Civil War.  I don't see how I'm racist, but I do see how one of us is employing reverse racism.<br>
<br>
PS.  If you can disprove any of the above, do so.  But you will not be able to.  Because everything I have stated is a truth and if it were not, I would not have the GPA that I do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xeraziaxuai>Xerazia Xuai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/03 10:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4666.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Xerazia</span><hr size=1> Racism exists everywhere, brother.

Ok...how many minorities were in Congress or sitting on the Supreme Court to help pass this ammendment? It was passed because there were actually enough white people that wanted it to. Why? Because they felt slavery was wrong. <br>

Hence the North did not free the slaves.  The North is dead.  The South is dead.  We are one, and have been since Lee surrendered. <br>
<br>
Had Lincoln kept his word, your claim to North superiority might be worth something.  But he didn't.  Every historian I know will tell you that the Emancipation Proc. was made to keep foreign countries from forming alliances with the South.  Because there societies had long since purged slavery, and therefore not much public support would go towards aiding a country fighting to keep slavery.<br>
<br>
I don't see your point.  I never said &quot;white&quot; people didn't want the slaves freed.  I said that the &quot;North&quot; misconstrued their reason for entering the war.  And the south didn't succeed from the North because the North tried to free the slaves, either.  They succeeded because Abraham Lincoln was elected and was against the &quot;expansion&quot; of slavery, but said states that already had slavery should continue to have it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tudilfv>TudilFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/15/03 11:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4666.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Xerazia</span><hr size=1> The emancipation proclamation freed all slaves that were held in Rebel controlled lands, It did not free any slaves that were in lands controlled by the north.

<br>
The 13th amendmant abolished slavery, because even Southern states were realizing, that slavery was evil.<br>
<br>
The civil war was fought over states rights, more than the right to keep slaves. If the South had won, indidvidual states would have more control over themselves and the Federal government would have been weakened drastically.<br>

GPA?? You're smart because you have the GPA that you do?<br>
<br>
Hate to break it to you, but GPA, while it supposedly means something, also means you simply completed your work in a timely manner and handed it in.<br>
<br>
Plenty of intelligent people have distressingly low GPA's. Those people don't use the: I must be smart because I have a 4.0, excuse.<br>
<br>
They prove it by word, action and deed.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, slight hijack of the whole thing here. I've always hated and been annoyed by the, my gpa is higher than yours, so I'm smarter than you, analogy. :P<br>

And, if you don't think that way, its fine, but don't imply that intelligence/common sense = GPA stats.<br>

Ok, let me get this straight. You have the GPA that you do, not because you're smart, but because you didn't lie ?<br>

<br>
Pure genius.<br>
<br>
Now, down to fact.  The civil war, and the internal diplomacy within the conflict, and America at the time was *****NOT***** just for states rights, Abolitionism was a strong force in the North regardless.<br>
<br>
Now that I've said that, let me delve deeper into the subject for you as I can see you've refrained from reading popular literature on the subject and more or less have stuck to...I'm guessing here, but a high school American history course?<br>
<br>
The Civil war was fought on the bases of many ideals.  States rights, abolitionism, social issues not including slavery, these were the basis for the civil war rhetoric.<br>
<br>
The E.P. was not to just keep European powers from intervening, actually it was one of the lesser happenings in the civil war that contributed to Britain not assisting the confederacy, if you look more carefully, Confederate naval defeat swayed the British foreign policy much more then the proclamation,  the proclamation by the way appealed mostly to the European commoner, rather than the more elite class who were far more interested in the cheaply produced southern cotton.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The emancipation proclamation freed all slaves that were held in Rebel controlled lands, It did not free any slaves that were in lands controlled by the north. So, in essence, Lincoln and the North did free slaves, just not any that they had any contrl over.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A commonly held view among those who have some education in American history, however it is also incomplete.  The Emancipation Proclamation did indeed free all slaves that  were in lands controlled by the confederacy, but Lincolns personal writings and the views of his cabinet were clearly, and I accentuate the word clearly here, to the end goal of abolishing slavery, and you can also clearly see that slavery post C-War in those remaining areas lasted only a quick second.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The 13th amendmant abolished slavery, because even Southern states were realizing, that slavery was evil.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Agreed, yet you miss the fact that slavery was always seen as evil, by both sides, even from the beginning of the American nation itself.  Slave owners saw slavery as a tolerable evil, and promised to themselves one day it would stop, just not now. (Procrastination is a common theme in American history).  Now, around the beginning and during the Civil war, the south became STAUNCHLY pro-slavery, and pro-states rights, which essentially resulted in slavery, this occurred because their system was being fundamentally attacked, and despite the previous views present that slavery was bad, they still did not want to end it, so various excuses arose from the situation, some examples being: Education for slaves, a home for slaves, a religious experience for slaves , the confederacy began to see slavery as a good thing, because they were defending the status quo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Had Lincoln kept his word, your claim to North superiority might be worth something. But he didn't. Every historian I know will tell you that the Emancipation Proc. was made to keep foreign countries from forming alliances with the South. Because there societies had long since purged slavery, and therefore not much public support would go towards aiding a country fighting to keep slavery.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
*cough cough* He did keep his word, slavery was abolished in confederate states and soon, but later in other areas, very swiftly i might add.<br>
<br>
I'd like to point out some extremely famous historians that would disagree with you that the E.P. was made to keep foreign countries out of forming alliances with the south.  IT was a contributing factor but DEFINITELY not the reason the E.P. was made, you fail to take into account the myriad of other reasons.<br>
<br>
Stephen Ambrose, one of the most famous American historians would fundamentally disagree with your view.<br>
<br>
Robert R. Remini would also fundamentally disagree with your view.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because there societies had long since purged slavery, and therefore not much public support would go towards aiding a country fighting to keep slavery<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This specifically deserves comment as it is for the most part very short sighted.  Public support was really not a pre-requisite for European action at the time, especially in the nations that were in negotiations with the south.  Cotton, and shipping trades were of the paramount importance, which you fail to mention.  Also, as soon as the south was absolutely destroyed by Union naval power, the European countries cut ties.  You can even find an incident where Southern diplomats were taken off of a British naval vessel, such was the Union naval power present at the time, yet Britain did not react other than to condemn the action of boarding their ship and removing diplomats.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't see your point. I never said &quot;white&quot; people didn't want the slaves freed. I said that the &quot;North&quot; misconstrued their reason for entering the war. And the south didn't succeed from the North because the North tried to free the slaves, either. They succeeded because Abraham Lincoln was elected and was against the &quot;expansion&quot; of slavery, but said states that already had slavery should continue to have it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The North had more than 1 reason, you fail to see that, abolishment of slavery, pro-federalism, pro-nationalism , progressivism in general, as well as economic evolution from the concentrated economy of the south.  You can also CLEARLY see that Lincoln's views change after he gains support from Kentucky and Missouri I believe they were, and he becomes much more pro-abolitionism.  You though, have failed to locate the intricacies of the situation, you may think you have the right view, but it is definitely not as black and white as you think it is.  It was a multi basis war.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What I said was: the Civil War did not free the slaves. And it didn't. Use google if you don't believe me, because I don't really feel like citing that which I deem common knowledge to anyone who graduated from high school.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The Civil War contributed DIRECTLY to the abolition of slavery.  Want to debate that point?  You can google all you want, I read history.  Your pompous attitude of apathy, and clearly patronizing statement that ends that quotation above clearly shows the inability present to defend your point.  I ask you, I implore you to offer me any basis to say that the Civil War did not directly lead to the freedom of slaves, and the ending of slavery in the United States.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm not saying the South won. However, the North had far more casualties. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Casualties are a fact of war, you miss the point of destruction, please research the happenings to confederate cities, I believe Sherman should come up.  A common statistic of warfare at the time was that invading forces sustain more casualties, I believe that you shall find that when the south made offensive strikes into Union territory they suffered much higher casualties, and vice versa, was common in warfare at the time.  So your saying that really doesn't matter, and I'm not sure why you threw that in since it has no relation to the argument at hand sir, other than to point out another failing of yours to see behind the obvious, and look at why, instead of what.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>. If you can disprove any of the above, do so. But you will not be able to. Because everything I have stated is a truth and if it were not, I would not have the GPA that I do. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have, I did; And you already said you were failing out of school sir.<br>

That is all, If you want to debate American History, I'll go back and forth with you all day, it's my favorite minor.<br>
