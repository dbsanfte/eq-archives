The Captain led me into a side hall, and down a stairway, to the bottom of the palace where the shamen and beastlords' guilds are. He took me into his guild and presented me to the Elder Animalist, telling my tale as I sat on the floor and wept. When it was done, I was sent into the next room, while the Animalists conversed. I knew not what they talked of, and did not care; I simply sat in a corner. One of the spell-merchants in the room came and sat beside me, giving a shoulder to cry on, and an ear to listen. But I would say nothing, only looking at the wall, or rather through it, into memory. Finally I was called into the guildhall once more. The Captain bowed and left as I entered, saying to me, &quot;Come to me if you are again in need.&quot; I stood before Sadhi, the Elder Animalist of our people, and he stared at me for a time in silence. Finally, he said, &quot;Captain Allm has judged correctly. Look at me.&quot; I did so, and he said, &quot;Yes, I see it in your eyes... you have lost a companion this day, have you not? You have. I know the tale, but this was unexpected. A warder usually does not show himself before the Vah Shir can call him.&quot; To which I could only say, &quot;What do you mean? You make this to be a thing of legend... I do not have a warder, only the tiger-friend that used to follow me, and he was not as mighty as the creatures of the beastlords.&quot; Sadhi looked at me again, and began to chant under his breath, words that I did not know. He began channeling the spirit forces, as I'd seen the shamen do on occasion, when they enhanced our warriors' strength, or healed their wounds. But this was different, somehow... this was a calling. He completed his chant, and suddenly relaxed, and before me appeared the largest warder I had ever seen. So great, it was, it nearly towered over the Animalist himself, and I took a step back, for want of space if not from fear. Sadhi looked at me and said, &quot;This is the warder of a Khati Sha. Look into his eyes, as I am sure you have done before, and tell me what you see.&quot; And I did so. &quot;I see... nothing, but I feel... what? Great pride, and great power. Majesty, and nobility. And, underneath it all, a wild, free spirit, that cannot be contained.&quot; He said, &quot;All these things that you feel describe the feeling and motives of the Khati Sha. All have them in varying amounts. Many choose to stay in the city, protecting and advising as the shamen. But others heed only the call of the wild... like you.&quot; I stammered, taken aback. &quot;But, I hold to the motives of our people! We are noble, and proud, and - &quot; He cut me off, saying, &quot;These things are true, and I hope you uphold them, but your spirit feels the call. I think you do not like the city overmuch.. it is too.. fashioned, to you, and not natural. There are places on the Old World that you would perhaps like better, though that doorway has been closed for years... it is now open again, and perhaps some of the old places are still akin to what they were, many years ago. But whether you go there is for you to decide. I have allowed this conversation to go on long enough. You have the spirit of our kind, though not the training, thus I make an offer. Consider well, for it will be extended but the once. If you will submit to me as teacher and master, and be guided by the wisdom of the Animalists, the Khati Sha will have you, and restore that which you hold most dear. You know of what I speak.&quot; I stared at the floor for a time, not daring to meet his gaze, and finally, I said, &quot;What I hold most dear is the finding of my blood-kin, whom I have never known, but I know what you say. You think my tiger was one of your warder, like in the stories.&quot; &quot;Not our warder, but yours, young one.&quot; I looked at him then, and said, &quot;Though I believe it not to be true, and you may be wrong, I will take this offer, for I cannot go back to the Thicket now, the memories are too strong.&quot; And he looked at me, and his eyes took on a strange light, and in them I saw my tiger-friend, and knew that he was not truly dead, and that the Animalist had told truth. And then I said, &quot;Yet.. perhaps you are right after all... I will go where I am bid, and let hope stave off the pain. Let, then, my warder be known as Swiftclaw, for though he did not harm the beast he fought, he struck quickly, and often. May he do so again.&quot; And to my mind, the name fit, and I knew that it was approved by the one so named. Thus began my first season as a Khati Sha.<br>
<br>
I look back on it today with pride, knowing that I made the right choice. I sit, now, and stare at the scar on my arm, thinking of the past, yet now a new joy fills my heart, for through my travels, I have found another with the same scar, and the same blood. And he is...<br>
<br>
... Sekayn of the Khala Dun. Sadly, soon after we met, he left the realm for a time, training to further his skill. I took to traveling, often alons, often with friends from my earlier years. One of them in particular, Reyial, I hunted with often. We traveled the legnth and breadth of Norrath, seeing many amazing things, and we were great friends. But Reyial was hiding something from me. I do not know where he went, while I was away... but there was something trying to tear us apart. And that I would not permit. My story continues, after I had not seen him for a while...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=150.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=150.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=150.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=150.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=150.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
