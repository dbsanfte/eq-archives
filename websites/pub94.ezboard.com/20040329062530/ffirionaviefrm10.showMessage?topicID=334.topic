RL kept me away, however, for a long time.  Now that I'm able to play again, I'm starting back up.  So, I've edited this story a little and reposted it here.  See you in Norrath.)<br>
<br>
(OOC: Warning, this is a dark, harsh and somewhat brutal story, but I thought appropriate for the character.  If something like this might bother you, please don't read it.  However, I have kept it clean and while it is mature, it is not adult.)<br>

<br>
“A dozen lousy copper?”<br>
<br>
The pain started as a stinging shock, followed by numbness.  A dull aching warmth spread across the left side of her face.  The little girl stumbled and fell to the floor from the blow.  When she looked up, tears trickled down her dirt-smudged cheeks leaving small clean streaks.  A bit of blood oozed slowly from a split lip.  Father was angry.<br>
<br>
“Oh, now you cry?” he yelled the girl.  “Why don’t you try that out there, where it might do some good?  Squeeze out a few of those tears and you might get me a little more money.  But, no!  This is what I get?  Twelve copper?  You‘ll get back out there and don‘t come back until you got a few silver!”<br>
<br>
Her eyes flickered from her father, to the table that occupied one corner of the small, dirty room.  Remains of a meal, a crust of bread, something in a bowl, were growing stale and cold.  She looked to the door that led outside and then back to her father again, hoping he hadn’t noticed.  Staggering across the room, he grabbed the girl roughly and slammed her against the wall.  His breathe stank of ale, as usual, but also of dinner.  Her stomach growled.<br>
<br>
“You want something to eat?”  Another slap and her lip bled more.  She knew she had to get out quickly, or he would start using his fists.  “You bring me copper and you want food?”  <br>
<br>
He pulled her from the wall and shoved her roughly toward the door.  She stumbled, but didn’t fall.  That would only make him mad.  No use explaining how another kid had beat her up and stolen what she had begged that day, that the twelve copper was all she’d been able to get after that.  Words only made him mad.  Crying only made him mad.  Theresa began to think that her just being around made him mad.<br>
<br>
She darted out the door into the darkness of early night.<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
“Gimme your money, girl.”<br>
<br>
The older kid sneered at her.  He had to be at least thirteen and easily weighed twice what she did.  He was dirty, and his grin showed several missing teeth.  Theresa wanted to run.  She’d escaped him a couple of times before.  Not today, though.  <br>
<br>
“Sympathy!  I told you, make ’em cry, feel sorry for you,” her father had said earlier.  He had used his hands again, until she was crying.  Then, he had stepped down hard on her foot.  Something had snapped and pain had exploded from the injured foot, dizzying her.  “There.  If you can’t fake a limp, I’ll give you one for real.”<br>
<br>
She tried to run, hobbling a few painful steps before the boy caught up and shoved her to the ground.  His fists rained down on her until she stopped struggling.  Planting his knee in her back, he rummaged through her clothes for the change she had tried to hide.  The old, tattered dress only had a couple of pockets and he found the money easily.<br>
<br>
“Oh, holding out on me, today.  Three silver!” he cackled happily.<br>
<br>
Theresa lay in the dirt after he had left, bitter tears dropping onto the dusty ground.  Her nose bled freely.  People passed her, but no one said anything, no one offered a hand to help.  This was East Freeport after all, and you kept to your own business.   Finally, she pulled herself up and slumped against the nearby stone wall.<br>
<br>
That’s when she first saw him.<br>
<br>
Across the open square, another beggar walked toward her.  After a moment, though, she knew he wasn’t a beggar.  Dark eyes burned beneath the hood of his cloak, watching her with contempt.  His clothes were tattered but he moved with an air of authority, though only one who really lived on the streets could tell the difference.  No sympathy on that dark face.  It was as if he enjoyed watching her pain.  Stopping next to her, he dropped a dirty rag in her lap.  Theresa picked it up, holding it to her nose.<br>
<br>
“Is life always this hard,” she asked him, “or is it just when you’re a kid?”<br>
<br>
He stared hard for a moment, then said, “Always like this.”<br>
<br>
The moment passed.  The man only shook his head before walking on.<br>
_______________________________________<br>
<br>
The Temple of Marr was an amazing structure, towering over her.  It made her feel small, but in a way different than what she was used to.  Passing through North Freeport had also been strange.  It was so clean, and the building were solidly build and not rotting or falling apart.  She felt dirty and out of place, and from some of the looks of passers-by she knew others thought the same.  Normally, Theresa would never enter this part of the city, even if the paladin guards would allow a dirty beggar child to do so.  Today, though, was different.<br>
<br>
The priestess of Erollisi stood beside her, smiling down at the child’s awkward wonder.  Several other children from the streets gathered around, also having followed the woman who had offered them a warm meal.  In exchange for the food, they only had to listen to the words of the lady.<br>
<br>
She waited her time in the line, and took the food that was given.  So much!  A bowl of some sort of soup, with real meat in it.  Fresh bread, not stale and no trace of mold that she could see.  A small square of cheese and a glass of milk.  After sitting down and gazing in amazement, she hurriedly tore off most of the bread and crammed it in a pocket.  Something for later.<br>
<br>
“Good idea, girl,” said a familiar voice.<br>
<br>
The mean boy slid in next to her on the bench, grinning.  Theresa looked around, hoping someone would see and help, but the priests and their helpers were busy with their other tasks.  He grabbed her leg under the table and pinched hard.  <br>
<br>
“You just shut up and sit still,” he told her.  “Don’t you eat any of that, either.  That’s my food.  Thanks for watching it for me.”  She started to protest, but the boy pinched harder.  “You make any noise and next time I see you on the street, I won’t be as nice as I usually am.”  Theresa quieted and sat still, then nodded.<br>
<br>
The sermon came and the priestess stood before them, speaking of the Twins.  Perhaps some of the children listened, wolfing down the food that was before them.  Theresa pretended to listen, but the words fell on deaf ears.  Her eyes looked longingly to the bowl before her, but she didn’t eat.  When the boy finished his own food, and no one was looking, he switched his empty plate with hers and kept munching and slurping noisily.  She didn’t cry, though.  That would just bring attention, and that would make him mad.<br>
<br>
So she sat and as the lady spoke of love and truth, the little girl just listened to her own stomach rumbling with hunger.<br>
__________<br>
<br>
Theresa hugged herself, tightly, trembling.  It was turning cold as the sun fell tonight.  She had a bit of money, and she had evaded the boy today.  Maybe she could buy a crust of bread for a copper before going home.  Father wouldn’t miss that.  Well, miss it or not, he’d hit her anyway.  She didn’t have to do anything wrong for that.<br>
<br>
Across the square, a priest of life walked by, resplendent in his robes.  Going to the docks, perhaps, to the story-like continent of Faydwer where gnomes, dwarves and elves lived.  He cared nothing for her plight, she knew.  They only took in and fed the kids from time to time to make themselves feel better.  For the children of East Freeport, though, it just served as an occasional reminder of what they didn’t and would probably never have.  She glared at the priest’s back as he disappeared down the street.  She hated them.<br>
<br>
“How much did you get for me today, girl?” the voice came.<br>
<br>
Theresa bolted.  It wasn’t fast enough.  It usually never was.  She was in the dirt again, his fists pummeling her back and arms.  I almost made it, she thought.  It’s not fair.  Finally, she went limp, giving in again.  Hatred filled her, for the priests, who were never around when this happened … for the boy, taking what she begged and scrounged all day for … for her father and the beating that she knew would come tonight.  Something snapped.<br>
<br>
When the boy rolled her over to search her, Theresa’s fingers scrabbled in the dirt.  A handful of dust flew into the boy’s face.  He looked startled at first.  She had never fought back.  Then, he yelped as the dirt stung his eyes and he put his fists up to them, rubbing.  Theresa scrambled from underneath him, and as she was almost free she raised her leg and shoved her foot as hard as she could into his groin.<br>
<br>
The boy gasped, drawing in breath and slumping over the ground beside her.  He curled into a ball and moaned.  Theresa clumsily gained her feet and stepped away from where he writhed.  She felt good.  He was the one crying this time.  She started to run away, to get home before he came to, and the thought entered her mind.<br>
<br>
What’s he going to do when he finds me tomorrow?  He will find me.  He always does.  He’s hurt now, but he won’t be next time.  He’ll be ready.  He’ll hurt me.  Maybe bad.<br>
<br>
Her eyes darted around, her mind raced.  The boy wasn’t moaning anymore, just huddled up on the ground.  He’d be getting up soon.  She looked at him, looked around again.<br>
<br>
A rock.  It was big.  Theresa squatted and grabbed it, tearing a couple of fingernails loose as she shoved her fingers underneath it.  The pain was fresh, but it didn’t distract her.  Instinct had taken over.  Survival.<br>
<br>
She lifted the rock, straining, and picked it up to rest against her chest.  The boy was starting to move again.  She looked at him, looked at the rock, became worried.  What am I doing?  Then, the memories came to her.  Stolen food, bruises, her father’s anger, hunger … and hate.  <br>
<br>
The rock came down. <br>
<br>
There was a horrible noise when it hit him, and an even more horrible one he made.  He stopped trying to get up though, and just lay there.  Theresa looked around to see who might be watching. <br>
<br>
Aside from the usual street trash, they were alone.  The boy moaned and she kicked him.  There was no pity in her, no thought of what she was doing, only her dismal rage and the hatred that burned through her blood, warming her despite the chill night.  I’ve hurt him, but if he gets away, or someone helps him, someday he’ll be back.  He'll hurt me again.<br>
<br>
She picked up the rock.  Three more times and he stopped moving completely.  She wasn't sure why she kept hitting him after that.  It just made her feel good.<br>
___________________<br>
<br>
A couple of years passed.<br>
<br>
Theresa was growing up.  She felt and saw the changes, small as they were.   Her body was at times awkward, an enemy with new problems she had to find a way to overcome.  There was no mother to ask, no woman who might help that she would go to.  So, she stumbled into adolescence alone, her only teacher experience.<br>
<br>
No one had bothered her since the incident with the rock.  Some of the other boys on the street began to look at her differently, though.  Even some of the men, on their way to taverns or guards on duty.  It was an uncomfortable look, and she knew it had something to do with the changes.  Something to do with the women who frequented the taverns and went upstairs with men.  Theresa was sure she didn’t want to know more than that.<br>
<br>
Her father grew more drunk and more angry.  He rarely bothered slapping her anymore, instead just using his fists and sometimes his feet when she fell.  She was sure he hated her, though probably not as much as she knew she hated him.  She also knew one of these days, he would kill her.  Or maybe worse.  He had started looking at her differently, too.<br>
________________________<br>
<br>
“Lousy couple of silver?” he screamed.<br>
<br>
It was never enough anymore.  It didn’t matter how much she brought him, it was never enough.  The punch sent her to her knees and she felt the blood trickle from her nose.  She held a hand to it, to keep from bleeding all over herself and the floor.  Blood on her clothes meant less money on the street.  Blood on the floor … would only bring more blood.  Maybe he’ll make my eyes swell shut again, she thought, then I won’t have to look at him.  Maybe he’ll kill me.  At least it’ll be over.<br>
<br>
“Not bringin’ in the money anymore, girl,” he said.  He’d never called her by name in as long as she could remember.  He probably didn’t even know it anymore.  “Getting’ too old, people like givin’ money to kids.  Makes ’em feel good.”<br>
<br>
She sat up against the wall, looking at the ground.  You didn’t meet his eyes when he was mad, unless he told you to.   He grew quiet and that scared her.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, softly, he muttered, “Maybe it’s time.”<br>
<br>
She did look up at that.<br>
<br>
“You’re older now, not a kid anymore,” he said, looking nervous for once.  “There’s people, men … in the taverns and such.  They’d give you good money, better’n what you get on the streets.”<br>
<br>
It took a moment for what he was saying to dawn on her.  He wanted her to be like those other older girls and women.  The ones with the hollow eyes and fake smiles.  The ones that went upstairs with the sweaty drunks.  She shook her head, without realizing it.<br>
<br>
“No!” he screamed.  “You telling’ me no?  I’m your father, and you’ll damned well do what I tell you to do, you lazy brat.  If you can’t bring in your share on the street, you’ll bring it on your ..”<br>
<br>
“I won’t,” she screamed back at him.<br>
<br>
Minutes later, she lay sobbing on the floor.  It was the worst ever.  She felt her left eye swelling, blood flowing from her nose, lip and split cheek.  She thought her arm might be broken.  When she tried to get up, the pain that shot through it was so strong that she almost vomited, but instead passed out.  When she came to again, he was sitting in the chair at the table watching her.  Drinking.<br>
<br>
“You’ll do it,” he told her quietly.  “Or I’ll have to hurt you.  Not gentle like this, but bad.   Now do something useful and clean this place up.”<br>
<br>
He staggered off into the other room.  When she heard him fall into his bed, Theresa slowly got to her feet, careful with the bad arm.  She refused to cry.  There was no one to help her, no one to turn to that wouldn’t be just as bad.  This was her home.  Without it, she’d be living on the street and that was worse.  She saw what sometimes happened to people that slept on the street.  She had to keep her home, just … without him.<br>
<br>
Her mind wandered, as her body went through the motions of cleaning.  I hate him, she thought.  He’s going to kill me.  Or worse.  She cleared the table, instinct taking over while she tried to figure out what she could do.  It was half clean when her hand came across the knife.  The old, rusty knife that father ate with.  He’d once poked her with it, repeatedly, when she’d been sick and said she couldn’t go out and beg.  Just poked her, over and over, until she had stopped screaming, stopped crying, and did what he wanted.   Her fingers closed around it.<br>
<br>
You’ll do it, she heard him say.  She shivered.  <br>
<br>
“No,” she said softly to herself.  “I won’t.”<br>
<br>
Theresa walked into the bedroom and shut the door.<br>
_________________________________________<br>
<br>
She wandered aimlessly from the house.  Vague memories darted around her mind.  A mother, no face, just a warm feeling.  Was that love?  Father, not drunk and dirty, not angry, giving her a piece of candy that he’d brought home for her.  He worked hard at the docks, but he’d remembered her birthday.  Back before things got bad, back before the drinking had started.<br>
<br>
Theresa put her face in her hands, sticky and warm with blood, and wept softly.  The memories flowed through her and as they did, they disappeared.  The warmth, the happiness, the love … remembered briefly, and then gone.  There was no room in this world for those memories, those emotions.  They only got you hurt … or worse.<br>
<br>
Is this what dying feels like?, she wondered.  Part of her was dying.  She struggled briefly, holding onto it with desperation, but then, finally, let go.  It wasn’t worth holding onto.  I will not cry any more.  Instead, she felt the coldness, rage and the hatred, the things that had saved her more than once.  Her strengths.  She embraced them.  Looking at her hands, her clothes, spattered and stained with her father’s blood.<br>
<br>
Theresa smiled.<br>
<br>
The low side of East Freeport was even worse than the rest of the area and the few people around moved away quickly, ignoring the bloody girl to the best of their ability.  Something about her even kept away those that would usually try to prey on a girl injured such as she was.  One of her eyes had swollen shut as she knew it would and she blindly made her way back to the house.<br>
<br>
That’s when she ran into him.<br>
<br>
He looked at her with the same contempt he’d given her before, years before.  The man in the cloak, with the dark eyes.  His hands grabbed her by the arms and stopped her.  Pain shot through her broken arm and she almost fainted, so he slapped her.  That did it.<br>
<br>
Theresa glared at him.  The tears were gone, the fear, too.  No one would ever hurt her again.  Only rage remained.  “Hit me again and I will kill you,” she told him.<br>
<br>
The man chuckled.  “Good … that’s what I was looking for.”<br>
<br>
Theresa turned away to leave, toward the old, run down building.  To the room that was her home.  The man stopped her, his one hand never leaving her arm.  The grip was powerful, his aura of authority too much to deny.  She looked back at him.<br>
<br>
“That’s not your home any more,” he told her.  &quot;That stopped being your home when you caved in that boy's skull.&quot;<br>
<br>
That got her attention.<br>
<br>
So, Theresa followed him, still angry, but curious now.  Something was happening, had been happening since the moment she lifted the rock over that boy’s head.   They arrived before another run-down building, walked inside.  She looked at him, questioningly.<br>
<br>
“This is your new home, girl,” he told her.<br>
<br>
“My name is Theresa.”<br>
<br>
A small chuckle again, and he replied.  “Theresa it is, then.  I am Pietro Zarn.  This is home.  This is the Dismal Rage.  There’s dried food in that crate over there.  Water in that barrel.  There’s cots and rolls on the floor.  Get cleaned, then eat and sleep.  One of the clerics will be up shortly to see to that arm.  Save your questions for tomorrow, when we start your training.”<br>
<br>
“Training?” she wondered.<br>
<br>
Pietro looked to her again, dark eyes dancing wickedly.  “When I will teach you what hate really is, girl.&quot;  After a pause, he added, &quot;Theresa.”<br>
<br>
Then, he left her alone to wonder what the next day would bring.<br>
_________________________________________________<br>
<br>
(Well, I hope you enjoyed it, that is the background of my character, Theresa, at least to the point where she joined the Dismal Rage.  There's more between then and the moment she left to go out on her own, but that's for another time.  And for those that recognize them, yep, I 'borrowed' a couple of lines from movies ... they just fit nicely.)<br>

While it may be graphic, it is not explicit.  However, if this might offend you, please stop here.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Pathetic.&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice sneered as her blow was deflected.  The counterattack took her squarely across the jaw, splitting open the flesh and shattering bone.  The sheer force of it spun her roughly to the dirt floor.  She didn't cry out.  Theresa was used to pain.  She spit blood into the dust and was unsurprised to see a couple of teeth.  Blood ran freely down her neck and spattered the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Am I done with the street rat?  Can I have a real opponent?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Again,&quot; another voice, deeper and rougher, stated curtly.  Brutol Rhaksen was overseeing training for the Dismal Rage.  The battle-scarred warrior was without pity.  She was glad.  She didn't want pity.  She wanted to make Wendel scream.<br>
<br>
Shakily, she regained her footing.  A glance around and she picked up her weapon.  The short sword was old and rusted.  Her armor was a mismatched patchwork of animal hides.  Wendel Vaughn stood across the circle from her, dressed head to toe in plate armor made of some dull gray metal.  Acrylia, she'd heard him boasting to another trainee.  She didn't know what it was, only that it made hurting him almost impossible.  To make things worse, he already had the best basic combat training that his North Freeport merchant parents could buy.<br>
<br>
Wendel, either sensing her thoughts, or just being condescending as always, grinned at her.  &quot;Give up.  You'll never be a warrior, little girl.  But, if you let the cleric fix that pretty face up ... I might just let you be my whore.&quot;<br>
<br>
The words had barely left his mouth and Theresa was on him.  Blow after blow rained down on his armor.  Some were deflected by his shield, others parried on his sword.  The few that made it through his defenses were still unable to find a vulnerable spot.  Her fury continued until a swing was deflected wide and left her completely open.  His shield slammed into her face.  Her nose splintered, sending pain through her entire head, blinding her.  Before she could recover, she felt his blade running her through.<br>
<br>
Gut wound.  <br>
<br>
He'd done it on purpose.  The agony was indescribable.  He twisted the blade.  Theresa screamed and fell to her knees.  Then, the sickening, strange sensation followed as he slowly pulled the machete-looking sword from her.  Theresa slumped to the dirt and coughed up blood.<br>
<br>
Her vision went from red to black as consciousness faded.  The last thing she heard was Brutol's harsh voice finally calling for the cleric.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
Pietro's was calm, as always.  Theresa had yet to see anything that broke his demeanor.  Hers, on the other hand, had snapped.  She yelled, angrily.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said it's not fair.  Why the hell did Rhaksen send me up against Wendel?  He's an advanced student, he knows how to fight.  I was doing just fine in basics.&quot;<br>
<br>
She paced in front of him.  A small girl, Theresa was barely as high as her mentor's breastbone.  That petite frame was unable to express the pent up rage inside her, so she paced as she talked, fists slamming on open air to emphasize certain points.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can handle my own with any of those others,&quot; she continued.  &quot;I mean, I've got the crappy armor that was dug out of a closet and I had to stitch it down just to fit me.  He's got acrylia!  What the hell is acrylia?  I can't get my piece of shit short sword through it, that’s for sure, but he has no problem running me through with that sendy machete thing ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Centi,&quot; Zarn interrupted.  Theresa paused.  &quot;Centi short sword.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't care what it's called, I just care that it goes through my armor like butter and ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up,&quot; he said, casually.<br>
<br>
Theresa stopped again, looking at him.  Her face was red with anger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut up?  You give me a combat teacher that gets off on my pain and throws me up against someone I can't hope to beat.  What the hell was he thinking when he ..&quot;<br>
<br>
The backhand knocked her down.  Pietro Zarn stared coldly at her as she stood back up and met his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said shut up,&quot; he stated.  &quot;I’m the teacher. You are the student.  You don't like what I'm teaching, walk out.  I'm sure you'll make a good living as a thief or a ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't!&quot; she shouted.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?  Whore?&quot; he sneered.  &quot;What is it about that word that bothers you so much?  It's just a word, used to punch whatever buttons make you go off.  Yes, Brutol sent you up against a better trained student.  I told him to!  I even suggested to Vaughn what to say to you.  Not that he needed it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Theresa was stunned.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because you have no focus,&quot; he said.  There was some passion in his voice and that, more than any way he'd spoke before, frightened her.  &quot;I've seen such hate in you as I haven't seen in a very long time, perhaps more than I've ever seen.  Most of my students come here because something in particular gets them.  The paladins, the clerics, the rich, the poor, the elves, the dwarves, or even specifically, like Vaughn.  He hates his parents.  They give him everything and he loathes them for it.  So he comes here in secret to spite them.  It doesn't matter, he'll never be more than a warrior, but I can use that.  But, you, you're not like them.  You hate everyone ... everything.  You hate your fellow students, the Dismal Rage.   You hate dark elves and you hate our patron, Innoruuk.  I can see it in your eyes and hear it in your words.  You hate me.  You even hate yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Theresa glared at him, sullenly.  So what if it were all true, what was the point?<br>
<br>
&quot;And?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have no focus and you have no control.  Wendel was better, yes.  He has the training.  More important, though, he was controlled.  One word and all thought of defense was gone from you.  You only wanted to hurt him.  To unleash that pain and hate and rage onto someone.  I had you taken out of basic combat with the other students because the only thing you were doing with them was venting.  You're not learning.  You're just waiting for your turn to hurt someone.&quot;<br>
<br>
A long, silent moment passed between them.<br>
<br>
Softly, she asked, &quot;What do I do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Pietro nodded.  &quot;Don't give up your hate.  It is your strength.  It may help you survive when all else is gone.  But, you must learn to control it.  Remember, last week, when I executed that knight of Marr?&quot;<br>
<br>
He spat the name of the god of valor.  Theresa shrugged, waiting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you saw what remained of him.  If you can focus your hate, you can direct it as well.  You can channel it as pure agony into your foe.  It causes serious harm to even a healthy person, can finish off a wounded foe, or even kill a weaker one outright.  The Harm Touch is one of our greatest weapons.  It's also the first step on the true path of the Shadowknight.&quot;<br>
<br>
Theresa's eyes danced at the thought and she grinned.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are no where near that goal,&quot; he said, breaking her fantasy.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't even focus on your weapon blows and you seriously lack any defensive skills.  In order to defeat your enemy, you must survive.  You can have all the hate in the world and a single sword blow can end your life.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sobered at the thought and realizing how idiotic she'd been in the weeks previous, Theresa nodded again.  Even more than, she hated the thought of ...<br>
<br>
&quot;You even hate me for pointing this out to you,&quot; Zarn chuckled.<br>
<br>
She smiled, not answering that question.  Instead, simply saying, &quot;I'll do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.  Don't lose your edge.  Just control your anger and swallow your pride.  Whatever it takes to win ... remember that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wiping blood away from her lip where he'd struck her, she said, &quot;I told you that if you hit me again, I would kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're welcome to try, girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I also told you the name's Theresa.  And I think I'll wait ... until I'm ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
They both knew she wasn't kidding.  Zarn laughed again and walked away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe you'll be the one, Theresa.&quot;<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
 Wendel Vaughn laughed mockingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me?  Teach you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Theresa nodded.  Her face bore the pleading look she'd often worn as a beggar child asking for coin.  It was hard not to express the contempt she actually felt.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to learn and Brutol doesn't care to teach me.  Weak little girl, he says.  I have to learn somehow.  You've had so much training ...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And natural talent,&quot; he added.<br>
<br>
She agreed, &quot;Yes.  I know I can't hope to be that good, but if I'm just able to hold my own I won't end up back on the streets.&quot;  It was that easy.  Just like the people who gave her money as a child, he only needed her to say what he wanted to hear.  To feel good about himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, father's money has bought me the best.  I could help you, teach you, at least enough to pass Brutol's muster.&quot;  He paused, thinking.  &quot;Why should I?  Why should I care if some little street rat just ends up back where she belongs?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; she muttered.  Theresa tried looking helpless and needy.  Even the callous had sometimes given her money when she'd put on her most pathetic look.  It worked, she saw, as something dawned in his eyes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he told her.  &quot;Yes, I can teach you.&quot;  His eyes crawled over her body and she saw something else there.  She shuddered.  &quot;I'll show you how to fight properly and I'll also show you how to do other things properly.  Hmm?  I'll make you into Brutol's little fighter and in return you will learn to be ... my ... little ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Theresa closed her eyes.  She knew what he was going to say and felt the anger coming.  Biting her lip, she fought it back.  Whatever it takes, Pietro said.  <br>
<br>
&quot; ... whore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence.  Then, weakly, “Okay.”<br>
<br>
Whatever it takes to win.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
She knew he was asleep now.  His breathing had slowed from it's rapid pace to a shallow one.  He snored slightly.  More than anything, she wanted to kill him ... had wanted to the whole time he'd been ...<br>
<br>
Her mind raged.  The things she'd just done for him, things he'd done to her, the names he'd called her and the things he'd said.  It sickened her.  This is the life that Dad wanted for me.  To do this, probably every night, so that he could have his alcohol.  I'm glad I killed him.  I should kill Wendel.<br>
<br>
She hurt.  Worse than the pain, she felt ... broken.  Unclean.  Stupid, she thought, that a street rat would think that.  That stupid little girl.  She'd have never done something like this.  She’d have run and hid and starved and died.  Well, she's dead now.  Dead and gone and all that's left is ... me. Theresa buried her face in her pillow and cried.<br>
  <br>
It was the final death rattle of the girl she had been.  It was the birth of the woman she would come to be.<br>
