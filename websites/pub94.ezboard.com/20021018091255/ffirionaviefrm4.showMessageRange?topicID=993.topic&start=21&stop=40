as for AS, i doubt they will responde until the words gets out and gets so severe that they feel some dmg control needs to be done.<br>
<br>
I have not had any positive expereinces with AS. either trains in velks, or just out down right rudeness. if that is what they want to be so be it, but with the influx of people comming to the &quot;jewl&quot; server with no &quot;NO DROP&quot; ... i have no doubts thier guild will soon catch up and pass FNF and Resolution unless Tunare herself himbo slaps em!<br>
<br>
I am sorry Blayze, and i hope something happens that will give you closure<br>

The problem with a cleric epic is that it's a guild tool. So guilds that are building in power will go out of there way to get them.

Thirdly - For the most part, my experiences wtih AS have been absolutely horrible.  I am on good terms with perhaps two people within the guild, but other than that, whenever I have a bad experience, whether a KS, rude person, etc., etc., there seems to be an AS guild tag above it.  I don't know all of them, so perhaps there are some nice folks in the ranks, but my worst experiences I have ever had on FV have involved AS members.   <br>

<br>
Blayze stated:<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> to set the scene to this post I planned to try kill ixiblat and ragefire a week and a half ago<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
So to set our scene to this post, we as a guild planned to try (and did) kill Ixilbat four weeks ago. About half a week later, we as a guild planned to try (and failed) to kill Overking Bathezid. The next week, we as a guild planned to try (and did) kill Overking Bathezid. This kill gave us 4 clerics who now only needed Ragefire to get their epic.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> so i set about camping his spot, i logged there last night<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So we set about camping his spot, and we had some members begin logging there every night for the past week.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, there are three main points that need to be addressed. We are not posting here to make excuses, we simply would like to state our side of the story before being further judged by community (the ignorant are quick to condemn). <br>
<br>
Our response will attempt to address a couple of Blayze's concerns:<br>
<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> DO i not being in a large guild and capable of going /gu rage is up come kill it and instea have to do /tell dozens of pple and organise it more , thus needing more than 5 mins not deserve a chance to kill a spawn when quite capable, even when there first just because a more powerful guild comes along ??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What would this have meant to them, a 3rd (or more) clerics with epics, to my guild it would have been 1, to the open raid community (and i know i dont go on all there are several a week now, but i go on a lot) it would have been 1<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) This was not a killsteal. It was well within the rules of engagement. You all know this. And it has been stated. No reason to belabor it. Awakened Souls plays by the rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) We had been camping Ragefire for *longer* than Blayze had. Does this mean we felt the &quot;camp&quot; was ours? ABSOLUTELY NOT. We were perfectly willing to share the camp. Had Blayze had a full raid force when we checked him, we would have backed down, as per the FCFS status of this server. This is our answer to Blayze's first question. <br>
<br>
FCFS is not defined as the first person to the mob. It is the first force capable of killing the mob. And although you had logged in to check Rage before we had, we were able to get the first force capable of killing him. If the server decides that FCFS is no longer for the best of FV, we are more than willing to listen to other options.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) This is perhaps the most important point. Ragefire has had a history of being the major bottleneck of the cleric epic. He is still that way today even after the changes. <br>
<br>
To answer Blayze's second concern, Blayze killing Ragefire would *not* have resulted in another epic. Blayze does not have other parts of the epic quest completed yet. See pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...=233.topic . Ragefire is supposed to be the final mob of the cleric epic quest. One would expect the members of a roleplaying server to actually follow the storyline of the quests they do, rather than just attempt to get all the pieces in whatever order they find convienient.<br>
<br>
Doing the bottleneck portion of the most important epic in the high end game before completing the rest of your epic just isn't considerate to people who are *stuck* at the bottleneck (thanks VI). Saying &quot;to my guild it would have been 1, to the open raid community (and i know i dont go on all there are several a week now, but i go on a lot) it would have been 1&quot; just isn't fair. Had you recieved the Ragefire piece today, no new cleric epic would have been added to our community today. But because we did recieve the Ragefire piece today, there is now one more cleric epic on Firiona Vie today. Tommorow, more members of the community will be able to find a free rez. Perhaps we should get their opinion on this issue?<br>
<br>
Ragefire will most likely spawn and die four or five more times before you end up getting your piece from Chardok. Asking the clerics who are *stuck* at the bottleneck to wait another week for their epic simply because you feel you deserve your bottleneck piece out of turn, is not being, as you would say, &quot;decent.&quot; Get the rest of your epic completed, and then take your turn waiting for Ragefire. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line:<br>
We are truly sorry things turned out the way they did. Although Blayze, along with a number of other people, condemn our actions and are going to &quot;blacklist&quot; us, we feel no animosity at all toward these individuals. Our members are not an active part of the &quot;community as a whole.&quot; We prefer to keep to ourselves and play the game we love so much as a close-knit guild. <br>
<br>
As a measure of goodwill toward the rest of the server, we will *continue* to avoid killing epic bottleneck mobs until we have done everything else in that quest up to the bottleneck mob. We feel it would be wrong of us to take these spawns from people who are just stuck at these bottlenecks. Although no rotation system is in place, we will also do our best to back down on these mobs for people whom have been waiting on their epics longer than we have.<br>

If any guild can do the really useful epics and not step on a few toes accidently I would be surpised honestly.  Just now reaching the point where epics are becoming useful to me I'm learning all sorts of things.  The cleric epic is awsome, mana free 90% rez, but it is very hard to do and takes massive power.  Unfortunately it takes killing some rare and super rare mobs (what epic doesn't...curse the lava elemental and Quillmane!).  In this case the rare mobs take many many people to take down.  Some can do it quicker than others, Blayze, we'll get you one bud.  Just like someday I'll finish my epic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I wanted to see some response from Awakened Souls.  Not necessarily so I could judge one side against the other, but so I could at least know for sure that Awakened Souls has some regard for their reputation and intends to be a part of the community.<br>
<br>
I have to say, I've had some negative feelings towards Awakened Souls also.  I can't even quote a specific run-in, just very small faction hits along the road that have added up, along with comments by friends and people whose opinions I respect.  A few people I've had good experiences with in the past ended up in AS and I don't imagine they turned to the dark side just because they are wearing a new guild tag, but I still don't have good feelings about the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
Strangely, this thread now qualifies as the first really good thing I've seen from AS.  Points:  They did play by the rules, even if a good friend of mine lost out I'll acknowledge that.  They are open to other systems, and state that as well, and it's hard to blame them by just doing their best under the system as it exists.  They responded intelligently and maturely, and more than that they all held their tongues until their guild leader himself made an official reply.  By any standard, that's class.  And their stated policy of holding back major quests until the last bottleneck is a reasonable one, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
To Xarpolis, and to Awakened Souls in general, I wish to state as an active member of the community that I at least don't hold this one against you.  But I'd also like to point out that the sum of this situation is not only in the details.  People are willing to believe the worst of your guild right now, and make assumptions against your favour, because of other poor experiences in the past.  If you wish to be a respected part of the high-end community on FV, as Resolution and F&amp;F have managed to be (kudos for agreeing to MA Gore) I hope you are willing to address the small issues as well as the large, and clean up the acts of some of your less reputable members.  Sometimes simply because someone is Uber they still aren't something you want in an &quot;uber&quot; guild.<br>

<br>
They work together, faster, more coherently and they win. They work on tough mobs and epic pieces on a weekly, if not daily basis. Now you're sore because you have to wait a week or even a month. If you didn't want to wait you could do what you need to do. <br>

Also, if you had been ready for the fight first, or if they had failed and thus you got a chance and won, do you think they'd be here impuning you? What, they wouldn't deserve to because you're Mr. open raider?<br>
<br>
Yes, there's competition involved and the best team reaps rewards. They didn't mess with it after you legitimately engaged. You can't fault them.<br>
<br>
You had no more right to that spawn that a group of level 9s at ec ord camp 1. Yet you insinuate that they treaded on you somehow. THAT is what causes problems. THAT is what causes the heated debate and the message board debaucle. Executing a plan and following thru efficiently and effectively does NOT deserve your hassle. You are a sore loser.<br>

I feel bad about Rage and all, but as Xarp point out they had clerics that needed it to get epics now and not weeks from now.  I will be glad to help you finish your epic, but I am not sure you can blame AS for being anything besides efficient.  I ve seen FaF and Reso both setting up in a zone for a mob and alas I am sorry to say FaF pulled it and killed it (darn Gore I tried to slow him but it failed), thats life he will be up again so no real lose.<br>

It's not a might makes right thing. FCFS simply means if the mob is up anyone has the right to take it down and all other interested parties have to accept that by policy. Things like leap frogging over another gathering force, KSing, lurking while another group clears your way or any other despicable practice will always be despicable practices regardless of the system in place. Shame on AS. <p><CENTER>

<br>
So let me understand that comment straight - Where is this list of clerics waiting in line? i have seen epic cleric lists before when they sigh up when a certain percent is done then wait there turn to pass... but what you are saying is there are other clerics in line, inplying that all 'your' clerics are next in line.<br>
<br>
If i make a easy example of this, ok get into character - you are queing up in a fast food outlet.. the que has a few people in it and you've been waiting a while. Then some Big guy from a behind the line walks up past the que pushes you out of the way takeing your spot.. you were going to be the next served customer.... what do you do? <br>
<br>
You cant push the guy behind him so you walk to the back of the que - sometimes the guy behind the one who just pushed in forfeit's there line and lets you slip in first... at this point the guy behind him either whines.. if he doesnt it's normally ok (gah cant please everyone)<br>
Or sometimes a bigger guy in the line walks up and pushes the line hopper out... Ohh i have seen this before and it's rather amuseing to see.<br>
<br>
Would you stand for that? let the other guy push you out of the way.. and when you ask him why he says &quot;i have four people to feed! you are only buying one... the que is long and we are hungry! you only nee one meal!&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL so ok... what about all the others in the line? arent they here for the exact same thing, it's not like they got in the wrong que &quot;This isnt the lottery que? Damn sorry i completely got in the wrong line...&quot; ok so maybe not... it's not like i wake up one day and say to myself &quot;wee i am about to complete my epic! no wait i've been doing the bard epic isntead!....&quot;<br>
<br>
and here comes the good bit - &quot;Well when we pushed in front you 'were' not actually being served so technically we are the first ones here... wich means that you are the one pushing in front of all the other people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now that is just about the situation except swap BK Whopper for Ragefire.<br>
Personally i think it comes down to what you are prepared to fight for wich is a shame, we should not be fighting like this - i have to agree with Shintou on this one, the second we can all happily disregard each other like this, when this becomes common play, is the day FV dies.<br>
<br>
note: As might be Verant spy's acting to force the server into blue mode! sort of like the Anarchy online epic story - but works.<br>

I came to FV to RP, and if your not RPing your not getting servered. I mean doesn't FCFS mean First Come First Serve? Well let see Blayze was First Come, so shouldn't he be First Servered? Or is it person that gets the bigest group of peeps together faster FCFS? I mean If I get to Ticket master first to see Floyd in concert but suddenly there are 300 000 000 000 000 peeps all in a group behind me, that means they go first cause they got an Uber group together to Linch mob my ass and get there tickets first? Basically In my opinion what you did was form a Linch Mob and went after the kill first, AFTER you had all been told that Blayze had been there FIRST, How many Clerics in your guild had there epics before this? You said it yourself your not a community player guild. Close knit and all that. You don't wanna help people then fine.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Our members are not an active part of the &quot;community as a whole.&quot; We prefer to keep to ourselves and play the game we love so much as a close-knit guild.<br>
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
That to me is a polite way of saying &quot;We rule, you suck, We are bigger, and you still suck.&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't wanna be a part of the community fine, you all wanna be jerks. FINE! But the minute you start stepping on other players cause they are X amount of minutes to getting a raid force together, and you just got yours finished, then start throwing the PnP FCFS rules in Peeps faces well then your just a bunch of cowardly Jerks. <br>
<br>
I say Blayze is right, at least he intends to use his epic for the COMMUNITY, and he IS an active member of the community. So he supposidly needs to back step a few and get a couple more drops. So what. From day one we all knew the end game Raids would be mainly Unroleplayed, Even Skathris will group with there Enemies on a raid situation. Hell if I was at Raid level and Shintou asked me to help him with his epic I'd say yes, Then after he got it I would go IC and whoop him good. Point is don't try and throw RP in our faces and expect us to take it. <br>
<br>
And as far as Awakened Souls go, all you need to do is add another &quot;S&quot; word on your guild tag so we can appropriatly refer to you as &quot;ASS&quot; which the majority of you are.<br>
<br>
PS: If I hurt ASS's feelings good. If your offended, then thats even better. I now know that AS will never get any help from me when I reach the appropriate level, and thats too bad cause In my opinion I am the best at playing the class I am, and that class is Ranger. Sure you may bash Rangers but that only means you don't understand us. Good day.<br>

You walked into their turf when you wanted to mobilize faster than experienced mobilizers&quot;<br>
<br>
Heagan, It's called guildchat. of course they're going to mobilize faster than someone who has to work with tells. Experience may have something to do with it but I guarantee you it did not have as much an affect as this factor alone.<br>
<br>
Ultimately it comes down whether or not you have respect for another person's hard work, which is why I personally DO give a little more credence to an open raid than that of a Raiding Guild. There is no question that Blayze worked his but off, both in the camp, and trying to pull everyone together. This isnt to say AS didnt work hard as well but they had a bit more going in their favor to reduce the workload such as guildchat above. Open Raids are just plain hard work on the raid Leader, which is why you Won't see a gaggle of Clerics from the Open raid community trying to camp Ragefire, which is yet another reason why I would give slightly more credence to an open raider who actually is showing a raid capable force, its just not that common an occurence. Most Clerics would likely go your suggested route and join that Raiding guild instead if they wanted their epic. <br>
<br>
Now clearly there is room for abuse, i.e. if some solitary person camps some major spawn and then expects all others to wait while he takes the next two hours to assemble a force. That wasn't the case here.<br>
<br>
Heagan I both like and respect you in game, but here I must respectfully disagree.<br>
<br>
As for AS there is no question they played it by the rules. They also had taken Ragefire the previous two or three times wich is yet another reason I'm a little more sympathetic to Blayze and a little less to them. I have some good friends in AS and I don't plan to blacklist them or their guild. Yeah they played it by the rules, so do lawyers that doesn't mean we always like what they do with them.<br>
<br>
For Blayze ther only thing I can suggest is to get all your friends to<br>
<br>
/autojoin Blayzepic <br>
<br>
you still wont likely have as fast a response time, but it might help you be able to compete a little more.<br>
<br>
just my oppinion on the matter take care all and happy gaming<br>
