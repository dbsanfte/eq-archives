Even when they try to introduce an interesting character, they can still be summed up in by a single characteristic. Cloud has an identity crisis, Squall doesn't like other people. Etc, etc. I guess what I really want to see is a greater degree of complexity. I'd like to sit back and say that the characters were compelling, but it's just not there.They keep advancing the technology and making everything *look* more and more realistic, but the people still feel like cardboard. Maybe I'm expecting better literature than one should expect from a console RPG.<br>
<br>
I understand what you're saying about FF being a &quot;niche&quot; for a certain age group, though. Perhaps it is. And if this were Kingdom Hearts, I would expect that, but for some reason I expect FF to have better writing than that. I keep hearing people laud the plots and characters of FF as being really great, but I'm having a hard time seeing it lately. I get to the end of the game, and there's just not much emotional investment in it because everything is just sort of floating on the surface. And the lack of depth wouldn't bother me that much, except that I know they're capable of better. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://stathol.home.comcast.net/stathol/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
It seems to me that the FF series has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> had one-dimensional characters.  <br>
<br>
This character is the gambler who relies on luck.<br>
This character is the dark knight who's trying to become good.<br>
This character is the thief who lives by his wits.<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
The &quot;main&quot; character usually has a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>little</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> more depth, but in just about every game in the series they've been more or less cardboard cutouts.  Heh... if you go back to FF1 they don't even <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a personality <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Don't read that as complaining, I'm not, just trying to be objective about the series.<br>
<br>
I think the main draws of the FF games are...<br>
<br>
1) Good elemental system: all the games from FF1 to the most recent have an underlying elemental system (earth, fire, etc).  Most monsters are strong or weak against certain elements.  Originally it was Earth, Fire, Thunder, Water.  Since then it's been expanded to Earth, Fire, Thunder, Water, Air, Holy (Light, White, Pearl), Unholy (Dark, Black, Gravity), Poison, and a couple of others I'm sure.  Anyways, it makes for fun use of spells / skills / weapons etc.<br>
<br>
2) Nice variety of monsters &amp; bosses.  They do a lot of coloring 1 template type (ie: Fire Goblin, Ice Goblin, etc) but there are a ton of different actual monster types in each of the games.  There's also lots of unique bosses.<br>
<br>
3) Good story.  They're not usually the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>best</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> stories, but they are usually good.  In earlier FF games they're pretty light, but they've gotten a bit more depth to them in newer releases.<br>
<br>
4) Good sense of humor.  There's usually a fair bit to laugh at in each of the games.  I'm not just talking about funny things in conversations, but also like if you accidentally attack a Chocobo and it runs up and pecks everyone in your group on the head.  <br>
<br>
5) Behold the glory of god.  In almost every FF game you can, if you want, advance your characters to godlike status.  I think Tycho at Penny Arcade put it best when he talked about casting a fire spell on a little group of plant guys that did enough damage to kill their entire civilization.  Square puts a lot of love &amp; care into giving your characters godlike fury to inflict on the NPC population.<br>
<br>
6) Good characters.  They're cookie-cutters, sure, but they're still fun to play.  In every game there's some you hate and just stay parked in the airship all game, and others you grow to love and bring them out every battle.  There's usually a lot of variety in their skillsets.  FF7 was probably the biggest departure from that as the characters really only differed by their special power-up type attacks (with a few exceptions.  Yuffie could still do full damage on steal attacks which made a big difference in the late game).<br>
<br>
7) Lotsa side quests &amp; exploration.  A lot of RPGs only focus on quests directly necessary to finish the game.  For the most part the FF games do a good job of adding in little quests and adventures on the side that are only peripherally related.  They're usually there to provide either a little more character background, or get some l33t gear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  l33t gear... speaking of equipment, FF games usually have tons of it.  It's not even just limited to equipment, but also spells.  You can go to the end and just collect the standard ones, but you can also go around and hunt down all the little obscure powerful ones.  Beat up a chain of various people in an arena, go explore some lost dungeon, raise a gold chocobo, whatever, you can get some fun trinkets to play with.<br>
<br>
So I dunno... I could agree that the FF games they're coming out with don't have a ton below the surface... but I don't know that they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ever</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have.  I think it's more the case that people who started playing FF games when they were in their teens <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>think</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they had a ton of depth because they're reminiscing about games they were playing when they were 15 etc <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All in all it's still one of my favorite series.  I know whenever I pick one up I can expect some fun characters, lots of equipment, some bad guys I love to hate, catastrophic upheaval of the entire world, some jokes and silliness, death of at least 1 good guy somewhere along the line, the eventual rise to unholy levels of supremacy over the same NPCs who initially gave me such a hassle, some graphics which are amazing at the time the game comes out, etc.<br>
<br>
It's like... I don't go to Bond movies and complain that it's yet <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>another</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> movie about a spy who runs around on the tail of some lunatic bent on world domination armed with a bunch of gadgets and hooking up w/ some beautiful woman.  It's a formula series... one that just happens to work in my opinion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

PS: If you want more depth in the storyline I'd try some of the other games released by Square. Chrono Trigger &amp; Chrono Cross, Xenogears, Parasite Eve 1 &amp; 2, etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arkitip>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 527<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/10/03 9:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1733.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Lacking the magic</span><hr size=1> The Japanese versions of the FF series used to be more mature than was let on by their US release. I'm talking in the Super Nintendo age though, where they seriously dumbed the game down and messed with translations to appeal to the kid fanbase Nintendo aimed for.<br>
A fan translated ROM of FF IV will likely have you wondering what the hell it was you were playing when you put in the US release (FF II).<br>
<br>
I would argue what the series lacks today is that sense of whimsy, or the magic, of the original. Everything about VI fit, right down to the sometimes goofy character intros. I have a hard time feeling any connection to the recent characters, although the characters in VIII were really well fleshed out. Squall didn't like talking to people? Pretty broad brush stroke, since the game went pretty in depth about his anti-social behavior.<br>
<br>
Oh, you'll also notice that the earlier FF's did have *some* mature themes. IV starts with Cecil and crew pillaging a village and likely murdering some of its occupants. In VI Celes was about to kill herself, Kefka murdered an entire city, women and children included. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3195<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/10/03 9:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1733.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lacking the magic</span><hr size=1> I dunno... take the 1st two hours of Parasite Eve or Xenogears, and compare them against the 1st two hours of any FF game, old or recent.<br>
<br>
Sure, the FF games have some dark moments, but overall they 'feel' like they're targetting a teenage audience to me.  Some of them feel like they're focused on late teens, some on early teens, but none of them ever 'felt' like they were games targetting adults (regardless of whether or not adults enjoyed them).<br>
<br>
FF6 (FF3 in U.S.) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>was</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a great game.  I only liked about 4 of the characters from a personality standpoint though (the main one, Celes, Locke, and Setzer).  Most of the other ones (that knight guy, the old man, Sabbik, Relm, Mog, GoGo, etc) were forgettable.  I used Relm a lot, but only because her Magic score kicked ass.  Some of the bad guys were great (that stupid octupus guy was hilarious).<br>
<br>
So I guess what I'm saying is that FF has always been hit &amp; miss on different aspects.  Some games have great characters and a weak story.  Some games have a great story and a weak magic system.  Some games have a great magic system and weak plot.  Etc.  <br>
<br>
I don't think the FF series is any better or worse than it's ever been.  I just think you're older and thus more critical <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

PS: What's funny is I have a friend who hates every game in the series except FF1 (which he loved).  Maybe that's part of the appeal of the series... because they try something a little different every release, everyone has their favorite &amp; least favorite in the series.  Your fave just happened to be in the middle.<br>
<br>
I'd have a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>really</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hard time nailing down my favorite in the series.  Rather I'd have like a few favorite aspects of each game.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3210<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/12/03 8:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1733.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lacking the magic</span><hr size=1> Ah ha, found a lot more info.<br>
