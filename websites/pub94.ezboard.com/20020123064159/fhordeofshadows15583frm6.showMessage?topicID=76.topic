Streaks of fire arched in the starless night, announcing the presence of another line of archers hidden in the darkness.  It was a rain of fiery death, igniting everything it touched from human warrior to grass roofs on the clay buildings. Screams of horror filled the night.  Another wave of heavily armed orcs armed with short sword to lance assaulted the  squad of human defenders, the overly large jaws open in yawps of rage and blood lust as they cut though the humans, killing everything in its path. Then as the battle was in its full height the true slaughter began.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From the edge of the forest emerged five robed figures guarded by a host of Night elves and undead. They lowered there cowls of their robes and admired their work, as if they were discerning if the battle was complete. Apparently not, for they unleashed such magical furry that to see it would drive sane men mad, fires of hell seemed to raise from the earth to engulf human and orcs alike and lighting struck everything from the heavens with booms so loud that it shook the very ground, and swarms of undead began to rise from all the dead thet lay scattered on the ground. As soon as one fell dead it seems to the oberserver that it rose in death to carry out their masters bidding,  picking up whatever weapon lay nearby to use weather it be sword, axe or  some limb that was severed off the bodies that lay on the blood stained earth.  It was madness, it was the beginning of end for those few humans that chose this place to be  their home.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lieutenant De’Monte  a human warrior ran up the hill that overlooked the battle, his bloody armor clanking loudly as he made his way passed the remaining archers. Only one arm was working properly due to the black arrow shaft that protruded out his other  shoulder, he sheathed his long sword as he come up to the person he sought.  “Captain we must call the retreat! We have lost this day, save what men we can, I tell you it is a fools errand to stay any longer. We have done what we could! Now hurry and sound the retreat milord I implore thee!”   Captain O’Brien was a large man over 6 feet in height and his  long red beard shown him to be of the north land people, a tribe of warriors that braved the harsher climates of norrath, he was not one to run from any fight, in fact all his battles in the past had been victorious. He looked down at his lieutenant and judged the weight of his words.  Captain O’Brien adjusted his dented Red plate mail and spoke in hoarse tones, that betrayed his feeling.  “And what of the survivors of this village?! Do you suggest we run and hide like dogs beat by their masters! Nay I will not hear it, I will not run from this fight!” But milord we must…” “Did you not hear me lieutenant, I said I will not flee, but you speak the truth there is no hope of victory while facing these odds when the retreat is sounded flee to the city of Rivervale, from there you can take control of the remaining troops and warn the surrounding areas Freeport militia must know of what has befallen here this day.” Lieutenant De’Monte knowing his duties and the great loss of  this battle nodded solemnly, “ I understand milord,  but you need not do this! Flee,  flee with us to the confines and safety of Rivervale, what will your death gain you? Tis for naught I say.”  Captain O’Brien looked at his friend, a friend that has been with him from the beginning, “My friend remember well these words, sometimes even through death there is a victory to be had, I will keep my honor and buy at least some time for some of the civilians to escape,  we have known each other for nine years my friend, do not make this harder for me you know as well as I what needs to be done, Now go! Waste not one more minute!” and with that he raised the horn of calling , a magical horn that was gifted to him bye the High Elven council of Felwithe its sound once used would carry to all reaches of the land  so that all would here it. And as a tear streaked his dirty and scared face he blew on the horn with his last breath.<br>
