After some serious battling in the Crushbone area, I decide I'm going to check out Lesser Faydark.  Not too far from home(Kelethin) and I'm curious. So after stopping off, selling everything I picked up, depositing my coins and such into the bank I head south.  Before zoning in I cast my spells of enhancing and protection.  Enter and proceed to mosey on down the path, it's a beautiful night and I'm having a great time thus far. Recounting a previous Orc battle and thinking on how I could've improved it had me slightly distracted when a Giant Spider drops from the tree in front and slightly to the left of me.  I startle, she chitters, screeches, and clicks at me, crouching low ready to attack. Now I live by the creed harm none, unless it harms me, so since she's looking at me as lunch and at the right time and place I've found spider silks to be in high demand and very profitable I decide to oblige her.  I cast Snare and then Root, the spider shrieks in pain and anger, I gesture, cant, and snap my fingers, producing an explosion of fire directly under her abdomen, which really pisses her off. Time to draw the scimitar and head in for the kill. She attacks, I attack, the battle that is almost dance like goes well, she is able to move again, albeit slowly so I step back, cast snare, she's too weak to move out of that so I move in to finish her off. WHAM!!! I'm knocked down and now missing some flesh, bone, and hair from the wound gushing blood from the back of my skull.  “What the Frell?”  I slowly get up; turn to look, when a touch from a wet horse nose on my cheek drains the life from my body as everything fades to black and I fall to the ground.<br>

I'm back in Kelethin, naked and really confused. A slight nod in the Soulbinders direction, and I sit against an out of the way hut. A quick inventory shows I've arrived with all my parts and pieces intact other than the material things.  A slight gesture and a mumbled incantation brings my spell book to my hands, I rememorize my spells once I can think straight and send the book back to its place. “Humph.” This is going to be a long night.  I'm on my way back to getting my stuff.  Asking around about the creature, I’m met with mainly blank stares and shrugs of indifference.  Enroute to the zone a wolf sits next to the path speaking quietly in common seemingly to him self.  Not an ordinary occurrence around here so I stop. “Good Eve kind um well Good Eve to you.”  I leave it at that realizing how foolish I sound.  The wolf chuckles and introduces himself as a Druid of Tunare, obviously of a much higher season, since Wolf form is only for those above and beyond their 24th season.  Fascinated by this new addition to Kelethin I’m eager to talk but being naked I need to go.  Sensing the obvious distress, he asks me what seems to be the trouble, and why I’m not properly attired as befits a young druid. I explain my story and he softly chuckles as I finish my tale.  Slightly irritated that he’s amused at my misfortune, I turn to leave, as he places a hand on my shoulder and says “We all step into situations without knowing the full extent of our decisions, don’t let the lesson get lost in your emotions or let your emotions prevent you from resolving the situation.”  Just as I was about to respond with “emotions” a Tree standing just to the right of the wolf began casting.  I’d heard of tree form but never seen it until now and I can honestly say I will never look at trees the same way, now you never know, is it a tree or not?  The wind picked up a bit with a twinge of energy in it and I felt a tingling sensation as a wolf’s spirit passed into me.  Then the Air crackled with energy once more and I could feel my skin harden after he finished his casting. &quot;That should help young one, be careful out there.” Said a feminine voice.  I sat there stunned for a moment and thanked them sincerely, forgetting my annoyance at being laughed at, and proceeded to head to my destination.<br>
<br>
 Once I passed into the zone I cast my enhancements, protections and camouflage as my body faded from view.  Now where was that corpse? Trying to remember where you died isn’t as easy as you may think it is.  But turns out this time was simple, it was guarded by the Nightmare, who I later find out is a Unicorn with a cut off Horn but that’s another tale for a Bard to tell.  She neighs, snorts, and stomps impatiently, as if she's waiting on something.   I sit down and hide, hoping that the additional cover will give me an advantage. Finally she leaves.  Once she’s out of sight I momentarily reappear as I recast Camouflage, since it decides to leave me at the worst moments leading me to believe that Tunare loves to play with this spell and the followers that use it. I head over to my corpse and shudder; this part is always a bit creepy for me, staring at your own bloody corpse that is staring off into nothing now and then looting it. Once I've retrieved everything, including the spider silks and legs, and put it all back on I head the opposite way than the Nightmare, casting a backward glance just in time to see the corpse meld into the earth.  After a little travel I see a few huts along the path in the dim light of Luclins glow, WHAM! OW!  I Look down at my hands, I'm still invisible, what the Frell?  The pain is unbelievable stinging coursing through my body.  RUN you elf RUN, is all I could think off, casting is not an option.  I feel the Lupine spirit leave in a breeze. I now feel like I’m running underwater with the hot acrid snorting in my ears from behind.  All of a sudden I am caught, the enhancements are gone and I can do nothing but run forward, I can't turn and can't stop, can barely breath. THUD! into a tree, SMACK another tree, I look like a necromancers first animated subject running into everything in sight. I try to fall and can't even manage that. She runs me up the hill and continues her sound beating of me until…. <br>

I'm back in control of all body parts save the endless shivering of rage and fear...A couple of deep breaths to calm down.  The expression on my face must've been enough to dissuade the soulbinder from his usual sarcastic remarks, since he just nodded slightly and went about his business.  I wonder over to the previous hut and sit down, conjure the spell book clear my thoughts and rememorize, Deja vu.<br>
<br>
Once I’m done a frustrated shout at Tunare from the treetops, &quot;What in the planar realms is that frelling horse creature?” gets me another visit from the elder Druid and his once treeformed but now elven female companion. “ I’ll go with you this time, too many death passes will corrupt your mind and soul.” He says as they come across the swinging vine bridge.  I stand up and send the Spell book back. “Death passes? I’ve never heard it phrased that way, what do you mean?”  He turns to his friend and nods. She smiles, lightly touches his forearm, and then heads back across the bridge to a merchant.  Turning back to me “Death passes are not quite death per se’.  Meaning that they aren’t permanent as once thought long ago.  Death used to be thought of as permanent because the times between “death” and “rebirth” took so long and we would start in a new body as well.  Take this last time you died. Back then you would have been returned but much later, say 100 years or so, and different, without any recollection of any of your previous lives or experiences.  You wouldn’t have come back in the same body but in a newborns to begin all over again.” He points to a baby wood elf being fed by his mother walking across the platform.  Astounded all I could do was simply stare.  Smiling at my incomprehension he continued “There are many theories and philosophies as to why we now keep our bodies and memories when we pass, and I believe there is a little truth in all of them.  Still Death can be permanent if the gods so choose so better to not offer temptation. While Death passes do take their toll, draining our life-force, memories, and knowledge and if it happens enough you could end up no more than a powerless child.  That is very rare and only happens to the most foolish. Now we should get going before the earth reclaims your body.” Realizing that I was, indeed, still without all my things and in desperate need of sleep I nodded and began my way to the lift. <br>
<br>
On our way to the Zone the Lady Druid explained to us what she knew of this once proud Unicorn named Equestrielle.  Now referred to as Equestrielle the corrupt.  Her abilities and how to best get around her.  Right before we zoned we stood while they cast on each other and on me.  I cast my own spells that weren’t already in affect and left off Camouflage but made sure I had gate firmly memorized.  The idea was for them to lead it away so I could retrieve the corpse and be gone.  I just hoped I could find my corpse, since I really didn’t have the coin to hire a bard, or worse a necromancer, which I wouldn’t even know how to find if I needed to.  I headed back to the huts, which was the last thing I remembered seeing clearly and began my search in the direction I thought I went.  It seemingly took forever.  Between jumping at every noise thinking Equestrielle was there, to wandering in the dark trying to find a corpse all the while remembering what she would do to me if she caught me again, made for a very nerve wracking time.  After hours and nearly at the end of my rope I headed back to the huts.  I sat on the bench between newly made friends and almost cried from sheer overwhelming exhaustion if nothing else. They each patted my knee thoughtfully as we sat there in silent contemplation.  During all this searching we had missed that it was getting lighter, dawn was just over the horizon.  We all looked up as the place took on a surreal feeling that was detectable to those who were attuned, to see the real Equestrielle in all her radiance and splendor stand on the outskirts of the forest, tip her horn down slightly and then disappear into the forest as if to say all would be well in the coming day.  Smiling I got up to do a final search and looked back at my friends to say I was heading this way when I tripped over something and landed face first on the ground.  I rolled over, sat up and looked at what it was that took me down?  I couldn’t believe what I was looking at, a Leafrunners Scimitar, my scimitar.  I frantically got up and looked around, started finding little things and finally my corpse, not more than a stones throw from that second hut.  How I got turned around and back at the place I started was anyone’s guess but there it was, in horribly nasty shape. I almost threw up all over myself but managed to keep it together until I got everything back on and moved away.  Luckily it had been a long time since I ate so not much came up.  Relieved and dead tired, I heartily thanked my friends, hugged them both and mentioned it was time for some much needed sleep. We all agreed, wished each other well and gated our separate ways.  I appeared in front of the Soulbinder “I see you found your things, I trust the thief is a but a memory now?” he chuckled. I grinned, happy to be back, headed home and fell fast asleep in my chair after having stripped down, changed to a simple tunic and said a brief prayer of thanks for making it home and through another ‘death pass’.     <br>
