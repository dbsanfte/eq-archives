I have a new friend who has just arrived at the Plane of Firiona Vie and he would like to join a guild.  I have looked at The List, but I am looking for some pretty specific qualities that are (understandably) not included.  This is what I am looking for or would like to create.  (I don't want to create a new guild, though, if one already exists that matches up.)  I like the server a lot, and the people I have met so far have been great.<br>
<br>
1) Strong emphasis on roleplaying in all settings (in guild chat and on forums -- ooc pretty much restricted to tells, emergencies, or specific forums.<br>
2) Good in alignment -- their purpose is to seek out and thwart evil.<br>
3) Allows all races with the assumption that people from &quot;evil&quot; stock have committed themselves to fighting for the cause of good.  (I have a Dark Elf on the &quot;Plane of Xegony&quot; who is good and believes the rest of his race to be misguided.)<br>
4) Allows creative license as far as background.  If a troll wants to claim to worship Tunare, I won't argue.  In other words, the game mechanics don't need to match with the roleplaying put forward by the players.<br>
5) Includes all levels of experience, low through 65.<br>
6) I can go either way on including all classes, but I have heard some good roleplaying reasons why necromancers are not evil.  I think the same could be done for SK's.<br>
7) I prefer a guild large enough so that there is diverse talent and so people can actually pursue goals and adventures together.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  One that is friendly and gets along well -- primarily not whiney with a lot of in-fighting.  By Brells' Stout, I hate that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
9) A fairly active message board/forums, to help keep people tied together.<br>

When I was looking for a guild, I didn't run a across one which allowed all that you are asking for.  If you want to make a Troll Shadowknight who worships Tunare and want to get into a guild in the first season, I think you will be in way over your head.  The good guilds won't accept you because you are both a Troll and a SK and the evil guild won't allow someone who is preaching Tunare to them.  You might find a Neutral guild, but as I said, I didn't run across any THAT neutral.  Of course, I was looking for a good/neutral guild for a High Elf Enchanter worshipping Karana.<br>
<br>
If you want to RP and get into a guild, you'll have a much easier time following the race/class/diety guidelines given by EQ.  A Dark Elf SK worshipping Innoruk may seem boring, but one of those can probably get into one of the better RP guild out there.  Another great RP guild would accept you as a Wood Elf Druid worshipping Karana or Tunare.<br>
<br>
But if you really want that person who sticks out because you want a really hard RP basis, or just like being different, good luck in finding a guild. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/Oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Koada'dal Enchanter of the 39th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=castinareleas@firionavie>CastinarEleas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/02 12:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=385.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Looking for a very specific type of guild...</span><hr size=1> /em bows to Dhugal<br>
My thanks unto thee for recognizing what it is we have accomplished over the past 14 months, my friend.<br>
<br>
Master Mithalwulf, <br>
<br>
As Dhugal has indicated, we might be close to what it is thee seek after for thy friend.  I would ask you to read my <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showMessage?topicID=371.topic" target="top">response to Isharra</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> found here...it may be that it does answer some of thy inquiries.<br>
<br>
I shall also address certain other specific questions here...for the rest, I would urge thee to contact myself, Lady Tithianus, Seeker Janthos, or another officer of Court.<br>
<br>
1)  As mentioned in the missive above, Court stands in antithesis to Evil.  We have mostly good aligned beings, with some few Neutral whom have seen the balance shift dangerously over toward said evil.<br>
<br>
2) We do contain within our halls three of the Tier'dal *(or 2 1/2 technically <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )* whom have returned to the Mother of All.  We currently have not any of the others whom generally follow Evil...mayhap as there are naught about in whom the spark of goodness has kindled...or mayhap as our requirements have proven to steep for one such as them to follow.<br>
<br>
We do have the requirement of at least 10 seasons behind one whom seeks to gain admittance to Court, and we currently number members with as many as 55 seasons behind them (current average level is probably low 40s).<br>
<br>
Our membership currently numbers some 70 or so, with usually two dozen or more about Norrath on a typical night (we have strong EST-PST base, with some GMT and at least one far east time zone) --- you will generally always be able to find someone of us about.<br>
<br>
*ooc* Okay... most of the rest is mechanics, so I shall revert to something...easier to understand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A couple additions:  Race/class --- we have 3 &quot;Tier'dal&quot;, one of which is a necromancer.  Race/Class is not necessarily an indication of evil/good, as you pointed out.  However, expect if your friend wishes to play one normally of evil alignment, to be mistrusted (at best) in the beginning of his dealins with Court.  We have had (and probably continue to have) some whom do not/will not trust completely one of that type.  It makes for some fun RP --- if sometimes &quot;heated&quot; (always IC -- never OOC problems).<br>
<br>
We do have restrictions/conditions to meet if you are &quot;Evil&quot; and wish to join Court.  They are not easy conditions.  The easiest to meet are:  Must be RP GOOD aligned... NOT evil aligned.  Must obviously have an RP backstory to show why/how you do not follow your racial tendency (Not looking for a book written beforehand --- a few ideas with a little flesh to them to show a little work on your part is enough... the story will come out as you actually go through the probation process).    You will have to find a Court sponsor, whom you meet IC, and from whom you gain enough trust to request your admittance.  At the end of your probation (30 days, perhaps more, based on Officer's vote) the Officers will vote -- you will need a majority of &quot;Yes&quot; votes to give you full membership).<br>
<br>
There are other conditions as well --- if what I have said so far indicates we may be what you look for, please contact me or another officer in-game and I will give the rest of the information.  <br>
<br>
A couple more general points:  We are a RP guild.  We tend to stay IC in /guild /group and to an extent /raid as well.  There are certain channels that may or may not tolerate /ooc chatter -- for instance officers channel is generally ooc -- -that is up to your respective Division Lord/Lady to determine.  We do not have a global /ooc channel.  For that reason, sometimes /ooc does creep into /guild --- all /ooc will be annotated (usually using &lt;ooc&gt; or * xxxx * or some such)... and usually won't be allowed to continue overly long.<br>
<br>
Our message boards are fairly active, with a variety of IC/OOC forums, public and private forums.  You can find a link to the boards on our main web-page (apoligies that it is slightly out of date... it is usually kept pretty close to being up to date &lt;G&gt;) <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://members.cox.net/kantzgk" target="top">Court of the Crosswinds</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to drop in and look around....contact any of us in game.... we are (mostly) a friendly bunch, with a lot going on on any given day, and always ready to make new friends.  <br>

Master Tich Greyskull, you are a credit to our race, and I am certain that Brell is pleased with you.  (He told me so after I finished my third keg of Brell Stout.  It was a slow night.)  However, my friend on the Plane of Firiona Vie is a half elf.  Although a weaker race, he is a good sort and stout of heart.  If you see him, think on him as a friend.  His name is Vanstorm, and he is a troubled youth, for his father, a close friend, was recently lost at sea.<br>
<br>
I read the messages between Isharra Moonsong and Castinar Eleas and was most impressed.  I have looked over the  writings of Court of the Crosswinds at their Guild Hall and have interacted with a couple of the guild members.  Vanstorm will be looking for members to hunt with in the near future.<br>
<br>
Oligith and Dhugal -- thank you for your words.  You may wonder why a dwarven cleric and a half-elf ranger care about the fate of evil races.  Well, that is a long tale, and more than one at that.  And unfortunately the spell Brell has granted me to commune across planes is draining even for a dwarf and my spell begins to fade.<br>
<br>
Isharra, it is too bad that you missed the words of Castinar, but hopefully our paths will all cross over a pint someday soon.<br>
<br>

<br>
We have almost everything you are looking for. We all came to Firiona Vie to do the same things.<br>
<br>
1) Strong emphasis on roleplaying in all settings (in guild chat and on forums -- ooc pretty much restricted to tells, emergencies, or specific forums.<br>
<br>
GOT IT<br>
<br>
2) Good in alignment -- their purpose is to seek out and thwart evil.<br>
<br>
GOT IT<br>
<br>
3) Allows all races with the assumption that people from &quot;evil&quot; stock have committed themselves to fighting for the cause of good. (I have a Dark Elf on the &quot;Plane of Xegony&quot; who is good and believes the rest of his race to be misguided.)<br>
<br>
GOT IT<br>
<br>
4) Allows creative license as far as background. If a troll wants to claim to worship Tunare, I won't argue. In other words, the game mechanics don't need to match with the roleplaying put forward by the players.<br>
<br>
GOT IT<br>
<br>
5) Includes all levels of experience, low through 65.<br>
<br>
Working on it<br>
<br>
6) I can go either way on including all classes, but I have heard some good roleplaying reasons why necromancers are not evil. I think the same could be done for SK's.<br>
<br>
Got one in guild. GOT IT<br>
<br>
7) I prefer a guild large enough so that there is diverse talent and so people can actually pursue goals and adventures together.<br>
<br>
Working on it<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  One that is friendly and gets along well -- primarily not whiney with a lot of in-fighting. By Brells' Stout, I hate that.  <br>
<br>
GOT IT<br>
<br>
9) A fairly active message board/forums, to help keep people tied together.<br>
<br>
Drop me a line and we can discuss things... kc.mayo@verizon.net<br>
