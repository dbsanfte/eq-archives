I got to thinking about it because of a story my mother (a nurse) told me a few months ago.  The story isn't important, but it involved a patient having to take medication that caused him to forget the events of the previous few days.  This is what got me thinking.<br>
<br>
If a man commits a crime, then knowingly takes a drug that causes him to forget the crime, is he innocent?  Let's assume that the drug erases all memory of premeditation as well as the act.  Also assume that the person is not entirely &quot;bad&quot;, in that he could be an average joe that for some reason, under unordinary circumstances, commits a heinous crime.  Say this circumstance is unlikely to happen again.  To put it simply - it was a crime of passion that could have happened to anybody:  this particular man was no more susceptable to it than anybody else.<br>
<br>
So, what do you think?  Is he innocent or guilty?  Both from a legal, and moral standpoint.  If it can be proven in court with 100% certainty that this man has no idea that he committed this crime, or why he committed, should he be aquitted?  If he is standing at the gates of heaven, should he be judged for what he did?<br>
<br>
Keep in mind a few things.  First, this was not an accident, he knowingly destroyed his memory for this VERY purpose.  Second, put yourself in his situation.  You wake up one day, no different than the last, and suddenly you are facing life in prison for something you have no clue happened, and you scream to the very end that you are innocent.<br>
<br>
I think this is hard as hell to say one way or the other, but I am leaning towards innocent, morally at least, and within a lot of grey area legally too.<br>

<br>
Taking the 'forget stuff' drug doesn't mitigate the actual damage done by the crime.  Nor does taking the drug somehow cleanse him of whatever caused him to be a criminal.  It simply erased his memory of the incident.<br>
<br>
We don't lock up criminals because they remember what they did.  We lock up criminals because of the fact of what they did (punishment) and the danger that they may do it again (protection of society).  A poor memory, drug-induced or not, addresses neither issue.<br>
<br>
Stating that it was a 'crime of passion' that anyone could have committed has nothing to do with the drug.  That calls into question whether anyone should be convicted of your hypothetical defense, regardless of whether they remember it.<br>
<br>
Finally, if such a drug existed, and if the &quot;I don't remember&quot; defense worked... well, this is a pretty steep slide, as slippery slopes go. <p>Hunter Gyre Redbranch<br>

As the previous posted said, forgetting you did it doesnt somehow remove the fact you did it.<br>
<br>
Simply forgetting you did it doesnt absolve you of guilt. Generally the only way to be found innocent of a crime you committed is to be judged mentally incapabale of understanding the nature of the crime when you committed it.<br>
<br>
Morally he should be judged as well, he chose to commit the crime, knowing it was wrong, and then to ease his concious took a pill to elimanate the potential grief for doing it. Not only is he guilty of the crime he committed, he is a coward. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elissina>Elissina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/12/03 9:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2007.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guilty or Innocent?</span><hr size=1> I'd have to say guilty from a moral standpoint.<br>

<br>
This statement bothers me. I don't think everyone would respond to the same circumstances with murder. There's pretty convincing evidence that one person can be genetically more inclined to murder than another. Murder isn't something that just 'happens' to someone.<br>
<br>
Having no memory of the event doesn't change the fact that it happened, and it no doubt affected many people. I'm sure the victim's family wouldn't be satisfied with the murderer getting off because he doesn't remember his crime. They have to live with the aftermath of his crime, so should he.<br>
<br>
People often lose parts of their memory following a traumatic event. I'm not actually sure if this is common following crimes of passion, but I don't see any reason why this should absolve them of the crime they've committed. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.imgmag.com/images/leknill/EliTrans.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

The defendent had no memory of the events immediately prior to the event or immediately afterwards.  Although this fact came out during testimony, it was never used as evidence for his innocence.  It was simply information that had been brought out in testimony.  <br>

<br>
Really, drop the part between the commas to get the real question.  &quot;If a man commits a crime, is he innocent?&quot;<br>
<br>
What he does to assuage his personal feelings of guilt is irrelevent.  Either he did commit the crime, in which case he is guilty, or he didn't, in which case he is innocent.  While, from his standpoint, it is unjust, because he does not remember doing it, the victims are no less victimized for his inability to remember it.  <br>
<br>
Also, ponder the ramifications of saying that if you can't remember it, you aren't guilty.  Suddenly everyone keeps a stock on hand.  I decide one day, I really need money.  I go rob a bank and take a memory-erasing drug.  Not guilty your honor.  Sure that certainly seems to be me on the videotape shooting the teller, but I don't remember a thing.  I'm free?  Thank you.  These pills are great!<br>
<br>
For an interesting story with similar theme, I highly recommend &quot;How it was when the past went away&quot; by Robert Silverberg.  Terrorist drops a memory destroying drug in a city's water supply.  A very good read.<br>

The fact that he took the drugs would still be irrelevent. The truly awful part of this scenario would be that they might forget their child has been murdered as well, and have to live that over again. Ok offtrack I know..<br>
<br>
I think in this kind of scenario, memory-loss drugs or not, you'd have a good case for arguing you weren't in your right mind when you committed the crime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/03 3:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2007.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Memories</span><hr size=1> Guilty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=takkonsmakafu>Takkon Smakafu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/03 3:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2007.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Memories</span><hr size=1> Whistlers post is a different issue.  I mean, the two could be combined, but eh.<br>
<br>
My line of thinking is this.  Jail does two things:  punish, and prevent.  I will grant you that a criminal must be prevented from future crime, but if he does not remember the crime, then he CANNOT be punished for it.  You can &quot;punish&quot; him, but it won't be effective in the sense of the word.<br>
<br>
I just cannot help thinking of a scenario where I wake up one day and am hauled off to prison for life, where my future, all my dreams and aspirations, are thrown into the gutter for, according to my perspective, no reason at all.<br>
<br>
The idea of intentional memory loss is a big factor, and it is most likely the no1 reason why the person will be guilty.  As long as there is no tolerance, nobody would have a reason for doing this other than to hurt themselves.  I'd much rather be serving time for something I know I did than go to prison thinking I was innocent.<br>
<br>
There are people who have sustained severe brain injuries that effectively changes their personality, even causes them to become retarded etc.  So I would say there is a large grey area to be considered.<br>

If you commit a crime you are guilty of committing the crime. Your lack of memory does not negate the crime YOU committed. Your supposition was and is, that the person KNOWINGLY.. premeditatedly... committed a crime. Whether they remember doing it or not, they are guilty.<br>
<br>
The only way you could be found not guilty ( though in some states your still guilty just not punished ther same) is if a court determines you were incapable of understanding the nature of the crime, You didnt know the difference between right and wrong.<br>
<br>
Having committed the crime knowingly, the person should be punished, whether he remembers the crime or not is not important. Society has the right and responsibility to punish him for his crime.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seraphimmm>Seraphimmm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.cox.net/seraphimm/boundhandsrose.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Existant

Trouble is, Takkon, you're looking at it from the relativistic point of view. If everything is relative to the observer (in this case, the murderer), then there might be some doubt. <br>
But it isn't. The environment exists whether or not he remembers it, or watches it. The results of his crime are still there (say, a body), even if he doesn't remember commiting the crime.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95331" target="_new">
