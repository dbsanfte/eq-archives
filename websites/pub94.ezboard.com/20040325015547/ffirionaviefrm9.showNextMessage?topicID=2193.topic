Runs faster = runs hotter. So whichever component you choose to overclock, your main concern will always be heat dissipation.<br>

I'm definitely no expert but I would support the idea of reading such sites as overclockers.com before fiddling. Get an idea of the changes it's possible to make to your particular system. Have an idea of what particular enhancements you're looking for (overall processing speed? 3D gaming framerates? etc.) and find out which component tweaks will benefit you most. Other people's test reports may give you recommended, tried-and-tested settings and cooling suggestions. Specific cooling solutions may be required for certain tweaks: even having 6 fans may not help if the cooling effect isn't acting exactly where it's needed.<br>

The only time I've run one of my PC's overclocked was quite a few years ago, when a friend of mine - in his &quot;infinite knowledge&quot; and inability to leave PCs untweaked - upped the FSB a tad, giving me just a couple of percent better performance. It was unnoticeable, to be honest, unless you were running benchmarks to test the exact figures. But I didn't know much about it back then, how to reverse what he had done, or that it might cause heat problems. Three months later I had to take my PC over to his house so he could help me figure out why it was refusing to boot, displaying all kinds of weird glitchy crap on the screen when I switched it on. He rummaged around inside the PC and pulled out a CPU covered in black crusty stuff (the thermal transfer compound, in a previous life) -- &quot;Looks like your CPU got too hot, it's cooked.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> impressed. I had to buy a new CPU (no surprise there) and, because the technology conveniently changes almost every year, a new motherboard to fit it and new RAM. Pretty much a new system. For about 3 months of approximately 2-3% better performance. I was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>p*ssed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Personal opinion:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I consider the risk and potential cost to outweigh the performance boost. Without more drastic modifications to your PC and a greater investment of time (and possibly money), the largest boost you'll see is probably only a relatively small percentage of your processing power. If you're looking solely for a performance boost and are prepared to spend a little cash, I would suggest spending a few of those dollars/pounds/euros/yen on an extra 512MB or so of RAM. Unless your system is wholly overloaded with it already, you'll get your performance boost from the extra RAM - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>without</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the risk or potential instabilities. That said, if you're looking for a hobby, if you enjoy tweaking electronic systems, are anally retentive about benchmark scores, have more than one PC (in case things go wrong), and have money and time to burn... you might enjoy it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Some of the watercooled PCs shown off on the web are very impressive! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calonderiel@firionavie>Calonderiel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_whitespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/7/03 4:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=talastius>Talastius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blueberry Yogurt, anyone?</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/7/03 3:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2181.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: OverClocking help:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When i get this stuff into the new case, i'll be running about 6 fans, very well cooled, and was getting curious about the over clocking deal. what does it do?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Don't take this wrong, but if you need to ask this question, just leave it alone. You need to know exactly what you are doing and how far you can push it. Mess up a multiplier and its bye bye computer.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/JCOLE1/pnimages/talastiusportraitsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Err...maybe that wasn't such a simple explanation.<br>
<br>
Lets try that again. A CPU (or any other &quot;synchronous&quot; device) runs at a particular clock speed. What that means is that the chip receives a signal that pulses X times a second. Every time it receives a clock signal (one of the pulses), the chip tries to do another operation. The clock signal is external to the chip, meaning that unless the chip has some kind of safeguard in place (most do), you can increase the speed of the clock signal to make the chip work faster.<br>
<br>
In terms of the circuit design, there really isn't any significant differences between say, an Athlon XP 3000+ and an Athlon XP 3200+ (if they're both Barton cores). The difference is basically just the quality control of the manufacturing process. There is no definite answer to the question: &quot;How fast is this chip?&quot; The question the manufacturer asks is &quot;How fast will this chip run without producing a significant number of errors over a long period of time?&quot; That's what the manufacturer's rating for the chip really is. It's not an absolute speed limit. Depending on how well a particular chip was made, it may or may not run reliably at speeds higher than what the manufacturer determined.<br>
<br>
The art of overclocking, then, is simply finding out just how far you can push a particular chip beyond it's &quot;official&quot; speed. Doing so comes with risk. The faster you run the CPU, the hotter it gets. Moreso with an overclocked chip than one that runs at that speed &quot;naturally&quot;. If the CPU gets too hot, it will damage it. Overclocking also sometimes requires an increase in the voltage that's supplied to the CPU. Increasing the voltage too much can also well and truly fry your CPU. And even if you don't damage the CPU, overclocking it too far may cause it to make mistakes, and that can cause all kinds of problems when you actually try to do something with it.<br>
<br>
Intel and AMD CPUs can be overclocked in two ways. First the basics: the CPU's internal speed is determined by two things. One is the speed of the front side bus (FSB), which is the data channel between the CPU and main memory. The speed of the FSB also acts as the clock signal for the CPU in almost all cases. Because the FSB is usually much slower than the desirable speed of a modern CPU, the FSB's clock signal is run through a multiplier circuit to create the signal that actually drives the CPU. The multiplier circuit can be adjusted to several values. So, if your FSB is 200MHz, and you use a multiplier of 10x, you get a final CPU speed of 2GHz. If you used a 14x multiplier, the CPU would run at 2.8GHz. So one method of overclocking is to increase the multiplier. You can also increase the speed of the FSB, but this also effects memory, which may introduce more instability/risk. On the other hand, increasing the FSB has the potential to give you even better performance than if you just fiddled with the multiplier.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned breifly before, most CPUs are &quot;locked&quot;, meaning that the maximum multiplier has been set by circuitry on the CPU so that you can't overclock the chip (both as a safety guard and for the manufacturer's own financial reasons <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Fortunately, both P4s and Athlon XPs are easly unlocked using a variety of methods. In many cases, your motherboard's CMOS program is capable of unlocking it for you so that you can do whatever you want with the multiplier. This is both a blessing and a curse.<br>
<br>
I can't stress how important it is to read up thoroughly on the subject before you try this, and how critical it is that you know the limitations of your cooling system. Case fans are important part of a complete nutritious breakfast, but they take a back seat to the heatsink and fan on the CPU. The HSF is *much* more critical to the equation. Before you even think about overclocking, get a program like Sisoft Sandra and run your CPU up to 100% utilization for a long time (30 minutes or more) and test what kind of temperature you're getting now. I keep my computer's CPU temperature &lt;55C at all times, and my newer machines are always &lt;51C. I wouldn't be comfortable with anything &gt;60C even though that's still well below the death temperature. Some people will disagree with that, I'm sure, and say that anything &lt;70C is OK, but when you can buy a reasonably quiet HSF than cools to ~50C for $30, there's just no excuse. Especially not if you have an overclocked system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=terathiel>Terathiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/7/03 9:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2181.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mutedfaith.com/quizart/demi2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: OverClocking help:</span><hr size=1> i was interested in the topic, but was not the one to make the mods, my friend was talking about doing it to my comp, and he knows a lot. but he left back to school in SD, so, can't really ask him the questions, so i thought i would ask you people... thanks for the info, greatly appreciated.

Depending on where you live I woud maybe recomend a place called Fry's Electronics (many through out California)... unsure if they are in other states but they ALWAYS have great deals on cases with power supplies in them. Also try <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.compusa.com" target="top">CompUSA</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> or Microcenter. There is a free magazine in California called &quot;<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ccnmag.com/" target="top">California Computer News</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->&quot; that usually has MANY advertisements in it for everything from floppy drives to SCSI drives to video cards or complete systems. I highly recommend this case <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.extremecase.com/detail.aspx?ID=108" target="top">THERMALTAKE</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> that comes with 7 fans (2 in the back, 2 in the front, 2 on the see through side, and 1 on the top) and a digital thermometer that has a sensor that goes under your processor so you can see how hot your processor actually get and will start to beep if your processor exceeds the temperature to set... you can also adjust the speed of all 7 fans with the 4 controls located around the digital thermometer display. The other nice this is the thumb screws on the back and NO SCREW needed to install drives or expansion cards due to the plastic items you can attack to your drives to make them easy to pull out or slide in. Drwa back is the power supply is NOT included but I am sure you could order one from them to suit your needs depending on your other hardware specs. FYI that is the case I am currently using for my desktop system and really enjoy it... it is also very quiet. One last thing.. it also has USB, Firewaire, and audio connectors located on the top of the system tower inside a nice click close cover as opposed to having them located in the from bottom of the system.<br>

I might have been laying it on a little thick in my last post as far as the risk goes. That's deliberate. If you aren't a little nervous about overclocking for the first time, you haven't been adequately warned :P.<br>
<br>
Fact: If you overclock your chip too far and your cooling is inadequate or if you ram the core voltage up too high, you can (and probably will) damage your chip.<br>
<br>
Fact: If you tweak it a little bit at time, testing the maximum CPU temperature at 100% load for at least 5-10 minutes between each test, it's not very likely that you'll damage any hardware. You'll eventually reach a point at which the chip starts acting funny. This can cause crashes, BSODs, etc., which in turn could damage a system file or something like that, but it usually doesn't come to that. It's no more risky than any other Windows crash.<br>
<br>
Personally, if you're the only one who uses the computer, I say go for it. There's no way to learn how it's done except to just do it. As long as you're watching your temperature and not messing with the core voltage in BIOS, your worst fear is a blue screen. My advice is to first bump the FSB frequency up just a little - maybe by 10MHz first, and then in 5MHz intervals after that and see how it responds. When you're done with that, set the FSB back down to normal and try raising the multiplier instead. Go 0.5x at a time - from 11.0x to 11.5x, for example. As long as the chip stays cool you should be fine. &quot;Advanced&quot; overclockers can sometimes resort to raising the core voltage supplied to the CPU in order to get speeds that aren't stable at the default core voltage, but I would strongly disuade a novice overclocker from doing that. Get some overclocking experience and knowledge under your belt before you try that.<br>
<br>
Maximum die temperature for a P4 depends on the frequency of the chip, the core voltage and the max FSB speed:<br>
<br>
2.60GHz core, 400MHz FSB = 72C max<br>
2.66GHz core, 533MHz FSB = 74C max (there is no 2.60Ghz core with a 533 FSB)<br>
2.60GHz core, 800MHz FSB = 75C max<br>
<br>
These are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>maximum</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> temperatures. Anything higher than that will damage the CPU. It's not a good idea to let it get anywhere close to that temperature. If I were you, I'd back down on the overclocking if your CPU temperature gets with 10C of the maximum.<br>
<br>
Here are Intel's data sheet and thermal design guide for the P4:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.intel.com/design/pentium4/datashts/29864311.pdf">P4 Datasheet</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.intel.com/design/pentium4/guides/25216101.pdf">P4 (with hyperthreading) Thermal Design Guide</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
The Datasheet has a chart with all of the thermal specifications including max and min temperature (apparently anything less than 5C will damage a P4. Who knew?) and maximum thermal power.<br>
<br>
Everything you ever wanted to know about about the P4 processor can be found here:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.intel.com/design/pentium4/">www.intel.com/design/pentium4/</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
I would also read up about cooling systems on Toms Hardware Guide:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com">www.tomshardware.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
And at Anandtech:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anandtech.com">www.anandtech.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
The Anandtech forums are a good place to ask about cooling and overclocking questions:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://forums.anandtech.com">forums.anandtech.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Those resources should help. I don't personally own any Intel hardware, so I can't give any specific instructions for overclocking a P4, but I'm sure you can find what you need between Tom's and Anandtech. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sabrosia>Sabrosia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lady of the Wolf</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/03 3:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2181.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: OverClocking help:</span><hr size=1> To be blunt, overclocking is a dumb idea....

Quite frankly:  If you don't have the money to buy a more powerful chip, you don't have the money to replace everything should your overclocked processor (whatever it may be (video or CPU)) burns up...<br>

Overclocking simply ain't worth the risks...<br>

Some chips, say celerons, are actually full blown P4's with the cache disabled and underclocked.<br>
<br>
And you'll only burn up a chip if you're not paying attention or don't put your heatsink on properly.  Most often, your computer will crash long before your CPU burns out.<br>
<br>
Yes, you risk destroying hardware.  On the other hand, getting 1.5 gig performance out of a 1gig chip... makes it worthwhile.  Even if you burn one up, the 1 gig chip is $70 where the 1.5 is $250ish.  (yes, old speeds, old prices.
