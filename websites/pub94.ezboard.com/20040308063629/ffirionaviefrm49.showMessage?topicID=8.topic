<br>
The guy in question insisted on Alpha Loot when we'd been Master Looting, then looted out of turn a few times.  The person keeping track of whose loot it was decided to skip him twice because he looted out of turn twice.  That's when this guy told the group &quot;that's gay!&quot;<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;I'm gay.  Watch your tongue.&quot;  (I realize that, to some, that's going to be considered an &quot;attack&quot; or that I'm  an &quot;arrogant asshole&quot; for saying anything about it.)<br>
<br>
Another person in my group really let him have it, though.  I mean, really let him have it.<br>
<br>
Then he tried to say he didn't mean it as &quot;an insult&quot;, that he meant it as &quot;you know, like gay meaning dumb!&quot;<br>

It's an expression (a dumb one).  IMHO you'd be a lot better off just tellin people that using &quot;gay&quot; in that context puts a negative spin on the word, and as a gay man you find that offensive.  If ya think somethin's dumb just say dumb instead.<br>
<br>
I think he'd be less likely to use the phrase in the future and it wouldn't end up bein such a big ol' mess.  A lot of people use that phrase and don't mean anything by it.  No need to jump all over them when correctin' 'em.<br>
<br>

I think the people who use the word know that it's putting a negative spin on it.  I think that's the intent.<br>

The one who really blew up was straight, by the way.  I tried to keep my cool about it, and convey a) I'm gay and b) I'm offended without saying c) you're an ignorant little jerk (which is what I was thinking). <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

I'm in my 20's and I started hearing that particular 'insult' back when I was in 6th grade.  I happen to know a man in his 40's that refers to people he doesn't like as fags.  It's not fair to blame this on children when it's been around a long time.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, I hear it alot.  It's disturbing, but I do not think alot of people mean anything by it...by using it you become desensitized to it, and it becomes just another word.  Enter the military and you will become so desensitized to curse words that when someone shouts at you without using them you'll actually feel worse than if they had!<br>
<br>
Now that I've defended the ignorant, I have to play Devil's Advocate to myself.  I really hate that this is going around like it is.  I've heard it alot...for a long time honestly...in EQ.  In FPS games it's thrown around commonly.  But I hear people come here, complain that keys aren't no drop or that they can't bind anywhere they want, and immediately That's Gay.  Someone was using the shout channel in GFay as their own little talk show or something, complaining about Arboreans don't drop amber or bark enough, and I heard the term enough that for the first time ever I've turned off the shout channel.<br>
<br>
It's really a nasty thing, and I hope that in the years to come we'll look down on it as hard as most of us look down on racial slurs.  Noone's race or sexuality should be an object of insult, especially over a silly game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 4:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is so str8!</span><hr size=1> Not everyone who says a phrase bothers to think through it's origins.<br>

It's a phrase.  People hear it associated with something stupid by their friends and they pick it up, same as people pick up any other phrase.<br>
<br>
If they don't bother to think about what they're actually saying, they'll keep on using it not realizing how it could affect someone.  Doesn't mean they have anything against gay people, or that they're trying to make a crack against them.<br>
<br>
Ignorance does not equal jerk.  It's when you try to enlighten someone and they choose to remain ignorant that they can become a jerk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Take the word &quot;colored&quot;.  It's a southern word used to describe people who aren't caucasian, and many people take offense at it.  Yet if you drive down South, you can probably find quite a few persons of color who use the word.  Doesn't make 'em racist, or give them some secret agenda.<br>

People can be so close minded about the world around them. There are people of the same sex that love each other. DEAL WITH IT. Jeez.. some people...<br>
<br>
And then there was the whole Prop. 22 thing here in Cali about recoginizing same sex marriages from other states. I let my homosexual friends take that damn sign off my lawn everytime my parents put up a new one. *sigh* But it still passed. <br>
<br>
Oh well, hopefully in the future people will just realize that they don't always get thier way. Everyone has thier choice to do what they want, I don't see why people keep limiting that on certain individuals because of preferance. <p><center>

I'm sure he meant no offence to you, or those that are as you say 'Gay'. Sometimes people offend others without even knowing. Did he apologize? Did the other person have to jump all over him like that.<br>

Tolerance is a two way street. Most people aren't running out there to offend the world on purpose. ::Shurg::<br>
<br>
Look, this probably ins't needed. You come off as just grasping at staws, looking for some kind of special acceptance cause you're 'Gay' and different, or something. <br>
<br>
Get over it. I've been known to say something was 'Gay' every now and again. I don't hate gay people, I don't even mind gay people. I mean, but no one is special. People are just people. No one sure really care what you do in your bedroom in your own personal time.

Ummm...you will?  That surprises the heck out of me who lives here in the South.  Most folks of color I know don't use it and take great offense in it still being used.  The only ones I know who still use it are really old white people who think it's more to say than the N word.<br>

People who use the word &quot;gay&quot; in a derogatory manner aren't refering to the &quot;happy&quot; meaning. It is pejorative because of it's association with sexual orientation.<br>
<br>
Since I'm so ancient, I can remember a phrase I heard a crony of my grandparents use. In saying that a salesman cheated him, he said, &quot;That guy tried to jew me.&quot; I feel sorry for anyone who would try to defend that as not offensive.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to insult people. You don't HAVE to use words that further negative feelings toward whole groups of people.<br>

Prior to the past 3 years, I hadn't heard that phrase since early 80's when I was in *early* grade school. It just went the hell away for a while, then some genius tacked on a GHE to it (ghey), updated it for the new milennium, and I guess it's &quot;cool&quot; again to say it over and over....whatever. It pissed me off again when the use of that word that way reared it's head again- then I just remember the &quot;brilliant&quot; people in the sandbox who used it back when I was playing with GIJoes. Same mentality, and it'll be gone again and replaced with something equally as stupid. Just take it from the source and shrug it off, man. Not worth getting upset over anymore. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukloeviseq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KloevisEQ</A> at: 8/1/02 6:37:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 6:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is so str8!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That surprises the heck out of me who lives here in the South.

   Well, in theory anyways.  One of my friends at summer camp was from therabouts and used the word from time to time so I thought it was still in infrequent use.  I've only been to Alabama / Georgia once (for a family reunion).<br>
<br>
   I'm half-black (half-caucasian) and I've used it once myself (albeit on accident).  Prior to college, I referred to non-caucasians as &quot;minorities&quot;.  College was where I first heard the term &quot;persons of color&quot; and I thought it was a much better phrase.  I was then speaking about something in class, meant to use &quot;persons of color&quot;, and it came out of my mouth &quot;colored&quot;.  <br>
<br>
   It's all about knowledge &amp; intent.  If someone's aware that the wording of a phrase (ie: &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;indian giver&quot;, etc) is offensive, and intentionally keeps using it, they suck.  If someone hasn't thought about the wording enough to realize it's offensive, or wasn't using it intentionally, I'd have a hard time holding anything against them.<br>

PS: In that story above, about when I was at college, right after I said that a girl jumped up and said &quot;Ummm, PC Sidenote, the correct term is &quot;persons of color&quot;&quot;.  I can still hear the snide tones in her voice, and I was so pissed at her interrupting me I was tempted to add the word to my vocabulary just to piss her off.<br>

I joined the US Army in the mid eighties, a very diverse and multi-ethnic culture. The black soldiers, when talking about and amongst each other, would call each other nigger, and didn't seem to be at all offended by it. It was just a term they used for each other. I was always puzzled by fact that it would be offensive, If I had used it, when talking to my black friends.  We had EO classes occasionally and I never had the nerve to bring it up. I wish I would have now.<br>
And no, I personally don't have any thing against anybody based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or whatever. I have found that an asshole is an asshole and always transcends all barriers to prove it.<br>

But here's my take.<br>
<br>
Plain and simple.  It's the context it's used in, and society's definition of it that's got you all in an uproar.  <br>
<br>
When it comes to offensive terms, you really have to go one on one with a person to see if they're meaning it offensively or not.  And that falls under the category of &quot;Don't judge a book by it's cover&quot;, ne?  I'll admit, I've been known to say the dreaded phrase myself (*smack* Bad Kerri) but anyone who knows me knows I'm not meaning to offend.<br>
<br>
So Robin, if we ever talk I'll be sure not to use it around you.  Or any of you others that have a problem with it.  Wouldn't want to upset anyone, ya know?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For the record, I'm in my 20's.  That phrase has been around for a long time, and I'm sure it'll be around for a while.  It's just now catching on...kinda like &quot;That's so phat!&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps we should force all the people who use that term to apologize fully to the obese people of the world?  Hmmm...<br>

True, he *COULD* have been of the unenlightened, but with the frequency of which the word is used today negatively, I highly doubt that he is anything more than a prepubescent guy who either A) thought they could get away with using &quot;gay&quot; freely, or B) didn't stop to think about whether or not there were homosexual people in the vicinity.<br>
<br>
I have friends that, on occasion, use &quot;gay&quot; to mean something negative, and while I don't agree with that particular usage, I don't feel it is any of my concern; esp. because I do not fall into the audience of which said use is offending. I personally do not use it, not because it can be considered offensive, but because I know what it means to say gay, and I don't think there's anything negative about a person being gay. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=8.topic&start=61&stop=73>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showPrevMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showNextMessage?topicID=8.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.threadControl?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49>The Dead Horse Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31b<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
