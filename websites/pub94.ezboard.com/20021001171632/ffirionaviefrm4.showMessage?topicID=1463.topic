But then I was tired, and later realized that both guilds (FnF and Reso) were simmering and just waiting for a chance to rip into each other so I refrained. Well the lid seems to be off, so I will say my peace.<br>
<br>
In my view KT was a train wreck, plain and simple. Two rival guilds with a history, were mustering at the same time. Niether wanting to back down. I honestly don't know who was there first, I just knew I wasn't as I was jogging across EW.<br>
<br>
With Macgee's logs coming to light, even if true, and as a Reso member I have no reason to disbelieve them, they were of no help to the situation at the time. Because I'm sure 95% of people from either guild at the time were not privy to such information.<br>
<br>
People are not omnicient, and even the raid leaders I'm sure had better things to do like trying to organize their raids rather than spamming who all every so often. My point is it's not always about facts but about perceptions. It is very easy with access to nothing but your own guildchat and private message boards to whip yourself into a frenzy, and adopt an us vs them mentality. If you feel your guild can do no wrong and your rival can do no right, chances are you bought into that mentality hook line and sinker. I do not.<br>
<br>
People are people. I don't believe any guild has a monopoly on good or bad. I honestly believe that all things considered the playerbase of the top 3 guilds are more alike than different. It's the guild leadership and it's policies that give a guild it's character. I think if we were to compare guildchat and messageboard threads, we'd find the content very similar. We all have our own reasons for joining the various guilds we do. Some for friendships, others for oportunities to be had. Making generalizations about people based on their guild tag is just wrong. People have names that comes before their guildtag. I prefer to judge people by their individual actions.<br>
<br>
Which brings me why I felt the need to write this in the first place. Like most everyone else involved, I was not happy that night. I'm not going to get into wether we failed or not because of lag or because modrods were eaten. I do feel that given the circumstances we should have pulled KT to someplace other than the zoneline with FnF sitting there. We chose to do it that way and we paid for it. I felt we had our shot and it was only fair to let them have theirs, just my personal opinion at the time. I sent a tell to someone I knew in FnF but had not spoken to in a long time, and wished them luck on their run.The response I recieved was basically akin to drop dead, though it was a bit more vehement. This saddened me greatly for there was a time when neither of us wore the guild tags FnF and Resolution that I both liked and respected this person.<br>
<br>
It made me realize how stratisfied the end game guilds realy were. I wanted to see the high end and I sure got a taste. I often wonder if I was not happier in my old RP guild.<br>

however, in that kinda situation, if you think what you are being told to do is wrong.. well.. don't do it. I wouldn't send nasty tells to friends that participate dint hat, but i have less respect for them for going along with it. everyone has a choice. people that didn't think that was right coulda said &quot;no i wont do that shit.&quot;<br>
<br>
i don't hate anyone in any guild based on their guildtag. if i hate them, its because of their individual actions. and i dont &quot;hate&quot; anyone for going along with that kinda shit, but i do lose a ton of respect for them. &quot;i did it because i was told to do it&quot; is a lame excuse.  <p><BR><B>Veteran Veloxia Voluptuous</B><BR>

And Coin, i think we know u and vel dont get along.  Why dont u let him make at least one post without harping?  But i guess that would require Vel doing the same towards you.  come on guys lets act like we are older than 5, i know Vel is i am sure Coin is.<br>

When you play a newbie, your main goals are to make friends, find groups, hunt to gain levels and have fun.  As your character grows in seasons, your eye moves on to platinum, gear and loot.  In the high end game, you compete to be the best at what you do.  There is a lot of animosity towards others.  <br>
<br>
I have a lot of respect for players that don't fall into that category.  The players that stay true to their newbie-self, if there is such a thing.  They make the Everquest Experience unlike any other gaming experience.  They are the ones that draw us back to the game and to the server.  <br>
<br>
Faoin, do not let that person's reaction towards you upset you too much.  They aren't worthy of your friendship.<br>

<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
The reality of the situtation is that you had the forces to take him down ,as did we. You lost your fight because you desided to fight in the middle of 3 guild worth of lag, and your tank change out went to hell.<br>
<br>
As to the rod issue .. you moved down into the fight, assuming your mage dropped 7 or 8 rods after the move the could have been eaten by your own folks, or not I know I didn't take any of them.<br>
<br>
There will always be a bit of bashing head over this mob or that mob.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to give up my friendships anyplace over guild tags. <br>
<br>
Guilds come and go, friends do as well but it's better to maintain friendships at leat in my view.<br>
<br>
You're all like what ever you can't tell me you weren't pissed.<br>
<br>
I was, sitting on my rear for 3 hours doing nothing was a waste of my time, however I logged off went to sleep went to work, came back loged back on and was all better.<br>
<br>
As to the train <br>
<br>
sure someone could have pulled it, or alot more likely seeing as ther were repops in the way tromax took a bit of agro back with him and transfered it, i've seen the throne room mobs do that 3 times now.<br>
<br>
Anyway, <br>

Ever notice how heated they get?? I look at EQ not as a simple game of rolling the dice its a game that depends on the skill of the player. <br>
Everyone keeps saying its just a game but really it seems to be more then that at least to me. I spend alot of time playing and have grow very close to alot of people here. (yes I do have a life, 2 jobs and a bf that thank goodness plays EQ) But in actually fact EQ has became a part of my life wether it be addiction or whatever I cant see giving up all my friends on here. Not that if it messed up my rl I wouldnt, but it doesnt.<br>
Ok sorry off track here, happens to me alot hehe. The fact of the matter is people put alot of heart and soul in thier charaters and guilds (well not ebays <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) so I can see why they get upset when they think they are getting stepped on or disrespected.<br>
I mysef love the competion just not at the hockey level of bashing and slashing. When things like Kael happen and people who I thought were my friends say petty things it does hurt but then again I guess thats when you find out who your real friends are and who the mature ones are. Hugs Thraall for telling everyone to STFU <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  To bad kids dont listen to well.<br>
It is a game but the toons are played by real people with their rl personalities. It does get harder on the higher scales of the game, you have to be more skilled and Officers have a much harder job organizing and running things. Kudos to my officers, no idea how you do it but you do it great. <br>
So anyways when your organizing a bunch of people to raid and the raid gets messed up by others sure your going to get pissed but our officers dont flame in guild chat they just tell us our next mob and we move on. Usually if a flame of another guild starts in guild chat its stopped pretty fast because why wreck our fun guild chat with dumb stuff.

By the time I arrived in Kael the GM was already there and everyone was just waiting to see what the outcome would be.

<br>
I have to agree with Briannalee. It is a game, there are real people with real personalities, and when you play as much as we do you don't just flip the Off switch to make it go away. It doesn't. It may not affect real life (and then again it may) but it does become part of that life.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen anything equivalent to Britain's football hooligans yet, but I suppose that could happen. The alleged &quot;train&quot; (which I didn't see) could have been a hooliganism, but I don't think it was. I know, to some degree, most of the people in both guilds and none of them are that immature. But then, outside the football (soccer) stadiums I'm sure the football hooligans appear to be mature, too. <p><p align=center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237657><b>Enheduanna Lia</b></a>, Arch Mage<br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=decius1>Decius1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/27/02 1:24:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1463.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re:</span><hr size=1> As to mod rods I saw someone in FnF pick one up.

Someone picking up a rod looks exactly the same as if one rots on the ground.  The range you have to be in order to pick up a rod is pretty big.  I can be behind several people and still be able to grab a rod.  I was not there so don't know what happened.  People don't seem to realize that when you drop these rods, that they won't just stay there forever.  <br>
<br>
I am assuming you saw only FnF members by the rod and then it dissappeared?  There is no way of knowing who picked up a rod or if it poofed.  Seems you are drawing your conclusion not on facts, but what you want to believe and your feeling towards the guild.<br>
<br>
I do hope that we can start talking and working things out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center"><font size="3"><b><i><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=188590>

The graphic isn't unique if you're assuming that someone would equit one, I normally equit a rod look alike in my primary just for example. picking an item up doesn't cause a ducking motion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 579<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/27/02 3:27:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1463.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Regarding the mutual hate society, please leave me out o</span><hr size=1> Honestly the fighting will continue...<br>
<br>
Its a competition whether you want to admit it or not.  <br>
<br>
Take 2 teams of people and give them a common goal....pick any sport event or whatever that requires them to obtain the same things to reach that goal.  Somewhere along the line in any type of competition some amount of feces hits the oscillator(sp).  Golf, tennis, chess, cards, football etc etc even yes EQ! its gonna happen.<br>
<br>
Bri's post was right on the money.  /hugs to Bri!<br>
<br>
Thing is we, as guild members and leaders, make up the team.  Like other teams who spend long periods of time together we become family-like.  When the chips are down you fight for your family.  Emotions and tensions are rising at those times.  No one wants someone messin with their family.<br>
<br>
So this stuff is gonna keep hapnin.  <br>
<br>
As far as Faoin saying leave me out of it.....well you cant be left out.  You wear the tag.  Your either one of us or.....  Being neutral really isnt ok imo.  Maybe others dont care but if im in a brooha and im pinning one guy down while another is climbing on my back and you stand back and say &quot;Well he is my friend too so....good luck Ichi.&quot;  Im not going to take that well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But thats just me.<br>
<br>
So for all the people that want FV to be tourmoilless......it aint gonna happen.  The feces will fly.  Some will sit and cry about it.  Some will decide they dont like to get covered with poop and leave.  The strong will wipe themselves off....maybe throw some back at the other guy and move on.  Anyone who doesnt want to get covered in shit somewhere along the way might as well stay out of the high end game (god I love this analogy ehehhe)  <br>
<br>
If your just here to play, have fun and not deal with this high end crapola....you picked the right server.  FV Rocks!!<br>

Don't get me wrong, I can be very competive, and I stand by my guild. But my loyalty is not unconditional. Call me old fashioned, but I believe in such concepts as good sportsmanship and fair play. Using the sports analogy I have no use for trash talking whatsoever. I might do all in within my skill to win, but I would still respect my opponent as a person.<br>
<br>
But to be honest I am not a large fan of competetive sports. And competition is really not why I play this game. I enjoy the social aspects of EQ. I enjoy working with Reso as a team to bring down that dragon and see places I might not have seen before. I don't nescessarily think in terms of bringing down that dragon just so another guild can't. In a competive atmosphere I might see and agree that such a thing needs to be done, but I don't nescessarily derive enjoyment from it. It's just not a primary motivation for me.<br>
<br>
You seem to think somehow I might not back you up. Fighting some dragon, I'll back you up. in a &quot;friendly&quot; fight in the Arena against another guild, I'll back you up. In the battle of ideas? I might not, if I think you're wrong.<br>
