<br>
And the two forces charged after eachother. This flat plain providing no hiding, no escaped as these two oposing forces charged after eachother, their numbers simply staggering, all but even on both sides.<br>
<br>
And the forces clashed almost simuntanously, a loud ringing of steel heard in the air. Already cries of pain and suffering can be heard within the croud as they are cut down by the steel of their opposers. Fair elves, Dark elves, both becomming mulsh for dirt. Corspes littered the ground, soaken in crimson streams of blood, the cries of battle, the cries of pain intermixing into a ballad of Hate and Rage.<br>
<br>
Soon enought, the croud became thin enought to allow Magical means to enter the battle. As if on Que, both forces's Magical force appeared instantly. Spells riddled the battlefield, striking all with powerful area effect fire spells. Burning the flesh, Boiling the blood and sending many more to firey deaths. Nercomaner Skeletal Pets did the dance of death with the Magical pets of the Magicans, crushing and destroying eachother while their masters flew down spells into eachother, and down into the battlefield.<br>
<br>
Those Skeletal Pets and Magican Elementals not destroyed in the battles against eachother, flew down into the croud of Melee fighters, already weakened by fatuge and the various spells cast upon them, and began to lay down their bodies with their superour fighting. Many more of the elves were slain, a haze of blood seemed to cover this area of the plain. The grass being painted with death.. as the very moon seemed to cry out for battle..<br>
<br>
As their masters were stuck down, the elementals and skeletal pets did die as well. Wizards and Clerics, finding themselves not having enought mental power to stand through the battle were cut down easily as well, the Warrior's blade finding its way easily throught cloth.. and into the tender flesh of the beings..<br>
<br>
But their was one final Wizard.. Already having many weapons within his atomy, his body dripping with the sticky red substance of life began to chant a spell.<br>
His fair skin even becomming more pale as his words weakly chanted this final spell..<br>
And the ground began to rage with fire, it seemed that he called forth the sorrow and the resulting rage of a mother who watched her very children fall in a cruel death.. that fire raged across the land, burning the souls of many warriors, elven and Tier'dal alike.. adding to the already staggering pile of those wasted in brutal combat..<br>
<br>
The Wizard.. losing enought blood.. fell flat on his face in a river of blood.. and slowly returned to his mother...<br>
<br>
Was it over? Finally this blood shed was ended? Nay.. one stood to her feet, her Small frame riddled by pain and her body rocked by suffering. Her armor was as Dark as the Night, her sword glowing dark purple.. it eminating the sprit of darkness, and the Curse of her Father.<br>
Her Rage was at its ebbing, watching her lover and child fall in combat to this world, she saw no pleasure in the corspes..<br>
She stood there, the blood stained on her armor.. and looked to the horizion.. the Sun now just breaking throught the darkness.. <br>
<br>
Then it happened. A Stun spell! She was locked into place as she felt the sword slash across her back. As she was released, she fell down to her knees, wincing as her dark blue flesh was cut.. <br>
She was allowed to turn however, and see the Paladin male standing behind her, his sword wet with her blood and the blood of many others, while his armor was saturated with the blood of himself, and his only son, who died in his arms that day.<br>
His love allowed his rage to be at the breaking point as well, those foul Tier'dal, they slain everyone! Their hate had to be stoped or the world would be destroyed.. or was it too late?!<br>
He gritted his teeth as his sword was lit aflame, the fires of his conviction.<br>
He had to win this fight, to honor those that faught beside him, that died to Protect the great Mother.. Who must also be in grievance..<br>
Her Chosen one, Frionca Vie, had also found her way to the wrong end of the sword in this battle as well.<br>
<br>
He pointed his sword at the dark one, and his lips spoke, not without pain, but still with the strenght he had to push throught it..<br>
<br>
&quot;Now foul field of the Night, I will cut you down, for the Horrors you cause! No more.. No more.. Their has been too much.. For my friends.. for my Family..<br>
Your reign of Terror ends today!&quot; He shouted as he held his sword tightly, taking the stance of the Paladins of Tunare..<br>
<br>
The Tier'dal female had no words.. only her sword spoke with a mighty swing fir the elf's head, but a quick ducking motion allowed the elf to live a bit longer. The flaming blade swong towards her midsection, a quick hop back left him swinging at air however. She twisted, giving herself momentium as she slammed her weapon against the sholder of the elf, making him yelp in pain, colasping him to his knees. She rose the sword to take him down for the last time, with one final powerful swing, it would be ended for sure..<br>
<br>
Or not, as the flaming sword found its way inbetween Innoruuk's Curse and fair skinned flesh, with such force causing both blades to instantly explode on contact, knocking both fighters from eachother, tumbling and crashing into the corspes of others..<br>
<br>
But still, they stood. Limping, staggering, all but crawling these two warriors made their way to eachother.. their fists now finding ways to cause eachother harm.<br>
<br>
The Elf stoke her across the cheek, a swift left to her midsection and a off balanced kick to her face sent her staggering back into a pile of corspes, crashing her back against it..<br>
<br>
And then he charged her, voice high as he yelled his battle cry, he rushed towards her.. <br>
But she found something in the pile..<br>
<br>
A Rusty Short Sword! She quickly grabbed the weapon and thrusted it foward, it finding the fair elven heart of the paladin, piercing it way out of his back throught his chest, a choking sound heard from his lips.<br>
<br>
The Woman spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;When you attacked me.. did you feel my father? Did you feel him touch you with hate.. You are all his Children..<br>
And now you will feel the power of the Tier'dal female, the most powerful being on Norrath!&quot; She said as she pushed the blade within him deeper, pushing him back and the blade exiting him, allowing him to collaspe.<br>
<br>
&quot;And.. did.. you feel... my mother.. Did you feel her touch you with love as you looked upon your lover.. .. as you looked upon your child..<br>
Know.. that we are all her childre---&quot; And the ability for him to speak left him.. as he slowly died..<br>
<br>
And she laid out across the ground, panting.. gasping for air..<br>
<br>
But it would be futile.. soon her wounds will over come her.. and death will be with her shortly.<br>
<br>
This, the final War of the Elves has ended.. with the final being on Norrath surcome to death.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, their is Chaos. And as she died, she saw this all. The unsettling peace as she looked left, and looked right to the valleys of death caused by the many corspes about the ground..<br>
It began in a Chaotic War.. only to end in this peaceful quietness..<br>
<br>
From Chaos.. their is peace? Just as Chaos cannot exist without Peace, can Innoruuk, the Dark Father, Not Exist without Tunare?<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes, hearing the call of death take her in.. as she let out a final breath..<br>
<br>
And allowed death to overtake her..<br>
<br>
~Lavastorm Mountains~<br>
And Shintou's eyes poped open, jumping from yet again another Nightmare, another message woven within his dreams.<br>
The PreTeen Samurai sat up, looking out across the mountain range, the sun just passing the mountain peaks..<br>
<br>
&quot;Another day.. Another Dream.. Is this.. the war I am to respark? Because Peace has settled over the land.. <br>
The cycle is unbalanced..? Is that my mission.. ?<br>
Or maybe he's telling me to leave the Females alone. Man they are cruel! <br>
Ah well.. whichever.. I still have to worry about the here and now! Sir Lindeal! I must find that Paladin and beat him into the ground.. I can think about these dreams later..&quot;<br>
<br>
And he jumped to his feet, dusting off his patchwork and went off to his delegated duty of bringing down Lindeal..<br>
<br>
~End~<br>
