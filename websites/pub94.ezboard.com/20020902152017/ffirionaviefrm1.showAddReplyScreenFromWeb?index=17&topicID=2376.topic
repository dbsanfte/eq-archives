IC, I view the Drow words as a slang-dialect that you either know or you don't, just like learning English doesn't mean you'll understand the heavier slang of cockney.  (Want a funny time?  Try telling that last sentence to a friend in-game when they have the language-filter up, then wonder why they don't understand what you're saying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  OOC, I find heavy use of Drow words kinda inconsiderate to folks who don't have the D&amp;D Drow supplement handy, let alone the same website compilation you're using with words other folks added and made up.<br>
<br>
And since others have put out tons of great advice, I'll just quickly add my vote to calling Nektulos the &quot;other side&quot; of GFay.  Stick it out through the low levels, get to know folks who'll RP with you, and things should start moving for you.  Play around with character types if you want to, take some time to find out where you're happy.  Chances are good there's a group of folks that'll make you glad you met them, you just have to find them.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Gnosis, I think, has hit it right on.  Most of the responses here have great suggestions and support… and on that note, I would like to add MY first few days experience on FV.<br>
<br>
My mate and I were fully ready to learn our new home and surroundings and train up in our tradeskills to keep ourselves protected and armed.  But we weren’t on for 20 minutes before we got tells inviting us to come to the bank for “something I was keeping for just such an occasion” gifts of armor and weaponry.  I was actually at one point trying to decide who of the three people calling me over I was going to follow.  The genuine kindness and generosity of the people we met was pretty overwhelming.  And they all RPd!!!<br>
<br>
I am very excited to be playing a Vah Shir.  Ever since leaving EQ several months ago, I was always fascinated with the upcoming expansion and the new race (big cat lover in RL).  But my man and I were burned out and quit, a story for another time, or perhaps not at all hehe  All I can say is so far it is so great to be back.  It’s a whole new game for us; new race, new zones and a new server.  <br>
<br>
With the gifts bestowed upon my mate and I, we were able to hunt more efficiently and there seemed to always be someone in the vicinity to aid us or provide “run-by” buffings.  Now leveled up to 9, my mate and I were thrilled to be able to continue the line of kindness by giving anything we could not use to those younger than ourselves.  It felt great!  This is what I want in a server home.  People who actually play their character and help each other.  What a concept <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have played a couple of dark elves as well, and on more populated servers you can still be ignored out on the newbie log.  Even worse, the noob mentality and KSing there is more widespread than I imagine it would be on FV.  <br>
<br>
Never fear, I am sure you will find more pleasing adventures once you finally peek your head out into the East Commons area.  Or better yet, get leveled up and fly to the moon, us kitties haven’t really seen many dark elves, and our curiosity has the better of us, as usual.<br>
<br>
For now, my mate and I obey the call of the animal spirits to help us further in our adventures.  We look forward to the day when we can finally see, with our own eyes, the other races that inhabit our mother planet of Norrath.<br>

Alot of it is a matter of luck.<br>
<br>
My best results often come in asking questions of groupmates in order to encourage roleplaying.  Asking about their homeland, ideologies, experiences in context gets them started off on the right foot, I think.  That leads to my own introductions and it's far easier to stay in character when everyone else is.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, however, there just isn't that right feel within the group, and everyone goes silent except for the mana status reports and incoming messages.  8(  I guess you take the good with the bad.<br>
<br>
Like everyone else said, if you can find someone who roleplays, is around your level, and likes to group, add them to your friends list right away!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
As far as restarting as something other than a Dark Elf...<br>
<br>
The worst /shouts I ever heard on this server came in East Commonlands.  Next would be Greater Faydark.  Nectulos Forest actually didn't seem that bad.  Misty Thickett was generally quiet, but alot of auctions were going on.  Steamfont was a very nice area to grow up in.  I think any newbie zone can experience a bad day or two.  Aside from East Commonlands and Greater Fay, I never really saw an innane running conversation in /shout.  Mainly just a large volume of auctions in zones that have their newbie armor quests implemented.<br>
<br>
I was actually surprised at the number of people who were hanging out near Neriak and how generous people were in Nectulos.  Again, I think it's more luck than anything.  If you are going to stick with your rogue, I'd suggest doing some traveling so you can meet more people and hopefully connect with a few roleplayers.  If you're not stuck on playing a rogue, it might be easier for you to start a class that can solo/travel more easily in order to get a better feel for the entire server's personality and perhaps find areas where there are more people you can enjoy interacting with.<br>
<br>
Above all...have fun.  If you're not enjoying yourself, just walk away from it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/02 3:13:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2376.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First few days on FV</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> OOC, I find heavy use of Drow words kinda inconsiderate to folks who don't have the D&amp;D Drow supplement handy, let alone the same website compilation you're using with words other folks added and made up.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
