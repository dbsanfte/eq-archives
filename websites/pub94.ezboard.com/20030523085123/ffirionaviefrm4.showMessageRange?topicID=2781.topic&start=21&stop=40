First, he killed a giant that had forced my group out of the zone twice, killing two people in the process. Then, he buffed us up nicely, without being asked for it. Then (and this is the interesting part, given the post that started this thread) he pulled the entire orc camp down on us, without warning-and then stood by, buffing and healing us, until we had killed the entire train. He wasn't very communicative (maybe in that English isn't my first language kind of way?), but he was definitely trying to help us out. <br>

Two scenerios come to mind. <br>
<br>
1. He ACTUALLY thinks he's helping by bringing mobs you can't handle, but since he's buffing and healing...he believes he's doing a good deed. <br>
<br>
2. He gets his jollies by harrassing lower leveled players. <br>
<br>
Either way, he AND Yongly are sure to be blacklisted by many players.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/siava/Lodgebook.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=607694" target="top">Volume II: Mage Treasures</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siava>Siava</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/siava/ball47.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Maelstrom Mistress

I get the impression that it's a habit. Still he seems nice enough =)<br>

I'm sure he wasn't intending to harrass us. I'm sure he was trying to help out. Granted, that's an unsettling way to be helped out, and it would've been nice if he'd at least told us he was going to do it, but I'm pretty positive that his heart was in the right place in this circumstance. <br>

<br>
<br>
I could believe that except when I asked him whether he was trying to train me with the initial 2 mobs, he completely ignored me.<br>
<br>
Then when I sent him a tell after he griefed the newbie players, he again did'nt respond at all.<br>
<br>
When I told him he could expect a talking to by a GM about what he was doing... silence.<br>
<br>
When I spoke to Yonly, he finally left the zone so he doesn't have chat turned off obviously.<br>
<br>
Silence is a good indicator of guilt imo.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I was to guess on the amiable side of his character, i would say he's wanting people to go ohhh ahhh he's so great he can save us from huge enormous trains with his uber heals and buffs etc.<br>
<br>
On the negative, he's a plain outright griefer, probably very young and just doing it for kicks.<br>

He was the guy yelling at Anezkia cause we wouldn't let him roll on a jade reaver cause he wanted to sell it, while other druids and rangers at the raid were in need of it for their epics....<br>
<br>
As far as this being another blue server....nah...we have a few bad weeds and we just need to make thier lives as difficult as possible without putting much effort into it.  For example....keep a list of the boneheads that act like dumbasses or dipshits and whenever you seem them or have them ask you for groups, raids, help, etc....just say NO and if they ask why say well if you weren't such a punkass, people wouldn't shun you, like i have just done.  <br>
<br>
I personally have talked to several little terds and explained to them that if they wanted to have any success or fun on this server they would have to watch their attitudes and their conduct because it reflects directly on them and will hinder their chances of getting into guilds, groups or any help they may need from others.  I explained that on this server reputation is EVERYTHING!!  We each get one toon per account and you rep follows your toon whereever you go.  I actually had one person reply i dont care i'll just change my name...and i proceeded to laugh and say well thats fine and dandy BUT, varant puts up a list of all those that change their names both what it used to be and what it was changed to so that wont help...that person was like oh crap....<br>
<br>
so again what i do is have my nifty asshole list and when someone repeatedly trains, ks's, steals, begs, or basically craps on others, they are added to the list and no longer can attend our raids, get rezes from us, or get help in any form...<br>
<br>
Thats how we keep our FV clean...we just all have to tighten our belts and keep to our standards of RPing and fun....screw the few weeds that try and kill our fun. <p>Vyrsin<br>

Why don't you take the time to get things resolved in the game instead coming on here making yourself perfect little angels and bashing players, I THOUGHT MOST WERE ADULTS. Anyway I am not mad at ya, I don't hate anyone and I won't change how I play, I do alright by me and those who know me, you can keep your drama thoughts and words to yourself, if anyone has a personal problem with me, come speak to me I don't bite and I would love to fix the situation in the game, and go on our ways instead of making a new message soap opra, but I do understand its a lot easier to follow the crowd or bash someone behind there back, instead of facing them like an adult because I know the game is played by a lot of children to.

This is a comma , <br>
<br>
This is a period .<br>
<br>
They are both your friends and both have a specific use - most times one can not be randomly substituted with the other. I don't usually criticize spelling/grammar but you are making my head hurt.<br>
<br>
And who are you anyways? I don’t think I have ever seen a suave1 hanging out in PoK or anything.<br>
