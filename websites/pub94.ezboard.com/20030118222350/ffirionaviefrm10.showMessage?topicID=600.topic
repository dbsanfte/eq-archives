The Rogues of Paludal gather round him, staring at his money pouch. &quot;AAAAAHHHHH!!!!&quot; roars Drachma, as his heart violently spasms. Drachma gripps his chest, the pain too much for him to handle, then he saw them... gathering around him, for the kill.<br>
Drachma grabbed his club, and raised him self. The Ache, his curse, was still present but silenced itself. Drachma looked at the four rogues, and smirked, maybe they could show him death, the death he yearned for, the death he should have been given, by &quot;her&quot;.<br>
Drachma twirled the club deftly, as the Rogues charged him, he immediatly sent Whittlebonz to sit, and he took the charge. Drachma laughed as he killed the first, and took their backstabbs... Yes Lako(Halflings) kill me, kill me.<br>
Drachma grabbs annother of the Rogues, and bit into his flesh, blood dripped from his teeth. <br>
He clubbed annother that had begun to go after his pet, then as the last one saw the Ogur for what he was, a caged beast... a cursed monster, no longer caring for life. He ran, ran for his life, Drachma at his heels, Drachma cast disease cloud, the rogue still ran... Drachma began to speak an ancient form of Ogrish, lost by his Brethren,&quot; Hok Tark Piktok, tak h-takie, noron Distrof...&quot;<br>
(You have angered the ache , now Die)<br>
Drachma waved his hands about, and the Rogue, grasped his heart, and screamed in agony, he felt the pain, the Ache, he knew Drachma's pain, and died from it. Drachma held the rogues head.... &quot;Noron hok tik hak h-takie,&quot; as he tore the head off the Rogue's body. ( Now you know my ache)<br>
 Drachma sat back down, a tear in his eye.... my love, I will remember, and I'll be here.... &quot;Hok tae Hak Ratckie-N`ice,&quot;<br>

He turned from her, and made his way to Shadowhaven, gripping his chest, he made his way leaning against the cave wall. He looked at passers by, with sadness, yet still, the feircness... the overwhelming anger in his heart. Blood dripped from the pack, and stained the floor... his jaw was covered with it, he was a beast, he was Drachma, the mortal Zek. <br>
Drachma came to a large building, it was empty, probably its last residence either moved to Norath or were killed long ago by some plague, either way, he was staying here. He sat down, and rooted through his pack, he grabbed the Rogues head, and took a bite, the skull cracked in one bite, blood streamed from his jaw, he drank deeply of all the rogues blood. he laid down and slept, dreaming of her, his Ratkie-N`ice.<br>
His muscles grew stiff during the night, the wind grew cold, and his ache again came, his roar was heard throughout the town, and all feared it, the sound of his anguish, the sound of him.<br>
Drachma leaned forward his arms supported by his knees, he coughed, he breathed deeply, but he felt like he was choking. Blood began to pour from his nose, as his heart, began to pump harder. <br>
Drachma fell forward, unconsious, his heart quieted, and his ache continued slightly...<br>
He woke up on the floor, a small Halfling sheriff kicked him, &quot;Get up, Ogre, get up.&quot;<br>
Drachma grabbed the foot and violently, hurled him to the floor, raising himself, he looked down at the terrified Halfling... &quot;What Do you want Lako,&quot;<br>
&quot;Ye best be leavin, my freinds are outside,&quot;<br>
&quot;Bah!!! Disturb the H-Takie, again, and you will die,&quot;<br>
Drachma grabbs his pack, and left what remained of the Rogues head, and left ShadowHaven....<br>

He found a portal heading down to Faydwer.... the old land.<br>
He stepped upon the pad, and he was transported to the Combine spires, on Faydwer. He walked a path, looking at the forest, it was full of life... he sniffed the air, he felt the rangers tracking him. He kneeled down, he hoped they would not disturb his meditation, the only way he could keep the ache under control. <br>
Hours went by, Drachma breathed a sigh, his ache was subsiding, then he felt it, as the arrow penetrated his shoulder, the bone breaking... he laid down, nursing his shoulder, and began to growl.... the first time in his life, he lost all feeling, he had no thought... he turned into an animal... he sttod up, and charged the young ranger, and tore him apart, his freinds came to help, but a similiar fate came to the young boys, barely in their teens... he picked up the elf, and began to feed, he roared, the ache began to subside, and with it, his mind came back, and he looked down at the mutilated boy, he looked sown at his hands covered in blood.... he grabbed his pack and fled the forest....<br>
Thoughts of Seraphimm, came into his mind.... the curse of stupidity was nothing compared to the ache.... the curse of Love...of Ogur love.... for Ogurs are the most feeling of any race.... once they fall in love.... they can never go back to their lives.... but none had ever suffered the ache.... those who have, die.... why didn't he.... She had cursed him.... he had to avoid her... for the ache grows stronger, when she is near....<br>
&quot; maybe one day I will be free of the ache.... but until then, I must wander.... oh Trachma I how we are bound....&quot;<br>
<br>
Drachma walked into the mountains of Butcher Block where his father was murdered.... this was a journey of rememberance...what he would find on this journey only Zek knows...  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.silentredemption.org/images/112102/ogre.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

He sniffed the air, and collapsed on the ground, he hoped a group of Dwarves would kill him, and put him out of his misery.<br>
<br>
the day came to night, and still he laid der, blood dried on his armor, and his wound scabbed over, the bone mending itself, ogur stamina and Zeks will having something to do with it.<br>
He awoke, and looked at the stars, the beauty there flooded his emotions and he wept, his feircnees flooded away as he wept, all the horrors, and sadness he had seen, was to much for him... he thought of Seraphimm, his love..how she had hurt him, he thought of what she had said to him last...<br>
&quot;Love is weak, and i can't be that weak again.&quot;<br>
He sighed to himself, he tried to change her mind, but to no avail, and now his love was killing him. It had made him stronger then he had ever been, but it was also torturing him. Looking up at the sky, he saw a cloud hover over him, he watched it for a moment, as the wind took it, and blew it away... that was him, that cloud, and the love was the wind... but he would not renounce his love of her. The love of Seraphimm, was greater then anything he had ever felt, he thought of her, and sighed... he laid down... and closed his eyes. He slept in peace, for once the pain went away for a while.<br>
<br>
Drachma awoke to the smell of flowers, he sniffed the smell, and he sighed thinking of seraphimm's perfume. He stood up, and picked up his pack, smelling the air, he became alert. he smelled Euridite, not only a eurdite but an Enchanter... he growled..his ache began to pump in his chest... his anger rose... he began to walk, sniffing the air.... searching for the enchanter... his father was killed by a Euridite enchanter, he hoped he would get lucky, and this would be the murderer... he came to the Euridite, killing a greenblood... he listened to what was said...<br>
&quot;what do you mean the son of Trach is searching for his fathers killers...&quot; said the Eurdite.<br>
&quot;Him say him kill eurdite... him angry about murder... him kill us.. him strong...him scare us.. he..ahhhhhhhh,&quot; screamed the Ogur as the enchanter tortured his cursed mind.<br>
&quot;you will tell him it was the Dwarfs wont you Ogur, tell him it was the Dwarf known as Dvalen..yes the Ogurs enemy.. that will be his fathers killer...&quot;<br>
Drachma began to breathe hard.. the ache..voiced its oppinion..kill...it said...kill now...<br>
Drachma burst from the hill.... &quot;All enemies of the mortal Zek shall fall&quot; <br>
the greenblood mesmorized jumped infront of Drachma..but he was easily slain.. the Eurdite casts every spell in his book..but nothing held... the ache was that strong.. Drachma grabbed the Eurdite... and bit into his flesh.. all in the mountains heard the scream of the enchanter... <br>
&quot;PLEASE... HELP ME... AHHHHHHHHHHH&quot;<br>
Drachma laughed.. a this moment he went for the moment insane.. and he enjoyed the Eurdites screams... as blood dripped from his jaw... he released the Eurdite.. the enchanter crawled..slowly stalked by the crazed Ogur. <br>
&quot;heheheheh... youm like killing my father..youm like me... killing you..hhehehehe... meet Zek...&quot;<br>
Drachma jumped on the Eurdite and mauled him.. biting his face..and arms....eating him alive...he would not let him die..not till he was finished... blood steinded the ground..as the Eurdites eyes went blanks.. his heart... exposed by the tearing of his chest.. and Drachma licked his hands.. blood dripped from his tongue... and he set upon the corpse... and ate to his fill... as the last bone was stripped clean... sanity came back to Drachma's mind..and he smiled... one down one to go he said.... maybe there was something good about the ache... he was full..on the meat from one of his fathers killers... and he enjoyed the taste of Eurdite...he walked planning to visit the hill near Khaldim where his father was killed... he smiled... and sighed contentedly... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drachmasonoftrach>Drachma son of Trach</A> at: 12/14/02 2:24:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=penbrick>PenBrick</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://thabricktosser.com/picture5.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/14/02 3:10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=600.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wow 0_o</span><hr size=1> OOCcly Heyyy, I didn't know that you were that well with your add-on storytelling.

&quot;I love you my goddess Seraphimm, if you ever need me I will come.. you are more immportant to me then Zek himself....and my club is yours.&quot;<br>
Drachma looked into her loving eyes... and he stood up.. he hugged her and kissed her upon the cheek... and departed with no further words.... <br>
<br>
Drachma looked back and saw her staring at him from the distance... he waved and blew a kiss to her... he turned back, and breathed a sigh as his heart began to pump back to normal... he relaxed his chest... and dropped to one knee... blood dripped out... he was glad she could not see him... and he was glad he had enough dicipline to stop the blood flow from entering his mouth... the grass steined red as the last dropp fell.... he breathed a sigh of releif... and made his way again.... He didn't know where to go... maybe planes of knwoledge... or Freeport...He knew he wanted to see Seraphimm again... maybe in the future he would be disiplined enough to over come the ache.... with the support of Seraphimm and his freinds he knew he would....<br>

One with Zek<br>Cursed with the Ache </span><br>  Posts: 357<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/02 1:14:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=600.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Ache</span><hr size=1> Drachma waved his hands in the air... and he steeped into the shadows... he looked upon the Dwarfs..and made his way to the port of butcher block....and for the first time the ship was on time.. he stepped upon the wood..and felt at ease..... it may have been his  desire to feel his feet upon the shore of antonica again..but Drachma cared not for the reason... he was heading home... <br>
<br>
Days went by as the ship finnially pulled into Freeports dock....Drachma made his way out of the city not wishing to kill the gaurds that protected the humans....as he set foot outside into the surrounding land... he sat down beside a large cactus..and meditated..hours went by... and many young children waved at him... but Drachma did not move....days went by... and Drachma neither moved..and for along time..did not even breathe... as the 5 th day ended.... Drachma fell... blood dripped from his breast plate, but no wound he had....Drachma awoke... a vision he had...one of a seacret alliance between Zek and Tunare.... Tunare grinned at the Ogur in the vision..Drachma knew not why.... as he walked to East commomlands.... blood fell to the earth... seeping into the land....Drachma sat down His back sore.... so he took off the lage mithril.... and placed it upon the groung.... orcs, gathered around him... and fear grew in their eyes.... as blood seeped into Drachma's undershirt..creating an image.... a brand upon his skin.... Drachma turned around seeing the orcs..he grabbed his club... they bowed before him.... he looked at them..and saw a female goblin drawing..... the symbol of Zek...entwined with annother symbol....<br>
<br>
Drachma knowing something was different about that goblin....<br>
 &quot;what is that, speak!&quot;<br>
the goblin looked upon him with sadness.... and pointed at him....<br>
 &quot;You,&quot; she said<br>
&quot;Me?.... I am not that symbol.... you orcs and goblins are strange creature....&quot;<br>
the goblin looked at him..and made her way behind him... she touched the brand..and Drachma fell... almost unconsious... he knew not how...as the goblin touched the brand again.. his head fell to the ground.... he was nearly dead.....&quot;But h-o-w.... ugh...&quot;<br>
