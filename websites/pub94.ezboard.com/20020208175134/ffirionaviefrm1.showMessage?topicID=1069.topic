I did hit a wolf to see if I could solo, but the thing hit for twice what I dished out and since im a warrior, I had to get out.  Other than the atroceous screen lag, is there a particular reason why Luclin is always so empty?  What are the places over 35 that actually have people?

Since I have spent most of my days on Luclin (high 20's and up) I have aquired some of the new Luclin gear. Its really neat looking stuff and I am always happy to have a different look than every other caster. For example I run around with a staff that has a book attached to its head. Quite a unique look and I haven't seen anyone else with it at all (mind you that might be because the stats aren't the greatest but heck, it looks cool).<br><br>If lag isnt an issue go out and explore Luclin.

Towards Katta i've seen many people, but not at once or in the same area at least.  Scarlet Desert seems to be a great area for groups too, but you'd have to bring your own.<br><br>Personally, i am a questor and have located the npcs with full bard armor rewards.  It's a tough quest, 33 items needed for each class if you want to obtain full armor plus a weapon.  So far i've managed to collect 23 items between all the classes.

(excuse my lack of exact terminology).<br><br>We should have known something was wrong when we had a tough time fighting a sonic wolf that was light blue to us.  We killed a couple who agroed us before we headed near the entrance to their cave.  As a ranger I played the tank.  I casted harmony to pull them one at a time etc.<br><br>Well they conned blue and white to me at the time.  I was shocked to descover how magic resistant they were.  It took several attempts to land a snare and through 2 entire fights only one of my &quot;panic animal&quot; spells landed, and for only a few seconds at that !<br><br>We died.  <br><br>Upon barely killing the first sonic wolf, even to me at (25 or 26 ?)  A wandering one jumped us.  our casters were oom and I was at 50% life.  Since none of my spells would stick  I tried to kite the wolf around until one of the casters could muster up enough mana to port us out of there.<br><br>Well, the damn wolf continued to double hit for 60 damage, and I was eating grass moments later.<br><br>The Wizard died too.  Luckily the druid was able to out run the wolf to Val Shir (the cat city) and zoned out to avoid death.<br><br><br>The moral of this story: from my short experience in Luclin, the creatures are rediculously underconned and highly magic resistant.

A nice range of relatively low-level creatures, and fairly safe for me to solo in at 12. Brigands, saurek deathclaws and shredders (i think that's their names) and some local shar taku (sp) necromancers. Lots of fun. Hopped over to the other side of Shar Vahl, to Hollowshade Moor, conned a rhino beetle (i think) near the city entrance and it was light blue. Got it down to about 10% health, then two of its buddies decided to join the fight. I didn't last too long. This happened twice, so I headed back to Shadeweaver's.<br><br>I saw a few non-Vah-Shir folk running around too. When I went through Shadowhaven later, tho, I was the only one there.

If you are experienced, just treat every luclin zone like a velious sp-to-you zone and you won't undercon anything too badly and you won't die unless you get careless, unlucky or stupid.<br><br>Echo Caverns, Netherbian Lair, and Paludal are great xp and a good bridge from Highpass to Velious. Paludal is roughly equivalent in difficulty to fighting Karanas bandits at level 10-13. Pulling can be tricky, but for the levels, the loot and xp is godlike. Echo and Netherbian are equivalent to Highkeep Basement in difficulty (with the exception that its possible to traverse Netherbian w/o a lot of death) and at least echo's loot is roughly equivalent in value (the boglings and skeeters). <p>Nakath<BR>The Esoteric Order</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udeneteth1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deneteth1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/11/02 6:09:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1069.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do people actually go to Luclin?</span><hr size=1> Well I do go to Luclin.

I only travel back to Norrath when friends want to do something special (like a dungeon crawl in Runeeye).<br><br>So far my hunting grounds have been the Netherbian lair, Marus Seru and Dawnshroud Peaks. I did a few quests in Sanctu Seru (amazing city, much better than KK on my opinion). I also did a couple of silly things, like trying to go from Shadow Heavens to KK using the fast way (through fungus grove, a 50-60 zone... alone, zone to the Twilight Sea deep inside... invised and sweating <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br><br>From my personal point of view Luclin is a nice alternative to Kunark (my usual hunting ground in the 30s).
