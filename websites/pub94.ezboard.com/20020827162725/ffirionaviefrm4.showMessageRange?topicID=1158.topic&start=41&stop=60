Comparing most of the words said here People havent got a clue to themselves let alone a nation. You shouldhave also posted how the US has helped rebuild nearly all of Europe after WWII as well as Japan and many other countries. We could demand people pay us back but no we dont and then we borrow from them to help their economies grow. We wouldnt have a national debt if we collected what the WORLD has been given freely from us and yes they begged for then say they dont want us in their lands. Bah I dont wanna expand on this It only leads to more people pissed off and thoughtless ranting of those who think they know shit and end up only standing in it. <br>

I am fed up.  As I said I expect every decent person to behave as if they are civilized.  I am tired of the excuses made for the evil people and their evil acts.  I do not care about the fellow in your office.  UNLESS  he/she has said &quot;The suicide bombers are wrong&lt;period&gt;    Terrorism is wrong&lt;period&gt;  any other equivocation means they agree with, are aiding and abetting, and support the terrorist killers.<br>
<br>
This same standard is applied to all civilized people.  For example:<br>
<br>
  &quot;the Klan is wrong, BUT blah, blah blah...&quot; (means you have a racist speaking)<br>
<br>
  &quot;he should not have raped her, BUT...blah blah, blah&quot; (means you have a rapist, and possible democratic presidential candidate)<br>
<br>
  &quot;The suicide bombers are wrong, BUT Israel,,,blah blah blah...&quot; means you have a person who is a supporter of killers.<br>

<br>
Yup. You came in almost as if on cue Marrty.<br>
<br>
And Edward, the one thing that struck me as I read your post--far more than the history and information you put up--was the fact that almost every statement you made, and every view you took of the situations involved, was intensely, vividly, and *blindly* American. <br>
<br>
Situations are evaluated and resolved as if the US is the only entity involved. I said in my previous post that many Americans feel very strongly that &quot;American ideals and way of life are superior to the rest of the world.&quot; I should also have said that sometimes the US forgets that the rest of the world is composed of human beings too.<br>
<br>
In terms of the Geneva Convention, Israel violates it on a daily basis. I invite anyone who disagrees to actually read the convention. Its at www.icrc.org. The violations will be readily apparent within a matter of minutes.<br>
<br>
For that matter, the recent US violations will also be apparent.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Heres something to consider:<br>
<br>
Imagine if a country existed that devoted a huge amount of its GNP to building a vast sprawling military machine; a nation that had stockpiled chemical and nuclear weapons but continued to research technology that would further advance its already superior military edge; a country that had no problem whatsoever with interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, including funding guerillas and assasinating leaders it felt were undesirable; one that refused to sign international accords concerning warcrimes and torture that had been ratified by the rest of the world, because it didnt want to be held accountable to anyone other than itself; a country that repeatedly misled its population in wartime, to the point not only of controlling the press but outright lying about military activities and casualties and curtailing civil liberties under the guise of national security.<br>
<br>
Imagine that country...and then look at the US.<br>
<br>
If you dont believe me, I can provide countless examples to support my argument, many of them very recent past. <br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
In the end, while there are bound to be two sides to any argument, I believe it comes down to this:<br>
<br>
Israel exists because Americans want it to.<br>
<br>
Sadam will die because Americans want him to.<br>
<br>
The US is playing the role of an arrogant god with the rest world.<br>
<br>
And when you are an arrogant god, things like 9/11 are bound to happen.<br>

<br>
The Palestinians attack Israel on all fronts, a few years ago Palastinian extrmists blew up the Israeli Cultural Center here in ARGENTINA, yea the Israelis don't just get blown up in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, they get it in South American and anywhere else trhey try to live out their lives. The Israelis aren't murduring Palestinian children, Palestine is.<br>

If you want some insight on this look around for Palestinian network programming, or research this one program shown to Palestinian children called &quot;The Children's Show&quot; or some such. There is a documentery floating artound about it, if you watch it prepare to be sick. <p><left>

Remember, Buran, nationstates do NOT have friends, they do not have morals, they do not have ethics... they have interests.  The US will act in its own self-interest, just as will any other nation state.<br>
<br>
When the US self-interest is to care about the deaths of foreign nationals, the US will do so, when it is not in the US self-interest to care about them, then the US will not care.  Either way the United States will come under criticism, either for 'interfering in the sovereign affairs' of a smaller nation and being the big bully on the block, or for 'not caring' about the problems facing smaller nations.  Bluntly, the United States is currently the top dog in international affairs, and the rest of the dogs will spend most of their time yapping at the top dog.  This is not a statement of boastful pride or vanity, but merely fact.  As of now, the United States is the global hegemon, the only Nation State capable of projecting power on a global basis.<br>
<br>
Historically speaking, the US has been rather passive in the last 50 years or so responding to threats and deaths to its citizens overseas, especially in comparison to both other nations and history.  Theodore Roosevelt dispatched the entire Atlantic Fleet to Morocco to pressure the Sultan into securing the release of a man who *might* have been an American citizen and who had been kidnapped by rebels.  12 Battleships, 6 Armored Cruisers, about two dozen destroyers, and auxilaries... dispatched across the Atlantic over a single *possible* citizen in trouble.  During the Iranian Revolution the Soviet Union had 4 diplomats held hostage, the Soviet Military threatened to engage in a border incursion into Iran in which every day those four diplomats were held they would kill 400 Iranians.  Iran returned the hostages 2 days after the threat, and before the killing actually started, and never again threatened Russian nationals.<br>
<br>
Nation states are different than interpersonal relations, and the same rules do not apply.  Nation states are, by nature, amoral entities, at the level of international relations, common morality no longer applies.  The whole question of 'right and wrong' is not often asked, but rather the question is of capabilities and interests, the callous, brutal arithmetic of power.<br>
<br>
If the United States had reacted to the USS Cole, the Khofar Towers, the embassy bombings, the first WTC attack, the Beirut Marine Barracks bombing, as energetically and forcefully as the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Japan reacted to the Boxer rebellion in China, the terrorist threat would have never reached 9/11.  It was in attempting to inject morals, and 'multilateralism' into international affairs that paralyzed responding to previous attacks by the Radical Islamic Fundamentalists, thus emboldening them to greater acts of terror.  The US, through its actions, appeared 'soft', and became more and more of a target, after all, we hadn't reacted to previous attacks, but rather lobbed a few cruise missiles at empty huts.<br>
<br>
Israel is currently in the process of a much more rapid progression through the same process.  At the beginning of the Al Aqsa Intifada they responded rather anemically (and were damned regardless), attacking known terrorist installations after warning everybody to leave, trying to treat the terrorist threat as a law enforcement problem, and not a military one.  The attacks continued, and escalated, and now Israel is at the point that the US reached on 9/11.  Now Israel is pretty much adopting the Bush Doctrine vis a vis terror, and striking directly at the terrorists where they live, where they hide, and rooting them out.  Nobody asks why the UN operated refugee camps were functioning as arsenals for terrorists, why UN buildings were used as armories... why the UN stood by and watched as Hezbollah terrorists kidnapped and murdered 5 Israelis from the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon.<br>
<br>
Irexes, at the scale of personal relations, yes, 1 US life = 1 Afghan life etc etc etc.  But that is personal morality.  In the realm of international affairs, 1 'my country' life is greater than any number of 'other country' lives.  Why?  Bluntly, those 'other country' lives don't pay taxes and don't vote.  It's not 'jingoism', its reality, it is how nation states manage their affairs.  The UK is equally callous in its International Relations, elsewise explain Rwanda?  1 UK life was more valuable than however many hundreds of thousands of Rwandans who died to the genocide their, why else didn't the UK send in forces to secure peace?  The Royal Marines and Army are certainly capable of dealing with tribal fighters... Every nation, from Albania to Zimbawye, operates under the same calculus of interests.<br>

Pause for a moment, unwrap the flag from your eyes and *think*.<br>
<br>
What really grabs me...what really made me want to post to the thread is what you have fallen back on, a mantra that makes you think you're the voice of America.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't like it, move to Canada&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is every americans right...no, it is every American's patriotic DUTY to openly and without fear express what they feel is wrong with this country. A country that keeps its populace silent, and opresses any and all dissent is a country you'd like to live in?<br>
So before you throw around mother insults (by the way, the last vestige of the truely ignorant).....<br>
<br>
YOU are what's wrong with this country. Not the democrats or the republicans or the war machine, not the poor or the rich. It's people like YOU that think any and all opinions other than what you see on TV are the only acceptable ones to have, and bully and pick on others that might be actually using their minds. Then again, you really ARE the perfect citizen, mindless and blindly following. <br>
I have no problem with any of you ideology. I'll respect you for having your beliefs...until you infringe on others...then you're not a part of what makes America great.<br>
<br>
And if you don't like that, why don't YOU move to Canada. <p><Font color="#FF0033" link="#FF0033" vlink="#FF0033" alink="#000066">

And you're right, the UK has done some very questionable things.  I not involved in the decision making process (a tick in a box once every 5 years notwithstanding) so I don't hold myself accountable.<br>

Why no ethics in foreign policy?  It's still individuals making decisions that lead to other people being killed.  And here was me thinking that Bush and Arafat and Sharon and Blair etc all believed in a god. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uirexes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irexes</A> at: 8/6/02 10:26:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uedwarddunai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Edward Dunai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/6/02 11:09:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   An example...</span><hr size=1> Think of it this way, Irexes...<br>
<br>
Banana_Republic00 is in the midst of a civil war in which tens of thousands or innocent civilians are dying.<br>
<br>
Major_Power00 has to decide whether or not to get involved.  Major_Power00 has no stake in the civil war, neither outcome will harm it, none of its citizens are currently in danger, and there are Banana_Republic01 and Banana_Republic02 there that should be able to deal with it.<br>
<br>
If Major_Power00 intervenes, it risks the death of its own citizens, the loss of equipment and prestige, the costs of the operations, and the reduction in capability to deal with other situations that might arise which might be a more immediate threat to the interests of Major_Power00.<br>
<br>
Moreover, if Major_Power00 intervenes, International_Body00, which is dominated by the various Banana_Republics, will no doubt engage in major criticism of Major_Power00 for intervening in the sovereign affairs of Banana_Republic00, since it is in the interest of Banana_Republic01, 02 and 03 that 00 remains in turmoil, since they are profitting from the situation by looting the refugees.<br>
<br>
What is Major_Power00 supposed to do?<br>
<br>
Ethics and Morality are fine for personal behavior, but at the level of nation states, making decisions based on them can very well mean that your people will die.  Bush, Blair et al answer to their own nations people, not to Afghans or Palestinians, and if American or British soldiers are to be placed in harms way, it damn well better be for the benefit of America and the UK.<br>
<br>
Yes, I freely admit it is brutal, it is not 'nice', it is not 'fair', it is not 'kind'.  It is reality.  No nation, no matter how 'progressive', acts in anything other than its own self-interest.  If that self-interest happens to coincide with common morality, we call it 'enlightened self-interest'.   The United States acts that way, the UK acts that way, Canada acts that way, Switzerland acts that way, EVERY nation acts that way.<br>
<br>
In many ways diplomacy is the art of making other nations see that their self-interest lies with supporting your national self-interest.  When nations interests coincide, you have alliances, and oftentimes a nations interests are quite moral, witness the international relief efforts throughout the Third World, witness the major nuclear powers uniting to pressure India and Pakistan into backing down from the brink of nuclear war...<br>
<br>
Personal morality really doesn't enter into this equation at all, where morality makes its appearance is in the methods and procedures, not in the actual decisions.  After 9/11, the US could, with the full support of the US populace and the full understanding of nearly the entire world, have launched a few ICBM's at the known terrorist supporters strongholds and incinerated tens of millions of people along with the terrorists.  Or the US could engage in a pin-point precision campaign against the terrorists while simaltaneously engaging in humanitarian 'hearts and minds' operations.  The 'interests' of the US was to destroy terrorism, where morality came into play was in deciding that it was more moral to risk our own soldiers lives in direct combat with the enemy rather than make use of our massive nuclear arsenal to obliterate it.<br>

<br>
International Affairs are by their very nature and practice amoral.  Morality, ethics, friendships, et al do not apply in the decisions of nation-states, only their interests.<br>
<br>
Those interests can, indeed, be 'moral' and 'ethical' if morality and ethics coincide with interests, but no nation state can afford to allow mere morality and ethics to overtake its interests, because if it does, it is quite possible that the 'moral' and 'ethical' decisions will lead to the deaths of citizens for no actual gain.<br>
<br>
Nation-states do not deal with issues at the same level as you or I do, when a nation state acts, it is quite possible that large numbers of people will die directly by either action or inaction, and oftentimes people will die either way, therefore, no nation state can be justified in acting in anything other than its own interests, because to throw away the lives of its citizens on things outside of its interest is amongst the worst things a nation state can do.<br>
<br>
Now in the practices and execution of these interests is where ethics and morality occur, where the leaders make the ethical decisions between options for attaining the nations interests.<br>
<br>
There is no 'new paradigm', there is no 'more ethical way'.  The basis for international relations has remained constant from the Pharoahs to today, and will still be the same when the universe succumbs completely to entropy.  'Society' is, by its very nature, amoral.<br>
<br>
Let me give an example... Somalia, where morality and ethics overrode national self-interest.... result? 19 American dead and the prestige of the US weakened, emboldening the terrorist threats and totalitarian opponents of US interests.  So, was ignoring self-interest in the interest of 'morality' justified? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>mistayn the mindless</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 2:48:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nakath...</span><hr size=1> that also depends on your view of morality.<br>

some people think its more than rude, almost immoral, to go around minding everyone's business for them.<br>
<br>
we don't need to meddle, but when we do we HAVE to have good reasons for it.  after reading a very large synopsis by a military general who was in the vietnam war, i'll agree with his point:  you aren't going to get citizens willing to lay down their lives for something less than what they feel is 'right', or righting a wrong somewhere.  <br>
<br>
ethics may have little to do with nation states and their interest.  but nation states are composed of, and supposedly serve the people that live in them.  at least ours has always given lip service to this concept.  <br>

and if the people think that their nation is a foul villain and agrees with almost nothing that it does because of their standard of ethics,  that nation state is not going to have a compliant populace and may not be in existence for much longer.<br>

<br>
That gets into the question of 'what are a nation's interests and how are they set', rather than how the nation state acts upon said interests.  Generally speaking, a freely elected government will have more 'moral' interests than a dictatorship, precisely because of the more communal setting of the interests.  But that is not always the case, and in many cases it is not the preferable way to get things done.  The Founders, and many political thinkers throughout history, have rightly abhorred mobocracy, because just because 90 percent of the populace thinks something is good doesn't always make it so.  That's where 'statesmanship' comes into play, and it is those crass amoral statesmen who oftentimes reap the greatest good for both their nation state, and, ultimately, mankind.<br>
<br>
Now to address the questions about the US 'over arming' and spending so much on defense.  There is a very real, moral, and ethical reason for a nation state in the global position of the US to do so, it's called 'peace'.  Peace is not achieved between nation states because of warm fuzzies or feel good words, peace is achieved when the most primitively barbaric thug on the planet is afraid to realize his ambitions because he knows that there will be a 800 pound gorilla hammering him into the dirt if he tries.  Crass?  Yup.  Crude?  Uh huh.  Uncivilized?  Damn straight.  True? Oh yeah, very.<br>
<br>
Its when the Osama bin Ladins and Saddam Hussein's and Jiang's and Qaddafi's and Arafats and Assad's of the world are trembling in terror of what the global hegemon will do to them if they dare disturb it that there is peace, and with peace comes such nice things as 'not getting blown up by terrorists' and 'not having to go to war'.<br>
<br>
Morally speaking, the US committed a great sin by allowing itself to be weakened by failing to act against previous terrorist attacks strongly, be drawing down its defense, and by weakening its military.  Why?  Because that emboldened the true barbarians fo the world into thinking that they could win, thus they struck.  World War III did not occur because the Russians were nice enough to want peace rather than conquest, World War III was prevented because the Russian leadership knew if they tried that they would die.  9/11 didn't occur simply because somebody hated the US, the US has been hated by much more powerful enemies in the past, 9/11 occurred because somebody who hated the US felt that they could get away with attacking the US without getting hammered.<br>
<br>
Once you have established such credentials that nobody dares piss you off, then you have, not just 'peace', but Pax.  Where the hegemonic power can bend events globally to its liking without the use of force, through the simple fear of the force lurking in reserve.  Then, a moral hegemonic power is able to impose more 'ethical' interests onto the lesser nation-states by making it too dangerous for a lesser nation-state to act on interests that may be seen as immoral (note, IMmoral rather than Amoral, there is a difference, immoral is the opposite of moral, amoral is the absence of morality) to the hegemonic power.<br>
<br>
I don't think that there is much argument that the US is more 'moral' and 'ethical' in its dealings than, say, Iraq.  The US is certainly not a paragon of virtue riding its white horse polishing its stainless escutcheon, but let us be honest, nobody else is either, and the US is certainly closer to the ideal 'moral hegemon' than any other nation-state that has achieved that level of ascendency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1158.topic&start=81&stop=87>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1158.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1158.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1158.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1158.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
