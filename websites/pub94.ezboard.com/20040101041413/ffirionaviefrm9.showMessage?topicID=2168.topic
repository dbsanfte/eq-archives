Basically you need to make sure you do not save any more information on the computer or install any software to give you the best chance of recovering the file(s)<br>
<br>
Your harddrive is organized like a library with a card catalog.  Think of the files you save as books in a library.  The computer looks at the card catalog to know where to go get the book.  When you delete a file, the computer just throws away card catalog entry with the book still there.  Using UnDelete in Norton Utilities allows the card catalog to get the card back so that it knows about the file.<br>
<br>
Not sure how clear that was but there is hope as long as you do it before you save any more files or install software. <p>Xsasx Miasma &quot;Death comes in many forms&quot;<br>

Not sure if it's still the same way or not, but most hard drives have a cataloge track...  When you delete a file, you delete the entry on that...   The data itself, is still on the harddrive, but the computer can't see it...   An undeleter program, can retie the deleted cataloge entry back with the data....<br>
<br>
The problem is, if you don't have one - you take the chance of writing over that data when you go to install one...<br>
<br>
You might try searching for a program - or buy a product like Norton's System Works...   But for the most part, if that program isn't installed, unless you know someone that can manipulate the cataloge track, you're SOL  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If your harddrive is formated using FAT (File Allocation Table) then you still have a chance to recover, i.e. if you are using Windows 98.<br>
<br>
If your harddrive is formated NTFS (Windows 2000 server is typically formated NTFS), then I am not aware of a way to recover the file.<br>
<br>
You may be able to tell by going to Windows explorer, right clicking on the harddrive and selecting properties.  Should say something about &quot;File System&quot; being FAT or NTFS. <p>Xsasx Miasma &quot;Death comes in many forms&quot;<br>

<br>
NTFS isn't *that* different from FAT. It's just has more built-in redundancy, imrpoved structure, and more features like hard links and parse points (soft links). The basic concept is the same, though. Instead of a file allocation table (FAT), you have a master file table (MFT).<br>
<br>
As others have pointed out, deleting a file really just means deleting it's index in the MFT. The card catalogue analogy is pretty accurate. It would take too long to actually erase the data from the drive, so the operating system just deliberately loses it's reference to the file instead. Whenever you try to stick new data on the hard drive, the OS looks for any sectors on the disk that aren't referenced by any entries in the MFT. If the data in that sector is &quot;unclaimed&quot;, so-to-speak, the OS assumes that it's safe to write over it with the new data, which then gets reserved in the MFT as a new file.<br>
<br>
Since the data is still physically there on the disk, it's still possible to get it back as long as nothing has trampled over the data yet to make room for a new file. So the longer you use your computer before you try to undelete it, the less likely it is that you'll be able to get it back. In the old FAT days, things were really simple. The entry in the FAT wasn't even really deleted like I described above, it just had the first letter of the file name changed to a special marker character (I think it was just a plain old ASCII ? mark) to indicate that the file was erased. You could browse through the FAT and try to undelete something just by giving it a real first letter and then hoping that the sectors it referenced were still intact and unused.<br>
<br>
For NTFS, I think they did away with this convention and just delete the file entry entirely. That makes things a little harder, because you have no way of knowing where the file was. In order to find a deleted file, the undelete utility has to read through all the data on the drive and look for anything that might have been a file using some semi-intelligent pattern matching (heuristics). It's more time-consuming and it's not entirely perfect -- sometimes random data on the disk just *looked* like it was a file, and there are plenty of fragments of files that overlap one other because they don't have clear beginnings and ends. Still, it can be done with a little patience and luck.<br>
<br>
In fact, it's even possible to a limit extent to recover data from magnetic storage like hard drives even after it's been accidentally overwritten or deliberately wiped due to lingering traces of it's previous magnetic state, but that's getting into the professional data recovery/FBI/NSA territory. People do offer that kind of data recovery service, but it's pretty costly (for a typical workstation drive, figure somewhere in the $1000+ range). It really just becomes a question of how valuable that data is.<br>
<br>
The best thing for you to do is find an undelete utility and use it ASAP. Try to use the computer in question as little as possible until you do. If this were a *NIX system, I'd suggestion freezing the computer, pulling the drive out and mounting it read-only on another machine to do the recovery, but in your case, you'll probably just have to settle for being quick.<br>
<br>
And not to throw any salt on the wound, but there's a saying - &quot;There are two kinds of people in the world: those who back up their critical data and those who don't back up their critical data *yet*.&quot; If your office doesn't have a routine backup system in place, they need one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=toveebearwhisper>Tovee BearWhisper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The wee Shamaness<br>

You need an undeleter - this is something that Windows can not do on its own.<br>
<br>
The most IMPORTANT THING!!!  Do not add anything to your computer system.  Don't buy an undeleter and install it, or you can and will right over the section that contains the files.  You need to look for a program that can run from the computer disk, or slave the harddrive that needs the files recovered from it.<br>
<br>
There are several good undeleters for NTFS and all versions of the FAT file system.  <br>
