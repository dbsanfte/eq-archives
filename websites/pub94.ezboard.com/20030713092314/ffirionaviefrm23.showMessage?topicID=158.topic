Pleased with herself at her decision to become a ranger, she proudly brushes off the Trueshot sleeves she just finished making at the forge at only 5 Seasons of training.  She figures just a few more bricks of bronze and she'll be out of these patchwork boots.  Heck, she salutes herself with her mead, won't be but another season and she'll have her bracers and gauntlets too.  Yep, Liu, ol' girl...you may have started late in years on finally choosing your profession, but you chose it well.....well except you get yourself lost all the time...,&quot; she thinks to herself as she congratulates herself with a second mead.<br>

<br>
An Iksar, a creature whose race is hated above of all others in Norrath, walks into the dim space. Smears of orcish blood paint his dark green garb. A spear adorns his back, and a short sword hangs sheathed at his side. His loping gait is hindered only by the slightest hint of a limp as he walks though the tavern and leans against the wall near the barkeep. Leaning in a bit, he is seen to whisper something to the elvin bar-tender only to be greeted with a dismissing wave and a disgusted glance. There will be no drink for him tonight. The deep black eyes of the Iksar give no hit to the inner workings of his mind, and his demeanor remains unchanged. He walks over to a dark corner of the tavern and sits upon the floor, his back to the wall. Rummaging through his traveler's pack he produces a small knife and a wooden figure. As he sets to work on his carving his sings to himself in a low voice. His song is sad and strange to hear, one may be startled to find that it is not in his native language but heavily accented Elvish that he sings.<br>

Dressed in an amalgam of red and orange clothing, it seems hard to place whaat he does for a living, although an educated guess would be that he was a rogue since it looked like his aramor covering was seemingly made of material besides metal or cloth. His moustached face peers out from his simple hat, a calm yet somewhat smug look on his face.<br>
<br>
Perris looks over his shoulder as he stands in the enterance, staring at something unseen from inside the Tavern. After a moment, he turns back with a small laugh, walking up to the small bar. He quickly sees that two of the few seats are taken up. The first is filled by an Iksar who he guesses is a fighter or warrior of sorts. While the barkeep certainly doesn't seem to smile kindly at the man, he also doesn't kick him out, so Perris quickly dismisses any possible trouble from him. Beside him is an Elven lady of some beauty, although Perrin conveniently forgets that there are few Elves that he has not thought beautiful. She seems to be speaking to the Iksar, by the sound of the language, in her native Elven.<br>
<br>
Perris quickly pushes his observation aside, turning to the barkeep and ordering a Honey Mead. Luckily, the Barkeep seems to know at least the rudimentary basics of the human tounge, probably to make better buisness, so Perris quickly gets his drink with no trouble. While Perris had only fought a skirmish or two with the Crushbone Legions, he still came off as a kind hearted man, so most people of Faydwer treated him fairly and honestly.<br>
<br>
Taking a sip from his mug, he takes out a small pocket book, flipping through it with a seeming purpose as he casually listens to the two next to him. <p>----------------<br>

<br>
Remembering herself, she apologizes, &quot;I'm sorry, sir.  It's just so exciting.  You, so different from everyone else, training among us.  You've seen the world!  The farthest I've been is to see Master Canloe in Kaladim to get a pat on the head for delivering Crushbone belts.  Tell me, tell me please of one of your adventures,&quot; she pleads, &quot;um, if you aren't too tired.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=perristhesuave>Perris the Suave</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Charming to a Fault</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/03 3:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=158.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/1877294.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hearthwood Tavern</span><hr size=1> Perris was busy in turn jotting notes, or reading slowly, or flipping quickly through his small book. He merely stopped whatever he was doing to give a few platinum peices to the barkeep, motioning with his head to indicate that he was paying for the two conversationalists. He didn't know what the two had said, the elf woman and the berkeep, but he doubted it was anything but a money issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyways,&quot; he said softly to the barkeep, &quot;consider them paid off for the night. And get me another Honey Mead and you'll get another plat where that came from.&quot; <p>----------------<br>

He loved the language of the elves, and speaking with one in a casual setting was a rare treat.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I train under the Emerald Warriors. For many seasons I have. I was offered this special training simply because I expressed interest in it...I have proven myself in many of the battles between your folk and the foul Crushbone orcs.” Taking another mouthful of bread he sat back<br>
<br>
“ A fosterling you say? One adopted by your kind? Indeed I am not, for I was already a  warrior of some season before I was gifted with the favor of Kelethin. I offer praise to Tunare for that is in respect for the warriors with whom I train. I do not bend knee to any of the dark Gods.”<br>
<br>
Looking at the excited young elf, he sat for a moment and thought.<br>
<br>
“I am not sure of adventures, if even I have been on one or not. I have been to many lands and in many battles. I have seen and spoken with many strange folks. I will gladly answer any questions that you may have.” <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=158.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=158.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=158.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm63">Ayrielle's Story Contest!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
