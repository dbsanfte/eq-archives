There were a handful of us that all left at the same time for various reasons, then we moved mostly to bah, can never remember that guild's name, then moved to OoC. <p>Macgee

Anyone remember Rollen crying when FnF was considering waking the Sleeper? Or all the reasons Reso gave for NOT waking the Sleeper?<br>
<br>
&quot;we won't wake the Sleeper, we 'care' about the community&quot;, lol<br>
<br>
You really had a lot of the suckers on FV fooled, I'm just glad they all finally got to see your true colors. Don't be fooled again by all the propaganda they are spouting off this time. They lied to you before, they are lieing to you now, they will lie to you again. Sure, they will help you with your Nagy raids, but you can't have any SoDs *wink*. THATS a fair trade off. This 'awakening' is long over due.<br>

<br>
I'm not talking about the ST after the sleeper is released.  I'm talking about FV's ST was changed into while he was still sleeping.<br>
<br>
Calvin is correct, you got a ton of loot in Reso.  Not only that, you knew you were leaving and gladly accepted a spell and disbanded a very short time after.<br>
<br>

The Sleeper event was great, I think most people enjoyed it.  We reached the max limit on chat channel, shortly after that all chat channels crashed server-wide.  Oops maybe.<br>
<br>
The dragon rampaged the tomb clearing all the keepers and lore masters.  Shortly after that he paid a visit to Skyshrine where he swiftly removed all the members of the Claw, including the Lord Yelinak.  The fight left him wounded and he fled into the night sky leaving only screams of terror in his wake.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The ST as we knew it pre-awakening was removed by VI.  By that I mean the zone was altered, the encounters were different, and the mobs were not the same.  The difficulty of the zone increased tremendously and the rewards were not on track with RvR.  <br>
<br>
The difficulty of maintaining an altered copy of of a zone that only was in place on a few servers is understandable.  Honestly, I believe they wanted all servers to move to the new storyline and FV was forced into it whether or not they were willing.<br>
<br>
Post-awakening, the zone was altered slightly again, only this time for the better.  The encounters did not change in difficulty, however the loot is now on track with RvR.  <br>
<br>
If you haven't seen or raided the new ST, I encourage you to do so prior to coming to this forum to flame anyone.<br>
<br>
There is nothing worse than jumping on a band-wagon that is full of unknowledgeable individuals, then coming here spewing forth mindless dribble. <p>Macgee

Then post this on the boards, and let people decide if all the badmout of new ST is worth it, so far everyone is judging my what is said from other servers, i am waiting for somone to prove me wrong.. maybe somone will come forth and post this data - them maybe other guilds will work towards there sleepers key and go do it for themselves.<br>
<br>
Right now a lot of guilds i doubt are planning on going there purely because they are already believing it is going to be bad.. me, i have never been, the fact that the zone has changed means little to me now, whats done is done.. still want to go and see it. <br>
<br>
There are many people they were hopeing to see that zone before somone awakened him as on other servers, i think maybe he was awakened a bit premature for this server.<br>

To have Calvin, who is generally nice to everyone on this server and one of the most generous people on the server come out and say what he did speaks volumes in my book.<br>
<br>
Anyways I just think your sorry you left and that your new guild blew up because the real reason some of the leaders were here were to wake the sleeper etc...<br>
<br>
Doesnt anyone find it odd that all these high level guild people in the other guilds bailed as soon as Resolution worked hard and got into NToV and woke the sleeper.  Hell, you can buy Ramels gear in the bazaar right now.<br>
<br>
If it was just about having fun and being with your buds and they had close family-like atmospheres like Resolution does, then why leave?  Because that wasnt what it was about for them.<br>
<br>
Anyways John I think we just saw your true colors actually.<br>

Resolution did the new ST.  They drop Primal like weapons and Priceless type weapons.  There is a bunch more Caster loot there now (good thing casters were getting pissy).<br>
<br>
The new ST has more to offer to everyone.  Its actually a better zone in My opinion.<br>

<br>
Just to clear up a little misunderstanding. Ramel bailed weeks ago. Long before all this nonsense about the sleeper being awoken.  He has been playing for over 3 years and it was just time for him and his roomie to walk away and do other stuff.<br>
<br>
I believe it was Exxy who bought his account. IF his gear is being sold off in the bazaar thats to bad but oh well.<br>
<br>
I don't know who else is &quot;leaving&quot; because the sleeper has been awoken. I don't really track who is quitting though. =P. I know AS broke up right around all of this discussion but I would be very surprised if they broke up over this.<br>
<br>
Btw, a little off topic, but why did Cori quit? I never did hear why he left EQ. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

No clue about Coriolis....he just dissappeared about the same time NWN's came out.  A whole lot of people sorta disappeared for a while after that.  For the most part they all came back.  Cori never did.  I figure he is a DM there or something.  He basically did everything he wanted here I think.  <br>
<br>
Ive been playing this game for 3 years too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Though I have seen almost everything, there are still some places I have yet to set foot.  I havent been to the Deep yet, VP, VT, or any of the PoP.  Would like to at least tread around on all of the places (well maybe not VT....god what a time sink) before i hang it up.<br>

Still having fun with Resolution.  Unless they kick me out ill be there to the end.<br>

There's this huge plasmatic bridge thats not really there and if you try to step foot on it you fall to your death. Then there's an invisible bridge not too far after that which you cannot see unless you have rez effects or 'become like the dead'. You basically have to get 1 person to lead you accross this long invisible bridge with a 10k drop. Was an awesome experience even though we didn't so anything significant. I urge people to go. Though it can get pretty rough.<br>
