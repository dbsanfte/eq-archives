You are not strong because you are evil. You are strong only because you are skilled. You are weak though, because you are evil. You are afraid of appearing &quot;soft&quot;. You are afraid of being hurt, when showing kindness to others. You are so afraid of being seen as &quot;weak&quot;, that you are filled with anger, and kill to &quot;prove&quot; to yourself that you are not weak. But all you are, is a raving madman. You gave in to your inner demons. Anyone can be a killer. Anyone can be a monster. It takes no great power to twist a dagger through flesh. You gave in. You gave in to your fear of being seen as &quot;weak&quot;. You gave in to your anger at this fear in yourself. You surrendered to the God of Hate. Hate can be a tool to help destroy an enemy, but if left unchecked, becomes a weakness.<br>
 I wish it were as simple as you think. That those who serve Gods of good are always good. I have seen too many so- called &quot;Druid&quot; attacking their wolf and bear allies...&quot;Just because.&quot; Paladins who are self-rightous and smug as they kill a creature who is friendly to them. Simply for greed. Evil is in what you do, not in what you are born or trained as. <br>
 I do NOT choose to &quot;sit on a fence&quot; and stand aside as evil runs amok. I oppose any and all who cause and delight in misery and suffering. I choose to fight evil. No matter whom or what the evil is. I wish my skills were more equal to yours, then I would challenge you. In time, Shintou. If your maddness has not destroyed you by the time I am more powerful...I will kill you. I do not fear death.<br>

<br>
One should not expect the lightbringers to understand Innoruuk or His message.  They are deluded fools, hypocrites because even within their &quot;pure&quot; hearts they harbor hatred of what they label &quot;evil.&quot;  The are willfully ignorant and seek to stomp out the truth, and the truth is that it is only through conflict that growth occurs, that without conflict all is static and truly dead.  They ignore the great motivator of conflict: Hate...pure, perfect Hate.<br>
<br>
They refuse to accept the truth of Lord Innoruuk's message, and seek to exterminate those of us who He purified to be the perfect vessals of His message.  Our mission is to see that Hate is propgated, and spread.  It is a Holy Sacrament to cause the flawed vessals created by Tunare to Hate us, made more enjoyable by their insane denial of it, or their rationalizations of it.  The worst offenders are the worshippers of nature, who refuse to accept the place of hate and death out of bigoted foolishness, and the utter hypocrisy of the paladins who hate us for our &quot;evil ways.&quot;<br>

Evil ain't about hate or power. You are too wrapped up in anger ta be anything more than a minor evil, Blueboy. Anger at yore poor ol' ma fer abondoning ya ta the whims of yore &quot;Father&quot;. Innoruk didn't teach y'all ta hate, Tunare did when she turned her back on you firstborn in favor of yore younger sibs, the Woodies an the Stuck-ups.<br>

Don't much matter what race or religion my pallete comes from, it is all the same ta mean iffen the music they make rings true.<br>
<br>
It is Aesthetically pleasin ta me...and I enjoy bein pleased.<br>

Why shouldn't I help out a 'lightie' from time ta time.... it is like this glass a wine here: What is it but gloriously rotten grape juice? Iffen the farmer didn't help out the grapes now an then, he would have a lousy end product. Helpin out a lightie (or a bluie)from time ta time just means his whine will be that much sweeeter when he comes time ta harvest.<br>
<br>
I don't worship Bertoxxulous, I follows him the same way a connosiuer follows a particular wine-master, or the way a groupie follows a particular bard.<br>

Have you ever seen the artwork of Rage? The way the blade of pure and total hatred tears and rends flesh? Do you know the Inspiration hatred gives one to destroy another? The artwork I produce even sends other so called evil Tier'dal running to the gods in the tears of Fear. Its all about hate..<br>
<br>
What is more evil they slaying the entire family of a Highelf, watching him grow in hatred, trying to stand against you.. and when he finally can, beating him down as well? Looking down at him as he curses you in self hatred as your blade begins its artowrk of Rage upon his back? <br>
<br>
I honor the death of Bertox however, as much as I can do with my hate, he is the Master of Death and I have to bow my head in the final result of my work.<br>

I am sorry, I'll never understand how you can assist the ..well Canvas as you put it. They are nothing but cattle for me, sometimes cattle pisses me off, so I kill a few to put them in line. Their are some very big cows that truly need to be backhanded down into their place, but that will come in time. I'm not helping any lightbringers, why waste the effort? Why even give them the tools. <br>
<br>
The weapon you give to a Lightbringer will end up in your back. You underestimate the woodelves and you'll be as F#$%ed as we were back then, when that elven dagger ended up in the back of our General.<br>

And Tunare turned my her back on me? Heh, don't make me laugh. Look at those in the Twilight Bastion. If I wanted to, I could go and be a happy lil elf with the rest, Tunare turned her back on nothing. I openly and freely turn my back on her.<br>
