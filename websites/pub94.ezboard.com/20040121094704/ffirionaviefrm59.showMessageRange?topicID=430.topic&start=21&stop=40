Now we have been doing these raids longer than you have even known about the City of Mist.  And as anyone can tell you! Anez is MUCH nicer about raids than I am.  WHY? well she's a sweatheart and i'm a mage!  hehe But even I thank people at the end of raids.   Now it occurs to me that IF she didn't thank you it was because:<br>
<br>
A.  You mouthed off before, during or after the raid ended.<br>
B.  Were causing problems for the raid at any time.<br>
C.  Started asking annoying questions like &quot;How come I dont get to roll on an epic item that i can't equip and don't need other than for greed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Personally if I had been there I would have laughed you out of the raid immediately, because WE DO EXPLAIN!! that jade reavers go to ONLY those that need them for their epic...not all rangers and not all druids get to roll on them if they have gotten a jade reaver before.  So a word of advice....try attending more than one CoM raid before you spout off about unfairness or not receiving a thank you. <br>
<br>
 Both Anezkia and I always thank everyone at the end of each raid and I personally go a step further and apologize to everyone just incase i offended anyone by the way I lead raids...I always say &quot;I wanna thank you all for a job well done! As well as apologize if i offended anyone for anything i might have said or done during this raid.  I like to run a tight ship so that little to none die during them.&quot; If you are upset because you didn't get a personal &quot;thank you lothor you are the best anyone could ask for OMG will you please let me give you a jade reaver for your attendance on this one raid today?&quot; sorry bro it's not gonna happen.  <br>
Everyone works hard on raids to make them as flawless as possible....and as a rogue if your job is to stay hidden the whole time and open doors...well then do your job and don't expect handouts for doing it.  If you think what i'm saying is not true try asking Cuttwin.  He has been on MANY CoM raids and never expects a thank you, just does what he is supposed to do and does it to the best of his ability...and amazingly he's actually rolled on and won alot of pretty nice sellable items that we get from these raids.  Go for it...ask him...please i dare you too.  <br>
If you are expecting someone to send you a personal tell everytime and thank you for a job well done, then try keeping quiet and doing the job you signed up to do without any complaints or hasseling anyone on the raid.  Ohh and attend more than just one cause it really makes you look bad the first time you show up and expect to get more than someone that has been doing it many many times.<br>
<br>
And as far as you not helping us at our raids? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
don't you worry bro, I wouldn't think of having you join anymore of our raids...you are as good as banned.  I think you need to research what you are trying to talk about first before just opening your mouth, cause you obviously have no idea.  I would rather never raid again than have you open another door, disarm another trap, or retrieve another corpse, for any of our raids.  <br>
<br>
And as to your final post about VS.  Bro try reading your screen we said MULTIPLE TIMES that we had never done a VS raid only VSR!! I announced that most likely it was going to fail but we were going to try anyway just for the kicks and giggles!! So if you are too scared to try something new...go back to playing donkey kong jr.  and avoid this game.<br>
<br>
As to everyone else, please please please forgive me for going off like this but hehe he kinda pushed the wrong button with me on this one.  We take our raids VERY seriously and any of you that have joined us on multiple occasions know that we work very hard on making them as flawless as possible as well as everyone having a great time.  We most likely will be doing more CoM raids just not as regularly but if you are interested in one please let us know and we'll see what we can do.  We are begining our private planer raids today and will be inviting those that have joined us on previous CoM raids to attend.  If you are interested in those as well please let us know.  <br>
<br>
Sorry for this being so long but i had a few things to say lol<br>
<br>
ohh almost forgot...Lothor next time you need an epic raid done for you...let us know ok..we'll organize it, lead it and even get the piece and then we'll allow everyone to roll on it and see how that turns out....maybe your right..maybe everyone should roll on epic pieces cause as you obviously have pointed out to us...your greed is more important than others needs.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Anezkia was busy keeping people alive and throwing buffs in addition to being the raid leader for 4 groups.  I feel it is unrealistic for you to expect her to be able to single you out for special praise and recognition in those circumstances.<br>
The goal of the raid was to help people toward their epics and about 20% of the people in the raid got one step closer to their epic without a single rez.  I do not agree with you that she is a bad raid leader.<br>

There were 21 people there, and I sure don't hear any of them complaining.  I ALWAYS explain the rules and loot before the raid...anyone that has been there can tell you that.  If you were not listening, there's nothing I can do about that.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone knows we do appreciate your support and attendance on these raids.  I hope they have been good opportunities for a lot of people!  I think all in all we have awarded 6 jade reavers, completed Telorea's epic, awarded a few other shamans with their epic pieces, awarded several enchanters their epic piece from charming the wraith, and also 5 or 6 torch of the elements for mages!  Whew, I think that's quite a list!<br>
<br>
Thank you Bippin!  We often have rogues volunteer because they like to help out their friends and enjoy raiding.  Thank you Cuttwin, Suladien, Nimbel, and Aades (if I am forgettting one of you I am sorry!!  Have had a lot of these raids! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) for being our rogue heroes in the past.  And don't worry, Lothor's actions do not taint my opinions of the good rogues out there!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And Venril Sathir was an experiment.  You, Lothor,  were way too low level to be there but we let you come anyway...because once again you said &quot;I love raiding etc etc....&quot;<br>

Anyway, I went to CoM 3 times, managed to win a reaver the first trip, then went the other 2 times to support a mage friend of mine.  Even considering that it wasn't a guild supported thing, those raids were some of the best run I have ever been on.  I know that Anezkia went over the loot rules before the raid started, and if i remember right, she listed them in her post here too. <p>Draugdin<br>

<br>
First off.  Wheeeeee!! Go happy fun Anon posting!!!  You come in here and flame friends of mine anonomously.  This nets you the &quot;Almighty Fucktard&quot; award.<br>
<br>
Second.  Not being thanked?  Um...you and I had a fairly lengthy conversation in tells, in which I thanked you quite a few times for your good work in the raid.  But you continued to whine and cry about not getting loot.  You took off in a fit before the cash and MoSS were rolled on. (Just for info, Anez ML'ed plat, and awarded a near 1300 plat pot at the end of the raid, on a /random 1000)  You whined &quot;Weh weh, I have played 28 days on this character to get to 50, and spent two days getting my lockpick to 200, and didn't get anything for my 6 hours time&quot;  And I answered, I have spent 82 days getting to 52.  EIGHTY TWO DAYS!!!  That's goddamn near 3 months of the past 14 sitting here having fun and raiding with great people like Anezkia and crew.  And you know what I have won on a raid?? Anezkia and Vyrsin can tell you, and so can my guild, NOTHING AT ALL!!!!!  And have I bitched about it??  They can tell you again, no, I haven't.  Have I continued grouping and raiding with them?  Yes, I have.  So, this gets you the &quot;I am an asshat&quot; award.<br>
<br>
Third.  Bringing this childish little temper tantrum of yours out of the game gets you the wonderful, Tzaroth inspired, &quot;Eat a bag of hell, d00d&quot; award.  Lying about the Venril Sathir raid may even get you the &quot;I just may be one of Niomal's alts&quot; award.  We never said we were going to be able to drop him.  Frankly, it was an understood we were going to get ripped a new one.  You were very kindly allowed to come along because you asked.  Afterwards, you offered your services for other raids freely.  You were taken up on that offer, and allowed the experience of a CoM run, even though we had rogue handy that had been on a good many of those raids, and knew the routine like the back of his hand.  Thank you Suladien. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Lothor Finepoint, there is a thing called friendship in this game.  Friendship in Everquest involves putting your character at risk for the benifit of others sometimes.  I have died for Anezkia's Epic, I have died for Tynsils Epic, I didn't die for Lerris's Epic, because that damn polar bear was a pansy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I didn't complain one time.  Because they are my friends.  Frankly, if it weren't for meeting Anezkia and Tynsil one night in Dawnshroud Peaks, after thoroughly getting trashed by some named Zelniak that decided to resist everything I threw at it, I may have gotten frustrated with soloing so much, and quit playing EQ.  But a simple heal from her, and a haste from Tynsil, and a bit of chatting with them both,  and that made my night.  And I was sure to tell her that as well.  She didn't have to take the time to help me out, but she did anyway.  And you know what?  Since January 22nd, when I created this character, Anezkia and crew are some of the finest bunch of people I have met in this game.  Thanks for everything guys. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In closing, thank you Anezkia for a raid that went flawlessly.  Not one person died on the raid.  I don't even think there was a close call.  Anezkia didn't have to award that plat, she could have kept it to cover Peridot costs.  Lord knows <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> owe her for a ton of them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hell, she didn't have to lead a raid at all, I know she gained nothing material from it either.<br>

Now, I am not going to rise to this slapping and back-stabbing.  But I am going to give you a set of simple rules, I always abide by when it comes to raiding.<br>
After that, you decide what you should think or feel.<br>
<br>
If you don't agree with my policies, thats fine.  But, like someone we could all mention by now, you will end up disappointed - and regardless of how little this molehill was to begin with - look whats happened?  Mountains!<br>
<br>
Ok - see what you think..<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Expect to die.<br>
2. Expect to lose exp.<br>
3. Don't expect to win on drops.<br>
4. Don't expect to get what you're after!<br>
<br>
So why go in the first place?<br>
well, because you MAY live, you MAY gain some exp even - although raids are not about exp!<br>
You MAY win a drop of some value - who knows?<br>
Lastly, YOU MIGHT, just might get that epic piece you're after, or a piece of armour or new weapon that you've been after for soooo long!<br>
<br>
So, put simply, if any of the above rules don't apply to you after a raid - then you must of had a successful time!<br>
<br>
If you don't like it - don't go!  Its as simple as that.<br>
<br>
Oh, and just a word of support here - my guild has a few rogues capable of opening those doors now, and I also have a friend in another guild who would likely lend her set of lock picks to your cause, if she can.<br>
Thats if, you ever need a rogue, and are short of one!<br>
Shout me in game!  I'll try and help if I can...  Oh, and please, can I come too?<br>

I've lead 2 somewhat open/guild raids on Lower Guk and ToFS once with him, and can conclude he is indeed VERY demanding. On Lower Guk, he attempted to undermine my leadership with his own, spouting orders at every moment, causing mass confusion. So I can instantly believe this thread, and apologize for the burden he has been. <br>
<br>
He was in my guild before and after this CoM raid, when I had not seen these posts. I can say that he is no longer with us now. This wasn't the only reason either, as he gravely insulted the honor of my wife, Renlaieli. Shortly after this, he then raided the plane of his own diety, Tunare. This lack of respect to his god, his officers, and now his raid leaders simply abhors me. He might be a generous man (he is, he has given many expensive items to lower guildees), but this does not make up for these occurrences. <br>
<br>
Lothor -- you simply must learn patience and respect to succeed. I bid you luck in your future, but you have no place in the Bane of Ruin any longer.<br>
