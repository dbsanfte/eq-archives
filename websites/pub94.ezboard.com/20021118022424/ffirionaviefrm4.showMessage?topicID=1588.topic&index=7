The guy had a problem...  He lost his job over EQ, he quit cleaning his place, and wasn't given the help he needed.  He was addicted, just like any other drug/behavior compulsion.  He needed help, and it was the mother's responsibility to see that he got it.  If not her, someone should have intervened.  There are plenty of other games out there like EQ, so I don't see how getting EQ stopped like the mother suggested is going to help anything.  That boy is the reason we now have a timer in the new ui.  Of course the guy from Sony that was interviewed said that the idea of someone commiting suicide because of a game was ridiculous.  Personally, I disagree with him.  EQ may be just a game, but that doesn't mean that someone cannot be so addicted that they do themselves harm over it.  We've all heard the stories of people losing their jobs or ignoring their health, so is suicide that much of a step up?  I thought the section 48 hours did was quite interesting, even if the people interviewed has some very obvious bias on their positions.  Ben Stein's remark about his child having a demon inside him was ...  ignorant at best, I think.  We as EQ players must take resposibility for ourselves, and seek help if we have a problem.  I think it is really easy to blame it all on the game for the addictive nature, like the mother did, but we truly are the ones that decide that we are going to play.  Whether it be for half an hour, 12 hours straight... No one else can make that decision for us, and the game cannot force us to continue to play.  Just my strictly ooc 2cp worth<br>

<br>
And here is where I respectfully disagree with you.<br>
<br>
We can't know, unless one of ya'll knew the guy. <br>
<br>
Mental illness aside, no one seems to take responsibility for themselves anymore.<br>
<br>
The mother is lashing out at VI/EQ because she knows there were things as a parent that she either wasn't doing, or didn't do...or maybe she doesn't know, I sometimes give the human race way too much credit.<br>
<br>
If this person was mentally ill or mentally challenged, either case...for him to be let go into the spin where <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> took that much control of his life, then somewhere along the way, someone wasn't looking out for his best interests....<br>
<br>
Maybe she didn't say much about eq, cuz it kept him out of her hair.  Maybe if he wasout of her hair, she didn't have to think about how she apparently fucked up as a parent....or maybe things like that didn't even cross her mind.<br>
<br>
Pardon my ranting, I hadn't realized how strongly I feel about people like this woman.<br>
<br>
She's not mourning her son, she's looking for his deat hnot to be her fault. And I'm not at all saying it is. Suicide is sadly, not always a black and white thing. <br>
<br>
I mean for the average Joe to kill himself over a chick, I think that's lame....but to someone either mentally ill, or mentally challenged, it may be The Worst Thing that's ever happened, because they may not be able to see past the right now.<br>
<br>
This woman is just another reason, imho, that there should be a screening process before you can propigate this race. <p><center><b><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner">Sarhea Yigsawla</a></b><br><i>Another taste of the evil I breathe,<br>

And I agree with the need for people to actually account for themselves instead of finger-pointing as soon as something goes wrong. It's partially the over-litigious (gahd, spelling -- it's late -- is it litigious I'm looking for?) society we live in, partially the fact that the same society coddles ANYONE who whines... <br>
<br>
Hell, we all know the game can be addictive. Most of us could probably find something more productive to do with the time we spend playing EQ, but if it brings anyone a little enjoyment in this nasty world, who cares...<br>
<br>
And to my fellow news/media people: there's a guy with a gun in Maryland. There's a war brewing over Iraq. Somewhere in this country a baby is starving to death tonight. Can we find something more significant to talk about? Please? Please...? Oh, wait -- 400,000 people play EQ, and starving babies don't watch 48 Hours. Ratings ploy, anyone?

The mother specifically said (but I'll misquote her so I'll paraphrase instead) 'He killed himself because of that game,' and 'Something terrible happened in that game that made him kill himself' repeatedly. I don't know how she knows that because she didn't even talk to her son very much (he was a recluse, so they say), but she made this big deal over how he was dead in front of his computer with 'That damn game!' on the screen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utherisiamorningdewfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TherisiaMorningdewFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ambition Starts Early</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/19/02 2:26:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1588.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kaolla-su.net/~shinobu/shinchan8.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hm</span><hr size=1> Well I suppose that's my point; if she didn't spend time with him, how the hell does <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> she</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> know??
