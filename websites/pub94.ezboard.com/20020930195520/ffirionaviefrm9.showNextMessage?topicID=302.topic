If it weren't EQ maybe it'd be Books, Paper'n Pencil RPG, or any other passions...<br>

I have been seening stories like this for more than 20 years.  Just last week we had 3 people from Colorado, a 23 year old male and two 19 year old females were found dead on a private beach, just over the hill, in Santa Cruz.  Was a murder-suicide.  The guy appearantly killed the girls then shot himslef.  The only quote they had from the guys BEST friend was he used to play Dungeons and Dragons.  Like that had anything to do with what happened.  <br>
<br>
Same thing with this guy.  I mean one EQ player, out of what 450K+ subscribers, commits suicide and its because he played EQ.  Nothing to do with the fact that he was diagnosed with Schizophenia, lived alone, and had little if any social contact outside playing EQ.  I wonder how he paid for his appartment and the month EQ bill, if he wasnt working.<br>
<br>
Its not just families looking for someone/something to place blame on.  A lot of it has to do with how the media chooses to portray RPGs and RPG players.  While most stories dont outright claim RPGs cause these problems,  they use language that implies a causal relationship, that has no factual evidence.  Lord, I hate the media!!<br>
<br>
Guess Im not playing enough EQ.  I can actually think logically.<br>
<br>
/step of soapbox<br>
<br>
Rant is over. Now back to playing EQ and  not writing my term papers.<br>

I mean the guy most definitely had problems and killed himself, but all the people in the threads do are make comments about how he was a fat loser and should die, etc... <br>
<br>
Who knows, EQ might have ruined him in some way we don't get from the story, we've all seen people who's marriages were ruined by Everquest and we all know addicts of Everquest, this guy is just another in that category who took his own like instead of seeking help.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the mother should sue, or should even have considered it.  In a suicide like this, the first to be blamed should be those close to the person, and in this case, it would be the parents or the mother.  They did not bring it up with their son and now she needs a scapegoat to cover her own inadequacy (sic?) as a parent.<br>
<br>
It's a sad incident, but Everquest, like everything else that is addictive, can lead some over the edge.  The only difference with Everquest is you can stop, it doesn't cause a chemical imbalance that makes your body crave it more and more unless it's some sort of crazy psychopatic experience, by which I mean the person is a schizophrene (sic?), otherwise, nothing about EQ should be able to cause an addiction so bad you have to kill yourself to escape it.<br>
<br>
Either way, please don't mock the poor fellow for what he did, if people consider suicide the only way out, it's their choice.  It's not the right choice, but it also doesn't give reason to make fun of that person. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A> at: 4/2/02 8:59:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaeonii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeonii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/immortalkindred/images/colors.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/2/02 9:56:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=287.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EQ-related suicide?</span><hr size=1> /mourn<br>

We can never know what goes on in someone's head, we cant associate with their feelings all we can do is react. I am deeply sadden by his death. The only thing I even remotely think that Varant/ Sony on line should have done was released his records right away to the authorities. This link can also be found on www.Fark.com.<br>

<br>
Doing such things would/could only hurt Sony/Verant.  And if they make an exception to the privacy policy they already have in place then it will open the door to other exceptions or will just cause them more problems when others make similar requests.<br>
<br>
It is obvious the boy's mother is sad and angry and &quot;she is out for blood&quot;.  From a strategic point of view, the best thing for Sony is to ignore it, and let it pass.  She wants someone to be responsible for her son's death.  It is easy to point fingers at EQ since he spent much of his time with it and it was something she did not understand.<br>
<br>
Whether EQ is addictive is all relative.  People DECIDE to spend more time doing things which give them enjoyment and pleasure.  If there is not a chemical dependancy, then any addictive-like behavior can not be blamed on the object of the addiction but rather on the decisions of the user.<br>
<br>
Heck, if our bodies did not have to rest and muscle soreness was not an issue, I imagine we would have a major global problem with sex addiction.  :^)<br>
