Well, here is my little theory about the story. As an agnostic, i decided to left the mystical things of Matrix and consider the problem in the computer side.<br>
<br>
Let us see the Matrix as a sphere, it's the inner Matrix. As most of computer programs, there are bugs. So we need to redirect exceptions of this program somewhere &quot;Real World&quot; which is a a layer of our sphere. When Neo at the end can feel the sentinels, he says &quot;Something is different&quot; and stop them. He knows now that he is in another matrix and become an exception of this second matrix. So the system throw him off this layer to a third layer or the real &quot;Real world&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now the &quot;Why?&quot; Suppose you want to find someone &quot;special&quot; between billions of individuals. You create a trial &quot;the matrix&quot;. Now you create a wonderful story with Oracle, Prophecy etc.... Only people who success this trial will be allowed to go to level 2 &quot;Zion&quot;. This second trial will be more difficult (life conditions are really awful) so you will find your elite then bingo level .<br>
<br>
In the film at the end Neo and Smith are in coma, they are the only ones who understood that it wasnt the real world.<br>
<br>
I know my explanations arent very clear. But consider architect and oracle as Operating system, they have CONTROL. The only thing im not sure is about Ghost, he is near Neo in power, and appear as gold code when Neo look at him (maybe a programmer? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I think Warshowsky brothers want to fool us with mystical things, dont forget Matrix is control over mind, oracle is constantly manipulating Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, and i think they try to control us to make us look at a direction and they will surprise us with the end, and i love that idea.<br>
<br>
What do you think if it's only  a video game at the end ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I don't think that Zion exists in another Matrix on top of the Matrix that they are freed from, for two reasons:  1) some Matrix insiders, including Joel Silver I believe, said there are no &quot;boxes in boxes&quot; and 2) if the &quot;Real World&quot; was just more programming, Smith would have replicated himself and/or changed his appearance to that of Smith.<br>
<br>
In the &quot;Real World&quot; Smith is constrained by the realities of physicality and cannot change things as he does in the world of the Matrix.<br>
<br>
As for the relationship between the Oracle and the Architect:  remember, not all machines are ambivalent towards humans, indeed some of them cherish humans as the creators of the machines.  The Architect built the Matrix, and when the anomoly arose (which he was unable to eliminate) he allows the Oracle to ply her prophecy program so that the One and the liberated humans of Zion are ultimately destroyed such that the Matrix is rebooted, it all starts again and the machines can keep using people as batteries.<br>
<br>
You mention &quot;Ghost&quot;.  You're referring to the character in the video game.  The character you are referring to in the movie is &quot;Seraph&quot;.  Despite your being agnostic and choosing to ignore the spiritual implications of the Matrix - of which there are many spiritual, philsophical and religious symbols - the Wachowski brothers have many spiritual devices in the movie.  A seraph or seraphim represents the highest order of angels, which also ties into Seraph's gold code coloration as angels are often spoken of as coming in glory or appearing in light etc...  <br>
<br>
If you recall what Seraph stated &quot;I guard that which is most important&quot; and the fact that he was able to access all of those backdoor with just one key (even the Keymaster needed a bunch of them), I think it's safe to say that Seraph is definitely a higher power, something of a guardian angel.<br>
<br>
The puzzling thing is the end sequence with Neo stopping the sentinels and whatever happened to Smith's avatar in the real world.  Guess we'll have to wait until November to find out!<br>

The sentinel's, I can't explain.  As for smith's avatar, if you remember he was the loan survivor of the initial contact between the ships and the sentinels.  How he survived, is not important in the least, and I doubt anything really happened to him.  What is important, rather, is that now he's on the same ship with an comatose Neo, and so has somewhat free-reign to finish him off once and for all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=whistlerfv>Whistler FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mod in disguise</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/21/03 11:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeeeeaah ...  8^p</span><hr size=1> All explained.

Thats about the only thing I cant find an explination for, either in logic or in technology. Neo basicly released an EMP blast from his body, thus he shut down the sentinels. That alone makes me, gruedglingly(sp) mind you, accept that there might be another Matrix. But then I look at Smiths avatar, nice way to explain it by the way, and see that he had no true powers outside of the Matrix. That he is confined in the body of the man he took. <br>
<br>
There are so many questions, so many holes that are open. One of the reasons I left the movie going..&quot;huh?&quot;. November seems a long, long way off.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aadyntasurdyr>Aadyn Tasurdyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/21/03 2:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=26>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~jonparadiso/images/clericanim02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeeeeaah ...  8^p</span><hr size=1> This has become quite an interesting discussion, because it revolves around the same opposing forces that drive the &quot;moral&quot; of the film. Namely, it is not the content of one’s life (as thought of as the choices we make and the ability or lack thereof to make those choices) but rather the reason we live it (both the Oracle and the Architect instruct Neo that the most important question is why). <br>
<br>
How are we to understand Neo's apparent powers outside of the Matrix, where he is supposedly free and thus, merely human. It is true that a possible explanation is that the reality of Zion and Neo's world outside the Matrix might also be a Matrix in a way, a set of defined rules and laws, which govern the physical laws of the dimension. While I think that this twist would make for an interesting conclusion to the trilogy, I have to wonder about something else. <br>
<br>
The Architect seems to intimate that Neo's powers and abilities inside the Matrix are somehow pre-ordained. The Architect also implies that Neo’s ability to influence the code of the Matrix is some sort of latent gift, one that no mathematical formula could accurately predict or quantify. From where exactly then does this ability derive? It cannot be somehow imprinted onto an individual by the Matrix itself, as, if such were the case, the potential for such abilities would be systematically bred out of the gene pool. It can merely be contained, by limiting the number of choices available to the One. If that is true, then Neo’s powers in the Matrix must be somehow genetically inborn. To a certain degree, this fact is implied by some of the script in the first Matrix, with references to Anderson always feeling like he has been looking for something and even some of the psychically gifted children in the Oracle’s apartment.<br>
<br>
The acceptance of this fact would lead one to understand Neo as a superhero figure, born with a unique ability to influence reality in the Matrix and perform godlike tasks. <br>
<br>
If it is possible then for a human to possess the innate ability to telepathically modify a reality governed by the set of laws defined as the Matrix, why then is it not possible for a human to possess the innate ability to telepathically modify a reality governed by the set of laws defined as Reality? Why does it have to be another Matrix for Neo to be able to use his powers? Perhaps his powers also extend to the outside world as well. Perhaps he is not merely superhuman in the Matrix, but he is superhuman in every sense of the word.<br>
<br>
The Architect’s soliloquy in the Monitor Room points to the fact that while the Matrix cannot adequately quantify the impact of chaos, it can set up a system of control over the expected consequences (forcing the One into a dire choice of genocide or servitude). The anomaly, or rather the chaos effect, for which the Architect seems to have designed his trap to prevent, can thus be understood as evolution. Neo’s superhuman ability is an evolutionary reaction to the potential extinction of his species. <br>
<br>
 Leaving the important question regarding his destruction of the Sentinels aside for a moment, and focusing on Neo’s ability, the path that the film’s narrative has set for us begs to ask the question, why? Why was Neo born with these powers? Whether or not, or however he chooses to use them is a moot point in a sense. He has no choice.<br>
<br>
The answer to why Neo chooses to do what he chooses to do is, quite simply put, Love. While I am will not go into the specifics of that thesis now, I think that the Matrix, at its heart is a love story. Neo’s moment of self-realization, and thus, the continuation of his path to enlightenment, is when he chooses to save Trinity rather than save the human race.<br>

<br>
Neo knew that Trinity would die. He saw it in his dreams. The very start of the movie shows Trinity dying. He knew all along. <br>
<br>
Neo is diffrent from the past incarnations of the One because of his love for Trinity. The Architect said that the others had a moral &quot;code&quot; written into them so they would choose to keep the cycle going. Machines destroy Zion and it starts again. But Neo loves, there for he is an anomaly inside an anomaly. <br>
<br>
I dont think any of us can honestly explain HOW Neo stoped the sentinels. At the moment, it just is. <br>
<br>
Oh, and on a side note. <br>

<br>
However I am faced with a puzzling question:<br>
<br>
The Architect presents Neo with two choices:  1 - one door foresakes Trinity in order to &quot;save&quot; Zion and 2 - the other door seeks to save Trinity but foresakes the whole of Neo's race (both those in the Matrix and those in Zion).<br>
<br>
The question is this:  what was the other choice that the previous One's had to make if none of the previous One's were confronted by love?<br>
<br>
While the Oracle states in the first film that Neo will fall in love, it is also stated in Reload that the previous One's DID NOT have to deal with making a choice over a loved one...hence I am confused as to what the Architect's choices would have been for the previous One's...<br>
<br>
Now, in regards to the Architect's confidence that Neo would foresake Trinity to save Zion, it makes perfect sense.  On a logical level, the Architect is the perfect computer, who seeks and is governed by logic, mathematics and reason.  On a moral level, the parallel between Satan and the Architect has also been made.  On either level (as Satan or a computer), the Architect (nor any machine for that matter) would truly understand the implications of love.  <br>
<br>
The Architect improperly predicts Neo's reaction to the choice (remember, he talks about the emotional build-up that Neo is feeling, the feeling that he must foresake Trinity and that she is already dead), because to a logical or diabolic entity, sacrificing all of humanity for the sake of one person is completely illogical.<br>
<br>
That is the turning point for Neo in comparison to the other One's.  The other One's made the &quot;logical&quot; choice, which is the gaurded path of the Matrix itself, and accordingly never step beyond the bonds of control imposed by the machines.  By embracing love and sacrificing everything for the sake of love, Neo's evolves spiritually - this has been likened to Christ sacrificing himself for the love of humanity (despite the temptations that Satan presented him), which in turn lead to the salvation of himself and all of humanity.<br>
<br>
Whether the 3rd installment expands on that aspect of it...who knows.  There is religious parable throughout the story of the Matrix, and there is no uncertainty that Neo = Christ on the certain level.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the the secret to how Neo EMP'd the squids relates to Smith.  The two are the Ying and Yang of the Matrix and are becoming ever more, inexorably tied together.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, I can see the two of them coming to some sort of reconcilliation that will be pivotal to the freedom of man and machine from a mutual relationship of slavery, into one of harmony.<br>

<br>
At this point, I don't necessarily agree with the author's assertion that the Architect actually wanted Neo to choose Trinity, although it is plausible considering the Architect/Satan theorem whereby da Debil would want everyone to burn in flames =oP<br>
<br>
Here is a transcript of the Architect's conversation with Neo...it doesn't seem to reveal that such was the Architect's intention:<br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
A: Hello Neo.<br>
<br>
N: Who are you?<br>
<br>
A: I am the architect. I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and though the process has altered your consciousness, you remain revocably human, ergo some of my answers you will understand and some of them you will not. Concordinantly while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize that it is the most irrelevant.<br>
<br>
N: Why am I here?<br>
<br>
A: Your life is the sum of the remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomoly which, despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. Or that remains a burden asiduously avoided it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control, which has led you inexorably here.<br>
<br>
N: You haven't answered the question.<br>
<br>
A: Quite right. Interesting.. that was quicker than the others. <br>
<br>
(( other neos murmur ))<br>
<br>
A: The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next in which case this is the sixth version.<br>
<br>
(( other neos murmur, some laugh, one says 'two possible explanations.. either no one told me.. (picture blends into the actual Neo standing there) )<br>
<br>
N: ..or no one knows.<br>
<br>
A: Precisely... As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations...<br>
<br>
(( other neos yell out, some cursing ))<br>
<br>
N: ...Choice. The problem is a choice.<br>
<br>
[ scene change: Trinity sees an agent in the elevator, fight ensues ]<br>
[ scen change: back to the architect's room ]<br>
<br>
A: The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect -- it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherited in every human being. As I redesigned it based on your history, to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature, however I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another -- an intuitive program initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the Father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.<br>
<br>
N: The oracle.<br>
<br>
A: Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99% of all test subjects accepted the program as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice on an unconscious level. While this adds a function, it is obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refuse the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.<br>
<br>
N: This is about Zion...<br>
<br>
A: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated...<br>
<br>
N: Bull****!<br>
<br>
(( other neos chime in with 'bull****' in overlapping fractions of a second ))<br>
<br>
A: Denial is the most predictable of all human responses, but, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it...<br>
<br>
[ scene change: Trinity fighting the agent again. ]<br>
[ scene change: back to the Architect Room. ]<br>
<br>
A: (audio cut out)..enter the source allowing a temporary dissemination of the code reinserting the prime program, after which you will be required to select from the Matrix twenty three individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which, coupled with the extermination of Zion, will ultimately result in the extinction of the ENITRE human race.<br>
<br>
N: You won't let it happen -- you can't -- you need human beings to survive.<br>
<br>
A: There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However the relevant issue is whether YOU are ready to accept responsibility for the death of every human being in this world. (pause) It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication in contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of 'the one'. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis a vis... Love. (taps his pen-remote)<br>
<br>
N: Trinity!<br>
<br>
A: Apropot!(sp?) She entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.<br>
<br>
N: ...no...<br>
<br>
A: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction -- the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason -- an emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth -- she is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.<br>
<br>
(( neo walks to his left, the movie viewer's right, and all of the other Neos in the screens all walk in the same direction ))<br>
<br>
A: Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.<br>
<br>
N: If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.<br>
<br>
A: We won't.<br>

The Meruvingian is very much like Hades, the holder of the Keys to the underworld (the Core). Which would mean the Architect himself is akin to Satan, who according to Gnostic theology also created the world to imprison mankind.<br>
<br>
I agree with the opinion that the machines are in actuality hoping for the destruction of mankind, as it is something they are not capable of doing themselves. It reminds me of the scene where the councillor is talking to Neo about the machines. The humans built and control them, but they cannot live without them. In effect, destroying those machines would subject the humans to a level of existence that is *not* acceptable to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enheduannalia>EnheduannaLia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/03 8:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Matrix Reloaded</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the transcript, Kurley.

<br>
But based on what was said in the conversation, he did choose the destruction of the human race, and so did the others.  As the transcipt shows, by entering the source, he would again have to choose 13 survivors to rebuild Zion (which completely makes no sense given the timeline of the movie, unless we assume they are much, much further in the future than 2199), the code would reset and the cycle would repeat.  Rather, he chooses to enter the matrix and save Trinity. Now, if we are to assume the &quot;Neo's&quot; on the screens behind him are the previous 4 incarnations of the one, they all make the same choice and head to the door on his left, leading to the matrix, and as the Architect says, the destruction of the human race.(At least I remember his previous selves heading in the same direction.  If they didn't, ignore the rest of the argument.)  <br>
<br>
So, are we to assume that the doors were switched this time, explaining why the other's headed to the same door?  Or rather they also chose to reenter the matrix, the entire human race that was attached to the matrix died in a cataclysmic system crash and the bots had to start from scratch growing new ones?  Or rather, the architect is full of crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     (Or the brother's overlooked this, and it will be corrected in the DVD release).  Personally, I think there's some truth to the 3rd.  <br>
<br>
The architect wasn't expecting Neo, and was hoping he'd be wiped out prior to his arrival.  However, against all odds, he wasn't, and the architect now has to bluff Neo into NOT entering the source or the machines are toast.  How to do this?  Manipulate the system to give him a choice he can't make...sacrificing Trinity, and bluffing by saying to enter the source is to allow the machines to continue enslaving the humans.  Contrary to the thoughts in the essay, the machines do know humans are unpredictable, driven more by their emotions, and count on him choosing Trinity over the source.  By manipulating Neo, the architect has him choose not to enter the source, and prevents Neo from winning at this point.  Personally, I believe if he had entered the source, it would have been game over for the machines and there wouldn't have been a 3rd movie.<br>
<br>
The other thing that drives me to this conclusion is this:  If the machines know 1% won't accept the program, and it's pretty easy for them to tell which don't (they wake up and are subsequently flushed), why allow this at all.  What point is there in allowing them to escape?  If those that don't accept upset the program from within, just get rid of them.  Machine logic should be able to figure this one out.  When they detect one that's not accepting the program: Eliminate, reduce, recycle.  In the first matrix, as soon as Neo wakes a robot moves into detach him, why not just squish him then and there?  The argument that the machines' programing doesn't allow it is hogwash, as clearly they have no problem killing humans throughout the rest of the 1st and 2nd movie. (of course, this also means there wouldn't be a movie at all, so there needs to be a few truck sized plot holes in the movies...)<br>
<br>
So, either there's a few major inconistencies that need to be cleared up either in the DVD, or explained in the 3rd movie, or the Architect is bluffing throughout the entire scene, and Neo (Being Keanu after all...) falls for it, hook, line and sinker. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaelyndimathe>Jaelyn DiMathe</A> at: 5/22/03 10:53:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurley>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 769<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/03 10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeeeeaah ...  8^p</span><hr size=1> &quot;The other thing that drives me to this conclusion is this: If the machines know 1% won't accept the program, and it's pretty easy for them to tell which don't (they wake up and are subsequently flushed), why allow this at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Two theories:<br>
<br>
1 - presuming that Zion is still within the Matrix (i.e. not really real), then the whole One Prophecy and Zion are just another form of control to catch that percentage of the population that rejects the &quot;1999 Matrix&quot;.  While the Architect cannot control who or when rejects the program, they can exercise control over where those people go.  So rather than having these &quot;rebels&quot; going this way and that, they all funnel into yet another program of control.<br>
<br>
2 - presuming that Zion is in fact the real world, then again the aim is to funnel those who reject the &quot;1999 Matrix&quot; into an area where they can be contained and dealt with.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have a difficult time with the concept that a real Zion has been destroyed and rebuilt 5 times - there are too many flaws with that concept (technology development, population growth, etc...) within the rough timeframe presented.  I suppose if the machines secretly aided in the restructuring of Zion, that might explain it, but it seems a little far fetched - even for the Matrix.<br>
<br>
I don't think that Zion being within the Matrix is unreasonable, but that presents the problem of &quot;where does it end?&quot;.<br>
<br>
When you get down to it, you'll find holes with any storyline like this because it presents the fantastic (i.e. based on our understanding of science and energy, humans would serve as LOUSY power sources, but it makes a cool story) so sometimes you just gotta go with it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaelyndimathe>Jaelyn DiMathe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Truth</span><br>  Posts: 495<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/03 11:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://myweb.cableone.net/agunders/jae.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeeeeaah ...  8^p</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1 - presuming that Zion is still within the Matrix (i.e. not really real), then the whole One Prophecy and Zion are just another form of control to catch that percentage of the population that rejects the &quot;1999 Matrix&quot;. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I thought of this too, but interviews with the brothers all seem to suggest this isn't an option (one speaks to this and says there are no &quot;boxes within boxes&quot;.  So, unless he's feeding us BS, Zion is in the Realworld.<br>

Why funnel at all?  That's just wasted resources and effort for the machines.  Allowing them to live, then having to deal with them later isn't logical.  Just snuff them and move on.<br>

That's why I think the Architect is full of crap, or the brothers just didn't think out the ramifications of this history.  Having 13 people rebuild Zion (and not just once, but 5 times...), while freeing others, fighting the machines, etc..., isn't realistic give time constraints, technology, etc... (or it's much, much later than 2199)  And if the machines are secretly helping them, just to destroy it all later, that again is a HUGE waste of resources.  Not a logical action at all, and not one I could see the machines making.<br>

Actually, it was like 23 people. 16 women and 7 men. Of course, I am in total agreement with the numbers. I dont see how Zion could go from 23 people and breed/rescue 250,000 in 100 years or so. Doesnt make much sense. Of course, if 1% of the population rejects the program and they are &quot;freed&quot; by the rebels, 1% of the worlds population is like..500,000 people or something? My math is prolly off. <br>

I really am enjoying this thread. It really adds ALOT to the movie and answers alot of my questions <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurley>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 771<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/03 1:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeeeeaah ...  8^p</span><hr size=1> Here is a good explanation (from Matrix discussion thread on FoH) of *why* the machines keep humanity around:<br>
<br>
Understanding why things are the way they are requires an understanding of another holy text: Asimov's Laws of Robotics. The machines, as demonstrated by Smith's need to try to kill Neo even after being &quot;freed,&quot; don't have free will. (Likewise, in various theologies, angels and other such divine beings also don't have free will—only humans do.) The bit about the machines needing human bio-energy to survive, as Morpheus (the dreamer) explained in the first movie, is bullshit. The machines keep humanity alive but imprisoned, even after taking over the world, because they were created to serve people. In other words, the machines would like to destroy humanity, but they CAN'T. Instead, they need a human to make the choice.&quot;<br>
<br>
This idea puts the Architect's speech to Neo and the choices he presents him in a different light. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1566.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1566.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showMessageRange?topicID=1566.topic&start=61&stop=76>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=1566.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=1566.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1566.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=1566.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1566.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1566.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
