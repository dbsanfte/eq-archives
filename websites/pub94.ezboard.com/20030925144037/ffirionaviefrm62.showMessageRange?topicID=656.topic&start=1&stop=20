I'm glad this guy isn't taking down the monument.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because I'm certain the Supreme Court is going to tell him the same, and then it will apply nationwide rather than his backwater state.<br>
<br>
We have the same kinda thing going on in my hometown (10 commandments on display outside a courthouse).   This is nice cuz it means I don't have to protest... I can just wait till Supreme Court takes care of things for me.<br>
<br>
/kicks back in recliner and puts up feet.<br>
<br>
My thanks go out to this judge, for having the arrogance to try and push his case further, only to have it backfire and affect every person just like him.<br>

Seperation is meant to prevent the establishment of a religion that is the sole recognized religion of the country.<br>

Having the 10 commandments sitting out there by themselves in the rotunda in a huge slab of stone is tantamount to saying &quot;The law used in this courthouse is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the law of god!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Obey ye heathens!&quot;<br>

The Alabama courts struck him down in a unanimous decision, and it's not like Alabama is some dark lair of godless liberals.  The guy's a moron for thinking the Supreme Court of the nation is going to be more open to this.

PS: A lot of states have stone slabs with 10 commandments on them outside or inside their public buildings.  Know how they got there?  Hollywood!  The director of the 10 commandments movie &amp; the Fraternal Order of Eagles made a bunch of them and donated them to cities across the country.

I dont think anyone was bashing Christianity, but rather putting forth an interesting concept.<br>
<br>
With all of the rampant church and state and school prayer nonsense going on, that is going to be an argument that comes to the forefront.  What do they do when the other major religions wish to have the same rights to display their symbols?<br>
<br>
Now I know in Cincinnati, at Christmas time - they allow every religion to have a &quot;display&quot;.  Of course you have your Christmas tree, the pagans bring a yule log, and so forth.  The thing that sickens most people is that the KKK will erect their &quot;cross&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I am getting off point here.  If you give freedom to one religion, you should consider giving freedom to the other religions as they all have a right to worship.  Perhaps having the ten commandments on a monument in your Court is a way to show that God is the Law, and perhaps it borders on the whole church/state argument.  I personally could give a crap less, but stupidly felt the need to interject that I don't think anyone was bashing Christianity.<br>

A lot of the founding fathers were Deists (sp).<br>

I don't care if someone who signed the constitution loved Jesus... I don't need a 10 foot statue of him on the steps of the courthouse.  You want a Christian State than move to Ireland.<br>
<br>
This country was not founded on Christianity, it was founded on the concept of a safe haven for those who wanted to practice their religion (or lack thereof) without fear of government intrusion (among other concepts).  <br>
<br>
It's not Christian bashing to say that Judeo-Christian law has no place in the law of the US.  The Law of the US should ensure the proper function of society, protection of it's members, etc.  If that ends up being in common with Judeo-Christian law... woo hoo, great.  But just because God came down and gave Moses some tablets doesn't mean the US should be run on those principles.  Graven images and having no god before God and etc have jack shit to do with the function of the US government.<br>

&quot;In god we trust&quot; is devoid of support of one religion or another.<br>
<br>
Although the phrase does support a person believing in a god (of some kind or another), it's pretty damn blind as to who's god.  I think &quot;In the value of the dollar we trust&quot; is probably more appropriate considering the values of this country, but whatever.<br>
<br>
Having the 10 commandments however screams specific support of Judeo-Christian faiths.<br>

<br>
The country was created in a time when Athieism wasn't very widespread (compared to where it's at today).  Is it possible to conceive that the spirit of the laws call for respect of the rights of those who do not wish to worship any god as much as it does the rights of those who do?<br>

Or should me and Shintou and Dom go slap some chains around our ankles and go farm up some cotton for ya since that was probably where some founding fathers thought that people of African descent should be?<br>

First of all, the few men who wrote the documents might have been simply diests, but the core of america, is, and has been from the beginning, a very christian(Mostly protestant) nation.<br>
<br>
Papists(catholics) were, at the least, looked down upon(at the most, it was illegal for a catholic to own land in the colonies) at the beginning of our nation.  The Quakers were looked at oddly, and witches were still burned at the stake(along with anyone else they could throw to the flames, but that part's neither here, nor there.)<br>

Joseph Smith(founder of the mormon church) was run out of town, thrown in jail, beaten, and generally illtreated because of the religion he started in the early 1800's(I think that's the right dates. Been too long since I saw church haha)<br>

We know right off the bat it would be 4-3 with Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Souter siding against Scalia, Thomas, and Rehnquist. The two wildcards would, as usual, be Kennedy and O'Connor. Based on his prior rulings, Kennedy has always asserted that the principle of separation of church and state was intended only to bar the establishment of a national religeon. So then we are left 4-4 with O'Connor being the deciding vote. This is not such an done deal anymore is it? Now based on past experience I would put Justice O'Connor solidly into pro-separation corner, but she always seems to break ranks when the issue deals with government funding of religion (such as vouchers). Justice O'Connor has always been incredibly tough to predict. More than once she has expressed views that seem contradictory, and she prides herself on judging one case at a time, keeping precedents in mind, but focusing on the specific facts in each case.<br>

Aside from the First Commandment, it doesn't contain anything that is not also reflected in US law.  I also don't believe it is a violation of the establishment clause, as long as Judges elsewhere have the right to place similar items of other cultures/religions as they see fit.<br>

I am assuming that the Chief Judge is empowered to make decisions regarding the decoration of the Courthouse, otherwise this is moot.<br>

<br>
I am a man and I cannot bear the though that a man could not, in fact, be Justice.  Also, how do we know that Justice is a woman, given that no one has actually met Justice?<br>
<br>
Likewise, depicting Justice as blind is offensive to deaf people.  Why does Justice have to be blind but cannot be deaf?  Why can't we have a statue of Justice that looks like a man holding his hands up to his ears?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah...because he couldn't hold those scales...that's why.  Then again, who needs antiquated see-saw scales when he could be holding a more compact, more modern weight measuring device?  But wait, why the hell does Justice need to physically weigh something?<br>
<br>
Wow...this whole statue of Justice as a blind woman holding see-saw scales is becoming more and more ridiculous isn't it?  I guess we should do away with all of those statues and maybe just put up a blank block of stone so that we don't have any semblace or symbol or imagery of where Justice came from and what it aims to acheive.  Just let people look at the blank block of stone and project their own image of what &quot;Justice&quot; is on the rock.<br>
<br>
That should do it.<br>

Is the goal to remove morality from these places altogether?  Or is it to replace it with a morality that everyone can agree on?  The latter will <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">never</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> happen.<br>
<br>
That’s the problem with moral relativism.  Who is the ultimate judge of what is right and what is wrong?  Society?  Ok… which society?  You local community?  Your state?  Your country?  And how, exactly, do you propose to establish such judgment?  Do you honestly believe that everyone can agree on what is right and what is wrong?  Hell no!  Someone will always disagree!  And who’s to judge if the one in disagreement is having his or her rights infringed upon?  So, where does that leave us?  Do we determine right and wrong by popular opinion?  Well, guess what?  That’s what we already have!  The majority world view in this country is based on Judeo-Christian dogma.  And that’s where the country gets its morality.  Get over it!<br>
<br>
The problem with moral relativism is that its logic is circular.<br>
