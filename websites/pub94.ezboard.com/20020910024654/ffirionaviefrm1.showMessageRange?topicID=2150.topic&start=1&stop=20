You could RP healing/buffing them all you like, but codewise you wouldn't be helping them at all. You can dispel them, and that would get you in trouble with the GMs if you were intentionally dispelling someone's debuffs. Training other guards on them is also punishable. No amount of &quot;I was RPing&quot; justification is enough to get around the basic rules of the game.<br><br>So, yeah, if you wanted to do something to actively stop them, you could duel them, and that's about it.

It seems obvious to me that you are INTENDED to fight with them.<br><br>Seriously, if you are fighting in a zone with these Guards, and would rely on them for protection, you are under level 10 most likely.  This means even if you die you lose no XP and no CR.  I don't have a lot of sympathy if you can't deal with that.  It isn't like anyone is killing the Guards AT THE LIFT who are buffed to hell and back.  They are killing wandering Guards that you couldn't run to because they aren't in a set place.

It's one thing to knock off guard so and so, wandering the forest of Faydark.<br><br>It's another thing to roleplay that your 1-man army somehow snuck past the gate guards, and is wrecking havoc inside the city limits with no opposition from the other guards.  Realistically speaking, the guards would call for backup, and the whole militia barracks would unload on you.  <br><br>Do I think it's bad form to kill city guards?  No, dive in, I just don't think it shows a lot of roleplay unless you're raiding a city with a sizable force.  <br><br>With the new changes to newbies, killing off the garden guards isn't as high impacting as it once was.  Dying to newbies is like a free health &amp; mana restore.
