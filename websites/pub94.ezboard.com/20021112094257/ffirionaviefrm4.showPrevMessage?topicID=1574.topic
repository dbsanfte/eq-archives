<br>
Dear Cretins: <br>
<br>
I have been an NTL customer since 9th July 2001, when I signed up for your 3-in-one deal for cable TV, cable modem, and telephone. <br>
<br>
During this three-month period I have encountered inadequacy of service which I had not previously considered possible, as well as ignorance and stupidity of monolithic proportions. <br>
<br>
Please allow me to provide specific details, so that you can either pursue your professional prerogative, and seek to rectify these difficulties - or more likely (I suspect) so that you can have some entertaining reading material as you while away the working day smoking B&amp;H and drinking vendor-coffee on the bog in your office. <br>
<br>
My initial installation was canceled without warning or notice, resulting in my spending an entire Saturday sitting on my fat arse waiting for your technician to arrive. When he did not arrive at all, I spent a further 57 minutes listening to your infuriating hold music, and the even more annoying Scottish robot woman telling me to look at your helpful website.... how? I alleviated the boredom to some small degree by playing with my testicles for a few minutes - an activity at which you are no doubt both familiar and highly adept. <br>
<br>
The rescheduled installation then took place some two weeks later, although the technician did forget to bring a number of vital tools-such as a drill bit, and his cerebrum. <br>
<br>
Two weeks later, my cable modem had still not arrived. After several further telephone calls (actually 15 telephone calls over 4 weeks) my modem arrived a total of six weeks after I had requested it, and begun to pay for it. I estimate that the downtime of your internet servers is roughly 35%...these are usually the hours between about 6pm and midnight, Monday to Friday, and most of the useful periods over the weekend. <br>
<br>
I am still waiting for my telephone connection. I have made 9 telephone calls on my mobile to your no-help line this week, and have been unhelpfully transferred to a variety of disinterested individuals, who are it seems also highly skilled bollock jugglers. I have been informed that a telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that no telephone line is available (and someone will call me back); that I will be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is available (and then been cut off); that I will be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is available (and then been redirected to an answer machine informing me that your office is closed); that I will be transferred to someone who knows whether or not a telephone line is available (and then been redirected to the irritating Scottish robot woman...and several other variations on this theme. <br>
<br>
Doubtless you are no longer reading this letter, as you have at least a thousand other dissatisfied customers to ignore, and also another one of those crucially important testicle moments to attend to. Frankly I don't care, it's far more satisfying as a customer to voice my frustrations in print than to shout them at your unending hold music. Forgive me, therefore, if I continue. <br>
<br>
I thought BT were shit, that they had attained the holy piss-pot of god-awful customer relations, that no one, anywhere, ever, could be more disinterested, less helpful or more obstructive to delivering service to their customers. That's why I chose NTL, and because, well, there isn't anyone else is there? <br>
<br>
How surprised I therefore was, when I discovered to my considerable dissatisfaction and disappointment what a useless shower of bastards you truly are. You are sputum-filled pieces of distended rectum - incompetents of the highest order. British Telecom - wankers though they are - shine like brilliant beacons of success, in the filthy puss-filled mire of your seemingly limitless inadequacy. <br>
<br>
Suffice to say that I have now given up on my futile and foolhardy quest to receive any kind of service from you. I suggest that you do likewise, and cease any potential future attempts to extort payment from me for the services which you have so pointedly and catastrophically failed to deliver - any such activity will be greeted initially with hilarity and disbelief - although these feelings will quickly be replaced by derision, and even perhaps a small measure of bemused rage. <br>
<br>
I enclose two small deposits, selected with great care from my cats litter tray, as a statement of my utter and complete contempt for both you and your pointless company. I sincerely hope that they have not become desiccated during transit - they were satisfyingly moist at the time of posting, and I would feel considerable disappointment if you did not experience both their rich aroma and delicate texture. Consider them the very embodiment of my feelings towards NTL, and it's worthless employees. <br>
<br>
Have a nice day - may it be the last in your miserable short life, you irritatingly incompetent and infuriatingly unhelpful bunch of twats.  <p>Mylodi ScarlettFyre, Bard of 45 cycles<br><br>

<br>
I mean, yeah, they do things that make NO FARGIN' SENSE WHATSOEVER sometimes, and as I sit here, patching the optional patches after having to unisntall eq from my D drive, and reinstall it to my C drive, all because one file from the new PoP patcher was refusing to go to my D drive like a nice little file should, I still think they're not so bad.<br>
<br>
I Mean CS at the very least <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> pretends</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be interested, and more often than not, in my limited experience with them at least tries to get things set right.<br>
<br>
And while, yesterday, as I was reinstalling eq for the second time that day, I'd have likely hopped that letter off in a heartbeat lol I just think sometimes we all forget that, at least some of the folks there, just work there, and really do try to do their jobs.<br>
<br>
It's the coders I have issue with cuz I can't imagine bardsongs being such an integrated part of the underlying game structure, that they can't change ANYTHING without breaking the poor bards lol <p><center><b><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner">Sarhea Yigsawla</a></b><br><i>Another taste of the evil I breathe,<br>

<br>
It was pretty pathetic before that imho and in the opinion of many others, at least according to various polls I read where people were asked to rate what they felt was the biggest weakness in the game, and CS almost inevitably lead the way by a vast margin.<br>
<br>
I even knew people who were planning on not buying Star Wars because the CS of EQ was so slack they didnt feel like dealing with another game initiated by the same company.<br>
<br>
My &quot;conspiracy&quot; theory is that Sony realized there was going to be a more competative gaming market out there soon, what with all the new MMORPGs coming out over the next year, and decided they finally better do something about it.<br>
