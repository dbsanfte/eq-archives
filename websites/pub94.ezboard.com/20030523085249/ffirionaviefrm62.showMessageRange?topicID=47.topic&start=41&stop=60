  From the initial post, I get the impression that your friend may have gotten a touch of the Susan Sarandon/Dead Man Walking syndrome.  After communicating with the guy for so long, she probably has a bit of an emotional attachment to him.  So of course, she is going to be upset about the final deliverance of his punishment.  <br>
<br>
  But, if it were not the killer himself, but the family of the victim she had been corresponding with, I think she would probably feel the exact opposite.  If you don't see where this is coming from, watch the movie (or preferrably, read the book ) Dead Man Walking.  ( The book is better because there's no Susan Sarandon to be seen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
  Anyway, as far as my opinion goes, an state or federal execution is just that.  An execution.  Murder was the crime, execution is the punishment.  And yes, I'm all for it.  In fact, I personally feel that the process takes way too long and applies to far fewer criminals that it should.<br>
<br>
  Some people just aren't fit for normal society, and when they endanger society by their existance, they should be removed from society.  And I, for one, don't really feel like paying for their room and board for the next 70-80 some odd years.  Aside from the economic standpoint, I feel that these people get exactly what is coming to them.<br>
<br>
  Sure, I will admit that there are have probably been more people sent to death and more scheduled for death than should be.  Meaning, there are probably going to be mistaken convictions along the way.  But I can't offer any way around that.  It is unfortunate.  I can only hope that as forensic science progresses, there will be fewer and fewer of these cases.<br>

Executions are just that, executions.<br>
<br>
Innocent people have been convicted of capitol crimes, and probably will be in the future. Murder is not the only capitol crime.<br>
<br>
While I don't have issue with the concept of executions, I have issues with the implementation of executions. Capitol punishment should not be an decision based on the economic status of the criminal. It should be even handed and unbiased. It is unlikely that it will ever be either, so I do not support the death penalty.<br>

Look Murder is a Criminal act where by one takes the life of another person intentionaly. <br>
<br>
Manslaughter is where the life of somone is taken thru the reckless acts of another unintentionaly.<br>
<br>
Execution is the the PUNISHMENT of a person who knowingly Murdered another person.<br>
<br>
For those that think our Judical system sucks needs to spend sometime in Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq and other third world countrys. Not much of a Judical system there. At least here we spend sometime and money to determine if indeed the person about to be PUNISHED for there Crimes is Guilty or not. Sure we have some mistakes but else where you are no afforded that oppritunity. Steal and you lose a hand a go to jail for yrs with no trial. IS that better for you? Or we can Hang the wife of a man that Claims, CLAIMS his wife sleept with another man? Is that Better for you. <br>
<br>
Or we can just let these ppl rot in jail and eat 3meals a day go to the gym, go to the libary and study and get an eduction, yes they can even study in jail to be Lawyers. While the Victims families celebrate an other Christmas or another Birthday without there &quot;innoncent loved one. They dont get Eat there favorite foods anymore, they dont get to finish school and be a baseball player or a lawyer or even mother or father and have a family of there own. <br>

What happens if you or one of your family members happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are wrongly convicted of 1st degree murder by a judicial system that is not perfect?<br>
<br>
While you are sitting on deathrow awaiting for your turn to have a ride on ol' sparky, will you be able to say to yourself &quot;Yes, I do not mind being executed even though I am innocent and the real killer is still running around free. I do not mind because with my death, 100 other real murderers will also be executed and that makes it worthwhile. My wife will be forever heartbroken and scarred while at the same time having to support the family and live with the stigma that her late husband was as MURDERER, my kids will have to grow up without me, my daughter will have to walk up her wedding aisle alone without me there to give her to her husband...BUT...that's okay...because I am just an unfortunate casualty of capital punishment&quot;.<br>
<br>
Do you think you will be able to say the above to yourself if one day you find yourself wrongly placed on death row? If you can't say that to yourself, then you should consider your position regarding whether capital punishment should be allowed or not. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vaeth>Vaeth</A> at: 3/14/03 1:56:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caliopae>Caliopae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/14/03 2:10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it murder or execution?</span><hr size=1> Murder.<br>

I'm not religious, but for all you people quoting &quot;an eye for and eye&quot;, how about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>thou shalt not kill?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
At the end of the day you are telling someone on the one hand &quot;you can't kill anyone, it's against the law&quot; and on the other hand &quot;if you do, we'll kill you&quot;.  It's hypocritical.  Just because you are the government doesn't give you the right to break the law, or at least I don't think so.  It's also unnecessary.  I say lock them up and throw away they key.  Hopefully they will live a long, long, long life of incarceration.

Also we dedicate a disproportional amount of resources to death row inmates. John Wayne Gacey had a nice computer in his cell while I was eating top ramen and typing out papers for school on a plain old electric typewriter. In Washington state we had some asshole who killed a couple people and was sentanced to death via hanging. This asshole worked to put on 300 extra pounds and then had his lawyer appeal the sentance because if he were hanged at his weight his head would have a chance to be ripped off and that would be cruel and unusual punishment. The way the stupid law is written the state was prohibited from changing the way he was to be put to death. The state then had to pay for his high medical bills because he developed liver problems because of his massive weight gain. <br>

<br>
2 - Execution is not murder in a societal or criminological sense because a murder is an unlawful premeditated killing of another human being, while an execution is a lawful punishment.  As for a moral outlook on executions, when has morality really figured into anything of relevance?  Chemical companies are allowed to conduct business in a manner in Mexico that is unlawful in America, yet still results in babies being born without brains on both sides of the border...so tell me where morality works into law, government and social self-governance at this point in our development...<br>
<br>
3 - The death penalty is supposed to server as a deterent, not a form of divine justice.  Accordingly, the death penalty is failing miserably in it's purpose.  As such, it should be abolished or someone with balls should help reconstruct it into something more effective.  The chair is somewhat scary, but hanging, the gas chamber or lethal injection?  Gimme a break.  May as well sign these pricks up for fatal blowjobs.<br>
<br>
If they want deterence, I have two suggestions:<br>
<br>
First, make the execution something to be truly feared, such as death by ants or being dropped from an extremely high altitude.  The thought of being injected by a couple of drugs that knocks you out with little or no pain is hardly a fearsome thing, aside from dying.  The concept of being slowly eaten bit by bit by bit by a million little ants who seek to extract their revenge for their ancestors that you incinerated with a magnifying glass many years before, is slightly more intimidating.<br>
<br>
Second, televise the event and allow advertising to be sold - this should more than offset the costs of this system and will undoubtably draw heavy advertising dollars given the outrageous success of reality television.  I mean, Fear Factor pretty much exceeds anything the bleeding hear liberals would allow the justice system to subject prisoners to anyways...  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/shintuk2/kurleysig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jarkellraven>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed of Bristlebane</span><br>  Posts: 2131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/16/03 12:21:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is it murder or execution?</span><hr size=1> Bah!

There are no feeling that are so bad for people in general as &quot;revenge&quot;. Revenge start wars, cause killing, abuse and assaults. For me (and most europeans) jails are there for rehabilitation more then for punishment and revenge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mistressoftherose>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 827<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/16/03 1:37:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://noirdaila.homestead.com/files/ZDoll.JPG width=83 height=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my opinion</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>thou shalt not kill<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The true translation from the Hebrew says thou shalt not murder rather than thou shalt not kill.  It's one of the many translation errors of the King James bible.<br>
<br>
As for saying that killing is killing and blah blah and blah read the argument I made a page or so ago.  These people willingly submit to our system.  They live in our system and benefit from our system.  Therefore they have a social contract with our system.  We aren't killing them they are deciding themselves that they should be put to death by committing the acts that we deem are harsh enough to put someone to death for.  Contrary to popular knowledge its not that easy to get the death penalty. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913"><br>

You know someone is wrong AND he knows it, when...<br>
<br>
... instead of looking at people doing better, as an example, he looks at people that does worse as a counter-example.<br>
<br>
So you basically say... since those countries have a worse justice system, let's keep doing what they do (killing), and we will have a better system? <br>
<br>
Why not looking at countries with low crime rates, and finding out if they do executions or not? <br>
<br>
And you called Turkey a third world country and compare it to Iran... please educate yourself a bit and save us some time. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=577826">Echtelion HeavyHand</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
