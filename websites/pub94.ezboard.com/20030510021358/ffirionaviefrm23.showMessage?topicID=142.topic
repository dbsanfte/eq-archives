Now all of you gathered in your drunken revelry hear my voice. For too long the forces of Hate, fear, death, and war, have been plaguing all of us. And they all grow stronger by each passing day. our people are scared, disillusioned and dejected. But no longer. Hate fear death and war will not threaten us anymore. We must harden our hearts against them. We must resist hate. Hate will only corrupt. When you fight and lose yourself to hate evn if you are victorious you lose more than you gain. We also must never fear. Fear is powerless to a strong heart. Cazic can have no power of you unless you let him inside. Fear infects the mind. But you never have anything to fear. The mother is always looking out for you. Death also is no challenge. Death can never be a victor over those who love. Love keeps the spirit strong. And death can only end life. Death is powerless to the soul. The spirit cannot be broken, cannot be destroyed. That leaves War. Wars of pure aggresion my friends is the greatest of all evil. For war brings with it the three lesser evils. War brings hate. War brings Death. War brings fear. Let peace quide your hearts and you will not hate, you will not fear, and you will never truely die. But i must warn you. Thier will always be those you are corrupted by these evils. Those who will bring hate fear death and war. Pity these poor fools. For they miss out on the truth. They will never understand. And they regretable can not be turned. Walk in Quellios. Live in Eroslli. But do not be like lambs lead to the slaughter. When you are threatened the Sword of Marr will see you through you struggle. Tunare be with you<br>

&quot;I hear words of courage and valor..and see only the desperate attempt of a High Elf, to deny the future. You are descended from a race of dreamers. Clouding their minds... with visions of glory days long gone. Your speech is dramatic..but only a dream. Hate, Fear and War are a means to an end. Death is unavoidable. Power will decide all. <br>
The &quot;kindness&quot; of your people and their allies, will not win the day. Only a ruthless mind can be focused enough to claim power. In time you will understand this. In time you will see and understand the strength of darkness.&quot;<br>

Daon pauses for a brief moment, then speaks again in his distant, deep voice.<br>
&quot;As it is my &quot;right&quot;... to destroy your dreams. All things die, even High Elf hopes.&quot;<br>

Daon fades away in a swirl of magic. The corpse of a patron now revealed, slumped in the corner. The body was hidden by Daon sitting in the chair, as the Necromancer sat to rest. The body is shriveled, as if all the life was drained. The dead eyes staring at the ceiling. Dead eyes that almost seemed pleading.<br>

Your ideals are a dream that will never be realized.  While you plead for peace we will continue to revel in the blood of everything you hold dear.<br>
<br>
I PRAY that you sit on your laurels, waiting for your &quot;sword of Marr&quot; to be unsheathed and come to your aid.  Your inaction will only breed a taste for vengeance... and vengeance begets hate.  Bring your crusade... ever drawn sword serves our Lords.<br>
<br>
You see, there is no course of action you may safely take.  Fight us and we rejoice in the pain, hatred and slaughter.  Even as we fall we fall knowing we have done our tasks and served our Lords well.  Do nothing and we bring that same pain... that same slaughter... on those you hold most dear.<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ignorants.... ignorants.... silly cuty lilly frowny stinky baby both y'ar...&quot;<br>
<br>
 *sitting a bit straighter, he allowed a large smile to form on his face*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Both of you speak as if hatred, anger, sadism, pain and others were decisions one would do.... ignorant ignoramus ignoratibus...&quot;<br>
<br>
 *he stood slowly on the table, sweeping some dust off his sleeves*<br>
<br>
 &quot;hatred, anger, sadness, pain, fear and all are powers. just like love, care, compassion and all other feelings are.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *the gnome wiggled his fingers, small bubbles of yellow-greenish power escaping them, and soon was he surrounded by the energy, it only dissipating to reveal a tier'dal wearing the gnome's robes albeit suiting him size-ways*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Hatred.... i hate you.... koada'dals are what we were born from, they were the ones that didn't have to endure our tortures, the godly and horrible pains that were inflicted to us. Why us and not you? Why did you escape such horrors? Why were you the ones walking the paths of Norrath when we were cast underground in our caves?&quot;<br>
<br>
 *the gnome returned to his normal shape, arching an eyebrow*<br>
<br>
 &quot;The hatred felt so is but a common feeling. It lives in any species, following or not the god of hate. It comes from Fate, from whatever tricks lady Fortuna played on such or such race. Did the tier'dals decide to be hateful? Was it a path they have chosen to follow? <br>
 No, it was bred in their bones, they would say.<br>
 Nincompop!&quot;<br>
<br>
 *Rasslyn shifted from one foot to the other, frowning*<br>
<br>
 &quot;It was not more bred in their souls than it was in any other species! it is in everyone's blood, but some cultures show it more than others! how dare ye say, as the tier'dal here expressed, that you shall feel no hatred for the one that dishonoured your daughter against her will? that slaughtered your newborn child in the most atrocious ways? You shall feel hatred. For this hatred we all share and know.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *the small gnome then turned into a troll, his eyes gleaming with a dark somber light*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Fear.... we were born from fear.... we felt the hunger, each a day, each a moment, terrible hunger that would torture our innards, drive us to insanity. We needed to feed, to eat, to consume! Small races came, they couldn't defend themselves.... it was survival for the fittest, we won and we ate! But you consider us monsters, you consider us criminals, why? You kill us for territory, we kill you for food, how are we different? We cast fear on you, but tis no choice of ours! We were born this way, casting shadows and dspair in your heart, but we didn't choose to, we were made as such, as barbarians were made tall and halfling hairy!&quot;<br>
<br>
 *Once more did the gnome return to his former self, grinning*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Have trolls decided to bring fear in the name of their original creator, Cazic-Thule? Or was fear a feeling that existed in all species since the beginning, and that awoke when smaller and more vulnerable ones saw such hulking creatures surpassing their power by far, and even before each a time they were surpassed by anyone? The fear of the hunted in front of the predator? <br>
 And why are trolls now afraid, now the hunted ones? Should they not, in Cazic-Thule's name, be the ones bringing fear only?<br>
 No, they were born with fear in them, just as we all, all species, and fear they knew when they turned into being the tracked ones. There is no such things as being spawns of the god of fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *the small gnome then turned into a human, grabbing the knife that was resting on the table he stood on, and saluting people in a knightly way*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Honor. We must respect honor and law, for they are the only things to guide us, the light that shine and we follow. Without Honor, we return to being savage beings, to the darkest moments of our history.<br>
 Honor is to be followed, and there is no such thing as hating, fearing, dominating or anything else. Follow Honor, for only it is right.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *once more, -POOF- back to gnomishness*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Honor? Why would only followers of Mithaniel be born with this? Were the first humans all honourable? Have the other species not following their gods shown no hnor?<br>
 Trolls show honor in their wars, Ogres also, the proud followers of Rallos Zek. How come, since they do not walk the path of Honor? How come tier'dals would follow the rules of war when they are but hateful spawns of Innoruuk? Why thieves of Bristlebane sometimes spare someone that fought bravely?<br>
 Honor was not bred in the humans souls. Honor is a value that all species share, but that their cultures decide or not to show. Honor is, and is followed or not, whatever your skin, height or god is. Deal with it. And anyhow, if followers of Mithaniel Marr were but honor incarnated, why are those frogs utterly insane and fanatics? Did they exclusively follow the rules of honor when kickin the trolls out of Grobb?<br>
 No, they fought, they won, they slaughtered. As anyone else, Mithaniel spawn or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *the gnome took a second of rest, drinking some stout to wetten up his parched throat*<br>
<br>
 &quot;God of Fear, god of Hate, god of Honor, and all the other gods.... they are greater beings, aye, but they are not the origin of whatever their title say. No. They incarnate the idea, yes, but that doesn't make them exclusive owners of such feelings and ideas.<br>
 The god of fear rules over human and gnome hearts also, the Mother of all Tunare reigns also on trolls, Terris and Morell respectively reign also on dreams and nightmare by their decisions.<br>
 There is no such thing as feelings being exclusive to one race. All those ideas we follow, war, power, hatred and such, we all share them since the beginning, since the Nameless one. Is the nameless one a god to follow even? no, it is a power, a billowing magma of energies that once gave birth to the world.<br>
 So please stop saying you can fight hatred. You cannot, for even at least once you will feel it. Tier'dals with always know love at least once, iksars will feel the need for honor as well, and so on. Gods are but representations of what part of the common pool of feelings and ideas a race, by it's culture, decided to consider the most important, the most powerful.<br>
<br>
 And anyhow, if gods are as you say, whya re you speaking about love, hatred and such wth Tunare? She is no goddess of love or righteousness. Nature gives, Nature takes. Nature doesn't have feelings, Nature breeds and gives death, there is no love, honor, respect or whatsoever with Nature and Tunare. It's survival of the fittest... wich quite puts you at the same place than every SINGLE race of Norrath...<br>
<br>
 Welcome to the world, elf.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *with this did the gnome sit again on his chair, drinking his stout and ordering some more, scribbling furiously on a notepad*<br>

<br>
In many ways, you are correct.  Most do not make a conscious choice to follow an emotion... be it love or hate.. or the conscious choice to have a feeling... pain or pleasure... or an abstract concept such as honor or loyalty.<br>
<br>
However... there are those of us that do.  I would think from your words that you are not a devout gnome?  Many would argue that before the Gods there was nothing...  others would say that our own force of will created them to represent things we can not comprehend.  No matter to which school of thought you belong, none can deny that they exist now.  Some small few serve their ideals devoutly.  Not only do they pay lip service to their cause... such as a wounded man praying to Rodcet for salvation... but they actively pursue their portfolio.<br>
<br>
You are correct that all beings have the capacity to show faces of nearly every god... but there are those that seek to propagate our Gods' particular interest.<br>
<br>
You are wise to note that all Gods touch all beings in some ways...  The devout, however, seek to purge themselves of all but their Lords' most consecrated desires...  becoming an instrument of their will.  The hand of their God on Norrath, if you so choose to see it that way.  I do not wish to -feel- hatred and pain, I wish to -be- hatred and pain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Vabris raises his hand, to stop any protest and continues</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That being said, I am young.  I do not claim to be anything more then a devout follower.  Someday, through service, I will be blessed.<br>
<br>
That is no matter now though.<br>
<br>
For all the praise I have given your words, I will correct you in one thing.<br>
<br>
You have a pathetic understanding of what it is to be a Tier'dal.  We do not bemoan our circumstances.. we revel in them.  We do not hate because of what has been done to us in the past... We do not war to right some old atrocity.  You speak as if Lord Innoruuk's blessing on us was a curse...  Believe me, it is not.  We bear his scars and marks with a pride you could not even -begin- to understand.  Hate is not something that can be birthed... even the most malicious of my kind is so because of choices they make.  To claim anything less is a blasphemy.  We are not animals.  We do not lash out, we choose our own path.<br>
<br>
Your patronizing satire of the other races shows an ignorance on your part...  Perhaps you should seek a deeper understanding?<br>

You misunderstand me. My family has already been slain, not by teirdal invaders, but by Lust for blood in thier famous raid on felwithe. And you can ask any of them that i have made no crusade to annialate them. I seek to reform and prevent such ruthless agression. I do not let Hate enter my heart. As for fear and the trolls i dont fear them and i dont amke war against them. Firiona! i have always stood against the decison of my people to make war against the ogres and trolls. In the last known sighting of firiona was she not in the company of a troll ((POP box art i thik thats a troll)). I have partied with an ogre before Drachma i think his name was. As for humans dont get me started. Humans produce the best and the worst of society and cling to nothing beside what brings them the most power and or gold. I know that will upset you humans out thier but feel free to prove me wrong.<br>
As for the frogs. I protest thier take over of Grobb and refuse to reconize Gukta. Diplomacy could have prevailed but both sids were to blind to see. blinded by war. And i speak of tunare because its her mission i follow to bring peace to this troubled planet. I speak of other dieties because i have been enlightened by them. And i do not hate any race. i would accpet all into my family if they would join me. I seek to bring a peace. a confederation of all races. no more wars between tierdal and koada dal. ogre and dwarf. human and human erudite and erudite. i want peace. maybe i am too idealistic but i will go to my grave fighting for my utopia. This speech has made me weary come Vabris have some wine. You aswell Rasslyn.<br>

Just have to walk through a lot of idiot d00ds and immature players to find the good ones. <br>
<br>
It's easier to role-play here on the forums, because we have more time to think about how our characters reply. Less &quot;mistakes&quot; about not &quot;appearing&quot; how we want our characters to seem to others. So more people role-play here in the forums. <br>

When the dark elf finished his speech, a glint appeared in the gnome's mischevious eyes, and he revealled himself...<br>
     .... his mouth and lips covered by crumbs and traces, his cheek inflated, holding a cookie in his hand*<br>
<br>
 &quot;ghmplf hmplff...&quot;<br>
<br>
 *finishing his mouthful, he swallowed a generous amount of the stout the lady offered, coughed politely and stood on the table*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Just a second, as i said.<br>
  My thanks, for participating to the debate, dark one. But pray hear my words correctly, friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *walking left and right, he started moving his hands in rythm with the flow of his words, half lost in his thoughts*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Abbil, if i can allow myself to call you as such, you misheard me.<br>
  Did i actually say one couldn't choose to align himself on a perticular emotion, feeling?<br>
  Nay, i said none could say one feeling or the other cannot exist in him, or that he can utterly and completely close his soul to one of the various feeling composing all of us.<br>
  Aye, fate and destiny's actions can make one more prone as to pick one of the many directions he could, following his need. As you say, the wounded shall praise Rodcet Nife if he believes in salvation, or Bertoxxulous to thank him if he believes in the power of decay. Are those two different?<br>
 No, the Rodcetian feels hope, for cure and health. The bertoxxulian hopes for a chance to propagate what ails him, and mayhaps for survival, albeit not a disfigured and marked by death and rot one, so that he can keep propagating the word of Plague.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *stopping and turning on his heels to face the tier'dal, he tilted his head sideways, crossing his arms*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Now now now, have i been patronizing? I do think not.<br>
  Tier'dals wouldn't find hatred ebcause of past sufferings? First, i did not speak as a tier'dal in temrs of whining or with sufferings in my mouth. But the very origin of tier'dals is this torture and transformation that was imposed on them. Blessing? Curse? I will not try to give an opinion on this, since i do think tier'dals will always have their opinions on this, and as hurtful as it is to me, i'm forced to accept it.<br>
  But do not dare to tell me tier'dals had not wished all koada'dals had been reached by hatred and reborn in the path of hatred. None would trust this, and it was the point i raised when i dared speak through a tier'dal's voice.<br>
<br>
  Have i been patronizing when speaking of other races, olath uss?<br>
  No. The hunger of the trolls is a perfectly known fact, and as i remember i did not make of them the stupid beasts YOUR people consider them to be? Aye, useful, easily converted to the ways of Hatred, but stupid nonetheless... Do not say the contrary, i've frenquently been walking the streets of Neriak as one of yours&quot;<br>
<br>
 *he grinned, starting again his left-turn-right-turn-left routine on the table's top*<br>
<br>
  &quot;The human? Honor and law is their credo, and my words were the one of more than one human warrior or paladin. Are they always this straight in following law and honor? No, because hatred, envy, fear and all that ails fragile minds reach for them and divert them from the path they took as model.<br>
    You say tier'dals choose their path? Truly?<br>
    Then how come the educationnal system of the dark oens direct them since the cradle to the temple of Innoruuk, and to all the guilds of Neriak that are heavily relied to the Path of Hatred? Tell me, friend, if all your life you had been taught the path of hatred, would you tell me you choosed to follow it?<br>
     And na, na, not that good o'l line about 'but but but but but but but but if i was confronted with the other possibilities, it emans i would have learnt and choosen.'.<br>
    Please, friend. Tier'dals were not idiots, far from it, and i heard the teachings of the Plitouth uss, Innoruuk. You are taught about all the other paths, but through the optic of hatred.<br>
   How can the path of honor be seeming any good to you and help make a choice, when you are taught that such creatures that use the notions of honor are not worth even uttering it's name?<br>
  How can you say knowing the path of fear can help you choose hatred, when you are taught Fear as a force that will help you by appearing in your foes hearts WHEN confronted to your hatred?<br>
  If you are taught Hatred as the root of all powers, how can being confronted to such distorted versions of the other paths, then turning a blind eye on the ones learning their true versions, BECAUSE you were taught otherwise and by, oh of course trustful persons (since they were tier'dals!), how can ye tell me it doesn't PUSH you into the path of Hatred?&quot;<br>
<br>
  *the gnome turned toward the high elf paladin, bowing swiftly to him*<br>
<br>
  &quot;May the one you loved find peace, first.<br>
   Second, friend, I apologize, but sadly must i disagree.<br>
   You choosed not to let hatred enter you. Did you not feel any hatred, even if but for a second? If not the slightest, then my friend you are either uncaring, of to the equal of gods, for only those greater beings are able to feel but what they decide to. Since i consider ye a good man and seemingly someone that loved and was love, i trust you to have felt this flinch of hatred, however small it was, when you discovered the horrid truth.<br>
    You speak about humans, saying they are power and gold driven. Have we never seen any koada'dal seeking to reach for the title of Grandmaster invoker, even by using petty tricks? Nor a captain of garrison reacting all too swiftly to the words of a subordinate that aims at stealing his rank? Nay, nay, friend, the lure of power reaches all races... some good soul like ye seem not to be desiring it, but we all desire it.... be it for good or for wrong. You shall, did or might desire power in order to bring unity, I desire power in order to undo what i consider a mistake of the gods, we all seek power... and money is but a potential form of power, friend, one you can use when you decide to, in it's own boundaries...&quot;<br>
<br>
 *Accepting the glass of wine offered by the elf, he bowed once again to thank him then took a sip, his throat aching a little*<br>
<br>
 &quot;As for Tunare, i do not think she seeks peace. Is there a peace existing between wolves and their preys? Or a peace existing between men and kobolds, wich are part of NAture's cycle nonetheless?<br>
  No, peace is against nature, for all that counts is balance in the cycles, harmony and balance. There must be a top force in the nature's chain, as well as a weakest one, and the top force must be able to be destroyed while the weakest are the one being given the greatest chances to survive, seeing they are the basis of the cycle&quot;<br>
<br>
 *He moved his hands, two small snakes of raw energy appearing between them, and starting a circle where they constantly followed one another's tail*<br>
<br>
 &quot;The weak survives the strong one mostly, but is eaten. The strong one diseappears, but soon shall reappear. Harmony and balance, Nature is steady and unmoving. All parts of Nature evolve, tis why evolution is not supposed to counterbalance the cycle.<br>
    Tis why i do not think Tunare as a goddess of good. She is the goddess of Balance, all that is good upsets this balance just as all that is considered evil does.&quot;<br>
<br>
 *he then turned again toward the tier'dal, and nodded to him.*<br>
<br>
 &quot;Ideals are a choice, elf, and your path of hatred is the ideal you fixed yourself. He choosed to put the stress on such said emotions, just as you did with Hatred, and so will the stronger one survive over the weaker one.... but as i said, Koada'dals cannot think about getting rid of you. For you are a part of this cycle of Nature, and utterly annihilating the tier'dals would be upsetting it's balance. They can lessen you until there is but a male and female among you, and perpetrate the race, but definitely making you diseappear would be destroying their own divinity's beliefs.<br>
<br>
 And in the end, i'd ask: Bartender!!!! got any cookies? finished mine!&quot;<br>
<br>
 *with this did he grab a servant's sleeve as the young boy passed by, and slipped some coins in his hand and some words in his ear, the young man soon bringing to Serenity's table a small note with a handdrawing of her profile, along with a rose, where was written that 'I thank ye for yer assistance and gentle words, fair lady. May yer gods and beliefs watch over ye, it would make a gnome's heart glad.'<br>
  With this did the young tender ask the lady if she wished any drink, for the gnome had payed in advance for anything she mught ask*<br>
<br>
 *And so did Rasslyn sit again, holding his glass of wine high as he smiled to the koada'dal male that offered it to him, and started drinking while drawing little butterflies and empty bottles of milk on his spellbook, a plate of cookies soon brought to him*<br>

 &quot;I never disagreed with the fact humans are prone on wars for power, domination and all the whatnot. I disagreed with the fact you spoke about them exclusively for that particular trait that belonged to us all. You just corrected this, so my apologies follow.<br>
<br>
 As for makin ye live again horrid moments o' yer past, tis nay my intent, and i apologize again. But the fct they did happen and such feelings happened also but add to my speech, and to agreein' to me words, friend.... might i offer ye a drink fer apologies?<br>
<br>
 Past pain i know, and dun wish ta relive mine... but they are here, they exist, and they are valuable informations about what nott a do in tha future. They help me. Never forget yers, friend. Someday ye might need remember.&quot;<br>

Your reasoning is flawed, gnome.  Tier'dal are diffrent creatures.  We are not Koda'dal with a blue tint to our skin and a perchant for violence... anymore then we are tall blue gnomes.  You assume, based on who and what you are, that we share similar ways of thinking.  We do not.  You may credit our diffrences to breeding, nuturing (or lack there of,) or any other number of factors... but the fact remains that we do not function as you do.<br>
<br>
I understand, why you disagree.  You couldn't possiably understand.  Nor can I.  I have no notion of how you think, or what you feel, other then what you outwardly express.  Not merely words, but actions... or inaction. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Glances over his shoulder at the elf</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You are as alien to me, as I am to you.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is the fact that we are so isolated from others, that makes us the way we are.  Perhaps it is the design of our Lord, as we were made in his image.  I lay evidence to the first guess, as seen by many Tier'dal that take residence among the Humans and other races.  They do not act as many other Tier'dal do, for right or wrong.  They think like humans.<br>
<br>
As for our raising of children...  All Tier'dal are creations of our Lord Innoruuk, their birth is a service and testament to him and his power.  Some choose not to serve him.  No matter... They all serve in some way.  Most become warriors for our dispariot king.  Thier service is obvious... the blood they shed breeds hate.  Others reject our Lord outright and walk among so-called-Lightbringers.  These also serve our Lord... in the scorn they suffer from others.  So are they ushered from the cradle to the alter, as you say?  Absolutly.  As well they should.<br>
<br>
This is another thing you can not understand.  You speak to me as if we Tier'dal are to choose a path...  Our lot is given to us.  We are HIS insturment.  We serve HIS whim.  We were not placed with benevolance, to grow and prosper.  We were placed to conqure and war... To spread Innoruuk's will on this world that he can so rarely directly effect.<br>
<br>
I do not hold you accountable for not understanding.<br>

<br>
Defeated?  I am no where near defeated, nor dejected.  You simply do not understand... and this illustrates it perfectly.<br>
<br>
You see my acceptance of my role as a Servent of Innoruuk as defeat...  There is no defeat or sucess in this matter.  Just as you do not choose to wake up an elf, I do not choose to wake up His insturment.  I merely am.  I am proud of that, and of my Service.<br>
<br>
All is not decided for us, even though we consider ourselves outside of Fate.  We make our own path in addition to the road the our Lord beakons us down.<br>
<br>
For example, I choose to follow Mistress Saryrn, for the power she grants me as one of her followers.  Not many are willing to accept her ways, but that matters little to me.<br>
<br>
I am neither dejected, nor defeated.<br>
