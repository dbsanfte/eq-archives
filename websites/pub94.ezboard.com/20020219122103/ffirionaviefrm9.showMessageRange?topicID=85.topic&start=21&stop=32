Yo, 2T..i see where you are going.<br>
<br>
Allow me to share my viewpoint<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
&quot;Because every Government has to have some acceptance from the majority to exsist&quot;<br>
<br>
Not quite, gov exist to regulate common affairs.  Majority is not <br>
a requirement.  What is required, is that all parties recognise that <br>
they have something in common.  they elect someone to handle<br>
it, for practical purpose. AFTER the gov is composed, then a majority MAY be required to regulate (depending on the type of gov)<br>
Another purpose of a gov is too avoid disputes and wars.(internaly)<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
&quot;There is NO universal world wide society on earth. There isnt even a majority society to rule the earth&quot;<br>
<br>
Quite true.  You can not however conclude anything from that.<br>
Having a majority is not a requirement to form a gouv.<br>
Recognition of common interest is all that matter.<br>
<br>
QUOTE<br>
&quot;Everyone gives away some freedom when they live in a society&quot;<br>
<br>
True. Question is: what they got in exchage for it ?<br>
Simple answer, the benefits of joining forces, or hamonising<br>
interests, by far outweights the limitations. Hence bigger and bigger societies.<br>
side note: reverse law: societies cease to exist when the perceived and/or factual benefits no longer outweights its limitations.<br>
<br>
Now, regarding earth.  <br>
<br>
I am wearing a shirt made in china, my coffee in made in peru<br>
my desk in canada, and most my library comes from Europe.<br>
<br>
Common interest. Yeah. <br>
Question: who regulates this ?     no gouvernement. I assure you.<br>
<br>
Regarding oppression.  I can tell you this. (w/o entering into the whole emotional/psychological issue) <br>
<br>
As you , you are responsible for yourself<br>
As a dad, you are 1/5 responsible for your family (for exemple)<br>
As an american, you are 1/280.000.000 responsible for the USA<br>
As a human, you are 1/7.000.000.000 responsible for the world.<br>
<br>
Dont fail to handle your share, however small it may be.<br>
Cause if you dont, oppression is surely just around the corner.<br>
Gov exist to help you handle your share. we create them for that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Not ALL governments are good. Not all Governments are out to take care of the people they supposedly rule/represent.<br>
<br>
When one simply assumes that Government is good, one is not dilegent AND is NOT doing their part (as you put it).<br>
<br>
IS the Government of every nation in the world a GOOD government? Are they all simply out to MANAGE the country for the benefit of the people in the country?<br>
<br>
Common interest DOES mean the same as what I said.<br>
<br>
The simple fact that a government exsists does not equate to something good or acceptable.<br>
<br>
The fact is that the farther removed from the people that a government is (the higher level that it is) the less responsive to those people it will be. The higher level a Government is the more diligence is required to prevent it from becoming corrupt or unresponsive to the people.<br>
<br>
To simply assume that a government is FOR the people is rather silly.<br>
<br>
Your comments about the people not needing to be part of the process in the government is exactly what scares the right wing of the political spectrum. The right wing does not want to be RULED, and the farther right you go you find people that dont want to be governed either.<br>
<br>
I know the difference between being a citizen and being a subject. Do you? A majority of Americans will not willing become subjects again. (well at least not all at once, the left has done a lot to drag the Federal Government towards ruling rather than governing) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwinglo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>winglo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_greenspot.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/9/01 9:27:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Right winger</span><hr size=1> <br>

On oppression: a few facts<br>
<br>
- humans are good natured in general<br>
- very few are rampant psychopath and live in terror<br>
or others.<br>
- human will defend themselves up to a point<br>
- human will not be hostile unless provoked.<br>
- this provocation may date back from a few seconds<br>

So we must agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
I have found that the majority of Europeans are so acclimented to being ruled that they dont understand the right wing at all.<br>
<br>
Basicly (not very accrute but also not to far off in a way) The left allows itself to be ruled because it doesnt mind the lose of rights, privaleges and responsibilities that are given up to a Government that &quot;takes care&quot; of them. The right would rather keep as many rights, privaleges and responsibilities at the LOWEST level (the people themselves) possible. The right would rather have to provide more care for itself but KEEP more basic freedoms.<br>
<br>
From the prospective of the right the Government is a necassary evil and MUST be watched and kept in line.<br>
<br>
From the prospective of the left the government is simply an institution that will take care of them at the cost of some freedoms and responsibilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwinglo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>winglo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_greenspot.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/10/01 1:27:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Right winger</span><hr size=1> <br>

Let me rephrase one more time.<br>
<br>
YOU CREATE THE GOVERNMENT.<br>
IT ISNT A SEPERATE ENTITY, FOR OR AGAINST YOU.<br>
YOU ARE IT.<br>
<br>
Exemple: you have a nail, you need it to hold something.<br>
To help yourself, you create a hammer.<br>
Its possible that you hurt yourself, then again maybe not.<br>
but its your hammer, you done it.<br>

They cant and dont do anything.<br>
<br>
A Government is an entity. A living entity. It is made up of people. People do act out of all kinds of reasons.<br>
<br>
If as you keep saying a government does nothing but manage people and is no threat in any way...... explain  all the governments in this world that DO purposefully KILL, maim, imprison their own people. Explain the Governments that attack other countries. The Governments that actively support actions that cause death and destruction around the world (and in their own country).<br>
<br>
A Government is NOT an inanimate object.<br>
<br>
On to the concept expressed about the Right wing only being for a certain race or class.... What a left wing thing to say.<br>
<br>
The Left strips people of responsibility as it takes away rights and privaleges. In order to ensure that no one is bothered by some inconvience a left wing government takes away the right of the people to do ANY thing it can possibly find that may cause discomfort.<br>
<br>
If I wanted to have Mom and Dad run my life, I wouldnt have left home. If I wanted Big Brother to keep me in a cacoon and protect me so I never bumped my knee, I would never have left home.<br>
<br>
I will say again... because Evil or wrong is done in the name of something.... does not make that something Evil or wrong. The left in America FEEDS on the fears of people. It equates everything with some fear and then using the 90 percent control of the mass media here, runs with that.<br>
<br>
I dont have the words to get this concept across obviously. But personal responsibility is required when one wants to have rights and privaleges. Because some people cant handle responsibility is NO reason to imprison yourself under the control of someone elses idea of what is right or best. Punish those that cant handle responsibility, train them, teach them.<br>
<br>
The Left IS about giving away your responsibility (along with rights and freedoms) so that someone else can DO for you. Amazingly everyone forgets that SOMEONE must do these things for you, which means they have power and responsibility and freedom, you dont. The Left wing Elite that rule are just as dangerous and just as likely to USE the system they run for personal pleasure and gain.<br>
<br>
I will grant that having someone do every thing for you sure is a nice idea. But I prefer to be responsible for myself and my own actions, I prefer to use restraint so that I can be as free and have as many individual rights as I possibly can.<br>

Of course the fact is it doesnt matter if I am willing to admit to this or not. Others WILL hold me accountable if they chose to and have the power to.  <br>

World wide Trade does not make me or my government responsible for the acts of anyone. I do however agree that if we see a problem with a country that one tool for dealing with them is the flow of trade goods.
