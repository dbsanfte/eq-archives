<br>
     Naught felt like a fool for crashing out the new home of the Nightmare like he had but his need for killing was tearing at him.  All of the trials of late had built to a head and he had been unable to hunt at all.  Now many things would die …many many things. <br>
     It was probably by no coincidence that he showed up at the home of the frogs; their mutual hate for one another was no secret.  <br>
What was a surprise to the ogre was that the Frogloks, were waiting.  <br>
    As the ogre entered the swamp something was amiss he felt, but his mind reeled with so much else that he paid it no heed.  He had journeyed over half the distance to the entrance to Guk when he saw them…a froglok army, more frogs than he had ever seen.  <br>
     Naught unsheathed his axe, he pondered who had betrayed him to the frog men as the army wrapped around him and began to close in.  No matter, he was alone against the horde now.  <br>
     The nearest one slowed a bit as he pulled the helm from his bag and placed it on his head, gently kissing a small flower and placing it over his heart in his BP.  They thought he would try to run, the warrior chuckled at that.  His betrayer had failed to mention that the ogre did not run it seems.  <br>
     Tired of their tentative approach the champion roared the roar of a true son of Rallos and charged the thinnest section near the wall of the near by hill.  He would make them all see his face as they died.  <br>
     The nerve of the first in line broke and tried to scramble away from the mad ogre charge, the warlord chopped them down as they fled and then tore into the mass.  Growling and grunting like the cornered beast he had become Naught hacked and slashed and cut and bashed and kicked…he even bit.  Gobs of quivering amphibian flesh caked upon him as he fought on and on.  <br>
     The army of green closed all around the ogre as they too had become enraged at the dispatching of there own.  The fight for an eternity continued, at times bodies stacked higher than the ogre's head were scrambled over by frog legions, often leaping at their unwilling victim from a top.  These foolish ones found themselves beside themselves in the most literal sense as a battleaxe them through.  This was not the young warrior who was such easy prey in his youth….this was Naught Headstomper  Warlord of the Nightmare.  <br>
     Yet even so he was but one and finally a blade took him high in the right side of his chest plunging deep.  The mass empowered by the staggered foe surged in again.  With a grunt the ogre jerked the blade from him and wielded it in the slaughter of the next wave of attackers. <br>
      Now though his blood was pouring from him and sweat beaded over his entire head…. now though in the beady black eyes of his would be assassins the warlord was not invulnerable.  For another 2 hours the ogre stood and fought against the horde, no stopping no rest.  <br>
<br>
     Finally the Frogs broke, less than 20 were left and they were demoralized by the loss of hundreds of there kin.  As they fled the ogre hurled fallen weapons at them with deadly force, 3 more lie dead as they had run.  Naught had defeated the army, alone.  No joy of victory filled him now though, as he sat and tried to stuff his insides back in where they drooped from several wounds.   Finally he stood and started towards home, he needed a healer if he was to survive. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~CHAPTER Y~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
      The sucking sound of deep black mud broke the odd silence of the swamp.  Predawn light lay across shoulders, once proud, now sagging.  A giant axe plowed through the muck, as it was drug by the hulking armor clad form.  <br>
     Naught had his eyes upon the ground.  The giant axe had been his friend so long he refused to let it fall.  A huge right hand tried in vain to keep guts and blood from pouring onto the ground, all the while clutching a small crimson soaked flower.<br>
     Movement pulled his darkrimmed eyes to his left.  A gravely wounded Froglok pulled himself through the long grass.  Naught grunted, pulled his axe from the mire, and brought it upon the head of the frog man.  The smaller being made no sound as it died.  The battered warlord pulled on his faithful blade but it was lodged deep and he had not the strength to wrench it free.  With a sigh of cold breath he pulled his hand from his side, fresh blood poured freely once more and dark soft masses bulged from the wound.  Powerful jaws ground together as he carefully tucked the dripping flower into his breastplate.  Both hands now upon the handle the ogre jerked the axe free….screaming as he did, a dozen or more wounds tearing wider or anew.  Dark fluid poured from too many places to count.  Leaning on the blade he pulled the small rose once more from his armor, and started forward again… only to fall to his knees within a step. <br>
      Dropping the blade Naught unfastened his armor and let it fall from him, finally free of the heavy plate on his arms and chest he took up his friend once more, and stood.  Looking down upon the spoils his love had worked so hard for him to have made, he thought of her and of friends like the Frizzled smith that forged for him personally.  With a renewed strength and hope of seeing those he cared so much for Naught trudged on…<br>
     As he walked Naught found himself accompanied by many of his old and dear friends, all silent and grim as they walked with him for a time, then faded back into the fog that seemed to be closing in on him.  Zimbale pushed him on with the ever constant FLY FAT ASS FLY calling from behind, the ominous threat of a bent arrow being revealed always a concern.   Dahveed walked beside him for a time, silent for the first time that Naught could think of, but his hand never left the ogre's shoulder until he too faded away.  Talastius came out of the fog once, a wrapped item in his hands.  He unfolded it revealing a fishing pole of gold, &quot;C'mon ogre he beckoned let's just sit on the bank for a bit, you have earned it.   One time it was both Cielo and Cook each under an arm at his side…helping him move forward, Cook's form flowing between himself the wizard and Flayed the rogue.  Neither said a word Cook/Flayed's face one of understanding, yet sadness…Cielo's a blend of sadness and disappointment, they were with him the longest…but they too were finally gone.   Talabrina came, her silenced shadow not too far behind.  He thought of the many laughs they had shared in private talks, they always warmed him.  The eyes of the Nightmare were there for a time to walk at his side.  As usual the presence of the stealthy Speck was more felt than seen.   Friends long gone would journey with him Ruagabuk and Phlupie, Taramak and Torched, Evilwon and the ever loved  Kuroneko .  Those that had been Prime would peak in at times Aelenie and Kyann, the sisters of Seraphim spite.  Holis now on the Farplanes…even the wraith like Spectre.   Valemdar walked with him for longer than the ogre would have thought…a better friend that the warlord had ever allowed him to be.  Kazanti was there several times, always his friend he understood more than most the trials the ogre faced.  The Ankhami priestess came in; her words of advice had always been invaluable.  Jeronic was there, only of late had their friendship began to grow, but the warlord saw a lot to like in the dark one.  Probably not by coincidence the ogre's beloved sister was next.  Her face saddened greatly, she had lost much in her hard life, her fear of losing him hurt her….Naught hated that.  She hugged him before she too faded away.  There was a visit from Lifecatcher  * nods * the ogre always cared for that one, and hoped he found the balance he sought.  Darkangle and Megan we next to see him for a time, somehow those last three were intertwined…time would hopefully reveal how.  The dark Dalmor came briefly, a nod of respect for the will that forced the giant warrior on, Naught could see that this one was of the right metal.  Tulip, war monk of the nightmare was there he helped the warlord for a while before he was gone an anxious gleam twinkled in his eye as he left.  Defiance bounded in, a smile on his lizard lips some strange words poised there as well Naught was sure…but instead the iksar just patted the large warrior on the shoulder and then he too faded. <br>
<br>
     Suddenly a blue aura lit around him, and he felt just a bit stronger, a small voice came to him, &quot;hello my protector&quot; Vyany said &quot; feeling kinda like a 87/87 rock  puff huh? Eheh&quot;<br>
&quot;Vy?&quot; the ogre asked….but Vyany Lifewynd was gone already.   <br>
     The battle shaman preach came, as did the mighty Oshram though he was Zhengi at times and oddly a troll named Notch at others. The young Valuhra came for just a moment, smiling and calling him master.  Again blue light bathed him and he could straighten a little more, &quot;Hello ogre&quot; a familiar arrogant voice said.  Izzuum was amongst his oldest friends and his presence was welcome indeed.  The core of the Void of old and some of the new joined him, Aven and Thad and Velsor and Skelators and Dragoth and Octavan.  As they too faded away Naught was joined by his friend Xilsis….who else could ever be his &quot;oh shit&quot; brother.  Khaldahar came for a moment, another good friend potentially but the pulls of duty had kept them from closeness.  It was then an odd sound filled his ears, he realized it was Bob.  The earth golemn walked with him as the warlord scanned for Talru; somehow Naught felt like he was out there, just lost in the fog.  The champion hated that he was unable to help.  Then the swordmistress was there, the beautiful warrior that was always there for him.  He truly adored her, and was most glad she too had come.  Another voice came now as Darsheva as well faded away. &quot;Hi there Gov&quot; its ever jovial tone began &quot;don't worry all will be well&quot;  That was his friend the Zartry bard, a good friend indeed.  Elyeni was next, she traveled with the Talyra knight both were grim but they smiled at him and added there warmth to the cold that seemed to be growing around him now.  The warlord noticed that the small priestess lady E played not with the ring around her neck so much, he was glad something was pulling her from the pain of it.  Oafgau was next he was quiet though, Naught understood and was glad for his visit.  Ikonoclastia came next; naught again felt a pang of regret as he had hoped they would have been able to be closer.  He felt much the same when Vena came as Ikono faded away.  He had always wanted that hunt together that they had spoke of so oft.  Puppis was there now, Naught had been missing the iksar for a long time now, his presence was nice indeed.  Ogarth stopped for a second, they were good friends a thousand years ago, Naught was always fond of the Soldier.  Kazanti came again this time with lady Vienemi his love, Naught was fond of her as well.  The warlord of the Damned seemed reluctant to leave but gray pulled him away like all the rest.  The ever soft yet powerful Utilu was next to walk with him.she too was a friend Naught wished he could see more of.  There was a blur of some next Tenar and Krudd came together Ayerroes was after them.  Apep and Azhrei stopped with some of the Storm, many came and went, the ogre found it hard to keep track, he remembered seeing Restoria briefly, he hoped she was well as they had not spoken in sometime.   So many came and went, some names he had even forgotten in his state, he was still touched by their passing. <br>
<br>
         The Headstomper was growing weary, when a presence so strong made him look around for its owner.  &quot;lil flower? He whispered though dry cracked lips<br>
 &quot;hello my lord, whose locket I wear,  you are tired now?&quot;  Her little hand came into his and squeezed, the ogre could hold not the tears that overflowed his burning eyes.  <br>
&quot;hullo me luv &quot; he whispered <br>
&quot;You need to rest now? she asked &quot; my lord I mean&quot; <br>
&quot;Me needs to rest lil flower but me iz skared…kan yoo buleeve dat, da mitey warlord  Naught Headstomper is afrayed.&quot;  <br>
&quot;Afraid my lord?&quot; she asked <br>
&quot;Yes luv me afraid me will wurk no more…me afrayed dat da dayz of da headstomper are at an end&quot;<br>
&quot;O&quot; was her only reply for a moment<br>
&quot;You have been deaded then?&quot; she asked <br>
&quot;Me not know luv but me afrayed dat me mite be&quot;  The weary ogre pulled the bloodsoaked rose from his tunic, &quot; me still have dis though…me will alwayz keep dis&quot;<br>
&quot;My lord you said you would always be there did you not…always?&quot;  The hurt in her voice was nearly more than he could bear.  <br>
&quot;It was good that I put up walls then?&quot; the betrayed feeling dripping from her tongue<br>
&quot;Oh luv…&quot; the ogre heaved an ogre sized sigh &quot;…yes me did, me know dat me iz lettin yoo down, me being surry duzn't meen much but me iz, …more dan yoo know.  Me did try lil flower…me tried so hard, but da ogre jes can go no more.  Now yoo do  hate me?&quot;<br>
His question went unanswered as the small hand in his faded away.<br>
<br>
     Naught walked alone for a time; hope was fading with the day.  At some point the large axe finally fell from his hand and both now clutched at his side.  He slumped heavily his flesh as pale now as the high elves he so abhorred…<br>
…and the ogre fell.  Colors swam before his eyes……. like an ancient oak finally crashing down……the ogre fell.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~CHAPTER Z~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
     Naught was startled to be opening his eyes; a fire warmed him to his side.  Shock and disbelief filled him as he took in the figure by the fire.  Raught! <br>
&quot;Brudder…yoo iz alive? Naught thought about it for a minute &quot;or iz me dead?<br>
Raught looked over to his brother, &quot;hullo der Naught &quot; he said &quot;it iz just time fur yoo too come home me brudder.  Zaught and Glop await us.&quot;<br>
&quot;It hurtz too much fur me to be ded Raught...rite? The Headstomper sounded hopefull.  His shadowknight brother just smiled at him, <br>
&quot;yooz will understandz soon liddle brudder, now yoo lay bak and rests though.&quot;  <br>
Naught Headstomper,  Ogre warrior, champion and Warlord of the Prime Nightmare lay back his head…… <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
…..darkness folded around him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~EPILOGUE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
((This is among the hardest things I have ever done…I am turning the Nightmare over to Cielo Infierno, she has been much the leader in interim as I have had RL developments keeping me away.  The journey of the ogre found him and I many close friends.  I hope to see you all again one day, in one form or another. Is the ogre dead?  Naught Headstomper forever gone from the face of Norrath?  Only time will tell if we have seen the last of his ugly mug.  Now though he sleeps and dreams of home.  His axe upon the wall, dust upon it.))<br>
<br>
Gud bye me frendz….gud bye<br>
<br>
Naught Headstomper<br>
Proud Warlord of the Prime Nightmare<br>
