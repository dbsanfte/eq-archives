<br>
Ever worry that millions of your fellow Americans are walking around knowing things that you don't? That your prospects for advancement may depend on your mastery of such arcana as who won the Iraqi war or where exactly Europe is? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then don't watch Fox News. The more you watch, the more you'll get things wrong. <br>
<br>
Researchers from the Program on International Policy Attitudes (a joint project of several academic centers, some of them based at the University of Maryland) and Knowledge Networks, a California-based polling firm, have spent the better part of the year tracking the public's misperceptions of major news events and polling people to find out just where they go to get things so balled up. This month they released their findings, which go a long way toward explaining why there's so little common ground in American politics today: People are proceeding from radically different sets of facts, some so different that they're altogether fiction. <br>
<br>
In a series of polls from May through September, the researchers discovered that large minorities of Americans entertained some highly fanciful beliefs about the facts of the Iraqi war. Fully 48 percent of Americans believed that the United States had uncovered evidence demonstrating a close working relationship between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. Another 22 percent thought that we had found the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. And 25 percent said that most people in other countries had backed the U.S. war against Saddam Hussein. Sixty percent of all respondents entertained at least one of these bits of dubious knowledge; 8 percent believed all three. <br>
<br>
The researchers then asked where the respondents most commonly went to get their news. The fair and balanced folks at Fox, the survey concludes, were &quot;the news source whose viewers had the most misperceptions.&quot; Eighty percent of Fox viewers believed at least one of these un-facts; 45 percent believed all three. Over at CBS, 71 percent of viewers fell for one of these mistakes, but just 15 percent bought into the full trifecta. And in the daintier precincts of PBS viewers and NPR listeners, just 23 percent adhered to one of these misperceptions, while a scant 4 percent entertained all three. <br>
<br>
Now, this could just be pre-sorting by ideology: Conservatives watch O'Reilly, liberals look at Lehrer, and everyone finds his belief system confirmed. But the Knowledge Network nudniks took that into account, and found that even among people of like mind, where they got their news still shaped their sense of the real. Among respondents who said they would vote for George W. Bush in next year's presidential race, for instance, more than three-quarters of the Fox watchers thought we'd uncovered a working relationship between Hussein and al Qaeda, while just half of those who watch PBS believed this to be the case. <br>
<br>
Misperceptions can also be the result of inattention, of course. If you nod off for just a nanosecond in the middle of Tom Brokaw intoning, &quot;U.S. inspectors did not find weapons of mass destruction today,&quot; you could think we'd just uncovered Hussein's nuclear arsenal. So the wily researchers also controlled for intensity of viewership, and concluded that, &quot;in the case of those who primarily watched Fox News, greater attention to news modestly increases the likelihood of misperceptions.&quot; Particularly when that news includes hyping every false lead in Iraq as the certain prelude to uncovering a massive WMD cache. <br>
<br>
One question inevitably raised by these findings is whether Fox News is failing or succeeding. Over at CBS, the news that 71 percent of viewers hold one of these mistaken notions should be cause for concern, but whether such should be the case at Fox because 80 percent of their viewers are similarly mistaken is not at all clear. Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes and the other guys at Fox have long demonstrated a clearer commitment to changing public policy than to reporting it, and an even clearer commitment to reporting it in such a way as to change it. <br>
<br>
Take a wild flight of fancy with me and assume for just a moment that one major goal over at Fox is to ensure Bush's reelection. Surely, anyone who believes that Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda were in cahoots, that we've found the WMD and that Bush is revered among the peoples of the world -- all of these known facts to nearly half the Fox viewers -- is a good bet to be a Bush voter in next year's contest. By this standard -- moving votes into Bush's column and keeping them there -- Fox has to be judged a stunning success. It's not so hot on conveying information as such, but mere empiricism must seem so terribly vulgar to such creatures of refinement as Murdoch and Ailes.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/LASLAN.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

SHOCKER~!<br>
<br>
If you are in support of the sentiment expressed in the article you've quoted above, then we are in total agreement.<br>
<br>
Jokishness aside, Fox News is, for lack of any necessity for subtlety, a dangerous program.<br>
<br>
History has taught us that every generation and era has a control system.  In our &quot;modern enlightenment&quot; we can look back at earlier epocs and chuckle at the &quot;obviousness&quot; of the control system that had the majority of a given population segment humming a desired tune:  &quot;How gullible/impressionable/uncritical/base/pedantic/simple those people were that they couldn't see what was being done to them.&quot; we can say...<br>
<br>
It is a rare, and historically dangerous, thing for the individual or the minority to get a glimpse of the mechanisms of the control system within their own era.<br>
<br>
However the sad truth today is that the system has reached a state of near perfection:  people are so distracted and generally consumed with their own vanity that they don't really give a shit, even when the &quot;ugly truth&quot; is heaped up in mounds before their eyes...they can just enter their favorite chat room, turn to the Bachelor, drive down to McDonalds for a cheap burger, and/or surf some internet porn..........and everything is okay.<br>
<br>
Either that...or Fox New is 100% quality journalism! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bignast>bignast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/24/03 10:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> holy shit</span><hr size=1> holy shit, me and KAZ better start kissing b/c hell has frozen over and Robin and Kurley are in agreement?  damn this must be a topic no one will disagree on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=takkonsmakafu>Takkon Smakafu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 484<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/24/03 11:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: holy shit</span><hr size=1> That's why I get all my news from the Daily Show.

people simply don't care enough to really research anything, anymore.  i'm certain that these people who &quot;watch the news&quot; occasionally have it on in the background while they're sniffing glue or looking at porn on their computers, and only look up when one of those big, sensational, eye-grabbing headlines flashes up on the screen.  and as we all know, headlines = fact.  i mean, it's not like it's sensationalized or anything.  or that anyone's actually trying to make money off of this.  or that they're twisting the news to reflect their particular thoughts and beliefs.  all that would be ludicrous.<br>
<br>
and i like Fox news.  however, all news programs need to be taken with a grain of salt, since none of it is &quot;fact.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deldrach>Deldrach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/25/03 9:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> I would personally be wary of anyone that gets all their news from a single source, even if that source were Economist magazine.

I do believe there has been evidence showing possible links between Hussein and Al Qaeda. Men who are known to have been members of Al Qaeda have been found residing in Iraq. And I believe that strong evidence has been found of links and support of terrorist organizations in Iraq.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Another 22 percent thought that we had found the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I would guess this would be in  the definition. The UN Inspection teams were finding materials and systems banned under the terms of the cease fire right up to the point of when they were not allowed to inspect. The Coalition forces have found materials and systems used in the manufacture and delivery of WMDs. So if you asked if I think Iraq had WMDs I would say they probably do or did.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And 25 percent said that most people in other countries had backed the U.S. war against Saddam Hussein.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Again it is in the definition and how you present it. I don't even remember what the numbers of countries that supported, opposed or didn't really care were. It was never that important. I think that most people agreed that it would be best if Saddam Hussein where not the ruler of Iraq.<br>

I put all this down with all the rest of the hype. Each is going to interpret and believe along the lines of what most reflects their personal wants and desires and they will try and demonstrate the opposing views in the worst possible light they can.<br>

Considering I stated they where my beliefs from the information that is available.<br>
<br>
I will accept there are variations as to what we will call fact, supposition or wishful thinking. To assume that you are right and everyone else who disagrees is not only hubris it is rather foolish.<br>
<br>
You find it difficult to understand why I and many others believe the way we do just as we find it almost inconceivable that you believe the way you do. <br>
<br>
Did you verify all the information available? Or do you accept the information that matches your world view and disregard all else as incorrect, ignorant or some nefarious plot?<br>
<br>
I am comfortable with my beliefs and I am confident considering the demographics of the majority of conservatives who share them. I made a choice as to group that I think will make the best choices for the future. Until I see a party or group I think is more capable or knowledgeable and rational I will stick with them even if they have some fringe nuts like any other large group. Right now I think the US is more or less on the right path and a majority of its citizens think so too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bignast>bignast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/25/03 12:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=818.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;I have not taken the time to sift through the information and see how they came to their conclusions.

Men who are known to have been members of Al Qaeda have been found residing in the United States as well... going on that same logical assumption are we to assume that there are ties between the American Government and Al Qaeda as well?

Depending on how the questions were written will determine how a person answers. Polls are crap. They can and are routinely subverted, used to prove a point that isnt true. Depending on how you write the questions and where you chose to do your &quot;random&quot; survey can determine what result you get.<br>
<br>
As for these questions so what?  There is reasonable doubt as to whether or not Saddam was courting Osam Bin Laden and his followers. There is ample proof that the MEANS to build wmd's was in Iraq in violation of the UN sanctions. The Congress just got a very long report on all the evidence that shows The government of Iraq was indeed hiding the ability to produce wmd's on short notice, hidden for the sole purpose of returning to production as soon as sanctions were lifted.<br>
<br>
Depending on how the question was written would determine how I would answer said questions as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

There actually isn't much irony in my statements. <br>
<br>
I did not sift through the polling data and how it was correlated. Reading the OP-Ed piece it was easy to see the venom and spite from the writer. It has been shown on several occasions on this board that people reading the very same words will choose to take total opposite meanings from them depending on their bias.<br>
<br>
On the other hand I did post the information that is known and verifiable and how I felt it had influenced my beliefs on the situation. <br>
<br>
Notice, no one tried to challenge the facts I posted instead they attempted to use scorn and obfuscation on only one. And that was not to say it wasn't true but to try and deny it could be indicative of what many of us believe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

Is there any one here that would like to publicly deny they believe:<br>
<br>
1) Men who are known to have been members of Al Qaeda have been found living openly in Iraq. That evidence of terrorist training basis have been found in Iraq. That Saddam Hussein has openly shown his support of terrorist with his words and financially by sending money to the families of terrorist killed committing acts of terrorism.<br>
<br>
2) That the UN inspection teams were continuing to find evidence of WMD programs right up till the time they were forced out of Iraq. The Coalition forces continue to find evidence of WMD programs in Iraq.<br>
<br>
3) That most people in the civilized world agree that it is better for Iraq that Saddam Hussein is no longer the ruler.<br>
<br>
I will be interested to see how many of the people right here are not part of the very statistics they are saying that the rest of us are boobs for believing.<br>
