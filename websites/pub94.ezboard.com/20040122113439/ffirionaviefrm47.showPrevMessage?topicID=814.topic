Hello folks!  A new guild geared towards the serious roleplayer is about to be formed.  As of this posting, there are 4 out of the 10 (not including alts) minimum of people willing to join.  We need 6 more in order to be tagged.  So there is no misunderstanding as to what type of guild this is, I've posted a full copy of our charter.  If anyone is interested, please drop by our message board.  The sooner we have the minimum requirements, the sooner we can begin our clan! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Clan McCulloch Guild Policies</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guild Purpose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Clan McCulloch is designed to provide the Fironia Vie community with an alternative to the style of play that emphasizes xp grinding, raiding, and dungeon crawling.  While we recognize these activities as an integral part of the game, Clan McCulloch strives to fully integrate roleplay into the most common EQ related activities.  In this regard, Clan McCulloch is considered a “roleplay heavy” guild.  The intention of the creators is to provide an atmosphere for roleplayers to immerse themselves in Norrath’s (as well as player created) history and lore.  Whether it is interacting with each other, or roleplaying with others outside the guild, our focus will always be the same:  to have fun and enjoy Everquest as the game was originally intended.<br>
<br>
Clan McCulloch is not, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">NOR WILL IT EVER BE</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, a raiding guild.  Members are free to raid with other guilds if they so choose, but Clan McCulloch will not participate in a raid unless it is conducted along roleplayed storylines.  This guild will also never be level or loot oriented.  Those players who are more “gamer” oriented will most likely not find what they are looking for here.  The success of our guild will not be measured by the quality of our equipment, the number of successful raids conducted, or the number of AA points accumulated but on whether or not we have fun through roleplay.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Roleplaying Environment</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
The preservation of the roleplaying environment is a founding principle of Clan McCulloch. Therefore we ask that ALL members, as well petitioners, make every effort to remain in character when interacting over /guild chat, /group chat, /say, and /raid say, as well as any other guild sponsored channel.  Out-of-character chat is permitted so long as it is clearly labeled as such, is not excessive, or become disruptive to the roleplaying environment.  A common technique used by experienced roleplayers is to label out-of-character chat by enclosing the text with (( )) or by prefacing the text with “OOC.”<br>
<br>
 Common EQ expressions such as “tank,” “wizzie,” “SOW,” “pally,” “nuke,” “KEI,” “shammy,” etc., as well as any discussions concerning game mechanics (stats and such) are considered out-of-character, and should be labeled.  Potentially inflammatory OOC topics such as politics, religion, ethnic background, or sports are not permitted over guild chat, and should remain in private channels.<br>
<br>
Excessive profanity will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be tolerated in public channels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It should be noted that membership in Clan McCulloch does NOT require one to be a masterful roleplayer.  The only requirement is that members make their <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>best attempt</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to roleplay and remain in character.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Membership</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Clan McCulloch is open to all Barbarians, regardless of deity.  Player creativity is encouraged so long as the religion does not interfere with or cause a major disruption within the clan.  Worship of the “evil” gods (except Rallos Zek and his sons) is prohibited, however.  <br>
<br>
Those who wish to join the clan should post a brief introduction (IC andOOC) on our message board.  A full member of the clan must sponsor the petitioner before the initiation process can begin.  Both petitioner as well as sponsor must then come before the Council of Elders (in game) to begin the “Rites of Passage.” The sponsor then serves as mentor until the vote for membership is called.  The petitioner must spend time with each of the Elders who will test his/her worthiness via the completion of a player-given quest as well as answering simple questions relevant to membership in Clan McCulloch.<br>
<br>
It is the mentor’s job to make certain that the petitioner <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">completely knows and understands</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the guild’s purpose, policies, and code of conduct before calling for the Council of Elders to vote.  Again, Petitioner along with his/her mentor must come before the Council.  The Council will then vote on whether or not the Petitioner should be allowed to become a full member. Any Elder that votes “no” must be sure to give proper reasoning for their decision.  If ¾ of the council votes yes, then the petitioner becomes a full member of the clan.  Any petitioners who are rejected the first time around will be given a second chance after he/she addresses any concerns brought up by the Elders.<br>
<br>
Humans and Erudites will also be allowed to go through the “Rites of Passage,” <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">but only if they marry into the clan</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  The Barbarians are a superstitious people, and therefore do not trust those who are not descendants of their Human ancestors.  As a result of the Barbarian tendency to look on other races (especially ones that are shorter, taller, or furrier than themselves) with distrust, no other race except Barbarians, Humans, and Erudites will be allowed to join Clan McCulloch. <br>
<br>
This guild is based loosely on the cultural tendencies of the Celtic, Norse, and Germanic tribes of the early Middle Ages.  Those tribes did not trust, and even feared what they believed to be the practice magic that, in their eyes, tampered with the natural order of the world.  Therefore, INT based casters are also restricted from joining Clan McCulloch, as are Necromancers and Shadow Knights.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>4.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Officers</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
The “Council of Elders” is a collection of officers nominated for their respective positions by the Clan Chieftain based on leadership qualities as well as having basic knowledge of Norrath’s Lore.  The Council serves as an advisory board for the Chieftain, represents the guild in the Chieftain’s absence, and has a crucial role in helping to preserve the roleplaying<br>
environment in Clan McCulloch.  When a perspective Elder is nominated, a general membership vote will be called (on the message board, not in game).  If the perspective Elder receives ¾ positive votes, he or she will take their place among the Council.  Of course there will be a ceremony to celebrate the promotion of a fellow “sword brother”or “shield maiden.” <br>
<br>
An Elder will eventually represent each profession allowed in Barbarian culture, and each Elder will have administrative rights over their respective sections of the guild’s message board. (Warrior, Rogue, Beastlord, Shaman).  Other positions may be awarded at the Chieftain’s discretion as the guild grows in numbers or as the need arises. <br>
<br>
Officers in Clan McCulloch are expected to lead by example by upholding guild policies at all times.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>5.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Loot Rules/ Trade Skills</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Clan McCulloch will always maintain a vault where members may donate their old gear and claim any items that may be useful to them.  Members are not required to donate to the vault, nor is any member permitted to claim more than one item at a time.  All items taken from this vault becomes the sole property of the recipient, and any loot acquired by a member while on a guild sponsored hunt/raid is also the sole property of the recipient.  It should be noted that the guild is not required to equip its members, nor is it required to financially assist its members in the advancement of trade skills.  Any assistance given to any member in this regard is purely voluntary.  By the same token, craftsmen are not required to donate their wares to the guild.  Members are encouraged to help one another, but never will such help become mandatory for any member. <br>
<br>
Trading between members is permitted at the players’ discretion.  Also, the guild message board will always contain a section where guild members as well as non-guild members can sell/trade.  Members are not permitted to use guild chat as an auction channel, however.  If members want to conduct a “guild auction,” a separate channel must be used.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Under no circumstances will greed or arguments over loot be tolerated in this guild.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>6.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guild Events</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Any member of the guild can plan a hunt, plan a roleplaying event, or a plan a raid.  It should be noted that Clan McCulloch’s raids will <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">always</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> be conducted along roleplayed storylines.  Loot and experience will play a minimal part in motivating the guild to raid a given area.  Should a member wish to raid a zone solely for the purpose of obtaining loot, we require the proposal be accompanied by a viable roleplaying reason or story. <br>
<br>
There will be times when certain members that attend a hunt/raid may not receive experience due to level restrictions set by the game itself.  This guild is designed in a way that roleplayers <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>should</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want to attend events whether or not there is loot or experience involved.  Our priority will always be roleplay before everything else.  Still, attendance at guild functions, no matter what type, will never become mandatory.<br>
<br>
Clan McCulloch will hold weekly gatherings in Halas, at our designated guildhall within the city.  The purpose of these gatherings is to keep members informed of the who’s, what’s, when’s, where’s, how’s, and why’s of clan operations in an effort to maintain a sense of camaraderie in the guild between ALL of its members, both new and old.  As with any guild event, attendance at these gatherings is not mandatory, but we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>highly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> recommend members attend as much as possible to take advantage of the roleplaying opportunities that will be presented. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>7.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Conflict Guidelines/ Guild Removal</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of the members to try solving any out-of-character conflicts among themselves.  Usually a private message or discussion works best in most cases.  An Elder or the Chieftain should be contacted <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">only</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> if an attempt was made by the players to solve the problem on their own.  Clan Elders as well as the Chieftain will do their best to mediate and come up with a solution beneficial to all parties involved.  The Chieftain (and Xelita, who is the co-founder of Clan McCulloch) reserves the right to expel members from the guild based on the “three strikes rule.”  If an offense is serious enough (i.e. sexual harassment, racism, loot scam, etc.), the three strikes rule will not apply.  The offender WILL be expelled.  Period.<br>
<br>
Roleplayed conflicts will be handled when a member comes before the Council of Elders to petition for judgment.  The Council will hear testimony from all sides, the Elders will advise the Chieftain, and he will make a ruling.  Rulings may be challenged through single combat between the accuser and accused or their appointed champions (due to differences in level).<br>
<br>
Duels between clan members may occur at any time under the laws of the clan.  However, the victor in such duels is required to compensate the vanquished with coin (based on the laws of the ancient Germanic Tribes of Europe).  This <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>weregeld</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (mangold in modern English) need not be a large sum, and is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>for roleplaying purposes only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  The amount is totally up to the individual that is required to pay.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In no way should the payment of weregeld place a financial burden on those who are required to pay it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This core tenet of Germanic culture was included here to add depth to our roleplay and to add strength to the roleplaying environment.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ANY exploitation of this roleplaying tool will result in immediate expulsion from the guild</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>All members of Clan McCulloch are expected to abide by Sony’s PlayNice Policy without exception.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>8.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Necessary Changes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:<br>
<br>
Guild policies and procedures will be modified as the need arises.  The guild as a whole will be involved in making the necessary changes. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hrothdan>Hrothdan</A> at: 10/6/03 6:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wilrethfv>Wilreth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/6/03 9:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=753.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New &quot;roleplay heavy&quot; guild</span><hr size=1> OOC:<br>

.... Ok... I have to admit that I am a novice when it comes to managing an EZ-Board Community.  A few people have told me that they could not view any of the threads (what few we have at this point).  <br>
<br>
Things should be fixed now so that everyone can get into the threads.  I want to apologize to those of you who just wanted to come by and see how things were progressing and left frustrated because the community administrator is a knucklehead. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you are doing this based on Celtic history, then you need a spot for bards. Bards were a huge part of the Celtic and Norse history, as were Druids. To leave either of those out is to not be totally true to what you are trying to create.<br>
<br>
Amongst the Celts, the bards were story tellers and singers, and passed on news, the druids dealt with day to day life and the religious aspects of life, presiding over festivals and healing. Then there were the &quot; seers&quot; that delved into foreseeing the future.<br>
<br>
In Norse lands, the 'bards' were called Scaulds, and were more story oriented then musically.<br>
<br>
Good luck with your endevour, it sounds wonderful. Look forward to seeing the Clan in game.<br>

<br>
You are right Jade, and I really did consider adding those classes to the Clan.  I decided not to because even though Clan McCulloch is based on Germanic/Norse/Celtic culture of early Medieval Europe, the guild itself resides in Norrath, specifically the area of Halas/Everfrost, an area rich in history and culture.  I wanted to stay as close to the original concept of the residents of the northern lands as I could.  Unfortunately that meant excluding certain races and classes from the guild.<br>
<br>
I know and understand the role of &quot;Druid&quot; in Celtic society as well.  Our guild's notion of &quot;Shaman&quot; mixes the spiritual, religious, and mystical aspects of Celtic Druidism with those of Norse &quot;Mystics.&quot;  Shamans in Clan McCulloch will be performing religious ceremonies, consulting with spirits through the tossing of bones, and fighting along side the warriors of the clan.  <br>
<br>
I did have difficulty incorporating the concept of Norse &quot;Scalds&quot; into Norrath's Barbarian culture.  The best I could come up with was to have our Rogues fill that role.  In Clan McCulloch, Rogues are not thieves per se, but &quot;Scouts.&quot;  They will be the travelers, the bringers of news, and the storytellers.  Of course ALL of our current clan members love to tell stories, but you get the picture. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The guild will grow and no doubt change in makeup.  As Humans and Erudites marry into the clan, I DID plan on slowly allowing other classes into the guild as a way to reflect the growing power and influence of the clan.  Hell, Hrothdan may even sound a bit more educated once an Erudite or two decide to teach him his letters! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Still this is all for the guild to decide as time marches on.<br>
<br>
I thank you for your encouragement and well wishes Jade!  I am excited about being a part of this guild, not only because I am its creator, but also because of its purpose and focus on this server.  Hopefully other roleplayers will take a look at the dynamics of Clan McCulloch, and decide to join our family.  We now have 5 people (not including alts).  Only 5 more before we can be tagged! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

After meeting with you the other night, the idea of this new clan has consumed many of my thoughts.  I'm anxious to meet more of the prospective members.  RL is restricting my ability to play this week, but I wanted to let you know that I have not forgotten and my interest is sincere.  My biggest question at the moment concerns guild wars.  Where does the clan stand on the issue and what are Sony's looting rules in a guild war?  I have made a pretty good search of the internet, but have found little useful information.  Are the primary/ secondary/ armor slots of the vanquished fair game or only the eight inventory slots and coin?  Are items in containers fair game?<br>

Agaar, it's great to see you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    As far as I know, /guildwar is broken, and Sony has no intention of fixing it.  Our plan was to fight pitched battles against other guilds in the Arena (or any other PvP zone for that matter).  All that is required for events like this is an imagination!<br>
<br>
I don't believe the victor in an arena battle has the ability to loot anything from the corpse of his/her opponent.  At least that's been my experience.  Clan McCulloch does not have any plans to introduce loot rules for their battles with other guilds.  I suppose this could change depending on the planning between myself and the rival guild leader.  It also depends on member feedback.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I have seen loot change hands in the past during such events, but our intention in this guild is to fight for the roleplay, not for the loot.  <br>
<br>
Clan McCulloch was created for players who want to focus their EQ experience on roleplay without the stress of having to spend hours camping certain spawns for a rare drop, or having to spend countless gaming sessions XP grinding so that your toon is raid capable.  All of this WILL happen for Clan McCulloch, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>roleplay</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is our first and foremost concern.  <br>
<br>
I have been looking for you, Agaar, and I know that you are sincere.  When our paths cross, you can be sure that Hrothdan will ride out onto the tundra to greet you!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    In the meantime, take a look at the log of our first &quot;gathering.&quot;  Most of our current members are casual players, so not everyone was there.  Still, we had a blast!<br>

Thank you Bignast!  Things are progressing nicely in Clan McCulloch.  We are considering allowing Bards of the Tribunal, Zek, and Marr into the clan, but at a later date.  We are also considering Dwarves as well.  <br>

As of right now, however, we are focusing on creating a significant Barbarian foundation.
