<br>
    I was in two pick up groups for LDoN, and both of them failed.  The first one we came close, but a couple of wipes and the stupid cleric (me!) accidently gated out once (/slap forehead repeatedly) doomed us.  The second one we wiped twice and quit.<br>
<br>
   It seemed to me that the biggest problem was that the set up of the encounters, namely being timed, set up a barge-ahead-at-all-costs mentality in some people.  Both times, we had people who would pull even though I announced several times that I was completely out of mana.  When I complained, I was told that &quot;We have to hurry... time limit!&quot;  I countered that wiping would take even more time, but that didn't seem to register.   I got pretty fustrated, and considered just quiting out.  After all, with no mana, what good was I doing besides soaking up exp?  And I was getting pretty tired of listening to myself whine.  But wiping mulitple times wasn't fun either.  Sure, there was the &quot;Crap!  Got too many!&quot; situation that lead to the wipes, but I can't help but think that if the cleric wasn't oom at the start of the pull, we might have had a better chance.<br>
<br>
    I think part of the problem is the nature of this server.  With our very low population, we have more solo'ers (I think).  I myself am used to duoing with Lenny, not functioning in a full group per se.   I think we probably have a higher proportion of very good soloers than any other server, save maybe Test.  And many of us, at least in the 40's range where I am at, simply have not had much experience grouping.  Why should the shaman care if the cleic is oom?  He knows he can can canni, and is able to plow ahead without enforced med breaks!  But in a group, all have to move forward at the same speed.<br>
<br>
   The good thing is that I think LDoN will teach good group tactics sooner than some might have learned them with the expansion.  For example, I learned that if I accidently gate out, I will feel like a total and complete ass.  It was just a fluke that I had it memed at all, and in a spot for a spell that I usually cast in combat.  Now I know to double check to make sure I don't have it all!  And in the first group I was in, I was apparent towards the end that we learning how to time our encounters verses needed med time.  Another good thing, I think, is that we are being forced to seek out people to group with that otherwise we might not hook up with, and thusly having the chance to make more friends.  <br>
<br>
   I want to play these dungeons, I really really do.  But I also don't want to be oom for  the whole time because we are constantly moving forward, as if we were all bards or melees with little or no mana requirements.<br>
<br>
  I dunno what I'm going to do.  /cry <p>-- <br>

The LDoN dungeons are a completely new ballgame so naturally it will take a few adventures under everyone's belt before the majority of folks get the hang of it.  Pickup groups won't be so bad then.   <br>
<br>
I also think that player skill will be a major factor in how well the group does.  I've read numerous complaints on this board from folks that EQ has been dumbed down over the years.  Folks levelled up fast in Paludal, Dreadlands, Velks, Valor, etc.  So your gonna run into folks who have rarely ever hunted in dungeons before.  Even if folks did a lot of dungeon crawling before LDoN, there is still a lot to learn, especially in regards to the traps.  Dealing with traps effectively could spell the difference between winning and losing a dungeon.   Also, how many casters already have their detect/disarm trap and open lock spells?  I haven't gotten enough points yet to buy any.  Once casters start getting those spells and learning how/when to use them, the dungeons should become easier.<br>
<br>
You can't always assemble the &quot;perfect&quot; group so to me I like the challenge of winning an adventure with a non-standard group.   The devs have stated on numerous class boards that the 90 minute window is plenty of time to complete an adventure, assuming you play smartly.  This even accounts for non-standard group composition. <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

We successfully completed our quest though.<br>
<br>
First, when the group formed I started buffing my new compatriots, halfway through buffing the leader accepted the quest. Oh crap 30 minutes to get from BB to Mistmoor! The group takes off, I'm at half mana, only half the group is buffed. We get to the entrance with 25 minutes to spare. Do we stop, finish buffing, med to full, then go in at full strength?<br>
<br>
No. We run in half buffed, healer at half mana, with wrong spellset memmed.  At the entrance I stop the group for a sec to get my group healer spellset memmed. Before I was done memming the spells the tank was already engaged in the next room.<br>
<br>
It made for a pretty exciting adventure though. I never got above 20m the whole time. Thank heavens for Canni.<br>
<br>
I definately learned a few lessons in mana management last night. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=776125" target="top">-Jahvah</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Two of them were succesful with the third failing due to lack and haste not allowing us to kill mobs fast enough in my opinion.  Maybe I am just getting lucky with the people I get, but most  seem to be pretty compentent about thier abilities and what to generally not do. i.e. stay back from the pulling area because mob aggro radius is huge, clerics, bards, enchanters knowing how to approach a room carefully to set up a pull, casters knowing how to manage thier mana, root capable casters knowing how to effectively root CC and pet classes knowing when to /pet back off etc...<br>
<br>
The only really bad experiance I have had so far that might have caused havoc was on a Raj run last night and the rogue in the group just couldn't seem to stay back even though he knew many of the mobs saw invis.  At one point he aggroed and entire room on us and almost caused a wipe.  Luckily, only he died.  Amazingly, even after doing that and being asked to stay back, he didn't get the point and kept doing it.  That no further trains were caused I attribute to the sheer mercy of the gods.<br>
<br>
Other than that one instance, I have been very happy with the people I have grouped with and have added a few of them to friends because of the sheer skill and common sense they have shown.  So far I have met an awesome bard puller, one rock solid trap killing rogue, two clerics with obvious pacify experiance and two necroes that that know how to dungeon kite adds effectively without drawing adds.  Very solid and valuable skills to have around in my humble opinion. Couple these abilites with people who can keep thier heads in stressful situations and do thier jobs effectively I am very glad I had the chance to meet them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Without LDoN I probably would not have met these people since I have fallen into the habit of grouping only with a few choice friends and guildies lately.  Not having a guild in the past few weeks has really limited some of my grouping opportunities and I very much appreciate the chance to meet some skilled players I probably would have otherwise not had the chance to.<br>
<br>
With regards to pull speed it has to be said that if you need to med more than once or twice, you probably won't be able to complete the run on time. In the runs I have been on so far though healer mana has not been a problem at all even with the clerics not being able to med much due to being on pacify duty. That being said, the mobs I have fought so far have hit very weak for the 65 level groups I have been in so the healers have really only been taxed when we have had CC trouble on adds. <br>

<br>
Maybe the rogue was incompetent, but a rogue has to go ahead to scout for traps, otherwise the group will walk on them before the rogue spots them. What's more, remember that see invis mobs do not necessarily see a non SoS rogue; I have been to Miraguals, Mistmore and Guk so far. Most of the mobs in Miraguals couldn't see me, virtually all of the mobs in Guk couldn't see me, non in Mistmore could that I found. I failed sneak hide now and again. When it fails its probably because:<br>
<br>
a) There was a rare see through sneak and hide mob that was just around a corner and you couldn't see until you ran slap bang into it.<br>
b) You set off a trap, causing hide to drop. This is very easy to do - reset timer on sense traps button is too long, so if you're moving at all fast (as you will be) then you can quite easily miss a trap through no fault of your own.<br>
c) You failed hide sneak - it seems to fail once in a while for no apparent reason, I think this is equivelent of a skill failure.<br>
<br>
Now, Miraguals I scouted ahead and I agroed once or twice (large agro radius didn't help =/ ), but I also disarmed every trap on route, one of which was a very powerful DoT, to say nothing of my scouting ahead meaning that mobs could be pacified, wrong turnings avoided etc. so I think I was right to scout ahead.<br>

We stopped and medded several times, and didn't really feel that rushed. Sure, we knew we needed to get a move on, since there wasn't anything popping up to impede our progress. I got excellent xp - 23% for an hour and half of work at 60 isn't bad at all.<br>

I have only been on a meager three runs now and the hardest I have been hit is for 360.  The other two times the mobs have maxed in the mid 200s.  The dungeon I was in that I was getting hit for 360s, the group I was in was average level 64 so I don't think level was the deciding factor that time.  Maybe just the luck of the draw?<br>

We did three adventures in a row, seek and destroy, gather, seek and destroy. All three were successful.<br>
<br>
Communication was great, and everyone listened. We hurried, but did not rush. The Gather mission was a cake walk and we had lots of time to spare. But we used all the time to complete the Assasination missions. They took most of the 90 mins to complete safely. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~mcjohnson/images/EQ/sig55.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Has anyone else noticed how difficulties seem to vary a lot? I just noticed this in a group we had today.<br>
<br>
My experience at the time was: Rescue - very difficult. Assassination - very easy.<br>
<br>
So the first mission that came up was assassination, and I say great that's pretty simple, and someone else says Nooooo! Assassinations are very tough!!<br>
<br>
So then up comes rescue, and I say Noooooo! Rescue missions are very tough!! And someone else says Bah rescue missions are easy peasy.<br>
<br>
And just reading all the experiences that people have had, seems like there's a lot of discrepancy between which ones are easier or harder.<br>
<br>
I was wondering... maybe there is a little bit of random difficulty factored in? It would explain how there can be so many different opinions.<br>
<br>
Or maybe certain types of missions are difficult in certain places?<br>

I also agree with Teapray:  LDoN does require at least moderately clever tactics and cooperation.  It's not like mindlessly bashing single-pulled golems in PoV.<br>
<br>
I tried two groups last night, my first forays.  The first group had a few friends/ good players, but was badly balanced (RNG, RNG, WIZ, WIZ, CLR, DRU).  In the Everfrost dungeon, we got our arses handed to us multiple times.  In the very first room.  Turns out I can't tank unslowed multiple frostfoot soldiers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The second group was quite different.  Very talented players (not including me!), consisting of RNG, BRD, BRD, ENC, CLR, and NEC.  We did a gather mission in Mistmoore, and utterly destroyed everything we saw.  Finished with tons of time to spare.<br>
<br>
I had a blast.  The dungeons looked good, the critters looked better, we got some decent drops and the time limit made it interesting.  I believe I'm now a LDoN Junkie. <p>Hunter Gyre Redbranch<br>

We didn't finish our mission (gathing ice in everfrost dungeon) but we didn't wipe either and had fun.  I also have to say that the experience was rather nice.  I was bit startled when I heard myself get promoted to 45... I certainly didn't expect that I would be getting it tonight.  I think part of the problem may have been that I was in a group of only five.  But I would be happy to group with any of those five anytime again.<br>
<br>
    So... yeah... I do think that the missions are a bit hard.. but even without winning, they can be worth it.  It is nice to get out of the &quot;only hunt with Lenny routine&quot;.   I hope I get to meet even more players this way.  And I have to accept that I might have some bad experiences, or cause them myself. <p>-- <br>
