<br>
City of Mist Raid on 9th March was a good success.<br>
We had 2 Jade Reavers drop.<br>
<br>
Now the hard part.  Apolgies.<br>
<br>
Firstly, I'd like to point out that this was my first time running a raid like this - and as much as I'd thought I prepared with the information I put on our website - www.wolvesofantonica.co.uk - -<br>
I didn't say enough.<br>
<br>
before I am shot down in flames I'd like to explain the looting of the Reavers, and the rolling.<br>
<br>
This is a little confusing, but this is how it happened.<br>
In future, I will not let this happen again!<br>
<br>
firstly, the raid started to break up, and people left before rolling on the reavers - a druid called Negerdar, I know for one.<br>
<br>
On the website, I talked about if more than one dropped, I'd like to take one if no one objected.  Up until the mess with the rolling, that was my intention.<br>
So, the roll was for the one remaining reaver - and believe it or not,  abraxxas rolled in the high 800's to win?.  Someone started complaining about people rolling for alts - then someone else rolled I think and scored a cool 1000 out of 1000!  Now, no one mentioned anything about rolling for alts to me, so I said that, and neglected to include that random.  To complicate things more, I then rolled for Negerdar after confirming I would.  Negerdat scored over 900 and wins.<br>
Then I get a few flaming tells saying they've never been on a raid where they couldn't roll for Alts, etc.  So, I had to think quickly.  I decided that this was exploitable on the spot, as every man and his dog would suddenly have a druid or ranger alt - honestly!  So, I decided the fairest thing I could do was stick to my oroginal decision, and let Negerdar have the Jade Reaver.<br>
<br>
It was obvious that people were not happy - and I am sure some left the raid at this point.  But I decided to give up my Jade Reaver for everyone and their Alt to roll on.  There was not a huge number of rolls, and I got 933 for myself, and rolled something pitiful for poor buvin.<br>
People thought this was for me - but I had to correct them, and I'm sure my credibility was going down faster than the Titanic.<br>
<br>
Then Brackin (Is that the warrior's name?) admitted that he doesn't have an Alt, and that he did not know what he was rolling for.  Great! What a mess!<br>
So, Come the end of the second roll, on MY reaver - the results ended up as they were at the beginning!<br>
Odds on that happening again in my lifetime?  Who knows.<br>
<br>
But let me assure you, this mess won't happen again.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I upset anyone with my actions, but I did warn you all from the start that this was my first!<br>
<br>
I learned an aweful lot this night, and I want a special thankyou to go to Sylenn who came along against all odds to ensure we had a rogue present.  <br>
Thanks Also to Antoin for all his help in the thick of the action.<br>
Thanks to everyone for making this the success it was.  <br>
<br>
I'm so, so, sorry it didn't start as I posted, and even worse, had to fight with the raid feature to get everyone in.<br>
<br>
Sorry for any problems. stress, and anxiety I might be responsible for.  I'm hoping that in the next week or so, I will reflect on this, learn from it - and perhaps you guys might find it in your hearts to raid with me once more.<br>
<br>
At least I'll never be rolling on the reaver again!<br>
<br>
1000 humble apologies.<br>
<br>
Guildor<br>

Unless the alt is there taking part in the battle. I've never been on an open raid that any Jade Reavers were reserved. Private raid sure but an open raid the reaver drops are too sporadic to reserve them. Sounds like you had alot of blue server trash raiding with you trying to put one over on you.<br>
Lastly, if someone can't stay for the whole raid, they don't get a roll. It's unfair to those who put in the four to six hours to roll against someone who was there for two or three.<br>
<br>
Simply put:<br>
Stay to the end to roll<br>
No alts unless they were with the raid<br>

<br>
I have.  It just has to be announced in advance.  In fact I got my jade reaver in a pick up raid there where the first jade reaver was reserved for a 65 druid.  After it dropped we stayed to clear the remaining reavers and a second dropped!!  Since I was the only other ranger/druid there I didn't even have to roll on it.<br>
<br>

<br>
I agree with these sentiments, but such things have to be decided by raid leader and announced in advance of the raid.  <br>
<br>
It sounds like the raid leader now knows now better to next time be sure to inform the participants of his raid of the loot rules to cover his arse. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

It is his/her responsibility to make sure the loot rules are announced well in advance so there is no confusion nor room for arguing over the loot.  <br>
<br>
So if I am leading a raid to Karnors and I want to reserve every single plague mite which drops, that is my perrogative.  I must be certain to make sure everyone knows that this is my intention though.  <br>
<br>
Of course, this also means that those who think about attending really ought to agree with the raid's rules before signing up.  Otherwise they should not attend.  And if they are joining a raid spontaneously where there might be a drop for their epic, it would be in their best interest to ask about the drop and how it would be distributed before they go too far with the raid.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it sounds like you handled the loot distribution well as the only point disputed was the epic drop and that was only because of a communication error on multiple parties.  The fact that you offered your reserved epic piece to be randomed shows that you are honorable.<br>
<br>
<br>
As it stands, I always put the clause in the loot section of my raid posts, &quot;If an alt or a guildie wants a particular piece of loot, that alt or guildie must be in the raid and actively participating.&quot;  I also do allow those who leave early but have done enough to earn their keep to proxy roll on items and say so in my raid posts.  It all depends on the rules the raid leader makes. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/Oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Koada'dal Illusionist of the 52nd Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kentassolgaard>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eats Halflings</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/12/03 12:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=449.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.personal.psu.edu/btk120/antoin.gif width=68 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> You're welcome</span><hr size=1> Guildor--the only reason one of the enchanters was to roll on our &quot;combined&quot; raid last time is that she was supposed to take her druid but we needed her enchanter.

Basically, yes.  You're supposed to only roll on druids and rangers that show up.  I could have rolled for Kimaya if I wanted to toy with you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
