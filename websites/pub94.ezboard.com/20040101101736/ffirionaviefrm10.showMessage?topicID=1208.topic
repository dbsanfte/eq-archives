Still under the covers, the boy did not want to move at first. Remembering that he wanted to be brave like his father, the boy slowly pushed the sheets away from his face and looked into the dark.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The man in the tattered, black cloth and hood walked throught the small village at night. He stopped in the middle of the village and slowly turned from one side to the other, looking around himself at all the surroundings. Houses made of wood and hopes; a well in the middle of the village and a large, single windmill for grinding wheat. The sound of the cloth blades of the windmill turning in the strong breeze and the rustle of the trees was all the man could hear. The guards had fallen asleep from the special blend of herbs the man in the tattered cloak had given them to smoke. A &quot;gift&quot; as he befriended them with small talk of crops and women.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The boy sat up in bed, determined to be brave like his father, a ranger of the elves of Kelethin. The boy's family had moved away from the elven homeland, to trade and prosper before returning to Kelethin, home of the wood elves. <br>
<br>
The boy found himself facing a man. A man sitting on the chair in the corner of the small room, watching the boy silently in the dark. He was a human wearing black cloth that draped over his body like a long cape, with the hood pulled up over his head, hiding his upper features with shadow. The boy's elven eyes could see the man in the dark of the room, yet the shadow under the hood still hid most of the man's face. From what the boy could see, the man was clean shaven, with strong features and piercing grey eyes. <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The man in the black cloth and hood, slowly walked through the small village. He placed small amounts of special herbs near each home. The smell of the herbs carried by the breeze to spread throughout the village. People asleep and resting, fell deeper into the dark behind their eyelids, from which they could not awake. <br>
The stranger stood still. <br>
Unmoving. <br>
Waiting with an inhuman patience, for the herbs to take their full effect. <br>
Standing still like a statue in black, in the center of the village.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The elven boy did not cry out in alarm. He wanted to be a hero and fight this stranger himself. The reality of him being a boy who stood little chance of fighting an adult, did not occur to him. Dreams of courage and not believing in their own mortality, made children brave. The man in the black cloth and hood slowly started to talk in a low, cultured voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will one day be a hero, who did not wish to be anything but a simple person with a simple life. You will one day rush into the darkness under a mountain, to save a village girl who became lost. You will lose a part of your soul on purpose. You will make a deal with death and decay to save the life of the girl... when you find there are no options left in the dark under the mountain. In the dark, where even your beloved goddess cannot help you beyond the magic she gives you, for all people must walk life on their own, yet evil will always try to make a deal.&quot; The man's voice was strong and patient, with no rush to finish what he had to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;The girl will be saved and safe. The monsters under the mountain will not kill you...and you will become a monster.&quot; said the man in the dark. &quot;You will do terrible things, Relias.&quot; The boy could only listen, as he felt hypnotised by the voice. &quot;You will be known by another name and see through different eyes. A man with half a soul, lost on purpose to protect your own plans... which turn dark. A man who still has visions of sunlight and trees. A man who faintly remembers his past life as a faded dream.  A man who serves death.&quot; The stranger in the corner of the room stopped speaking and just watched the boy with grey eyes, then he was gone. The boy blinked his eyes and wondered if he was half awake with his mind still stuck in a dream.<br>
<br>
This was one hundred years ago.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hours had passed. The night was beginning to die as the sun struggled to be reborn. The bodies of the villagers hung from the trees like horrid decorations for a village faire. Some of them hung upside down, tied by the ankle. Others hung by the neck. Dead long before they were strung up like criminals to be executed. They never awoke, as the stranger plunged the dagger down swiftly through the darkness and rays of moonlight and into the villagers hearts.<br>
<br>
The man in the tattered, black cloth and hood, a funeral shroud stolen from a tomb of nobles, slowly walked with a calm demeanor out of the village of the murdered.<br>
<br>
<br>
Under a city of hope, in a hidden world of death and decay, the man in the black cloth and hood performed a spell. The spell came to life with a dagger that shed the blood of one hundred innocent victims. The man performing the spell was given a vision. A vision of how to create a powerful servant. To create a general for an army that would help the man take over the cult that trained him. An army to serve his will and his will alone. Defying even his master if needed. The man in the tattered shroud, walked out of the dark under the city and onto a road on the land above. The first step on a long journey.<br>
<br>
At a residence that is home to many dark souls and dark minds, there is a knock on the front door. A servant watching over the residence, opens the door and speaks to the guard of the front gates. A visitor arrived in the rain, in the middle of the day. A visitor who wishes to speak with a young woman of dark elven descent. The servant walks in the rain, hunched over and irritated, towards the front gate.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot; the servant shouts. Trying to make his voice clear through the pounding of the rain. The stranger just stands there for a moment. Silent and unmoving. Wearing a tattered, black funeral shroud that functions as a cloak and hood. The upper half of his face hidden in the shadow of the hood; his grey eyes watching. The faintest hint of a smile is on his face. The faint smile of someone who knows somthing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to speak to the woman called Minru.&quot; said the stranger at the gates. His cultured voice patient, low but not deep. &quot;My name is Morcrin.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

She stared blankly at the mirror.  The sparkle was gone from her violet eyes.  She was alone again.  He had been called on yet another mission.  He explained it all to her a hundred times, and she knew in her mind that he had to leave.  But it was always the same feeling of emptiness and doubt.  Would he ever return?  Would he remember her?  Would he feel the same?  Would there be anything left?  Shaking her head, she looked out the window for a sign of hope that he would be returning.  Something… anything.  How she hated these gray, rainy days!  The lack of sunshine outside only served to sour her mood further.<br>
<br>
There was a knock at her door.  “Lady Minru, a man is here to see you at the front gate,” the servant announced and shuffled off.<br>
<br>
“Oh!! Xoner,” she said to her skeleton, “a man!!  Maybe he has returned from his mission.  Maybe he has come back to see me again!”  Hurriedly checking herself in the mirror, her words came in a rush, “We must make sure that I look stunning for him.  I wonder if he will like my new dress.  Its not black anymore, but I fancy how this dress matches my lipstick perfectly.  Yes, I am ready.  Stay here please.  You know he’s not so fond of you, with your habit of stealing his kills.  I think it is best if I see him alone.”  She ran out of her room, and almost tripped running down the stairs.<br>
<br>
Words could not express her disappointment as she approached the front gate and saw the partially shrouded figure.  Too pale to be Teir’dal, too tall to be an elf.  It was a human!  Panic struck her mind.  Maybe this is a messenger to tell me of his demise.  Maybe he won’t come back.  <br>
<br>
Trying to compose herself, she walked slowly and gracefully towards the robed figure.   She approached him with a forced smile, “Hello stranger, I was told that you were here to visit me.  To what do I owe the honor?” <p><center><img src="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/sigs/minru.jpg"/></img></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/28/03 2:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dreams in the Dark</span><hr size=1> The man with half a soul, watched the elven woman approach him in the rain. Looking down at her, he did not move. His face oddly calm. His grey eyes studied her features and his mind recalled faint images of a memory. A faded dream of another time, another place.<br>
<br>
He was not himself in this dream. He was not a human who served a god of death and decay but a hero.<br>
 An elf.<br>
 Blurry images of the dark elf woman's beautiful face. Magic and pain. A desperation to survive and save.....someone. The tattered pieces of the dream that was a memory, shatter with the sound of thunder from the sky and rain all around him. The storm makes the raindrops flow around like sheets in the wind.<br>
<br>
&quot;You look uncomfortable in the rain.&quot; The man with half a soul says simply, calmly. With a low, patient voice. <br>
&quot;Perhaps...you would feel more comfortable inside...by a fire?&quot; <br>

A stranger was here and inviting himself in to talk.  Why would he want her to be comfortable?  Bad news, no doubt.  But what?  What would this stranger tell her?<br>
<br>
&quot;Comfort is a rare commodity these days, stranger.  But I would be amiss not to invite you in to hear what you find so important to come here to tell me on such a bleak day.  While you go about telling me whatever you have to say, please don't forget to let me know your name, as our servant neglected this bit of information.  Come inside and have a seat.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Minru gracefully motions for him to come in and sit down in the guest hall.  She eyes the stranger warily, smiles again, and braces herself for the worst.<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you like a drink?  Perhaps a snack?  I believe there are barbarian shaped cookies, fresh out of the oven.

If he had known, would a man with half a soul cared? Who knows...<br>
He feels no need to speak at the moment. Neither out of politeness or necessity. His eyes roam over the walls and decorations of past victories Minru's league has seen. Echoes of their footsteps mingle with sounds of the residence, creating a soft, grim mealody to Morcrin's ears. <br>
<br>
Soon the warmth of a fire fills the guesthall and Morcrin removes the soaked, black cloth to let it dry. Grey, slightly worn traveling leathers cover his muscular form. His young, sharp features seem slightly at odd with his long, straight hair that has turned prematurely grey. As if his soul had aged while his body had not. He politley shakes his head &quot;No&quot; to the offerings of food and sweets.<br>
<br>
The man with half a soul, speaks casually as he leans against the wall by the fireplace. His grey eyes reflecting the fire as he watches the flames yet talks to Minru.<br>
&quot;I have not come to leave you with news, my lady.&quot; Morcrin says, his voice serious and blending with the sound of fire and wood popping under the heat.<br>
&quot;Rather...I have come with hope that you may be able to enlighten me.&quot; He stops leaning against the wall and faces Minru, taking a few steps towards her then stops a polite distance away. His hands together as if in deep thought. His piercing eyes on the dark elf.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Morcrin.&quot; he says simply. &quot; I am wondering about a man...who, as I understand it.....you knew.&quot;<br>
<br>
For a brief moment, there is only the sound of the fire.<br>
<br>
&quot;A man who was a leader of people and monsters.&quot; The man with half a soul takes one step forward then stops again. &quot; A man named Gray Hateborn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Far away, beyond the borders of the League of Shadows, in a graveyard almost forgotten by men and memory, three strange beings dig into the ground. Digging under the lifeless gaze of statues of the dead....<br>

Minru stared deeply at the flames, mesmerized by their movement.  Flames would always remind her of him – the wizard, the devoted follower of Solusek Ro.  Her thoughts drifted back to him on his current mission.  Yes, there is a chance that he could return and maybe, just maybe, there was a chance for things to be like they were before he left.  How many more times would he leave?  How many more times would she await his return?  <br>
<br>
The weight of Morcrin’s stare finally brought her out of her trance.  She hesitated, trying to choose her words carefully.  “Lord Regent Gray Hateborn, interesting.  I am not sure how much I can tell you that you have not already heard.  The tales of him have spread far and wide.  One more far-fetched than the next.  No doubt you already know that he once led this very League, or you would not have come here.”<br>
<br>
She spoke as one does when simply reciting facts memorized from a book, not from personal knowledge.  “Lord Regent Gray Hateborn, a human priest of Innoruuk, was raised as a boy in the Overthere after the death of his parents.  This, I know to be true.”  She paused again, took a sip of milk, and bit the head off of a barbarian shaped cookie.  “There are few other things about him where I have been able to sort out the fact from the fiction in the stories.  He was reputed as a ladies man, and I have heard that he had multiple wives.  I have heard strange stories of vampirism.  I do not know whether there is truth in these tales or not.”<br>
<br>
“There is one other fact that I know about him, and that is that he is no longer walking these halls.  Lady Didi D’Aryth now leads the League.  The tales of Lord Regent Gray’s disappearance are perhaps even more varied and bizarre than the stories about women.  Again, I have been only able to confirm one thing.  He disappeared after a battle with the League of Honour.  The rest is a mystery.  Some say he was taken prisoner.  Some say he is a slave.  Some say he is converted to the light.  The tales grow taller from one person to the next.”<br>
<br>
Minru looked at Morcrin, her eyes locking onto his.  “I, myself, am searching for answers about Gray.

The coffen of an unusual hero is pulled from the ground like some obsene child being born from the grave. The bones of a troll who stood above the rest of his race and became a hero, are taken along with the grave dirt in the dark.<br>
<br>
Sister.....<br>
the word hisses through Morcrin's mind like a snake. Vile plans. Dark ideas. Ideas for creating his general. All were dependent on one thing. All were dependent on one soul. Now Morcrin knew that one soul had a sister. <br>
<br>
 It didn't matter that the knowledge of her being related to Gray, made no sense to him at the moment. A dark elf related to a human in some way. All that mattered was that she was a connection to what Morcrin needed. Now, one of many questions was...how to use this knowledge.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are his sister you say?&quot; Morcrin replies with politeness. Neither his face nor his posture betraying the dark plans for her brother within his mind. &quot;Is there human in your blood or perhaps dark elven in his?&quot; he asks in a conversational tone, interested in knowing more about this woman. &quot;Or were one of you adopted?&quot; The idea of using the parents as leverage occured to Morcrin. Should the dark elven beauty appear to know more than what she was saying. If they still lived, that is. <br>
Morcrin almost smiled. Even if the parents did not still live, that is.<br>

Jewelry and gold taken from tombs could make a handsome profit. The mercenary arched his back and took a sip of old dwarvish ale to warm his stomach. His life was not an easy one, nor quite as hard as others. He was not the cutthroat some mercenaries were. Neither was he the hero with his head lost in the clouds, like some he knew. Scratching the stuble on his chin, the mercenary walked past the front gates, never thinking twice about them already being open. <br>
<br>
A raven cawed at him from an old tree growing over an even older grave. the mercenary looked up at the rain soaked bird. &quot;Not enough sense in ye to get out of the rain, eh?&quot; the mercenary chuckled. &quot;Stupid bird..&quot; he grumbled, then fished in his dirty pockets for a skipping stone to throw at the bird. Maybe if he hit it hard enough, he could have a little raven for dinner, instead of the swill at the local tavern. The raven cawed lowder at him, as if sensing his plans and becoming hostile itself. The mercenary snickered as he found and brought out the skipping stone. &quot;Stay right 'ere, little birdy. Ol' Gun is gonna just flip you this little stone and have some...&quot; the mercenary heard footsteps.<br>
<br>
&quot;She said, 'beloved, how art thou?'..she said to me.&quot; the  strange man covered in mud and walking among the graves whispered with a smile, as he approached the mercenary. Seemingly unaware or unconcerned for the sword at the mercenary's belt. &quot;What the Hate are you talkin'  'bout, you stupid man?&quot; the mercenary said in anger, dropping the stone and drawing his sword in one incredibly quick motion. The madman merely grinned with perfect teeth. He had a clean-shaven, handsome face some women would call beautiful. His eyes had an inner gleam that showed intensity and purpose. Cold with a smile. The strange man just stoped at the point of the mercenary's sword. Smiling, as the tip of the blade touched his throat and drew a faint drop of blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;He said I had a pretty face...&quot; stated a feminine voice behind the mercenary. Wistful and dreamy. <br>
The mercenary quickly moved to the side to keep the man in his sight but to also guard against a back attack. A slim woman in a dirty dress that used to be white, approached. Covering her face and upper body was a thin veil. A wedding veil, all muddy and tattered. The mercenary could see only a faint hint of her face behind the cloth but he could tell she was smiling. <br>
&quot;I said  ' thank you good sir. My name is Pretty Mary.  Would you like to touch me ? ' &quot; the woman said in her dream like voice. &quot;Then...I ate his face off.&quot; The woman lifted up the veil to reveal a beautiful face to make men dream... and teeth filed to sharp points. <br>
&quot;What the Hate is this?&quot; the mercenary yelled. &quot;You two lovers mad?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not mad...&quot; a deep voice said from the dark beyond two large gravestones. &quot;Quite the opposite, really. Quite bright, really. Quite deadly, really.&quot; the deep, grateing voice was far too intelligent to be coming from the creature that emerged from the shadows.  Eight feet tall. Red eyes that glowed out from under the shade of a black hood. Large, long ears that reached to a point. Grey chainmail and an ornate belt decorated with human skulls. The troll looked slightly different from others of it's kind. Almost like a dark, giant, green skinned version of the fey. His beastial face showed an unusual amount of intelligence. He carried a mace strapped to his side but had no other items on him that would belong to a fighter. Instead, he had pouches of spell components and bones. <br>
He was something that somehow existed but never should have been. A troll who learned the Dark Arts.  Not a Shadowknight but a true Necromancer.<br>
<br>
The mercenary stepped back in surprise. Briefly forgetting about the two strange humans when seeing and understanding what he saw before him. Pretty Mary let the veil drop back down. &quot; Black Vach...do you think he likes me?&quot; she said with a giggle as she carefully approached the mercenary. &quot;Malga, would the dirty man like to speak to my bones? &quot; she asked the troll, then turned back to the mercenary only to see him running toward the rusty gates. Black Vach, the handsome human with a mad smile, was already upon the mercenary. Moving fast like a cat and cutting the back of the mercenary's legs, with long fingernails that cut too deep for nails. More like blades. The troll, Malga Syn, roared in laughter as the mercenary fell down. The troll kept his face turned up to the heavens. Letting the rain fall into his large, shark like mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't speak to my bones.&quot; Pretty Mary pouted, sounding sad. &quot;You didn't speak to my bones...and now they have something to say to you.&quot; <br>
Pretty Mary opened up her hand to reveal pieces of bone that began to glow. The bones then grew and flew out of her hand and formed into something unnatural. The mercenary tried to fight, waving his sword back and forth through the air. Crying out in defiance in the rain, as the skeletal pet of Mary, the man called Black Vach and the troll Necromancer closed in on him. The raven in the tree watched, as if pleased.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot; I have an interest in Necromancy.&quot; Morcrin stated. &quot;I also have an interest in lost items of yesterday. I found something. A mask. A mask made from the skull of a large, humanoid. A mask that has a special ability.&quot; The man with half a soul slowly paced back and forth in front of the fireplace, then finally sat down in a comfortable looking chair across from Minru. &quot;Some say the ability is useless. An ability that only works in the right place and only in the right situation. Despite the power of the ability, it's limited use in only the right situations, makes the mask seem....not worth the time to most.&quot; Morcrin looked at the dark elven beauty and smiled. &quot;But not to me.&quot;<br>
&quot;The mask can bring a soul, that is not departed from this world, back into a form that has been prepared for it. Out of an obsessive curiosity...I wish to see if this mask will truly work....and how I may use it to my advantage, should I need to.&quot; <br>
Morcrin looks at Minru, quietly for a moment. Watching her. Looking at her and as if &quot;through&quot; her. He notices her beautiful features and form as any man would but only lets it distract him for the briefest of moments. He did not travel here to play. Morcrin was a serious man, not a boy just learning about girls. Rather, he looks at her and judges her inner strength through her eyes. He always wanted to know a person's strengths and weak points. The better to kill them if it proved necessary. He did not know if he would need to kill Minru. He felt it would be a shame if he had to. That would not stop him though.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cast a spell to find a soul, a strong soul..the soul of a leader. To see if the mask can bring the soul back into a new form. I believe your brother is dead, Minru. I want to bring him back.&quot;<br>
Morcrin was quiet for a moment. &quot;Unfortunately...there are three other Necromancers who know of the mask....and want your brother's soul for their own ends. Three unusual...people. I met them on my travels and escaped from them. If your brother is truly dead but not gone from this world, they might, just might, have the wit and creativity to actually pull his soul to them and enslave him.&quot; Morcrin continued to explain in his patient voice. &quot; They are building a body, a golem of earth and bone, to host Gray's soul...as a slave. I do not know if they can truly do this. I know that they will try. If Gray truly is dead, they may attempt to find any physical remains left of his original body. The better to bring his soul to them.&quot; Morcrin finished speaking and sat quietly, calmly. Watching Minru.<br>
<br>
<br>
((OOC With the exception of Minru and Gray, i made up names for the three Necromancers and the mercenary. No connection meant to anyone playing with similar names. ))<br>

Her mind was a jumble.  She did not know what to think, or say, or do.  On the one hand, she naturally trusted those of the dark path, especially necromancers.  She saw too much useless bickering these days.  She knew in her heart that when all of those of the dark drew together, they would have a powerful force indeed.  On the other hand, this man worried her deeply.  This man spoke of her brother and wanting to bring him back for his own advantage.  He spoke of plots and plans of others.  It was all so complicated.<br>
<br>
She had dedicated her life to necromancy for one reason alone.  To find her brother and bring him back.  While others told her that her brother was alive, she knew in her heart that he had died on the battlefield that day.  She grew stronger in power day by day with the hope of restoring him to his former glory.  She did not want him enslaved, or a pawn of others.  She wanted to know the Gray that everyone talked about in the stories she heard.  She wanted the brother back that she never had.<br>
<br>
Minru stood up, and walked to the fire searching for answers that she could not find.  In the absence of direction, she decided to temper her reaction.  She spoke slowly and without emotion, “So, Morcrin, let me see if I understand you here.  You believe that my brother is dead and you wish to use a mask to bring his soul back into a new form.  You say there are others out there with the same belief that want to place his soul into a golem.  You say you want to use this mask to your own advantage.  Do I have this correct?”<br>
<br>
She turned to face him again with a look of defiance in her eyes.  “Could you tell me then, Morcrin, what form that you wish my brother to inhabit and why your form is any better for my brother’s soul than the golem of these other necromancers?  And where do I fit in to all of this anyway?” <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/5/03 1:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dreams in the Dark</span><hr size=1> Morcrin calmly walked toward the fireplace, listening to the dark elf speak as he did so.  He picked up the large, black funeral shroud that functioned as a cloak and hood and seeing that the shroud was dry, wrapped it around himself. The Necromancer simply turned and faced Minru without moving otherwise. His grey eyes looked at the dark elven woman through the shadow of the the hood. &quot;.....Yes.&quot; he said almost too quietly. <br>
<br>
&quot;You understand enough. ....Although...... the form your late brother controls is not important to me. I only wish to know that the mask works.&quot; the Necromancer talks in an almost low voiced purr. &quot; I have not picked a form for him. I prefer to face one problem at a time.&quot;<br>
&quot; His name.... was the name that appeared in my mind from the whispering of shadows....the spell I used to find a soul that fit the description... that the mask could bring back.&quot; Only his eyes moved when he talked. Following Minru should she move. &quot;I wanted to understand more of the soul I will try reincarnate. To understand something...is to have more influence over something.&quot; Morcrin nodded slightly and slowly as he spoke to give emphasis to his words.<br>
&quot;The more influence I have, the better chance I have of pulling Gray's soul from... wherever it is wandering.... or traped.&quot;<br>
Morcrin still had not moved from beside the fireplace. He stood like a statue, perfectly still.  &quot;What your brother chooses to do afterwards, if the mask works...is not my concern....nor my interest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as You.....&quot; The Necromancer said slowly. &quot;.....I had hoped you would know more about him. Your name also appeared in my mind from the spell. A link in the puzzle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So the question is...&quot; the man with half a soul said with almost a smile. &quot;...Where do you fit into all of...this.&quot; <br>
Somehow...the Necromancer did not state his words as a question.<br>
<br>

He was dangerous, at best, perhaps even deadly.<br>
<br>
“Well, I don’t believe there is anything else that I can add about my brother.  As I explained, we were separated at a very young age and I did not come to the League until after his disappearance.  What I know about him are merely stories from others, and I suspect those contain more fiction than fact by the sound of them.  Is there anything else that you wish to speak about today or are you ready to take your leave?  I see your cloak has dried.”<br>

The Necromancer just stood there silently, watching the dark elf woman with quiet, grey eyes from under the darkness of the hood. His face emotionless like a statue. Something was amiss. He couldn't quite put his finger on what was wrong.<br>
<br>
The woman called Minru seemed...almost eager to end the conversation. She expressed an interest in learning more about her brother...if she truly did not know him well...and she showed slight concern on what would happen to her brother should the mask work. But what was bothering Morcrin, was that she stopped asking questions. Questions about bringing her brother back from the dead. Questions about The Three. The unusual....unique Necromancers. <br>
She did not seem to be too interested in continuing a conversation regarding her brother. Her &quot;dear&quot; brother. Her dearly departed brother.<br>
<br>
This...bothered Morcrin. Something was wrong.<br>
<br>
There was always the possibility that Minru was simply a shallow socialite. A Tier'Dal woman who's only concern was gossip and drama. <br>
No. Looking into her eyes, Morcrin detected something more.<br>
<br>
Perhaps she was like most Tier'Dal and unconcerned with her brother's death and possible rebirth. After all, why should a dark elf, a child of Innoruuk, have any concern for anyone but herself?<br>
No. She expressed an interest in her brother earlier. She would not have pretended to know more about her brother just for the sake of a stranger asking about him. There was always the possibility of pretending to care but what would she have had to gain from pretending in front of a stranger?<br>
<br>
Perhaps she did not take him seriously? A stranger walking up and telling her he believes her brother is dead but not gone from this world. Then claiming he may be able to bring him back with a magical mask?<br>
Very possible. Tier'Dal were as arrogant as Erudites. A possibly fatal flaw but a flaw that was there non-the-less.<br>
<br>
The only other possibility Morcrin could think of, was that Minru knew more than what she was telling. Perhaps Minru had plans to follow him? Perhaps she had plans to take the mask and use it herself? This thought amused Morcrin, although he did not smile. <br>
<br>
Morcrin stood still and silent. Waiting for the dark elf to realise he was not following.<br>

<br>
&quot;Three questions....&quot; Morcrin said in a low whisper; his face calm and still. His eyes never leaving Minru. &quot;Where would Grey go if he wanted to be alone?&quot; the Necromancer paused for a moment. &quot;...and what happened to your parents?&quot; Morcrin waited for the dark elf to respond before he asked his third question.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Malga Syn, the troll Necromancer, placed a fresh human skull into a chest cavity of a large body of dirt, clay and bone.  He smoothed the dirt and clay around the skull, fixing it into place. &quot;You did give us entertainment.... yes, dead man?&quot; the troll chuckled to the skull. &quot;Now, you will help us make a toy soldier.&quot; Malga turned around to look at his two allies, Black Vach and Pretty Mary. &quot;Anything about the soul?&quot; Black Vach shook his head &quot;No&quot; and listened to the whispers in the wind. Pretty Mary sat looking at the cieling of the almost bare, underground room, singing to herself and smiling. She still had bloood and flakes of human flesh around her mouth. She had enjoyed eating the man in the graveyard. His screams were like wind chimes to her. Soothing to her soul. <br>
<br>
Malga looked around the room; at the dirt walls; the lighted lanterns and collection of skulls and skeletons held intact with wire. Some bones decorated the walls in patterns that made sense only to the mad or truly diabolical. In a corner of the room, resting on a crucified skeleton, the raven from the graveyard met the troll's gaze. It seemed as if the raven smiled.<br>

And now, this man stood before her asking some of the very same questions which she never was able to answer.  The thought was very distressing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where would Gray go if he wanted to be alone?&quot;  She repeated the question quietly to herself.  Minru sighed, and wished she knew.  She wished to know so many things about her brother.  The brother she never had.  What was his favorite color?  What was his favorite food and drink?  What was his life like after their parents died?  Was he treated well in the Overthere?  Was he forced to be a servant like she was?  Were all of the stories she heard about him true?  <br>
<br>
She looked at Morcrin and shrugged.  Very patiently, she begain to explain the situation yet again, &quot;I do not know where Gray spent his time.  We were separated at a very young age.  As for our parents, they are long since dead.  I was never told the manner of their death, if that is what you ask.  All I know is that it was sudden.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sat back in her chair, trying to judge the lack of reaction on Morcrin's face.  Why did he stand there like a rock?  Just what did this fellow have up his sleeve?  And, why in the world did he come here to talk to her?  She smirked slightly, wondering if he was becoming annoyed with her lack of ability to answer his questions and toyed with the idea of making up a story to satisfy his curiousity.  But, what would she say?<br>
<br>
&quot;I fear there is little I am able to tell you regarding your first two questions.  Perhaps I can be of further assistance on the third?&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/11/03 1:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dreams in the Dark</span><hr size=1> &quot;.....I see.&quot; said the man with half a soul. He walked away from the fireplace and towards a window and looked outside. his eyes scanned the horizon through the window. Watching the storm fade away like spent smoke. the sound of rain grew distant and finally, quiet. Morcrin would go over her words in his head later. He would find some way to grab Gray's soul. there was always a way. Just a matter of finding out &quot;How&quot;.<br>
<br>
He turnmed slightly to look towards minru but not at her. &quot;My last question?&quot; He paused for a moment. &quot;What form would you like your brother to have....if the mask works, of course.&quot;<br>
<br>
He slowly walked to the doorway, giving the dark elf enough time to answer; not looking at her as he walked by. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A> at: 12/15/03 12:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysticlioness>MysticLioness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Demon Damsel<br>

Given the tales of his exploits with women, he should be fine in any form other than a masculine siren, I should think.  We don't need gaggles of naked women running around the League halls.  It would be such a bother to weave through the crowds back to my room.&quot;  She grinned evilly and added, &quot;Although perhaps on second thought, the males in the League would like that.  Some of them have been so grumpy as of late.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped as they reached the exit, &quot;Very well then Morcrin, this was a most <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>unique</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> visit that you paid me.

He believed she was acting unconcerned and yet, he almost felt as if she did not take him or the act of resurrecting her brother seriously enough. The Necromancer almost smiled. He knew of a way to gain more information about Grey Hateborn. Tempting to try the more violent approach...but Morcrin may need her alive someday. He paused for a moment before he spoke; thinking of the words to say. <br>
&quot;Since you appear to have little interest in bringing your brother back...or you do not believe I can do so....then you would not mind leaving me a drop of your blood in this vial.....would you?&quot; He could not hide the sarcasm in his level voice, holding up a small, glass vial. &quot;The small portion of your essence may help me.&quot; He did not expect her to comply. He just wanted to see her reaction..or what reaction she would hide. In his mind, he was already planning on what to do. He already had in mind, whom he would contact to assist him.<br>
<br>
Lady Minru would not like what would happen later. Morcrin did not care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysticlioness>MysticLioness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Demon Damsel<br>

That very life essence could resurrect, refresh mana, and even harm another.  She had even been doing experimentation with other uses.  Perhaps the blood of a necromancer would be just what she was seeking for her most recent attempts to advance the art of necromancy.  Perhaps it would be strong enough.<br>
<br>
Gaining the blood of another was typically a somewhat simple matter if small amounts were needed.  Small accidents usually proved the best source of collection.  Just a little bit of the right type of poison and a tiny wound would yield a decent sample.  She did not put it past Morcrin to try this on her, as she had done to countless others.  No, better to try to make an arrangement where she would cooperate while gaining his blood in return.<br>
<br>
She let out a laugh.  &quot;My blood you say?  I do not know how my blood will assist in the matter regarding my brother with whom I share no blood ties.  However, I am always needing new blood for my experiments, so I shall make you a deal if you wish.  An exchange as it were... my blood for yours, in equal amounts, at the same time.  What do you say?&quot;<br>
<br>
She pulled a dagger and a vial out of her robe and waited for his response. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=odyessy7>Odyessy7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/22/03 2:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dreams in the Dark</span><hr size=1> The Necromancer admitted to himself he was surprised. He did not expect her to comply. He thought she was clever and now he knew. <br>
<br>
Morcrin knew the risk of giving her his own blood. His essence could be used in any number of ways. He needed the information her blood could give him though, should the spell work. He thought for a moment, looking at her. What was she planning?<br>
<br>
Morcrin drew his own dagger to draw his blood, not trusting Minru's blade. The weapon could be poisoned for all he knew. Carefully, he cut his arm and let his blood drip into the vial he held; the vial he originally intended for the dark elf's blood. As he watched his essence fill the glass container, his mind began to form a plan. He knew how he would use Minru's blood to help him capture Grey's soul. He also knew he could use Minru's blood to send her a little...surprise. She may become a threat to him in the future. He would take care of that.<br>
<br>
When he was finished, he stopped the flow of his blood and holding the vial, waited for the dark elf to do the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1208.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1208.topic&start=41&stop=50>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1208.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1208.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1208.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1208.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1208.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1208.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
