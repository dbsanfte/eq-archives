Seeking to avoid the judgemental opinions of elves and humans alike, they made their home in the Qeynos Hills. They were made welcome there, and in the city of Qeynos itself, whose people are fair and noble.<br><br>When I was 6, a raiding force of gnolls from blackburrow raided our hamlet. Everyone was slaughtered, including my poor parents. I hid in a haystack. I was found by a druid called Holly Windstalker. She took me to an orphanage in the city of Qeynos.<br><br>At the age of 12, I left the orphanage and travelled to Surefell Glade, there to learn the ways of the druids. Holly guided my ways, showing me the power that Karana had to offer. For several years, I ranged the Hills hunting the gnolls that had interfered with my fate.<br><br>When I was 14, a chance encounter with a wizard called Tithianus led me on a long journey. She was going to the land of the Elves and I asked if I could accompany her. Together we made the dangerous journey across the Karana Plains, through Highhold Pass to Freeport. Freeport; that scar upon the face of Antonica. I was glad to leave that repungent city. We took the boat across to Butcherblock, and so came at last to the Faydark, where we parted company.<br><br>I had hoped to find some sense of companionship there. Felwithe did not welcome me. The high elves sneer on those whose heritage is broken, and are often arrogant. It comes, I think, of being a race without purpose. How they envy the wood and dark kindreds. The woodelves were scarcely more welcoming but at least gave me the opportunity to prove myself against the orcs of Crushbone. I shared many battles with them, my half kin, and I became trusted.<br><br>It was in butcherblock, when I was 17 years old, that I met the dwarf Coinfist Heavyhand and joined the conspiracy. I made the resolution and he said that he would call upon me when the time came.<br><br>After another 8 years of adventures, the word came that the conspiracy was nigh unto revealing itself. At that time, I made my first journey to Velious, where for the past two years I have been fighting in the wars under the banner of Resolution.<br><br>In recent weeks, I have much considered the song that Holly used to sing to me when I was a child.<br><br>The sun shall travel to Southern lands<br>A dwarf will make a kingdom with his hands<br>The trees of the Glade will be draped in snow<br>The Ice shall begin to Northwards flow<br>The great clowns lair will be found<br>The king of giants will be drowned<br>The sea will rise and the forests flood<br>Blood will be spilt to wash away blood<br><br>The water is rising.

That reminds me. I have not visited my mentor Hagar Sureshot in a long time.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>My name is Maxvs Wolftracker, I am a ranger.<br>- Loyal follower of Karana the rain caller.<br>- Friend of the wolves.<br>- Protector of the bears.<br>- Restorer of the land.<br>- Wielder of many weapons.<br>- Deliverer of justice with my bow and arrow.<br>- Retriever of the corpses of my fallen comrades.<br>- I lure of evil beasts to my friends so we can slay them in the name of good.<br><br>Both of my parents were rangers from Surefall Glade. That is where I was born. My first memory of home is of me standing in the middle of the forest. It is raining and I am in almost complete darkness, with only a candle to guide my way. A kind fellow told me I should go outside and kill a fire beetle and keep his eye. I did not know what a fire beetle looked like. With a lot difficulty and with the help of a stranger I made it trough the tunnel to Qeynos Hills. There I met the guards and some other young rangers. I saw my first fire beetle and decided to attack him. With a lot of struggle I managed to kill him and got his eye. I thought the fire beetle eye was great. I could see much better in the dark. I believe this was the first time I used that low-level sword.<br><br>I was raised by Hagar Sureshot. He took care of me after both my parents were killed. He has been a good friend and mentor to me. You can often see him at the archery range teaching young rangers. He taught me a lot about combat skills, tracking and fletching. I make it a point to go visit him every few seasons and he always has something new for me to learn.<br><br>I do not remember much about my parents. They both died when I was very young. But Hagar knew them well and he often tells me stories about them. One day he told me how they died. It was during a raid on Vox the dragon. He tells me it was quite amazing to see both of my parents fight together. It was as if their minds were one. During the raid they were part of a bank of rangers strategically located between the casters and the dragon. They were both perfectly synchronized shooting arrow after arrow at the beast. They loaded their bows over and over with godlike speed and grace. Suddenly, the casters started yelling for help. Vox started to attack them. Without saying a word, they put their bows down simultaneously and displayed their dormant blades. They ran to the aid of the casters in the blink of an eye and started slashing at Vox. The dragon was in pain and turned to my parents, allowing the group of casters to evacuate. But now, without the casters the raid had no chance for success. By this time other dragons came to the aid of Vox. Resistance was futile. The rest of the raiding party ran for safety while my parents held back the dragons. My parents never made it. I was told that later scouts were sent in camouflage to retrieve their corpses. But the corpses were not there. It is believed the dragons took it upon themselves to incinerate the remains. With tears running down my face I swore I would avenge my parents’ death. I patiently await this day.<br><br>Watch out Vox, I am coming for you.<br> <p><br><hr><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=221012>Maxvs Wolftracker</a><br>Weilder of Many Weapons<br>Pathfinder of 51 Seassons<br>House of Carnage<br></center><hr></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaeonii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeonii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/immortalkindred/images/colors.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 6:17:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> deleted</span><hr size=1> deleted <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaeonii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeonii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/immortalkindred/images/colors.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/30/02 1:08:09 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil<br>Look out! ...Rar!<br>New lizard Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 571<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 8:01:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kelisk's Story</span><hr size=1> He was born, he's served the Empire, he'll die serving them (probably).

At the age of maturity, sent to the Court of Pain to begin training as a Swifttail. After Years of apprenticeship, sent out into the world to prove worthiness. Hunts with his crechemates, brothers and sisters, all given different apprenticeships. After a few years, honing skills close to home, went wandering farther afield.<br><br>First exposure to non-Iksar.... fear and lothing, disgust at their weakness both physical and moral. First exposure being the short pointy-eared invaders of Kunark, both blueskinned and pale. Forced to interact with some, to obtain needed supplies far from home, encounters language barriers. Chose to learn some languages, rather than starve. More interaction with non-Iksar learning their tongues. Sees some admirable traits in a few of these softskins, begins to wonder.<br><br>Interaction becomes more frequent, actually hunts with some softskins. Sees more admirable examples of all races, as well as the vile disgusting softskins who are spoken of by the Elders. Wonders at the dichotomy. First stirrings of pity for these less than Iksar beings.<br><br>Forms a guild with some friends, who bring along some non-Iksar &quot;friends&quot; of theirs... a disturbing concept, but his friends are Iksar, so to be trusted.<br><br>Meets a curious Human who sometimes claims to be an Iksar, trapped in the body of a human, sometimes claims to be Karana's Cleric to the Iksar, sent to convert the Empire. Obviously insane, but with some small talent as a healer.<br><br>Meets an Iksar who claims to be a Goblin, in the guise of an Iksar. Obviously insane, perhaps addled as an egg. She shows great prowess as a priestess, first true non-creche friend.<br><br>For a long period, hunting and training far from home, has little interaction with Iksar. Forced to interact more with the softskins, decides since they are to be slaves, they can be used, but sees more and more that is worthy of respect in some. Learns many tongues, masters a few. Truely begins to wonder at the dictates of his Elders. Comes to befriend some of these non-Iksar, long period of confusion.<br><br>Spends much time hunting alone, both near to home and far afield. Spends much time thinking about the Empire, and the softskins. Does not so much have an epiphany, as reaches a conclusion:<br><br>Still numbers many not of the Empire as friends, but realizes that the vision of the Elders is right, even his friends must one day be slaves to the Empire. But also believes the Elders are wrong, slaves can contribute to the Empire, they are like any other possession, some are useful, to be cherished, others not so useful, to be used up.<br><br>Sees no contridiction, other than with the beliefs of his fellow Iksar. Still seeks to solve this contradiction, as he is viewed as less than whole by many within the Empire, but still believes there is some worth in some non-Iksar.<br><br>Xethux<br><br><br><br> <p>Confrontation is the essence of nature, confrontation is the rythm of life.

One, that she was teir'dal. and two, that he'd loved the woman.<br><br><br>So, she followed Karana as a ranger, she became attached to a druid.  <br><br>When he'd had a bounty put on his head for the slaying of dark elves guarding the Nektulos forest, she decided to go seek out the one who'd placed the bounty, in hopes of giving her druid vital information....however, she fell in love with that dark elf, instead(damn the little blue skin guys*grin*).<br><br>And through a series of events, some of which being(and this is just her point of view, not necessarily what actually happened) those she called her family spweing more raw hatred than she'd ever seen, then turning their backs on her, and having the dark elf declare that he'd never loved her at all, that it was all just a trick, etc etc....she learned true, pure Hatred...and Karana took his magic from her.<br><br>Bereft of her love, AND her magic, she sought out a human she'd spoken to a good deal(Morgrist Vanadil, just to give credit where credit is due), and spoke with him about her life choices. <br><br>Even after hearing about what it would take, she chose to walk the path of Hate, and went through a purification ritual. <br><br>When she regained consciousness from the ordeal, she felt no magic within her, but instead, a pure, crystalline hatred...and then she was shown to the Dismal Rage, where she started training in the ways of sword dancing.<br><br><br>And so on and so forth, to today, etc, yada yada.<br><br>~Sar, the extremely longwinded. <p><center><b><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner">Sarhea Yigsawla</a></b><br><i>What I've felt, what I've known<br>Sick and tired, I stand alone<br>Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one that waits for you<br>Or are you unforgiven too?<br>Wandering warrior of <a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/banathema48379">Anathemat</a></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 2:58:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Jiren</span><hr size=1> I never thought of how Jiren was born. Essentially, he was born a normal man to normal parents. <br>Jiren was ambitious... to a fault. Picture the typical Shakespeare tragic hero, with one flaw that is his undoing. Such is Jiren and his ambition. <br>Ambition led him to marry above his station. Wasn't enough though. Ambition then led him to be easily possessed by a demon created by the combined energies of Cazic-Thule and Innoruuk. The demon called itself the Scourgefist. The Scourgefist first had Jiren train as a monk to be its own personal weapon. It suppressed most of his personality and engaged in whatever mayhem pleased it. Jiren was angry with himself, captive in his own body. Power is what he wanted, but it was not he who had power, but instead the Scourgefist. He slipped his spirit into meditation through his monkly training, which kept the Scourgefist from destroying it completely. With the energy he conserved, he called to a Shamaness. The Shamaness faced off with the Scourgefist finally, and exorcised the demon.<br><br>Unfortunately, the realization hit Jiren too late. Without the Scourgefist, he was normal. He had no power. His years of monkly training were stripped from him. He was miserable, without skill, poor, pathetic. He began to loathe himself and the Shamaness for &quot;freeing&quot; him. His ambition again hurt him. Never before had his longing for power seemed this far-fetched. Hatred for all that happened engulfed him, and that hatred spread to all around him. Innoruuk enjoyed this immensely. Jiren and he came to an &quot;understanding&quot; of sorts. Jiren would make the world hate and fear him, as long as Innoruuk provided the means to do so.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=korzax>Korzax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 5:29:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Is dat joo?</span><hr size=1> Born in the mountains,<br>Raised in the cave,<br>Blasting n' casting is all I crave.<br><br>nuff sed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 1059<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 10:02:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~ Love is for the Weak ~</span><hr size=1> Evil Born.<br>Evil Lived.<br>Evil Done.<br><br>Created from the very hatered of two people.
