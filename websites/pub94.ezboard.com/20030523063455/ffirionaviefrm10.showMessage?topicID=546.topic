The stories proved to be correct. As they approached the front of the building a figure appeared in the doorway wearing a tattered black dress.<br>
<br>
“Welcome, warriors of Marr!” The figure shouted eagerly. “I was just finishing breakfast, would you care to join me in some milk and biscuits?”<br>
<br>
Berkin had never seen a person radiate such power, it crackled around the figure like a cocoon, even the aura that surrounded Aggadon, his master, was muted by this display. He looked expectantly at the older paladin.<br>
<br>
“We have traveled far this day, and have already eaten, but we have brought some mammoth steaks with us from Everfrost, perhaps later we could share them with you.” Aggadon approached the female carefully. She had bone white hair that had not been washed in what seemed like ages, it hung limply, clumped together in waxy patches. Huge black circles surrounded the eyes making the face appear skull like. Broad shoulders and well muscled arms attested to a physical lifestyle, currently curtailed by her pregnancy.<br>
<br>
Her dress had decomposed further since the initial reports. The top of her dress had eroded away and her bloated breasts splayed onto her heaving stomach like two fat white maggots. Dried pus caked what remained of the dress, holding what was left together in a sort of stiff barklike skin. The stench of rot was nearly overpowering.<br>
<br>
“Yes, some meat would be wonderful. It has been too long since I have had anything other than milk and biscuits.” The madwoman shambled closer. <br>
<br>
Berkin could see her eyes now, they held him like chains. The right eye was totally occluded by a milky cataract, the left was clear and revealed a soul being slowly torn apart.<br>
<br>
“My name is Aggadon, this is my squire Berkin.” The older paladin said, greeting the madwoman as he would any normal person on the street. “Your cottage seems to be in need of some repair, perhaps you would accept some assistance from us?”<br>
<br>
“You are most gracious, Ser, my husband has taken ill of late and been unable to do his duties around the farm.” She curtsied, the action made more difficult by her bloated body.<br>
<br>
“Berkin see what you can do about the roof, I will see to this woman’s husband.” Aggadon ordered, striding purposefully into the house.<br>
<br>
Berkin was glad his master was shielding him from the horrors within the house. Just being near the woman was enough to make him feel physically ill. He could tell that her sanity and perhaps her very soul was balanced on a knife edge, and he thought with compassion about how difficult it must be to fight that battle alone in the ruins of a cottage out on the rainy plains of Karana.<br>
<br>
Aggadon had been preparing himself for this moment since he had received his orders at the temple that morning. He had seen many terrible things, the undead horrors that populated the deepest depths of Guk, the taint of vampirism that clung to Castle Mistmoore and most recently, for a brief moment, the oppressive darkness of the plane of Hate. This was such a place, he could sense danger crouching in the shadowy corners of the room but its exact nature avoided him.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps you could do something for my husband…” The woman said drawing aside the tattered curtain that had been placed to mark the difference between the sleeping area and the kitchen area.<br>
<br>
A corpse, old and decayed lay among the rushes that served as the woman’s bed. He knelt next to it, inspecting it carefully. It had been buried hastily some time ago and then recovered from the same unmarked grave recently. He had seen many corpses in his time, this one was no threat to him.<br>
<br>
“I am afraid he is beyond my power to heal.” Aggadon said, rising carefully keeping his eyes on the woman. “His soul rests in Marr’s sheltering hand now.”<br>
<br>
“No!” The woman hissed in true grief. Then more quietly, “it rests with Karana, he was one of his rangers.”<br>
<br>
“Please allow me to lay him to rest, you need not suffer any longer.” Aggadon picked up the corpse, it was very light, and hardly smelled at all. “What name shall I put on the headstone, My Lady?”<br>
<br>
“Tarragon.” She sobbed, sliding into a crouching position on the floor.<br>
<br>
Aggadon could barely suppress his surprise, he had known Tarragon when he was a young squire about Berkin’s age, their life paths had taken them in different directions in later years but time had not dimmed the affection he had for the young man he recalled in his memory.<br>
<br>
As he left the house, the sense of overwhelming evil seemed to fade. He found a suitable place for the grave and after carefully laying the body down, began to dig. He had always found physical labor helped the thought process. He had heard rumors about the ranger’s demise but had ignored them, refusing to believe that he could die in such a foolish way.<br>
<br>
Berkin had given up on trying to patch the roof with the little thatch that remained there, it seemed most of it had fallen back into the cottage, it clumped in bunches all over the floor. Carefully he entered the house.<br>
<br>
“I need a broom to sweep out the thatching in the kitchen, do you have one that I can borrow?” He said querulously.<br>
<br>
“There is one in the corner, over here.” The squire could hear the tears in that response and he entered the room to find the woman slumped in a corner. Clear tears ran from her good eye in counterpoint to the filth that seeped from the other.<br>
<br>
Recalling that the service of Marr is not an easy one, he leaned over the woman and asked gently, “Is there anything I can do for you?”<br>
<br>
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this, you know,” She looked at him carefully, “I was a good girl, it wasn’t my fault…”<br>
<br>
He patted her gently on the shoulder and went to fetch the broom.<br>
<br>
“It might not have been you fault, but it became your life Didn’t IT!” The woman shrieked, slapping herself in the face. “Look where it has brought me! Alone! Sick! Feared by everyone! There is no joy in this bloody bargain! I want it back! I want IT ALL BACK!” She was screaming now and kicking the jagged floorboards with her bare feet, soon bloody footprints began to paint the floor.<br>
<br>
Outside Berkin could hear the digging stop. He looked at the woman, she seemed a lot calmer now.<br>
<br>
“You know,” She leaned over with a conspirational whisper, “this is what I wanted, what I always wanted, a husband and a child to look after.” At this she rubbed her bloated belly.<br>
<br>
Feeling uncomfortable, Berkin began to sweep away at the rushes, trying to ignore the gibbering woman. As he swept he began to realize there was something under the rushes…<br>
<br>
“I got this…as a reward…I asked my god for it, and he gave me exactly what I deserved.” She babbled on, oblivious to the fact that the squire was busy staring at what he had uncovered on the floor.<br>
<br>
He was uncovering bones, freshly gnawed, elven, human, barbarian and halfling, they lay in jumbled piles. He turned and stared at the woman in horror.<br>
<br>
“I had to feed the baby…He makes me so hungry…” She whined plaintively at him, crawling towards him on her hands and knees, her distended belly nearly dragging on the ground.<br>

<br>
But I must say that I've tried to read everything you've written, and enjoyed every bit of it. Even the parts that made my stomach queasy. The first part of this story had me rather dismayed, until the madness of Valkiri was revealed.<br>
<br>
...oh, and while the story doesn't frighten the day lights out of me, I am glad I'm reading it during the day. &lt;sheepish grin&gt;  <p>~Culanae Mithrilborne<br>
