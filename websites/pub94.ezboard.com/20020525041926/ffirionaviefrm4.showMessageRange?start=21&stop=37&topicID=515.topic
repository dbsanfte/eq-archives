<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ÅgI think this is because evil is incredibly easy to RP.Åh<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Personally I find this to be somewhat difficult online, precisely because of this problem where people arenÅft clear whether youÅfre rpÅfing or just being rude. I know you could always send them a tell ooc but that takes a lot of the fun out of the moment.<br>
<br>
IÅfve had countless cases were elves or halflings have helped or offered to help my char and my charÅfs response would be to tell them ÅgGet your stinkinÅf carcass out oÅf me face before I bite yer nose off!Åh, of course what I actually say is ÅgHey, thanks a lot. ThatÅfs really nice of youÅh. Then I kick myself for being the wussiest Ogre ever.<br>
<br>
For me most of the fun in rpÅfing comes from the Good/Evil friction and I like playing evil because I think that itÅfs the inevitable duty of the evil player to get their ass kicked by the heroes. Of course the villain always returns for vengeance, but you canÅft have this cycle or convincing heroic characters without someone willing to rp the bad guy with consistency.<br>
<br>
In general though I only really act my char with people who also seem to be role-playing. So when an elf comes up to my Ogre char and hails him politely I respond to the player (who seems quite friendly) rather than their char (who my char despises).<br>

I roleplay him how I envision him being, acting, and talking, and let others label him however they'd like. It doesn't concern me, and I'm ALWAYS pulling for the Iksar to win. As far as I'm concerned, they have just as much right to victory as any &quot;good guy&quot;. <br>
<br>
I try very hard to not be a jerk OOC, and like someone mentioned, I sometimes do things my character would just never do. I'll SoW anyone who asks, cause it requires way more effort to decline, and it's just not worth it. I throw in some insulting comment and SoW them. Likewise, I usually save other people in trouble when Zil would just let them die, I feel too guilty if I don't. I do regularly /snarl at soft skins, that's just Zildrax, although he's politer then many. <br>
<br>
Roleplaying is suppose to be fun, and I try and ensure those who are my RPed enemies have just as much fun as I do. I won't ever knowingly do somthing to ruin someone elses fun, but I won't sacrifice my enjoyment of the game just to make someone else happy, either. Alot of the time I don't enjoy grouping with soft skins and will decline to do so. Nothing personal OOC, I just really prefer grouping with Iksar as much as possible. <br>
<br>
And I'll /duel anyone who challenges me, although opportunites for such duels seem to be slim with me for some reason. *shrugs* I do very much enjoy them though.<br>
<br>

 <br>
Nor will I be nice to paladins. Paladins are best used as bait to attract orcs,preferrably while minus both hands and both feet.<br>
 <br>
OOC,players are players...anyone who knows me from when I played on Innoruuk knew that I was as nice to someone playing a high elf as I was a dark elf. This is Fironia Vie. I'm roleplaying. I'm a freaking knight of Hate in-game,people. This means my IG actions are supposed to be disturbing and even rude if ypu aren't playing something evil yourself. I won't train you. But I certainly will laugh as something kills you. If you come up and ask me when I'm leaving a camp,I will inform you I don't yield anything to lightloving scum. I will oppress the weak,commit acts of mayhem,and kick puppies at every opportunity. If I feel I have a chance,I will try and kill you if you don't follow the dark gods.<br>
 <br>
And I happen to run a Pokemon League for a living,with a pack of children I happen to be very fond of since I get to play games for my daily bread. The closest I ever came to killing anyone was a car accident,and that gave me nightmares for a year afterwards. So please don't equal &quot;evil character&quot; with &quot;spoiled bastard&quot;. There's plenty of those playing anything they feel they can annoy other _players_ with.<br>

<br>
As a Tier'dal, I don't feel any need to be rude to most folks.  I mean, who would bother being rude to sheep?<br>
If the sheep treat me with respect and courtesy, then I will counter appropriately.  But the general baa-ing that<br>
you get from many is just noise.<br>
<br>
Many folk appear to be rude because of insecurities about themselves, and they think if they can try to put someone else down it will elevate themselves.  Silly them.  Livestock is still livestock.  The worst thing is watching someone who ought to know better, say another Tier'dal, go be rude.  They ought to know better.<br>
<br>
Many Iksar get respect from me because they seem to understand my attitudes about this.  They also have this tendency to assume that softskins are slaves.  That doesn't bother *me*, I am a slave.  Erudites tend to be sufficiently arrogant that they pretend not to notice anyone that doesn't suit them, and so we never clash much. They don't see me and I don't see them.  And when we do, we're polite.<br>
<br>
I don't have much problems with druids.  Druids acknowledge the natural order, which is based on a certain amount of predatory behavior and something called the food chain.  <br>
<br>
I don't duel much because most aren't worthy of my attention.  It's rare that someone who is so rude that you want to duel them will learn the proper lesson anyway.  A pig is a pig, why waste my time trying to teach it.  If I duel someone it's generally for honor or the sheer joy of fighting.<br>
<br>
I do indulge myself occasionally.  I make a practice of killing ((npc)) Paladins and High Elves.  And I got interrupted in some meditations one day by a human paladin who was so crude and so condescending that I let my temper get the better of myself and chopped him into little bits down by the shadowed men in Western Commons.  He should have gotten a bind closer than Qeynos before he decided to be so crass.<br>
<br>
I am a Tier'dal warrioress, and pet to Dalninil Venorsh.  That's all the &quot;status&quot; I ever need.  Everything else is a result of honor, duty, responsibility, respect, and the kindness of others.  I know who I am and I am deeply satisfied with it.  <br>
<br>
begin OOC <br>
<br>
As a player I believe in playing nice and helping folks when and where ever they'll give me even the slightest excuse to do so.  I try to temper that with IC behavior of some sort or another.  I helped a high elf one day on the condition that he never ever tell folks I did (lol).  But we all play here together.  And the IC conflict is much much more fun if we know that OOC that everyone is ok.<br>

it's easy to confuse the two when your at the receiving end of the insults...<br>
But to say one is being too evil is too suggest that good alignment characters are being too good....im sure no one will complain getting healed from a stranger for no reason....or money from a passing paladin...<br>
<br>
Fact is...Dark elf's are hated and hunted...<br>
Almost every race uses Neriak and the surrounding forest as a free for all to attack our vendors and guards...<br>
So donít be too surprised when my SK calls your half-elf &quot;trash&quot; or &quot;human loving bileî...etc..<br>
But that is a small part of my RPLing  experience...<br>
For example...<br>
My group of DE's are attempting to overthrow the current (lack thereof) regime ruling the tier'dal...<br>
We see (for right or wrong) that all non-tier'dal exposure has threatened the Existence of our race...<br>
High Elves attack our cities, Half-elves hide in shadows and cowardly attack our guards from behind...halflingís (spoiled children that they are) set up camp in our hills, twisting the valley with their ugly scent...<br>
<br>
We are attacked....and we hate you all for it.<br>
<br>
If you donít want the insultsÖor the duelsÖ.then donít dare to invade usÖ<br>

Silly them. Livestock is still livestock. The worst thing is watching someone who ought to know better, say another Tier'dal, go be rude. They ought to know better.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
/IC: Oh, how a smug and ignorant you are, Ayida. You think that by hold the *attitude* that the pale skins are inferior to us, that you are in fact superior. You are living a silly illusion. The truth is that the pale skins laugh at you as the arrogant pushover that you are. The truly Elevated need to DEMONSTRATE that they are more powerful. <br>
<br>
The fact that they run freely in our lands and slay our guards is the most dire mockery they can make of us. Yet you turn a blind eye to this like the sheep you are. Yes, it is *you* who are the sheep. And you admit that you will take their hand-outs too, like an animal fed by hand.<br>
<br>
You disgust me.<br>
<br>
You should have the ebon skin torn from your body, for you do not deserve to wear it.<br>
<br>
/OOC: Tier'dal should be the scourge of every light race newbie area. People should fear and hate us, but what really happens is that Neriak is used as a raid training area, and our newbies get no help from dead camped guards. Higher level Tier'dal characters group with lighties and accept and bestow heals, buffs, and freebies with them. Dark Elf guilds make regular alliances with Lighties, and even build faction with them. <br>
<br>
How much more hypocritical can you get?<br>
<br>
Nobody plays Dark Elves like the evil race they are. It is pathetic. Slvik and I are trying to make a difference, but of course, our fellow Tier'dal players respond with apathy. <br>
