One shield is not going to let us out mitigate warriors... fact. But then again 'shields' in general should be better than just Crap AC.<br>

Anyhow i dont think shield bashing is super effective for 'just' knights... shields needed a bump up.<br>
<br>
Though shadowknights get a new pet buff at 60 (Aug death) and cure disease ..... while a new pet buff is nice.. haveing this spell at  60 (for the lv58pet) does not really make sence to me, we are not really crying out for better solo options, They find it easy to make shadowknights solo... than balance them out, thinking that most of the shadowknights will go and solo and.. hence there patch was an sucsess and the shadowknight crowd is pleased.<br>
<br>
If this pet buff is needed... because of new beastmaster upgrades going in i dont know.... maybe the beast's have some hidden upgrades soon makeing there pets just a whole lot nicer... that may well be (i hear they are working on removing pet haste cap for beasts to allow for 98% haste stacking)<br>

<br>
In any type of raid situation, I agree with Oogmog, you really do need a taunter to hold aggro.  Shadowknights are wonderful for grabbing quick aggro, and they can always FD once it's time to transfer aggro to the main tank.  But in any situation where a complete heal rotation is going on, you really want a warrior standing there taking the hits.  Accept no substitute! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 771<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/02 1:35:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2596.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> It's all situational</span><hr size=1> SK's are absolute tops at gaining agro quickly.  Monks are good at keeping it once they have it and are by far the best at straight-up tanking when not using CH.  The reason is that they take far less damage from things than other classes except for a warrior that is using defensive.  The reason they make bad tanks in raids and against higher level critters is due to the huge efficiency of CH and the long duration of defensive.<br>
<br>
Generally, you won't see a monk tanking, though.  The reason is that they make the safest pullers.  If you're pulling for raid or xp, you can't hang around afterwards to fight.  You need to get your hp topped up and head back out to get more or at least setup to get more.  The same monk doing both pulling and tanking slows everything down.<br>
<br>
BTW, not sure why you mentioned Paladin and agro in the same post.  The only thing they can get agro on is undead and only when they have that nifty AA that does huge undead criticals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/02 11:32:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2596.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's all situational</span><hr size=1> paladins have several stun based spells which will get them aggro quickly. Warriors on the boards myself included are wondering if they are going to make the difference in tanking skill so minimal that we will become obsolete except for a few situations. If they make the warrior less attractive then a guild would only want 2 warriors and then 10 paladins and or SKs. Warriors have no spells and completely depend on others for most combats. Yes at the high end with the right gear we can solo, but with that same gear a Paladin or SK can solo even better. VI insists on making monks the melee damage kings if you take away backstab from a rogue so a warrior would be reduced further down the chain if they loose ground in their dominance of defensive capability. Paladins and SKs already have closed the gap on damage output with some of the nicest weapons you will ever see i.e. Reso has had many 1HS weapons drop that are about 24dmg/21 delay that are Pal/SK only with a proc to boot.<br>
<br>
Verant keeps thinking that the classes are not balanced because people are playing warriors over SK/Pal hybrids, but the fact is the classes are not imbalanced, but rather SKs/Pal's are tougher to play.<br>
<br>
With that said if they come out with shields that are weapons for warriors like how a Shield of the Slain Unicorn is, but reasonable damage to delay then warriors will not be hurt by the propossed changes.<br>

<br>
The reason why pal / sk chose 2h mostly everytime at hight lvl is because of the dmg bonus you get on a 2H weapon.<br>
<br>
With a good 2H you have a dmg bonus of 35+ while a 1h you only have 11 max. If you are beating on hight ac mob (like most luclin boss), you will do crap with a 1H, further more if you are the tank (in a xp group) you will not build enought agro with your hits.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, if VI wants people to use 1H + shield, they will have to improve the dmg 1H (and bash) can do on a mob so it can reach a 2H weapon with the same dps (on paper). I hope you are not expecting me to see 30 dmg / 15 dly 1H, but i think an improve of the dmg bonus for 1H could be enought and for the dmg you do in bash .. well this is more like &quot;kudos&quot; or to interrupt spell.<br>
<br>
On the agro managment, sk / pal are pretty good ... i would say that sk are a bit better than pal just because pal are only using MR base spell and well we all know how mobs are resistant to magic. Sk with some taps (damn a new buff on my buff bar) could be less resisted. I dunno, but 2 new lines of spell has been added to SK on test, 1 is &quot;sorta&quot; a DD that give you direct hate and the other line is a more like a buff that increase the hate you generate by a  % (from 2 to 10).<br>
With those 2 lines, SK are becoming the fast agro master .. now we (yes ..i'm a sk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) will have to use that very carefully. In hunt situation , damn great .. my shaman will maybe stop complaining like that .... In Raid situation, we could take agro on mez mob without killing ench, get agro to us to help MT transition (maybe .. never tested), keep agro on us if we are to tank (mmmmm do you often see sk tank big mobs ???).<br>
<br>
Well ... lots of changes are coming ...we will see what will be the result of all of that . Hope it will be positif for every one <p><br>

<br>
Erm...  Bjond?  If I'm in a group with anyone other than me tanking, I have to actually hold back on my abilities so I DON'T take the aggro.  I can gain aggro from pretty much anyone else so quickly and hold it so well that it would take a miracle to get it off me.  The only class that even comes close to a paladin in aggro control is a shadowknight, and it generally takes them longer to build it up than we do.<br>
<br>
If a paladin only gets aggro because of Slay Undead, then it's generally because they're holding back so they don't render it impossible for your warriors to get back aggro. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A> at: 8/27/02 6:04:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1233<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/27/02 6:53:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2596.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's all situational</span><hr size=1> For the record, Pallys, Shadowknights, and Rangers get TONS of agro.

Most of the Shadowknight one handed wepons are just blown away by luclin two handers and damage bonus, i dont see myself useing a 20/20 one handed anytime soon... I love being able to bash, but to be honest on high ac mobs i get much better results with a two handed wepon.<br>
<br>
What is more interesting/scary is the shadowknight line of sister spells simular to the enchanter haunting visage.<br>
<br>
*self agro<br>
     Means one spells estimated 500taunt, Shadowvortex is200 off top of my head.... so with one spell that is pretty much a solid mes break with one spell..... wich will make Shadowknights more usefull in EXP groups, wee i can break mes on seb frogs a few seconds earlyer... but does nothing for raiding (wich is what all the SK were asking for, more raid choice)<br>
<br>
*Targetable agro<br>
     Like enchanter visage, and stacks... so now we can cast hate spells on a warrior... and i am sure out of 2, 3 shadowknights that one of them can spare the room to memorise this spell.<br>
<br>
What was interesting was Warriors going into MA with a shield, and haveing a shadowknight use Agro spells to keep the warrior taunting, and also can stack with enchanter line i hear. The thing is, will this use a buff slot?<br>

How many shadowknights want to play giveing agro to warriors? quite frankly it is a rather painfull thing to do... to take something that you have clung onto feeling it the 'best' feature to others (not yourself) and then have you cast it on another warrior!!!! <br>
     Saying that, i 'would' use both those spells... because sometimes i suck up my pride and will use it to keep a warrior tanking, other times i want to take the odd hit and lifetap back. /shrug I still think it is either a HATE it or LOVE it type approach to class balance.<br>
