Its ok to have friends but you want to be Reso or FnF or AS then be one.  You cant play both sides or be on both teams.  <br>
<br>
Friends NP.  But when you put on the jersey you are either on one side or the other.  You knock the other player down because your playing the game.  Its ok to lend them a hand and pick them back up after and say &quot;nice play&quot;.....but you cant walk off the field at the start of the game and say &quot;Im not gonna play because I have friends on both sides&quot;  Your wearing our jersey.....you gonna be with us or what?<br>
<br>
Thats what Im saying.<br>
<br>
I have plenty of people who I &quot;get along&quot; with in all guilds on this server.  I have a few people on ignore.  Im sure a few people have me on ignore....hell....I am The Hated One.<br>
<br>
Re-read my post.  No where does it say its not OK to have friends....but when the fight is on, dont play neutral if your on my team.....I want people who will step up and fight....not stand off, watch and eat chips.   <br>
<br>
This of course is my view and no one elses.<br>

<br>
This implies that FnF and Resolution are playing competetively, against eachother.<br>
<br>
Not all members of either guild see it that way.<br>
<br>
Some people see them like hiking clubs, where you could hike w/ your club, or someone else's club, but the fun &amp; personal achievement is the important part.  The other club's success at hiking some really tough trail doesn't detract any from your success, etc.<br>
<br>
And of course, some people see it like Survivor or somethin.<br>
<br>
They're both valid viewpoints, no need to get on someone's case for seeing it differently (unless you've laid out in your guild charter that your mission is to be the #1 guild at all costs or whatever).<br>

<br>
I was going to pick up a mod rod. There was a nice row of five and I was about to move in range to pick up the one on the far right when it disappeared.<br>
<br>
It would look identical to if the rod had just faded but 1) this was relatively early on and I don't think there was time for any rods to be depopping, especially as I thought they had been recently summoned (though the second point I couldn't swear to) and 2) it was in a line of about 5 mods and none of the others depopped.<br>
<br>
Three people were relatively close to the mod rods. All were in FnF. However, I don't recall two of their names, because they seemed to me to be out of the range of being able to pick up a rod. And actually, you do have to be kind of close. The other person was practicaly on top of it. I remembered their name.<br>
<br>
I don't think I should mention it here, because it's a public place. I don't think that there's any point in complaining to an officer, or even to anyone in FnF, because I will not be believed on the strength of the fact that I am in Resolution. So why mention it? Because maybe someone in FnF will read this and instead of thinking &quot;WTF no way you suxors&quot; they might think &quot;Hmm, that's actually not very nice, I must ensure that nobody does that next time a situation like that occurs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whilst it is possible that the person is not guilty, I regard that possibility as being extremely small. Note that this is not an opinion corrupted by previous knowledge of the person.<br>
<br>
I would alos like to point out that I am not the source of the allegation of FnF stealing the mod rods. That had been aired to no small length before I mentioned what I had seen.<br>

I hafta say that I think competition is kinda fun!  I have friends in both guilds and so far I don't think anyone hates me.  So...I know where Faoin is coming from.<br>
<br>
But!  Stealing mod rods is just wrong.  I wasn't in Kael so I know jack.  But fact of the matter is that my cleric comrades have discussed the unlikeliness of a LACK of mod rods for them.  Yes, during KT they apparently, couldn't find any rods.  Now for all of the nincompoopyheads that will claim &quot;you can't prove this&quot; or whatever, I will say this...Ramoldar is a mod machine.  He is maybe the most decked out dood on the server and he has cranked out more mod rods in a short period of time than I could have ever thought possible.  I'd like to stand on the side of the fence like Faoin but I can't ignore the fact that there was someone who did this, maybe many who did this.  Only the people who did it actually know.<br>
<br>
Do I lose respect for FnF?  Not really.  Unless this was a mandate from their guild leader or something I assume this was the action of the childish few who continue to stain the name of FnF as much as the few morons in AS stain their name.  There are so many good people in these guilds, for me to believe that the same druid that helped me do my shawl quests and slaved once upon a time to get me Kromriff leggings to all the sudden steal a mod rod and destroy it would turn my stomach.  That is NOT what is happening here.<br>
<br>
The same dumbasses who quad kite in ME and kill a newb and say &quot;Sorry, you shouldn't have been in my way&quot; or the dumb @#$%ckers who decide to train Velketor to the zoneline...These are the people who would steal mods...they are the people who I have no respect for.  I love mentioning names but I'll leave them out for the sake of PCness.  The main reason I joined Reso to begin with over AS or FnF were just that the bad eggs had desuaded me.  These bad eggs are petty and just in general mean.  If AS and FnF got rid of these jackasses they would be no different than Reso...but alas some are still there...sigh...Strip them of their loot, their pride, their arrogance and &quot;they shall come&quot;. *Excerpt from Field of Toons staring Keven &quot;the lazy paladin&quot; Costner*<br>
<br>
P.S.  Stop messing with DS guys its just lame.  As a guild both AS and FnF have one time or another stepped on them while we often acquiesce mobs to them.  Have some courtesy for other guilds.  The few instances you have done this...I mean if Reso had done the same I think I would deguild, i mean comon show some decency you are not the only toons on this server.  *hugs and kisses to all my FnF and AS buds* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1371<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/27/02 10:39:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1463.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> I already admitted to picking up the mod rods.

note: dropping rods. we dropped many rods and had them lying on the ground. we, FnF had rods on ground.<br>

then, what do we see? resolution running back towards us, and 1 King Tormax following on their heels. all of a sudden, we have like, no rods on the gorund. now where did they go all of a sudden? reso just arrived... hmm... then you guys start fighting and dropping rods.<br>
<br>
#1 whose to say we didn't think those were our rods? after all, we DID have rods lying there before you guys came back. <br>
<br>
#2 a shitload of our rods disappeared jsut as you guys arrived with KT. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> any FnF [did] happen to pick up any rods, how can you guys blame us for taking them when so many of ours mysteriously disappeared when you guys arrived?<br>

and was my comment wrong on so many levels? was it really? so, if a leader tells you to do something that you don't think is right, are you just gonna blindly follow them? and i'm not talking about directions to kill a mob. i'm talking about moral decisions. <p><BR><B>Veteran Veloxia Voluptuous</B><BR>
