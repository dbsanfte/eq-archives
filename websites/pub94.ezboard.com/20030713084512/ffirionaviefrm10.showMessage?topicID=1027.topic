<br>
Today started off as any other day, Syren rose from her slumber in the middle of the stone ring, brushing away the leaves that had kept her body warm throughout the night. She stood and stretched and breathed in the cool morning air. <br>
<br>
Something was not right today it seemed, she felt as if she had lost something. She checked under the rock where she'd hidden her clothes and few meagre belongings the night before. 'Have those naughty pixies been going through my things again?' she wondered to herself as she wrapped her cloak around her. Everything was there, but still that feeling of loss surrounded her.<br>
 <br>
As she set off for the grand city of Felwithe, she heared the soft sound of the trees whispering to one another. Even though she could not understand them completely, she caught occasional words as she passed them by, it felt as though they were mocking her. 'Poor, confused little bard,' and 'do you think she'll remember?'. <br>
<br>
Even more unsettled now, she rummaged through her backpack and took out her drum and started to tap a little beat she'd been working on, she felt the power from her instrument rush through her body as the speed at which she ran increased, the soft grass felt wonderful and cool against her bare feet. She hoped the bright lights of the city would settle her down and the sooner she got there the better! <br>
<br>
She wished good morning to the guards as she passed through the gates and headed straight for the public pool. She left her cloak, drum and the rest of her belongings in a heap by the side of the water and dived straight in. The cold water took her breath away for the first few seconds but her body adjusted to it quickly and soon she was gracefully swimming back and forth.<br>
 <br>
Feeling refreshed and fully awake now, she climbed out of the water and sat on the edge of the pool, letting her tiny feet dangle in the water. She rummaged through her bag looking for something to eat, finding a few berries and a root or two and munched away as she splashed the water with her feet. She was feeling a little better by now, but still that unsettled feeling surrounded her.<br>
 <br>
Then the previous night's dream suddenly started to come back to her.... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She was running through the forest as usual, occasionally beating up the orcs when they jumped out at her from behind the trees and searching for the silk of the spiderlings. When all of a sudden the song she was singing changed its tune all by itself! And a strong yellow light surrounded her, she could feel it was a powerful song and this made her feel a little nervous as she didn't know the song off by heart and wasn't certain how to sing it properly.<br>
<br>
And just as she was about to try change the song back to the one she was singing, a little pixie ran by and got caught up in the song's aura. The pixie was furious as the yellow light singed its wings and it started to hit out at young Syren, the yellow light was made of fire! <br>
<br>
Young Syren panicked, but her natural instinct was to defend herself, she reached for her shield and tried to fend off the blows from the pixie, she could still hear the song surrounding her even though she had tried to push it from her mind, then all of a sudden the poor little pixie fell to the ground dead! <br>
<br>
Syren couldn't believe what had happened, she begged the Lady Tunare for forgiveness and bent down to see if the pixie had any belongings she could deliver back to her family along with the grim tidings. She found a little pouch of dust in the pixie's pocket, but no indication of where she was from or to whom she belonged. Syren set off with a heavy heart back to the city of trees and sat herself down at the edge of a ramp to mourn the loss of the pixie, sadness surrounding her.<br>
<br>
She barely noticed anything that was going on around her as she sat and contemplated ways of making right the terrible wrong she had done. <br>
<br>
Then suddenly she heard the voice of a fellow elf, he sounded like a wood-elf by the tone of his voice, calling out to adventurers his need for pixie dust for a new recipe he was working on. She felt the little pouch of pixie dust in the breast pocket of her cloak and the guilt surrounded her once again, 'Maybe if I get rid of it, I might not feel so bad about what I have done,' she thought, and called to the elf that she had some he could have. It turned out that he was a ranger and he tracked her down in less than a moment.<br>
<br>
They spoke briefly and he gave her some money in exchange for the dust, she decided to buy some candles with the money and make a little shrine in memory of the fallen pixie. <br>
<br>
The Ranger and the young bard spoke for a little while after the transaction and they ended up getting on like a house on fire (or pixie wings for that matter). This cheered Syren up to no end and she was soon forgetting the whole terrible business in the forest.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Then the dream faded........<br>
<br>
The dream didn't seem complete in Syren's mind, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't remember any more of it. But the feeling of loss was even greater now and grew every time she thought of the Ranger, she felt as though she was under some kind of spell. <br>
<br>
Throughout the day, little flashes of the dream kept coming back to her, she recalled visiting a strange and scary land covered with ice and snow that was inhabited by giants and other foul beasts. It made her think of a place she'd heard of once when she 'accidently' eavesdropped on a group of brave adventurers. Somewhere called the Great Divide. <br>
<br>
As soon as the thought entered her mind, she felt her heart leap a little. She decided to set off for this far away land and try to solve this puzzling feeling that had been bothering her all day.<br>
<br>
She knew of a magical portal that could take you to different lands and she set off eagerly to look for it, not even thinking to pack any warm clothes for the journey. She stood in front of the magical portal and held her breath as she prepared to step through, praying to Tunare that there wouldn't be any nasty giants waiting to beat her up when she got through to the other side. <br>
<br>
She stepped out from the portal and the cold icy winds took her breath away, she scolded herself for not bringing any warm furs to wrap herself in and set off running as fast as she could to try and shake off the freezing cold that was surrounding her. <br>
<br>
She didn't really know where she was going, but she started to get a feeling for the place as though she'd been there before. She headed Northwards as her instict directed her to and suddenly she saw a huge waterfall. <br>
<br>
More of her dream started to come back to her, it was as though she'd been here before and the feeling of loss was getting smaller and smaller the more she got closer to the grand waterfall. <br>
<br>
She ran up to it and stood watching as the water gushed into the stream at its base. Then suddenly she heard the tapping of feet and someone grumbling about the weather. It was coming from behind the waterfall! She tried to see behind it but she couldn't see anything but gushing water. Then she heard a gruff little voice.<br>
 <br>
'Hey, you there! Come in from the cold you little fool, you'll catch your death!' <br>
<br>
'Where are you?' Said Syren, 'I can't see you!'<br>
<br>
'Inside of course!' Came back the voice, 'Ahh, new here are ye? You'd think they'd make the entrance to our town a little more obvious wouldn't you heh, but we have to keep those giants out you know, and they're not the smartest of beasts if you get me meaning. Step through the waterfall little one, before you freeze on the spot!'<br>
<br>
Syren closed her eyes and jumped through the waterfall and found herself in a little tunnel and in front of her was a cute little dwarf who only came up to her waist. <br>
<br>
'Well met Sir, a pleasure to meet you indeed!' Said Syren as she offered him a friendly hand.<br>
<br>
'Hehe', said the dwarf, 'it's you again! That's what you said last time we met too! I've been told to watch out for you, the Ranger placed a few coins in my hand before he left on his journey and said if I were to see you again I had to direct you back to his room.<br>
<br>
'Again?' Thought Syren, 'What on earth is this little fellow talking about?' <br>
<br>
She decided to go along with the dwarf, more out of curiosity than anything else, this was turning into a very strange day indeed! She followed him inside the town, it felt curiously warm even though it was made from ice and she had to watch her step so as not to lose her footing on the slippery floor. <br>
<br>
They came to a little shop and the dwarf held the door open for her and she stepped inside. Syren wished the shopkeeper good evening and the shopkeepr smiled up at Syren, <br>
<br>
'Good to see you again young bard'. He said.<br>
<br>
Syren carried on following the dwarf up some stairs, becoming more puzzled with each passing moment.<br>
<br>
'Here we are youngin,' said the dwarf as he placed a big metal key in her hand, 'have a pleasant stay, the Ranger said he'll be returning in a few days time and you are to make yourself at home, you know where I am if you need anything.' He smiled as he set off back down the stairs.<br>
<br>
Syren unlocked the door and stepped inside, she sniffed the air, it smelt familiar somehow and the feeling of loss was nearly gone finally. She couldn't understand what all this meant, and how the things in her dream where somehow mixed with what was happening now. Was she really under a spell perhaps?<br>
<br>
She looked about the room, a bow was leaning up against the bed, clothes strewn about the floor, typical of a man she thought. She picked up a tunic and held it to her face, she smelt the fabric, she knew this smell somehow and her heart began to beat a little faster. She folded the tunic and placed it on top of a set of drawers. <br>
<br>
She felt very tired suddenly, all the excitement of the day had finally gotten to her. She placed her backpack down on the floor beside a cupboard and took off her clothes and placed them on the edge of the bed, she found a basin in the other room and washed quickly before heading back to the bedroom.<br>
<br>
She sat down heavily on the edge of the bed, causing her cloak to slip to the floor, as she leant to pick it up she noticed a little yellow mark on the floor, as she bent down to brush it away, she noticed it was dust, she rubbed at it a little and brought it to her nose, it was pixie dust!<br>
 <br>
She was more confused than ever now, she stood up and pulled back the furs on the bed, there was a note sticking out from under the pillow.<br>
<br>
