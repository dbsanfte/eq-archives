But thats not where I want to start at all. Let me fill you all in on my life in EQ and how it has ruined my life as a whole, be it this might not happen to everyone but this is my story and this is how it goes.<br>
<br>
Day 1. EQ Had just came out! My friends at school had been in beta, and while I told them how much better Ultima Online was than stupid Everquest, I still went out an got the game and started a character.  My first character was on Bristlebane server, his name was Niin he was a human warrior, and like most people of my day I put every point into STR!! GRRR. Well i played Niin in my off time from UO and casually got him to 32 which was a major accomplishment for my day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I had almost full crafted and bronze in the off slots and a SSoY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3 days ago, and there is a guy with a level 51 neco on Innorukk and he wants to trade my UO account for his EQ account, and im like HELL YEA level 51 none of my friends had made it past lvl 45 I was the SHIT!<br>
<br>
I payed Niin up to level 53 where fear kiting got REALLY really old At this point I got a trade offer, an offer that i thought was unbeatable.  Somone wanted my Necro for a level 48 Warrior and a 49 Cleric on Tallon Zek!!! I was extatic! not only was I going to be UBER there, but I was going to have 2 uber characters.<br>
<br>
I made the trade.. I had a lot of fun a LOT of fun playing theese characters and got the cleric to level 56 and the warrior to 55! And i got a touch of PvP blood in me.  At this point it happened! I got scammed for the first time.<br>
<br>
This event  changed my life forever IMHO, Both my characters got taken from me in a fury of all hell when I thought I was supposed to be getting a level 60 shaman! WITH HIS EPIC!!!!<br>
<br>
So i got scammed... And i basically deleted EQ from my computer and got REALLY REALLY pissed! But then somethign changed, im not sure what happened but all of a sudden a lightbulb clicked on! if somone can Scamm me, Why cant I scamm somone ELSE!! So I tried and I succedded! I got a level 60 Cleric WITH HER EPIC on Tallon Zek!  It was wrong I know it and if i could go back I would undo it but i cant, this is my life its how Ive lived it!<br>
<br>
At this point I was sure I was going to quit EQ, I was getting sent to RiverSide Military Academy in Gainsville GA, and I was fine with it all.  So i put up an auction on Ebay trying to sell my character.  I got a person Grael Nagel was her in game I believe, who was going to buy the character for her sons birthday present.  She had an abusive husband, and very little money! where as I have 2 loaded parents and never lacked money. I had all intentions of making this a normal sale, but then as if magic, I recieved her payment Via PayPal, and then the account stopped working, im not sure how it happened! but it did, and rather than do the right thing, I just kept the money. I played it off for months with her prommising everything under the sun if she just waited a minuet.  And she did, I still have her $350<br>
<br>
At this point I finished Military School a year ago this summer, and my life has forever been changed...<br>
<br>
I got this grand Idea, If there is nothing theese people can do about Paypal revercals than why dont i just SCAMM all day long.  And I did I amassed around $2300 In illegitmate stuff.  <br>
<br>
At military School I met a teacher, Im not going to say his name, but his son still plays here and Friends and Famly know the details.  He got me hooked on FV, this grand land where everyone is friendly and there is nosuch thing as NODROP items!  So I searched the Ebay sites frantically and found a druid at level 43 for sale named Kajinn. I paid 75 dollars for him and he had 148 Wis, At this point i had $2225 left over, with this $$$ I got as much PP as i humanly could and twinked out my Druid to all HELL.. After spending $2225 with a single person, I had their trust to a high degree, and got fronted another 130k or so never to get paid to them<br>
<br>
At this point in the Road I also scammed a level 60 Druid on Tallon Zek with about 200aa's and was having a party on him<br>
<br>
I was offocially an addict to scamming, this care free I never get hurt and progress at levels never though possibly happened to catch my liking rather than things I didnt like.<br>
<br>
After Twinking out my druid so that he had a base 255Wis and FT 8 at level 53 I had about 300kpp left over and I wanted to get PLEd not do it on my damn own. So I found a Monk named Xoraxis who had just come back from Legends and was level 60, and had a Shaman he could Bot as Well, and had the only Fungi on the server.  I paid him anywhere from 5-10k an hour to group with me and let me go AFK in HHK nobles,  or Fungus Grove, there he had to BoT Ermok to keep himself alive but he got AA's and I got EXP and I then had enough $$ to level a lot.  <br>
<br>
At this time me and Ermok were becomming frinds, good friends, we talked on the phone i might say regularly but not super, and I found out he wa botting a 60 Enchanter named Mezzmorizer, I asked him if i could as well use Mezz for a KEI whore and he said sure.  After i grew tired of letting Xoraxis level Kajinn, I went to ask ermok If i could play Mezz as a Main, he said sure I dont care. So i Did i got him about 4 AA's and all. At this point I joined an up and comming guild called Awakened Souls, I had fun raiding with them and it was all happy go lucky with killing and killing.  But then They broke up and I waas bakc board as can be.  I still had a very uber druid who was level 59 now, and looking good but FnF wasnt looking for druids and I didnt really want a druid, so I went back to the drawing board, I got $500 in abotu 5 mins scamming and sold Kajinn stripped to Erollia for 150k that she got after stripping Cinny and selling her shit (she was later banned for this)  So i had $500 and 150kpp to my name and I wanted to uber twink a Monk now, So i found this guy named Indore who decided that after getting Legends loot he wanted to play a Mage instead.<br>
<br>
This is where a lot of other things went wrong, The deal was, my $500 and &quot;my&quot; character Mezzmorizer for a Fungi/Tstaff/ssra Monk fists/CCom/Priceless Fists  I was in Heaven.. So I made the Trade, I sent him $500 and he gave me the gear.  Now is where something im still unsure of happened, rather than do what i normally would have done, and not given him the Enchanter to complete the deal, I did I gave him the info.  And I didnt think twice about what Ermok my FRIEND would say, I didnt care because it was my thing.  <br>
<br>
Well needless to say Ermok Got rather pissed and ended up hating me ever since we still talk but very briefly and he hates me a lot... a whole whole lot!<br>
<br>
Well Nedless to say I eneded up still getting all my Gear from indore and Mezz got back to Ermok.  But now i had a level 1 Human monk named Zimbel Fro, He was uber as all get out!  I mean it was sad, very very sad  I was level 30 and could solo all of HHK! I was in hevan.  But around level 42 I got sick of Monks and wanted to be an Enchanter again, like i played Mezz, you know... I just loved the feeling when i would KEI a group and how cool they were with me ... i really cant explane the feeling.  <br>
<br>
Well at this point, the scamming was catching up to me, my parents were starting to realise that i WAS really doing this and i couldnt lie my little way out of it like i thought i could.  <br>
<br>
I got sent to Aspen Achievement Academy, a wilderness program in the Utah desert. Where I hiked 5-8 miles a day made fire with sticks and rocks and cooked everything.  there is an excelent book called Shouting at the Sky, that details everything easy to read and a good book, if anyone is very interesed at all /shurg<br>
<br>
After Aspen I went to a secondary Program, called Fireside Ranch, Where I spent the next 4 months and finished school there.  <br>
<br>
Now Im back home in Florida.  And exxy, is trying to fuck me over.  Big time, telling my dad that ive made lots and ltos of paypal charges about $4000 to eb exact, im not sure how he did it or why... well why is a stupid question i mean i screwed over the guy bigtime in the past.  But i dont care, the Feds, and and Sherrif office are questioning me now, Its not going to be a big deal but it could have turned into one.<br>
<br>
Thats the end of my story.. Why I tell this you ask? well simply to help! to help whoever I can.  Why because this game stole 4 years of my life from me that there is NOWAY i will ever get it back.. I have scammed countless numbers of people in a self estimated $6000 probably.  So please if a game is worth that to a person, then by all means, play away.  But for me I wish i could have read a story like this, and been able to help myself or get help from somone.  I feel this would have helped me in one way or another, and if i can help ONE person just one, then I think taking my thursday afternoon to write it is well worth it! <br>
<br>
So for those of you who have auctually read this whole thing, I hope you got something from it, if I mentioned you in my story, im sorry if it hurt you in any way shape or form.<br>
<br>
In the present I am currently attempting to track down everyone I wronged, and in the cource of this action I am attempting to pay everyone back.  <br>
<br>
So go ahead do what you do, flame away or do whatever doesnt bother me at all, I needed to share this and get it off my chest as well as into the open.  So to all of you have fun playing and remember its JUST A GAME, dont let it controll your life like it did mine!<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
An Ex-EQ player<br>

Don't blame the game.  The game isn't what your problem was/is.  The problem is YOU.  I'd venture to guess that even if EQ didn't happen to be the catalyst that brought out this particular behavior in you, then something else would have been.  <br>
<br>

There were several gems in this post.<br>
<br>
First, I get the feeling that you are only upset because you got caught and not for the harm you have inflicted on others.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now Im back home in Florida. And exxy, is trying to fuck me over. Big time, telling my dad that ive made lots and ltos of paypal charges about $4000 to eb exact, im not sure how he did it or why... well why is a stupid question i mean i screwed over the guy bigtime in the past. But i dont care, the Feds, and and Sherrif office are questioning me now, Its not going to be a big deal but it could have turned into one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with ebay and everything to do with pure fraud--Exxy ain't the bad guy here.  You defrauded many people out of their savings and that is against the law, not just the EULA, the criminal code.  No wonder the police are looking into this.  You obviously feel guilty about what you have done or else you wouldn't have posted here.  My ass you aren't worried about this--you have written about how this has destroyed your life.  Karma's a bitch--what goes around, comes around.<br>
<br>
Did I read this right?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So I found a Monk named Xoraxis who had just come back from Legends and was level 60, and had a Shaman he could Bot as Well, and had the only Fungi on the server. I paid him anywhere from 5-10k an hour to group with me and let me go AFK in HHK nobles, or Fungus Grove, there he had to BoT Ermok to keep himself alive but he got AA's and I got EXP and I then had enough $$ to level a lot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think this is the kind of public relations that Fire and Fury wants.  Their guildleader offering powerleveling services to a scammer.<br>
