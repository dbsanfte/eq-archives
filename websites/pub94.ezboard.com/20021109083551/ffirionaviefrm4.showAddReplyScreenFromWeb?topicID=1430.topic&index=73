It has been that way since the beginning of time my man. &quot;<br>
<br>
Reread that.  It's patently absurd.  Cows existed before they were domesticated.  To this day cows go feral and survive.<br>
<br>
Regarding the argument that humans are at the top of the food chain.<br>
<br>
The food chain is a logical construct that can be stuctured in any way one likes.  Bacteria, which eat human flesh, could be placed at the top.  Plants could be placed at the top instead of the bottom.  We just like to say we are at the top because we think the top superior and we made the damn chart.<br>
<br>
Regarding the argument that humans are omnivoires, always have been and that's just the way it is.  <br>
<br>
I'm assuming you live in a tree since homids are tree-dwellers, always have been and that's just the way it is.  How do you get internet access up there?<br>
<br>
Now, as to vegetarians as less cruel.<br>
<br>
Realise that vegetarianism is made possible largely by mass-agriculture.  It is also aided by chemical supplements.  In the developing world people usually survive on a diet consisting largely of vegetables withe meat substitutes.  Pure vegetarianism, and certainly vegainism is a product of western style agriculture.  Western style agriculture burns over nine caloeis of energy to produce one calorie of food.  This is only possible through the burning of fossil fuels in the agriculture process.  Which is less cruel?  Eating some animals or poisoning the entire biosphere?  What's better in the big picture?<br>
<br>
For myself, I'm still trying to figure out how to stem the horrible outbreak of humanity this planet is dying from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 546<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/24/02 3:35:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok, I have to weigh in on the food chain</span><hr size=1> I'm pretty sure that it's been said before, but I don't really want to read through this entire thread. Why can't you just eat what you want to, and let other people do the same (provided that they aren't eating humans)? If they try to tell you that you that your eating ways are sinful and disgusting or whatnot, just roll your eyes in their general direction. But that goes both ways, too -- if veggies are their food of choice, so be it. It's no big deal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umithlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/24/02 7:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok, I have to weigh in on the food chain</span><hr size=1> I have no problem with what people choose to eat.  I generally won't tease people about it either.  (Well, aside from ferverant vegans that are oppertunists and will eat meat if they need to, and playing the song quoted earlier in this thread to them in jest once)<br>
<br>
I am not a dietician.  I do not know what humans can and can't survive on.  I do know we are omnivores.  I also know we are animals.<br>
<br>
Now, I won't anthropromorphasize.  That is, I won't project human emotion onto animals.  But that doesn't mean I don't think they reason or feel.  And I can understand people trying to explain it in term of human emotions.  But I have watched animals long enough to notice they are each individuals.  But that doesn't really change anything.<br>
<br>
Suffering.  Yeah, they may suffer.  But for the most part humans are relatively nice in that regard.  Did you know a cheetah does not have very large teeth like other cats, and has to resort to biting it's preys throat and suffocating it to death?  Did you know an animal with a broken leg will be abandoned by it's mother despite plantive crys for help?  Did you know that many predators will start eating before their prey is completely dead?<br>
<br>
Cannibalism.  It makes sense.  What has all the nutrients you need?  Something like you does.  But while that may be, it has high risk.  Much more likely any disease could be passed on.  That is why it is not a bad idea.  Well, that and any number of social and otherwise non nutritional reasons.<br>
<br>
PETA, good idea taken too far.  I would even go so far as to classify them as nuts.  Any orginization that deals with animals has to worry about PETA.  This includes the zoos that have the best kept animals and veterinarian clinics.<br>
<br>
So I say eat meat, eat vegetables.  I've started cutting back on meat myself partly in respect of a partially vegetarian roommate, partly for dietary concerns.  Oh and the reason she is partly vegetarian is because her body needed nutrients from meat.  Not everyone is built the same.  Some can do vegetarian and be fine, some can do carnivore and be fine.  (Literally carnivore)  Some can use the Atkins diet (Being malnourished is a surefire way to lose weight) some would make themselves sick on it.  I will try to be respectful and not shove my meat eating in other peoples faces.  Hey, I enjoy a good salad as much as the next guy.  But I still enjoy going out for a good rare steak some times.  There is actually a Simpsons episode about vegetarians and living together where Lisa goes on a vegetarian rampage.  She then talks to Apoo and finds out he's vegan, won't even eat cheese, but he explains he doesn't hate her for it.  It's about acceptance.<br>
<br>
And regarding pets and vegetarians.  For some pets it works, for others it doesn't.  Often it is very difficult.  Dogs you can work a vegetarian diet but it is extremely difficult and it won't be the healthiest dog in the world.  Cats are actually obligate carnivores - they must have meat, end of story.<br>
<br>
And finally I leave you with one final thought.  Vegetarians eat vegetables.  What do humanitarians eat? <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
Cattle are not oxen.  They may have been at one time, but centuries of breeding have turned them into quite another animal.  An animal dependant upon humans to keep it from dying off.  <br>
<br>
Trust me, if we let our entire herd of angus go free, they'd have died in short order.  They were completely dependant on us to feed them hay and keep them watered.  (That was winter.)  In the summer, they could and did graze on the range, but even then, if there was a drought they couldn't find the food they needed to survive.  We had to feed them.<br>
<br>
Feral cows, my ass.  <br>
<br>
Now, oxen, yaks, etc...they may go feral.  But they haven't been bred down to the extent of cows.  Totally different.<br>

<br>
I have been a healthy lacto-vegetarian (no meat/chicken/fish/eggs) for about 3 years now.  I do it for ethical reasons, and for health reasons, and for personal reasons.  The last part is the most important.<br>
<br>
Because, you see, it doesn't matter why I am vegetarian.  I'm not asking for you to judge what you think of it.  In fact, I don't remember asking your opinion at all.  I usually don't bring it up unless I'm asked, or when people start talking like they know every vegetarian because of &quot;this one girl&quot;.  I am probably the least preachy vegetarian out there, and I still get shit.  If you ask about it, I will educate you.  Otherwise, do your own thing, and I'll do mine.<br>
<br>
I do eat dairy, and some people (mostly those that eat meat) will call me a hypocrite for eating any animal product at all.  Fine, call me what you will, but remember that I never asked what you thought.  I'm not looking to change your life, you shouldn't feel threatened by mine.  Grow the fuck up.<br>
<br>
And to answer the dairy thing, just becuase I can't change the world doesn't mean I can't do my best to try reducing my impact on it.  If you feel the urge to hurl insults at a guy who wants reduce suffering and cruelty by as much as he is capable, if that makes you feel better, then have at it.<br>
<br>
Just don't talk any of your shit near me.  If you can dish it out, you sure as hell better be ready to take it.<br>
<br>
I'm all for disagreement.  Open discussion.  But the flaming here on this thread is what I've run into for the past 3 years, and frankly, it's pretty lame.  Close-minded people are only so creative, and frankly there was NOTHING I've heard here that I haven't already heard from those that troll in real life.  Find something better to aim your little brains at.<br>
<br>
And to the original poster (I can't believe I have to write this, it feels like elementary school), just because one member of a perceived group did something does not mean that they all do.  /sigh.  There ya go.  I'll send you a bill for that lesson on life.<br>

If the person is a vegetarian or vegan, I will ask if they mind someone else eating meat.  If they do, I don't at the meal with them but might get something to eat later *shrug*.<br>
<br>
The really odd dietary thing was the person I met who is a vegetarian who doesn't like vegies.  I blinked a few times, completely lost.  Then what do you eat, I asked.  Not much, was his reply.<br>
<br>
I think of vegetarian and vegan pretty much in the same light as other food preferances or allergies.  I can't handle curry, so I can't eat Indian (even the non-curry items of the menu have traces of curry from the pots and utensils... enough to get a reaction).  My roommate can't eat anything with cloves (try to find pre-made pumpkin pie that lists out those &quot;other spices&quot;, a true pain).  My boyfriend dislikes Chinese but likes other Asian.  I can't stand fish.  My boyfriend's brother is intensely allergic to eggs.  I might have an egg allergy, but can't stand them anyway.  I don't drink soda any more.  I know people allergic to chocolate (poor poor people).  I have problems with dairy (but still love cheese and ice cream... I just learned to suffer for my love).  I know serveral people who keep some level of kosher.  And so on.<br>
<br>
The problem is those who are self-rigteous on BOTH sides.<br>
<br>
But... you should see my cookbook collection... vegetarian/vegan, meats, kosher, french, italian, german, chinese, japanese, american, cookies, candies, bread, etc.  I need to get back into cooking....<br>

<br>
I probably wouldn't disagree that cats need meat in their diets to stay healthy, but they can and do eat other stuff.<br>
<br>
Our cat <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> loves</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> nacho chips, glazed donuts, cheese puffs, potato chips, and a few other junk foods.  I don't mean she'll eat these if you give them to her, I mean she meows her head off if she sees you eating them, and tries to stick her head in the bag to get some, etc.<br>
<br>
She eats bread &amp; bagels and other stuff too, but usually only nibbles at them unless there's cheese of some kind on them.<br>
<br>
It's funny, because I eat salt &amp; vinegar potato chips, and she loves the chips but hates the vinegar, so she just sits there meowing at the chip, and looking expectantly at me, like I'm gonna lick the salt &amp; vinegar off of the chip for her.  She's so spoiled...<br>

I have no problem with people eating meat around me, and I am in excellent health.  I work out 2-3 times a week most weeks and am in decent physical condition.<br>
<br>
Being a vegetarian has not negatively impacted my health at all.<br>
<br>
Debate all you want about the ethics of veg*anism vs. meat-eating, I don't particularly care to be honest.  However, if you are going to say &quot;vegans are pale, scrawny, freaks&quot; or make other health claims about a particular diet, then cite your source.  Anecdotal evidence (&quot;I knew this girl...&quot;) is not acceptable in scientific circles, so don't use it as the basis for your &quot;logical argument.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for intolerant veg*ans, I've known several.  I've also known several intolerant meat-eaters who would take immediate offense to my &quot;No thank you, I'm a vegetarian&quot; when offered a bit of meat.  What does this prove?  Absolutely nothing other than some people are intolerant @$$holes.<br>

I won't disagree with you there.  Just avoid chocolate and onions, both of which are poisonous to cats.  I don't mean to say they can't handle other things.  They can't necessarily digest it or digest it as well, but they will eat it.  They just can't survive on non-meat alone is what I meant. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>
