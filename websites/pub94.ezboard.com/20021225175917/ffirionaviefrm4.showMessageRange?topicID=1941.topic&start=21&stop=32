<br>
Almost all societies and nations argue that their atrocities are in the name of good. Societies almost never revel in being evil.<br>
<br>
But this is atleast a common fantasy idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Again, as I later replied in this thread, the problem can occur on both sides.  And the funny thing here is Valquiss himself is fairly tolerant, but I work with a lot of people who aren't so I tend to take their view of things.  I don't want to involve anyone else by name here....oh wait, I'll use Bane as an example.  Bane is a good example.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Drizzet:  &quot;No!  I'm a good dark elf.  I'm reformed, you should give me a chance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bane:  &quot;No Tier'dal is good, because you are spawn of an evil god.  Now crawl back under your rock and stay there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, that's role-playing, granted, and that much I will give anyone.  If they are role-playing I'll roleplay back.  But I may well be role-playing being A) intolerant and B) unwilling to co-operate with them or help them.  And that's got to be an acceptable option.<br>
<br>
I've had far too many enounters lately with &quot;non-traditional&quot; character concepts who seem to think I owe them a chance to be my friend. And I don't.  I'll give them their chance to be dismissed in character and with appropriate flourishes, and if they deal with it well and amusingly they'll go on my list of players I appreciate, but that won't change the reaction of my character to their character.<br>
<br>
So yes, I agree with the spirit of this post, I just think the problem is two-sided.  As often as not, it is the good Tier'dal, or whatever, unwilling to accept that the dwarven paladin, or whatever, just isn't going to give him a chance under any conditions to be friends.  He won't accept that the player of that dwarf has a character concept and he just isn't budging.  Well, I don't expect the Tier'dal in question to be evil like all the other Tier'dal just to make my role-playing work, but dammit, the player of that Tier'dal has no right to expect anyone else's character concept to change either, to accomodate them.<br>
<br>
And let's face it, when you insist on doing something so non-traditional you know in advance you are going to be at odds with the rest of the world.  I know it must get frustrating, and I'm sorry, but I'm still not going to change what I'm playing to accomodate anyone else.  Or demand they do the same.<br>

Halfling cleric turned into a troll. I'm a troll shaman if you somehow caught me off /roleplay. I want to give some veiws on the flipped side of the coin. I just wish that sombody would refuse a group with me. I think that most people who choose a non-traditional character set up are just begging for some roleplay. I went through a good long time as a halfling cleric with no roleplaying what so ever. Picking a non-traditional class set up has really brought some people who wouldn't want to roleplay at all into the world a bit more. I did actually play the halfling cleric for 49 seasons, and after playing both, i've made a decision. People out there are not going to roleplay unless you take the initive. Being able to say somthing weird when sombody asks a simple question like race/class? really helps that. I mainly play in pickup groups, since my play hours change every day, so finding a set group of people that actually roleplay is a real problem. Even though I understand some of you might not like the idea of a shrunk troll running around talking about jumjum and such, I think it's helped a lot in my playing career. )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elsbetsquishytoes>elsbet squishytoes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Grey</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/7/02 5:17:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1941.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Maxwell</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I went through a good long time as a halfling cleric with no roleplaying what so ever.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Bah, Faias.  I roleplayed with ya long long ago on the dock in Freeport while I had to wait for the fabled &quot;boat&quot;.  I definitely roleplayed with ya that day.  <br>
<br>
I watched your career from afar, hoping to run into you again some day, but our paths never crossed again.  Us haflin clerics are rare, and I like to know what ye all are doing.  Now that you are a filthy troll animal, though, I can't have nothin ta do with ye now.  Was the same way with Yugisha, way back when... a halfling cleric that then decided to be a lizard necromancer.  Such a shame to see so many once-good players turn to evil because that team has a bigger presence on our server.<br>
<br>
I continue to act as though there were alignments and racial tensions, and I absolutely do not believe in the myth of evil druids and good tier'dal.  Go ahead and spout your nonsense at me, all day long, I will not believe a word of it, and I will probably smash in your head if you bother me long enough.  At this point in my old age, I am playing my character more &quot;good&quot; than I initially meant for her to be, but this is because far too many people will compromise their characters' viewpoints and group with whatever is convenient.  <br>
I will die in a gory mess to aid a paladin, but I will absolutely not heal any tier'dal, for any reason whatsoever, and I have a hell of a fun time playing my game in that manner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faias>Faias</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I liek Jumjum!</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/02 5:19:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1941.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Maxwell</span><hr size=1> Heh, that was a while ago I seem to find that the higher and higher season I get the less and less I find people willing to roleplay, or maybe it's just all the roleplayers move on to luclin, and such where I cannot tread <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

I just roleplay my character the way I always have, with anybody I run into that wants to listen to me babble. Heh.  I rarely go OOC, and I hold fast to my principles, and refuse to help evil characters out.<br>
<br>
I find that people will roleplay if they are roleplayed to.  This tends to be true even in the high-end game; we have a great collection of people here on both sides that will uphold RP standards.  On the other hand, I've been here for a very long time, and I never have to join a random pickup group with characters I shouldn't really be associating with.  I am blessed to have a great guild and the Fellowship to group with, and all of them stick to their principles, even in the 50s, and it's a nice thing.  But I imagine it might be hard to create a new character here tomorrow and expect things to work out as well as they have for Elsie.<br>
<br>
EQ just has too many things about it that are not conducive to a roleplay mindset, and VI/SOE changing so many of our rules on March 8th didn't help with that.  But I am glad I came here, and I have been lucky. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jharycleric>Jharycleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/02 12:24:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1941.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Work with the Roleplay</span><hr size=1> Mainly I was concerned with just giving the peoples I mentioned a chance to roleplay with you.  If a Wood Elf tries to tell Shin how evil they are, Shin can be dismissive, try and duel them, insult their mother, but Shin will give the person a shot at roleplaying. As I metioned, I have had some fun with the Ven Sho, they are nothing but dismissive, and derisive, they are also really cool people some of whom I have had the pleasure of raiding with in OOC fashion. I know some people have talked crap about that too, but as Fuvi mentioned once, till you try and play in an All or mostly Iksar Guild you have no idea the true high end limitations placed upon you by the game.

As an Iksar, I don't accept that, Goblins simply aren't that capable. My roleplay views her as an Iksar who's egg was addled, who thinks she is really a goblin. Roleplaying, I have great pity for her, while she has great scorn for me. We can both roleplay our views and enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
You don't need to &quot;buy into&quot; someone elses characterizations to roleplay with them.<br>
