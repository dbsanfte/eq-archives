He was laying on his stomach, exposing the four inch scar that marked the entry point of the rogue’s dagger. Pus bubbled from around its puckered edges each time the gnome took a halting breath. <br>
<br>
Valkiri slowly ran her finger along the bubbling crust, collecting a half congealed green and red-flecked globule. Her tongue snaked out and delicately lifted the glistening mass into her mouth. Residual poison burned her mouth like strong whiskey, she swallowed with relish.<br>
<br>
“Why are you always the lucky one, I want to be the one poisoned next time!” She said petulantly.<br>
<br>
“Sure, you say that now.” Mal said hoarsely.<br>
 <br>
“You are right of course, I think Velious would be a good place to hide out, Spartax, Opious and Keemodo have been hunting there lately.” Valkiri said sucking on her finger. “I don’t think the barbarians would think to look for us in a frozen wasteland.”<br>
<br>
“Who will watch my shop?” Maladominus said mournfully as his gaze darted from one jar of questionable contents to another. His guise as an apothecary had been his first and most successful cover. <br>
<br>
“I can, if it is only for a little while.” A quiet voice said.<br>
<br>
Both Valkiri and Maladominus turned to look at the speaker. A tall human female in a purple robe stood in the shadows, one of the few new recruits to the temple that the gnome had been able to save from the blood feud of the barbarians. <br>
<br>
“I won’t be gone that long.” Maladominus said hopefully, “It wont be long before some one else angers these barbarians and they go after someone else.”<br>
<br>
A throaty chuckle warped into a barking laugh caused the gnome necromancer to turn back towards the shadow knight. It was the first time he had ever seen Valkiri display any humor other than her usual gallows wit. The herald of Bertoxulous wore a ghastly smile that showed entirely too many teeth, it was like watching the crocodiles of the Oasis of Mar grin at a wounded 10th season paladin.<br>
<br>
“I take it you have an idea?” the gnome said testily.<br>
<br>
“Its perfect!” Valkiri said holding up the broken arrow that the ranger Mosak had thrown at Maygrot in disgust. “We just need to get a few more items.” She looked pointedly at Philia the robed human female. “How would you like to get some revenge on Holly Windstalker?”<br>
<br>
“She has been a thorn in my side since I first chose this path!” the young Necromancer hissed. “If you will work against her count me in.”<br>
<br>
The next morning dawned bright and clear in Qeynos hills. Holly Windstalker was on her usual patrol protecting the wolves and the bears of the area from harm. She loved her job, since it allowed her to kill poachers on sight, none could survive her devastating combination of magic and steel and few were quick enough to escape to the safety of Black Burrow or Qeynos when she began to chase them. <br>
<br>
As she stalked along the western borders of the hills she heard a familiar laugh. It was the sound that those damnable skeletons made when they were the summoned tools of the Necromancers. She followed the sound behind a large hill, there she saw a horrifying sight. Dead bears and wolves littered the area, their corpses left to rot beneath the hot sun. Standing in the middle of this carnage was a young human female bloody to the elbows and obviously in league with the Millers.<br>
<br>
“You will pay for your crimes!” Shouted the ranger as she charged into the remote valley with a feral grin on her face, this young one would stand no chance against her.<br>
<br>
“I think not.” A voice said as darkness surrounded her.<br>
<br>
“Your feeble spell cannot stop me Necromancer!” The ranger growled, drawing both of her blades and turning to face her second opponent.<br>
<br>
Further back in the ravine a second figure stood in the shadows, this was the one that had dared to attack her. She charged towards this new enemy, surprised at how slowly she moved, the darkness snaring her as well as one of her own spells. It would not matter this new enemy was trapped, it would have to run past her to escape the valley. As she got closer her blood began to burn. It was extraordinarily painful.<br>
<br>
At last she could see her enemy plainly, a tall human female holding a great-spear in black plate armor looked at her with an eager expression. Her twin long swords flashed in the sun as she closed on the Shadowknight. Before she got close enough to strike the great-spear plunged into her side, the blade drank deep, sucking greedily at her life force. <br>
<br>
The ranger knew in an instant she would find no victory here.  Gritting her teeth she leapt backwards, drawing the eager spear point out of her body with a wet sucking sound.<br>
Behind her she could hear the skeleton of the Necromancer approaching with a cackle. Twin blades made a statacco beat as they sundered the skeleton, but it had delayed her too long. Again the spear struck her, this time in the leg and yet more energy was stolen away. <br>
<br>
Holly shouted weakly for help as she hobbled towards the top of the hill, but the animals she had fought to save paid her cries no heed, and the guards of Qeynos were too far away to hear. <br>
<br>
“She is yours…” The Shadow Knight said commandingly.<br>
<br>
Spells gripped her again, stealing her strength, courage and life force. Holly crested the top of the hill with a gasp of agony, she could see far away the path that led to Surefall Glade, her home. She would never see it again…<br>
<br>
“Take her boots, her swords and her beltpouch.” Valkiri ordered as Philia approached her kill.<br>
<br>
Attracted by the scent of fresh blood a pack of wolves were now circling the two followers of the plague god. The Alpha male advanced growling until it caught the scent of Valkiri. As she approached it rolled onto its back and exposed its belly making its total submission readily apparent to the rest of the pack. The pack waited patiently while Philia looted the corpse of the fallen ranger. <br>
<br>
“Stupid nature lovers, the beasts of the earth don’t care about their efforts, they only care about full bellies.” Valkiri muttered as the pair stalked off the hill. <br>
<br>
Behind them the wolves circled the fresh kill for a moment before beginning to feast.<br>
<br>
The journey through Black Burrow was exhilarating for Philia, the gnolls refused to approach or even look at them it was as if they knew better. There was a moment of excitement as a huge gnoll commander drove a swarm of inexperienced adventurers before him as a wolf drove sheep. It stopped and glowered at Valkiri for a moment. <br>
<br>
The shadow knight drew a wicked looking long sword and held it over her head. The blade literally whined in its eagerness to drink gnoll blood. The commander fled back into the depths of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
When they entered everfrost Valkiri stopped and drew the dead ranger’s boots onto her own feet. Windstalker’s sword felt good in her grip as the two agents of evil strolled leisurely towards the bottom of the ramp that led to the cave mouth. There at the bottom stood a barbarian guard, Arnish Mc Leish. It was a short fight. When it was over bloody bootprints stood out in stark relief in the snow.<br>
<br>
“What now?” Philia asked.<br>
<br>
“Now comes the hard part.” Valkiri said sourly as she began casting spells to protect her in the upcoming battle.<br>
<br>
The two waited in a frozen glacial rift, invisible, for what seemed like hours, as oblivious barbarians wandered to and fro across the tundra.<br>
<br>
“Here it comes.” Growled Valkiri as a young barbarian ran breathlessly up to Bandl Mc Marrin.<br>
<br>
“Arnish is Dead!” He panted.<br>
<br>
“Who dares to slay one of the wolves of the north?” Commanded Bandl, hefting a fine steel two-handed sword. “Show me where!”<br>
<br>
The two barbarians ran past them towards the entrance to Black Burrow. <br>
<br>
“Don’t get too close, these barbarians are cunning.” Valkiri admonished as they approached the ramp. Where Bandl and the young warrior were looking at the corpse of Arnish. It took them a moment to get fully into position. <br>
<br>
“Kill the young one!” the herald of Bertoxolous thundered as she charged Bandl.<br>
<br>
Bandl was an experienced warrior and he fought like his namesake. No quarter was asked and none given. Blood painted the snow with broad strokes but in the end Valkiri stood victorious over the dead guard. Philia had a much easier time with her target.<br>
<br>
“Drag that one to the cave mouth, where the gnolls can get to him.” Valkiri panted, pointing to Philia’s victim. <br>
<br>
The fight had been frighteningly close and she had not dared to cast any spells that would leave a lasting impression on her prey. Calmly she plunged the blade into Bandl’s chest, pushing hard so that it stuck into the frozen ground beneath him. A casual flick of her hand deposited the shattered arrow from the Surefall Ranger, next to Arnish. Next she took the beltpouch and dropped it next to Bandl.<br>
<br>
Relations between the barbarians of Halas and the rangers of Surefall Glade had always been tenuous at best. Their mutual hatred of the Bloodsabers had for a long time held them together in an uneasy truce, the barbarians resenting their inability to hunt in the Qeynos Hills area and the Rangers anger at the slaughter of young polar bear cubs kept them from being anything more than the coolest of allies. <br>
<br>
It did not, in the end, take much to set them against each other. In the ocean of blood that was spilt afterwards all traces of the handiwork of Philia, Valkiri and Maladominus was washed away. It was Philia who made the death of Holly Windstalker possible, Valkiri who slew the guards of Halas and Maladominus who forged the note which stated simply, “the beasts of everfrost  have suffered long enough at the hands of the barbarians, they cannot protect themselves, it falls to you Holly to teach them the error of their ways.” <br>
<br>
And so it was that the forces of Decay grew stronger and those of good became divided against each other, and the Herald of the Plague Bringer came one step closer to fulfilling her destiny.<br>
<br>
Valkiri Blackhand, Shadowknight of the League of Shadows.<br>
