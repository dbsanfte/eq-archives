The last one they had where the undead came into North Ro was a blast!<br>
<br>
BTW it was really cool on this server to have so many people helping others obtain items that were appropriate for other classes when they dropped.<br>
<br>
Good for morale.  Good for making friends.  Good for the server.<br>

Hope they do it again!<br>

      <br>
 You enter the two story structure of the Tavern known as The Blood. As you enter many faces turn and stare at you.<br>
To your left you see three coldain playing cards with a robed Teir'Dal lady. To the right you see a human in full plate, a strong jaw and long black hair. This man seems powerful but he travels with a gnome in a dark robe. The gnome seems to be carrying a book made of iron and a silver skull carved on the front. The two are having a drink of the House ale, Blood Wine.<br>
At the bar five faces met your gaze. One troll in stinky leather armor, and he seems to have some sort of spiked whip at his side. A middle aged male halfling with curly blonde hair, nice studded leather and expensive looking daggers attached to his deathfist emblazoned belt.<br>
Another human, this one in chainmail and bearing the creast of Hate on his black silk cape. <br>
A hooded female figure is the forth face that meets your gaze. All you can see is she has some sort of elven features in this low candle-lit room.<br>
The fifth person to look upon you at the bar seems to be a ogre of great strength. He wields of large blade mounted on his back. He also has many blades attached to his sword harness. He wears heavy silver full plate. He looks at you and gives a slight smile.<br>
You come to the edge of the bar and notice the bartender now. He was not noticable before with the troll in the way. The bartender asks you what you would like to drink. Your shocked it is a white-furred gnoll. He looks friendly enough though and you order a drink.<br>
<br>
You sit and have your drink for a time and then notice something strange that you had not seen before. A hallway to the right side of the bar. At the end you see a dark oak table with a curtain behind it. At the table there appears to be two chairs. One seems to be occupied by a shadowy cloaked figure.<br>
<br>
You are curious so you walk toward the table. As you get closer you hear a voice as soft as a whisper, but deep as a chasm. &quot;Greetings, please come and sit.&quot;<br>
<br>
You come closer and deside to take a seat. Under the hood you see two piercing red eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;I understand you are new to this area?&quot; &quot;Perhaps I can assist thee.&quot;<br>
The man gives you a letter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Take this letter to a friend of mine and I shall reward you with a great treasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be warned however, anyone but my friend that reads this note shall suffer under my wrath.&quot;<br>
<br>
You ask who this friend is...the reply...<br>
<br>
&quot;Banegrivm&quot;   Tell him a old friend is back...tell him he will understand once he reads the letter.<br>
<br>
You make your way out of the Tavern and into the cold night air of the Eastern Commonlands.<br>
<br>
*You stare at the letter in your hands* What to do next?<br>
<br>
<br>

Beware you infidels! <br>
<br>
The power of my Master -- The Plaguebringer -- shall finally manifest itself upon all of Norrath. <br>
<br>
Our ranks grow stronger and stronger each day. <br>
<br>
Just yesterday I was in Qeynos assisting two new necromancer initiates in the guild of the Blood Sabres. <br>
<br>
The ranks of His Minions will continue to swell! <br>

<br>
IMHO if Verant continues to do more Bertoxxulous-related GM events similar to the older Karana Plague events.... then eventually my guess is that we will soon see a portal to the Plane of Decay. At least that's my theory, since it has long been speculated that Verant will imminently open up a new evil plane for Bertoxxulous. Likewise, I also hope that this means tons and tons more new quests and items specially for Bertoxxulous worshipping characters like myself! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Weary of foot, her voice ragged from three days of constant warring and travel, Minuet pushed through the mist of Nektulos Woods. Despite the fatigue, her spirit was still buoyant, for upon her legs were the gorgeous blue Lambent Greaves, as promised to her by Walthin Fireweaver. Meeting his price had turned out to be difficult, much more then she had bargained for. If only it had been the simple collection and delivery of obscure minutiae from around the continent, as the task had originally presented itself.<br>
<br>
She still struggled with the memories of the Dark Troll and his slave. Her mind waging war on itself, she clung to her belief that it takes all kinds to fill the world. Even if some of those kinds were of an evil best not to be mentioned by name. In the end, vanity won. She ran her hands along the cool azure armor, as she had done unvaryingly since taking them from Walthin’s hands. Vanity, it wasn’t a sin.<br>
<br>
The Tier Dal guards gave her only a moment’s glance, thanks to the clever disguise afforded her by her enchanted mask, and she passed unmolested through the heavily guarded checkpoints along the road. The steady cadence of her drum kept her moving and it was not long before the woods began to thin and the pastures of the Commonlands surrounded her. It would be good to have the warmth and protection of the Sisters’ hall for a night, and she looked forward to the bath and warm bed that awaited her there.<br>
<br>
She was startled by a raspy voice. Disembodied, it echoed off the isolated buildings. She searched for source as it pronounced in a ghoulish tone,<br>
<br>
“You will not escape the grasp of the Plaguebringer. Bertoxxulous will strike again.”<br>
<br>
In her haste and distracted by her search for the speaker, Minuet failed to see the cluster of ghouls until the last minute. They were huddled over the corpse of some poor sod, squabbling over some choice morsel. She veered away at the last moment, but it was too late. She had caught their attention, and the horrid wights began to give chase, more interested in the hunt for fresh meat then in their current meal. <br>
<br>
Now as most people know, a bard at full tilt is the fastest thing on the face of Norrath. Minuet had no fear of being dragged down by the vicious claws and fangs of the pursuing ghouls. As she had a steady gain on them, she stopped to look back. To her horror, the ghouls had veered off towards another traveler, who was unaware of his plight. She raced towards him, shouting,<br>
<br>
“Run!! Run blast you!!!”<br>
<br>
 She was too late and the ghouls descended upon the hapless man in a blithering mass of foul teeth and rotten flesh. Hoping to save him in the only way she knew how, Minuet pulled out her mandolin and played a dissonant chord. Even their unlife could not defend them from the majik she summoned forth from her instrument and in anger they leapt from their victim and began to give chase to her once more.<br>
<br>
This time Minuet knew she could not let the ghouls continue forth on their rampage. She held no love for the folk of the Commonlands, but they treated her fairly enough, and they were not deserving of such calamity. She looked back over her shoulder. One, two…five ghouls had given chase. She muttered a silent prayer to Erollisi, and turned back into the horde.<br>
<br>
Undead are stupid, at least the simple creatures such as these ghouls. Minuet led them on a merry chase, all through the early morning and well into the day. She taunted them by letting them close on her, just until they were within earshot and then blasted forth another dissonant chord. As they reeled she would speed away. Twice she let them get too close and they pummeled her and laid at her with their filthy talons. She found herself rooted to the spot by their fell majk. But at the last minute, when it seemed her doom was certain, she was able to break free of the paralyzing grip, and she continued on her parade. Slowly the ghouls were overcome by her playing and they began to fall to the side, whatever force that had animated them beyond death now driven out. The last ghoul turned to flee and Minuet promptly ran up from behind and finished it with a resounding crack from her mandolin.<br>
<br>
She rested for a moment but then caught sight of another group of three ghouls skulking along in the shadows. She licked her lips, gritted her teeth, and set off after them.<br>
<br>
“Taboot!”<br>
