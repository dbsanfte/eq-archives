The only way I would accept any changes to the TCL would be that every item other than low end stuff obtainable would be non-equippable by anyone under 25, the 25 coming from that they can now make money easily enough or group and get better items. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 6:29:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> TLC is really not a problem for ..</span><hr size=1> .. my character now. I know all the quests I want and I've got them covered.  However, it's a big huge warty problem for new quests that are added and for all newbies.  TLC gives me a huge advantage over newbies and those without two comps/accounts.  That's bad.<br>
<br>
1.  TLC promotes uber &quot;phat lewt&quot; &amp; level chasing play over roleplay.  It gives a big advantage to those with money to pay lowbies to quest for them.  It gives a big advantage to those with two accounts and two computers (can farm low items with blur, atone, FD, etc.).  It gives a bigger advantage to those that read spoiler sites than it does for non-TLC -- it almost makes reading spoiler sites essential.<br>
<br>
2. TLC breaks quests.  You can't do quest discovery.  Many quests involve killing green creatures for no-drop items (which of course trivial-out here).  You can't even see what you might have obtained when trying a new quest with TLC in place.  Basically, you have to wait until someone else solves it and posts the spoiler on the web.<br>
<br>
3. TLC promotes farming.  You *MUST* pay a farmer for blocked items.  There is no way around that other than two computers (see point 1).  TLC encourages lowbies to farm rare TLC blocked items and charge outrageous sums for them.  Without TLC, you have the choice to pay a farmer or camp it yourself.  With TLC, you simply pay -- no choice.  You need to empty your wallet on a newbie raising plat to buy ethereal mist or fire up your 2nd comp/account (y'all do have a two comps and accounts, right?).<br>
<br>
Most people that support TLC are non-roleplaying web d00ds that want to kick back and let someone else solve the quests for them.  After the spoiler is on the web, they have no problems not doing the quest themselves, but rather reading about it and paying someone to do it for them.  Those that aren't web-d00ds are perma-lowbies that want to charge outrageous prices to farm trivial items so they can buy gear they have no intention of leveling up to obtain themselves.  Most generalizations are ridiculous.<br>
<br>
When you see a level 1 player in full planar armor, I think you'll change your mind about how good TLC is.  Or maybe not.  Maybe you're one of those that wants to buy planar on ebay instead of hunt for it yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uchiporama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chiporama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 7:45:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC is really not a problem for ..</span><hr size=1> Most of your points are baseless statements lacking any hard evidence (other than opinion) to back them.<br>
<br>
Addressing your Points:<br>
<br>
1) &quot;TLC promotes uber &quot;phat lewt&quot; &amp; level chasing play over roleplay... it gives advantages....&quot;<br>
False:<br>
- TLC does not promote 'phat Lewt' or level chasing, especially over Roleplaying.   You give no solid example of how the TLC directly causes either of these by itself (IE - a person with 2 computers and 2 accounts still holds that advantage without the TLC.  And people will still read spolier sights to solve quests, and you can still solve quest without reading spoiler sights.).    <br>
<br>
2) &quot;TLC breaks quests. You can't do quest discovery&quot;<br>
False:<br>
- Most quests tell you what you need, either by quest NPC or book in library.   In most quests, you do not 'discover' a quest when you kill a mob (ie - the mob drop does not suddenly tell you about the quest).<br>
<br>
3) &quot;TLC promotes farming. You *MUST* pay a farmer for blocked items&quot;<br>
False:<br>
- Paying farmers is not the *ONLY* way to obtain blocked items.  You can merchant mine, plan ahead and farm yourself when with in the TLC, have a guildie get it for you, find a newbee not charging insane prices, etc.  Farming on one level or another is a part of the game (it is part of the player economy).  <br>
<br>
4) &quot;Most people that support TLC are non-roleplaying web d00ds that want to kick back and let someone else solve the quests for them&quot;<br>
- False<br>
You have no evidence and make a  broad baseless acusation.<br>
<br>
5) &quot;When you see a level 1 player in full planar armor, I think you'll change your mind about how good TLC is.&quot;<br>
- False<br>
It is near impossible for a level 1 to make enough money farming anything to make the money to purchase a full set of planar armor (at a resonable price, not at 1 plat per piece).<br>
<br>
6) &quot;Maybe you're one of those that wants to buy planar on ebay instead of hunt for it yourself.&quot;<br>
- False<br>
Do you know me?  Did I indicate this in my posts? Again, another example of baseless statements.<br>
<br>
In general your arguments are baseless acusations to support a rule that you disagree with.  You castigate vaild arguments against your statements, rather than offer strong evidence to support your position.  In fact, most of your statements would are better arguments for the the TLC (in that without it, most of the issues you stated would be rampant, just as they are on other normal servers).<br>
<br>
Your arguments seem to simply elude to you haveing negative experiences with the TLC.  That you probably had negative experiences in attempting to purchase TLC blocked items, and that you feel 'cheated' by the TLC barrier that you are faced with.  Now I do not know you, so I am only making an educated guess based on your posts rather than following your example of making wild acusations, disparaging remarks and baseless statements to support my position.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to hear some 'hard' facts why the TLC should be removed.  What are some quests that are completely unsolvable because of the TLC (and it can only be fixed by removing the TLC).  How does the TLC make the game unplayable?  Not the 'it makes my life difficult so remove it' opinion.<br>

I countered most of your points in previous posts. Instead of repeating them all I would encourage you to read the thread &quot;Another TLC rant&quot;.<br>
<br>
Most of us that are against TLC love this server. We want to make it better. Alot of us have brought up valid points and they need to be addressed. Please read the other TLC related posts on this board and you may gain an appreciation of our issue with TLC.<br>
<br>
Shaman epic is the most recent one I have heard that was impossible but here are some more. Long sword of Ethreal Energy: Impossible to do if you were level 35 or over when Luclin came out. The hammer of Ethreal Enregy, same reason. And the rest of the Ethreal weapon quests. Then of course there are the newbie quests that came out, you can't expect us to believe that verant intended those Val shir quests to be impossible to do on Firona Vie..&quot;Sorry you chose this server, so you can't do these quests&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Please refrain from calling anyone who seeks to modify TLC a farmer or a power gamer. It simply isn't true and is an unfair generalization. It would be like me saying anyone who supports TLC hasn't explored and doesnt quest.<br>

You didn't even read what I wrote.  Read it again and perhaps you will understand.  Your points here, for instance, quote me out of context.  I never accused anyone of anything: I practically hit you over the head with that sarcastic bit about all generalizations being ridiculous and you still took them all at face value.  Ah, pearls before swine!<br>
<br>
In simple words of little sylable the reason TLC should be removed is that it forces farming instead of permiting people to solve quests themselves.  When faced with a TLC blocked item, you are required to pay outrageous sums for a simple to obtain item, delevel yourself (absolutely NOT an option that should even be considered), or use a 2nd-comp mule.  Most do not have a second comp+account.  That means large sums, which are not available until you are high level.  So, TLC promotes leveling and &quot;phat lewt&quot; gathering so you can afford to pay the farmers.<br>
<br>
TLC doesn't stop farming.  It just makes it more exclusive.  Guess what I found when I went to wisp island to get some xp and cash?  A high level druid and mule on 2nd comp farming every wisp on the island.  Guess what I find when hiring lowbies for quests?  Complete disinterest.  I don't blaim them.  I can't afford to pay much at all, nor do I wish to.<br>
<br>
And, yes, it completely removes all hope of quest discovery from the game.  I did quite a bit of that on my other server.  Some of the most worthwhile quests do not tell you which mob to kill or what to do with the item or even what the item is (eg. monk shackles).  You often have to kill armies of green things and then use an identify spell on everything that drops.  If things don't drop due to TLC, you can't solve the quest.<br>
<br>
The iksar shackle quest was so buggy that I had leveled my monk to 57 before they finally fixed it.  So, I'm supposed to delevel to 15 to finish it?  I'm supposed to find and pay a lowbie to spend 20-50 hours camping green junk when we don't even know if it's really fixed or what we really need? It took 4 rounds of &quot;we fixed it!&quot;, &quot;uh, no you didn't!&quot;  Ask a friend to do that camp?  I wouldn't even dream of it.  I'm not that cruel to my friends.<br>
<br>
Now for myself, I have a 2nd comp and account.  TLC is no hardship for me personally -- other than having to maintain a mule of the right level.  I'm thinking about the folks that are real newbies, don't have two accounts, don't have two computers, haven't played multiple characters to post-50, or don't read the web.  That covers most people.  They're great people.  They make this server so much more fun than a regular blue server.  TLC will squash them flat.  It turns FV from a RP server into an RP/experts server.<br>
<br>
TLC is for elitists.  I like newbies, especially the non-begging variety, which seems to be all FV has.  FV has great newbies!  I seriously dislike pretention and elitist snobbery; eg. &quot;You knew about TLC when coming here.  *I* can get a round it. I don't give a damn if you can or not, so lump it or leave it.&quot;  Hell, I can get around it, too.  Most can't.  I do give a damn about them.  So, I don't like TLC.<br>
<br>
If all I cared about was myself, I'd say keep the TLC and get rid of the alignments.  Then I could make a lizard monk that could group with everyone and still twink my second char with planar armor.  It will just be a while before I can do that.  I'm sure others are already doing it -- they're just not being obvious about it.<br>
<br>
BTW, I'm not going to go into the exploits TLC permits for obvious reasons.  Think about it, though.  Almost nothing is no-drop.  If I was selfish, I'd be embracing TLC like a twin seperated since birth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 237<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 10:48:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin quests...</span><hr size=1> As to the starting quests for the Vah Shir:<br>
<br>
If you're not a Vah Shir, you can't do them.  Period.  You have to turn in your Acryllia Sheet in order to activate them, at one stage or another.<br>
<br>
They are completeable.  A bit tough, I'll grant you, but they can be done.  I've done them.<br>
<br>
I like TLC.  Not because of the individual restriction but because of the overall effect it has had on the server.  Players on FV are smart.  Really smart.  Our resident uber guild, FnF, is not filled with d00ds and l33t3s but rather thoughtful and considered tactical players.  Our general population has a better understanding of the mechanics of the game and the way that classes can interact than any other server that I've seen, and I've seen several.<br>
<br>
Newbies to the game are learning at the very start how to run their characters effectively.  People are more polite to each other because the only way to erase your rep is to restart your one and only character.  Grouping is stronger because we HAVE to form tight-knit groups.<br>
<br>
Yes, server population is low.  That's because we're only getting organic growth and not server-changes, for the most part.  Those who wanted to acquire rather than experience have stayed away, or left almost immediately.  Our new adds are people who are brand new to the game, and that's a good thing.<br>
<br>
So, my vote:  Napster bad.  TLC good.<br>

That being said, if they're useable by other races, then on another server you would simply need to run the quest and get the result.  No need to interact with anyone other than the required NPC's.<br>
<br>
This is FV, however, so the rules change slightly.  You need to RP through it.  I'm not familiar with the quests, but if TLC is keeping you from completing it, then the answer is to ally yourself with Vah Shir of the appropriate level, and assist them as they assist you.  That way you can complete the quest.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget, Verant puts new quests into the game quite often.  This is not a static environment.  Therefore, on a TLC server, if you want to run a quest that is newly introduced and you're above the level where you can actually run it, you need to ally yourself with others.  This stops quests from being dominated by high level players as soon as they're introduced.  I'm not saying that this would happen on FV, but it does make sense to me.<br>
<br>
For my part, I'd be glad to help you out with these quests.  It gives me something to look forward to, and I kind of look at it the same way as when I help out someone lower than me... I get nothing for it, but you'll remember me as a good guy in the future.  Maybe you'll even buy some of my fish rolls.  Not holding my breath though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, again, my response is that FV breeds an intelligent player.  And because of this, we can work around TLC through interaction, which is why it was implemented.<br>

The starting guild note is not no-drop and the citizenship quest gives phenominal faction.  I went from indifferent to amiable in just one hand-in.<br>
<br>
BTW, I don't think TLC breeds intelligence -- shrewd cunning perhaps, but not intelligence.  It requires that you do three things: 1. wait until someone else has solved the quest and posted it on the web.  2. hunt the web for spoilers.  3. find a way around the TLC.  So, it seems to me that it breeds behavior that is somewhat lazy and exploitive rather than encouraging people to figure out and do quests for themselves.<br>
<br>
For most servers, 1&amp;2 are optional.  You can choose to be lazy and wait or you can choose to solve it yourself.  Here, you must wait.  That's the problem.  You can't even read about a quest and decide to go off and do it on your own time.  You have to research mob levels and trivial points, pick your level window, and recruit lowbies to kill for you.  You can't do your research in-game, the /con system will only tell you all the mobs are green, not where they're trivial.  This makes questing far harder here.  So much harder that unless the reward is substantial, most people won't bother.  Kinda takes the &quot;quest&quot; out of Everquest.<br>
<br>
If every single quest item was exempted from the TLC, then I'd have no problem with it.  I see that as essentially removing TLC from the server.  We don't need TLC because we don't have a farmer problem.  What we have is a population problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 4:01:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FYI</span><hr size=1> However, without TLC we would have a farming problem.  Not from anyone present, I don't think (although there are lots of folks on this server who don't post to or read this board) but rather from the hoards who would descend upon us.  I don't doubt for a moment that a large number of individuals would come over from other servers, powerlevel themselves up in a matter of a week or two, and then start farming Guk.  For starters.  The server would be awash in no time in ph@t l3wts and the entire purpose of putting the hardship package in place for this server would be defeated.<br>
<br>
Now, I have no hard and fast evidence that this would _definitely happen_ but then again, I have seen what happens to other servers.<br>
<br>
I don't think FV is going to be around very long in its present form.  The population is too low for it to be profitable, and I think we'll probably be merged with another server.  When and if that happens, you'll get your wish.  TLC will be gone, but so will everything else.  If this server can't support itself with a player base then that means that this experiment is a failure.<br>
<br>
We can offset this by, instead of complaining about the strictures imposed upon us, succeeding despite them.  I didn't have walkthroughs when I started my Vah Shir, but I managed to run my quests.  I didn't get TLC'd, although I came close.  I didn't (and still don't) know what I'm walking into as far as the Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon quest, but I figure I'll work it out when I get there.<br>
<br>
This server makes me level slow.  I don't mind that, because everyone else is levelling at about the same pace (with some exceptions).  Anyhoo, best of luck. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>

The Orc Impaler is the 2nd weapon for rangers after Short Sword of Morin. (it is not a great weapon, but it is one of their quests.) Part of the quest is to kill a shadow leader in Lesser Fay. The leader is okay to kill at that certain level, with a group. Of course, is usually a long spawn. (Took me 6 hours to camp him on my old server to get him to spawn for me.) <br>
<br>
The problem is the brownie outcasts who roam right by the camp site where for the leader will be able to easily kill any group who is camping the shadow leader, unfortunately. So your solution would be to take a higher level person to watch over you for the brownie outcasts? But how do you convince a higher level to waste 6 or so hours on a nothing camp for him? I would feel awkward asking any of my friends to do this for me, and actually on my old server, just did this camp myself.<br>

As a L26 shaman now I can, myself, attest to the fact I've barely gotten in under the wire on some of the items required for my Mystic Scale armor pieces.<br>
<br>
My (RL) monkly husband (also L26 now) has not been nearly so fortunate on his Shackles quests. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeh, so it's really still too early for me know for certain if this is going to work out okay overall... <br>

I have read throught the various Anti-TLC posts.  Most of them simply bring up issues of the inconvience of it.  There are no real 'broken' quests because of the TLC.  The quest might be inconvient, but not Impossible.<br>
<br>
The only 'BAD' thing about the TLC is that it makes your choices more costly.  Consider that part of the rules of the game.   If you chose to level rather than focus on tradeskills, that is the price you pay.  You can nolonger simply plan 'I will come back here when there is no danger and loot'. <br>

<br>
Seems to me, the concept of performing a quest, or what have you, when there is no danger or challenge (ie All the combat mobs are Trival) is rather lazy and impatience.  The inability to wait is also rather lazy.<br>
<br>
On the same note, other servers has its fair share of players that do 1, 2, and 3.  Infact, there are even players that continually search for exploits.  The TLC did not 'create' spoiler sites, nor are they exclusive only to Pro-TLC players. So again, this is another inaccurate statement regarding the TLC.<br>

<br>
That is basically exactly an example of the new 'challenges' proposed by these rulesets.  Somethings are now going to be very difficult.  <br>
<br>
Others will become eaiser (with the removal of the NO DROP tag, players can now sell, give, trade everything - you might stumple upon your needed piece that used to be NO DROP on a merchant or from another player, which would eliminate your need to camp for it). <br>
<br>
If I may add to your senerio about the Brownie outcast.  What if the high level 'guard' player needed stacks of swirling mists (not sure if it is TLC affected).   The I am sure they would gladly exchange 6 hours of guard duty for a stack or two of swirling mists, which was TLC to him.  <br>
<br>
It may not always be so 'neat' a transaction, but it is just a simple example of lower players coorperating with higher players to a mutually rewarding relationship (rather than the Highlevel players dominating).<br>
