I'm sure some of you will just think I'm being petty or silly, and I'm sure some of you will just downright disagree with me.<br>
<br>
But .. %&amp;$&amp;$&amp; people, just because you have a computer, it does NOT make you a graphic designer. Just because you have a 35mm or a digital camera, it does NOT make you a photographer.<br>
<br>
I'm a graphic designer for a newspaper. I also know how cameras work, but I would not call myself a photographer. I know how to use top-of-the-line programs for the work I do. I know how light levels work, how to adjust colour saturation and such, and how resolutions work. Yadda, yadda yadda.  Lineart vs. Bitmap. RGB vs. CMYK. <br>
<br>
I have to put up with SO MANY PEOPLE who think that because they have a computer, a $99 scanner or a $150 digital camera, and Microsoft Word, that that makes them a graphic designer. Then they get mad when they try to send their &quot;advertisements&quot; to us and we won't accept them.<br>
<br>
Or they have a really kick-ass Powerpoint presentation with 8 million different cheesy wipes and they want to know why we can't use a screen from their presentation for their ad. <br>
<br>
Or they have a nice web site that someone made for them, and they want us to pick up logos from their website for their ad ... and photos, and everything else.<br>
<br>
ARGHH.. <br>
<br>
I drive a car. I can change the wiper fluid, I can put new gas in my car. I don't know what else I could do with my car, but I certainly know I'm not a mechanic. I'd never try to change the oil in my car because I wouldn't have the slightest idea of how to do it. <br>
<br>
I leave that kind of stuff to the professionals – the people who do it EVERY DAY and get PAID to do it, and get paid to DO IT WELL and to DO IT PROPERLY.<br>
<br>
If I get another .PPT file, another stupid Microsoft Word &quot;Advertisement&quot; that only uses Arial Bold, or another Microsoft Paint .BMP &quot;scan&quot; that is saved at 96dpi and is 10 meg because the picture wasn't cropped and includes the whole of the flat bed, or if I get another 72dpi logo from the Internet ... I am going to start hurting people.<br>
<br>
Well, not really, but surely you understand my frustration. Or maybe you don't, or maybe you think I'm an idiot, as I said earlier.<br>
<br>
But darn it people, if you get a computer, you should at least know the basics. You shouldn't &quot;lose&quot; a file on your computer because you accidently didn't save it in &quot;my documents&quot;.  And if you're not &quot;set up for graphic design&quot;, as someone on the phone said to me recently, then you SHOULDN'T BE TRYING TO DESIGN AN AD. <br>
<br>
I need that &quot;Break Stuff&quot; icon here. Bleh. <br>
<br>
Ok, I feel better. Now back to  your regularly scheduled Soapbox.<br>

I worked for a while as the editor in chief of my college newspaper.  We did our own ads and such.<br>
<br>
We got those people who wanted to use a 72dpi logo in an ad, and I think we even got the powerpoint presentation one time.<br>
<br>
But what really got me is when people would send in articles for us to run.  As if we were just there to take stuff and put it on newsprint.  And I might have considered running a guest piece of they were ever any good.  But we got really bad writing.  I'd open the envelope, read it, and say to my adviser &quot;I'm not running this shit.&quot;  Then I'd figure out what the article was supposed to be about and assign a real reporter to cover it.<br>
<br>
It's all you can do.  Next time someone calls in and asks &quot;Can we use a screen from our Powerpoint presentation?&quot; you say &quot;No, but we'll be happy to look at it and try to get some ideas from it.&quot;  Then when the CD or zip disk shows up, you just toss it aside and do your own work.<br>
<br>
That's what we did anyway. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/thewok/jarasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

And a crappy one at that.<br>
<br>
And three times a day, I want to shoot people, and most of them are the other typesetters. There is lots I don't know. I admit that. I didn't go to school for it, I fell into it.<br>
<br>
So I make mistakes, I am not the best at color adjustments, and various bits of photoshop work are sloppy and rough. When JRC decides to hire 2 more typesetters to help out in my office and alleviate some of the 23 papers I do a week, I will take the time to get better.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I get from clients all the time, 4 color rgb photos at 72 dpi. Or at a print size of about 4 picas. My secret to work place enjoyment. I quit caring. Crap goes in, crap comes out. I am usually to busy explaining to a client how to make a pdf or explaining to a typesetter in another office why them using Roundhouse is worthless to me if they aren't going to put their damn art in the parts file. I love checking out a job to proof it out, and discovering I now need to connect to a computer that is off, two towns over, to have the logo not show up as only a low res preview image.<br>
<br>
So, while I doubt I have anywhere near your credentials, or talent, I do feel your pain. Every damn day. JRC is teh debil. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/JCOLE1/pnimages/talastiusportraitsig.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

This software is hardly compatible with anything useful.  Adding AOL to the list has nothing to do with my own personal hatred of the clearly inferior ISP....well, okay, maybe it does.<br>

--People who have a &quot;site&quot;, yet need to ask questions like &quot;What's a web browser?&quot;<br>

As some of you are aware, I have my own adult site (tasteful nudity and gaming nerdiness, because everyone knows that stuff goes together, right?) and nearly every day I get at least one email from somebody (most likely in their teens, or without a credit card) explaining to me what a *favor* they would be doing me if I let them redesign all of my graphics because my current graphics suck and they are the best designer ever, and all of this would come at the small price of a free membership to my site (not).  Now, for starters, a good way to get on the good side of a potential partner or employer is not to insult their current product, especially using slang, bad grammar, or bad spelling (as these &quot;offers&quot; invariably do), and especially if it's obvious that the site is designed completely by the owner (as my site is).  Another thing that seems obvious to me, but is apparently not to them, is that if they were really such talented designers they probably wouldn't have time to spend all their efforts redesigning my graphics for the equivalent of ten dollars a month... they would have their own job or enough freelance work to just pay it themselves and enjoy a membership that way.<br>
<br>
I am not the only one plagued with this, either... I know a number of clothing companies who receive similar emails every day from people offering to redesign their sites in exchange for clothing or other free merchandise (with the standard insistance that the current site design looks like something someone stepped in).  Sheesh! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dashanvaliant>DashanValiant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/4/03 12:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3617.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  ouch</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

I feel your pain here.  I used to work in a computer graphics lab on a college campus.  Many years ago.  When 20 meg was a *really* big hard drive.  And that happened.  Lots.  Enough that I got a paper in technical writing out of it by making an idiot's guide to using the scanner, killing 2 birds with one stone, as it were.<br>
<br>
Although, my favorite story was equal parts help desk employee error and user error.  Employee was trying to help user save a scan, and there wasn't enough room on the floppy.  So he asked if they could format it to free up the space.  She said sure.  About halfway through the format, she asks if it will hurt the files already on the floppy, since it was the only digital copy of her (unfinished) graduate thesis.  I really can't imagine how he felt right then, knowing the news he had to break to her...  They recovered a small portion and she had printouts, but she ended up having to re-enter something like 60 pages of text and graphics.  The car analogy is valid.  You should know that putting water and sugar in your gas tank is bad, or at least think to ask beforehand.<br>

<br>
My personal pet peeves as a Graphic Designer are 1) Family or friends who want you to now design everything they have to put in print because &quot; You do it so well and it's so much cheaper! &quot; Thanks no, I like my free time! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and 2) People who think because they have a degree ( or less sometimes ) in any sort of design it means they will do a fantastic job at anything.  I'm good at doing quick, efficient ( in terms of space used ) and fairly good text lay out for newsletters brochures and the like. I have a very hard time designing logos and I wouldn't take a job making them when I know I can't. It peeved me to NO end when my old boss hired someone who was supposed to be my superior ( and got payed more than twice what I did!! ) but I had to teach how to use Quark, Illustrator and those kinds of programs. * shudders * She had a degree in photography and had a great portfolio and was a really nice girl but yikes! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=404353" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.inkbard.com/art/lithsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Home of Dwarven Pride, Gnomish Spirits, and Halfling Taste it's...<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.halfheightheroes.com" target="top">  Halfheight Hero Hall! </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> ~ I just shot this <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/inkbard/" target="top"> InkBard </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> in the butt and now she wants to eat me!

<br>
Pet peeves:<br>
<br>
1)  Not checking that your computer is plugged in before calling me.<br>
<br>
2)  Extra points if you refuse to check because &quot;it was working fine yesterday, it can't be unplugged!&quot;<br>
<br>
3)  Wanting a file restored from backup a few months ago, but you can't tell me a date when you remember it being available or where exactly it was located.<br>
<br>
4)  And no, &quot;somewhere on the H drive&quot; isn't sufficient information for us to find it in a tape backup.  (fyi:  the H drive is typically mapped to a major divisional share.  We're talking millions of files.)<br>
<br>
5)  Getting angry with me because I suggest that the caps lock key is on, which is why your account locked out after the password failed.<br>
<br>
6)  Hanging up in a huff when, after I insisted to just humor me and try the caps lock key, that resolves your problem.<br>
<br>
7)  When working remotely from home, just because you &quot;got service with this ISP because it's more sophisticated, so they can't possibly be the problem&quot; doesn't mean you can treat me like a complete moron.  Believe me, I work with hundreds of remote users each month, I'm pretty good at diagnosing the issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Thinking that just because you fired your accounting department's software developer, you can expect me to be able to diagnose the problem with his 1500 line Excel macro that isn't working quite right.  What, did you hire him to write the thing and not work out a support deal?  Well, he didn't document his source code at all, so unless you can contract me for a long time to read his crappy high-school-quality code, I don't have time to fix it.  Sorry, I'd get fired if I wasted that kind of time.<br>
<br>
9)  E-mails with 20 different colors.  Sorry, that annoys the piss out of me, especially when it's coming from a divisional manager who's supposed to know what professional correspondence looks like.<br>
<br>
10)  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE START BUTTON IS, DON'T CALL ME ANYMORE.<br>
<br>
I could go on, but I think most of you are with me here.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Tobrin &lt;Crusaders of Thunder&gt;<br>

<br>
I work in internal support BTW so i should have nothing to do with this, unfortunatly i was the only one who knew about anything like this so my Boss agreed i would do it before he spoke to me - i had almost no time but manage to get something semi-decent out, trouble was i was not supplied with ANY logo's at-all so had to pull major favours to get our corporate one from marketing as they did not want to give it to me (even though this was a favor for there manager) and then i had to trade the other company logo into vector because it would not convert cleanly enough, document it and get it into an installable, get it proofed on a few different operating systems then roll it out before the show went live....<br>
<br>
Anyway - i know i am below amature status - but what really pisses me off is when this stuff comes to be because no one else can do it...... or when we hire someone to do it for us and they get payed at least 10x my wage and produce results that i have done so much better on...... when i have to bug fix stuff people do EVERY day and get payed more in a day than i do in a month and i have to give them the *&amp;^%$ answers to what they done wrong..... i agree, leave the jobs to the Pro's.<br>

<br>
my worse calls back been these.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) NEVER EVER delete anything in the registry just because you found an &quot;article&quot; read message forum topic, that said to. yet no where does it say to backup the damn key your deleting.<br>
<br>
2)When you login MAKE sure your id is what is in the Login ID field before you call me and tell me it won't take your password. (this is usualy after they been gone for 2 weeks...Christ ever think someone might have USED your computer when you where gone?)<br>
<br>
3)If you cannot print how hard is it to actualy ask a co-worker &quot;Hey Tom? Can you print?&quot; and if that person says no also Maybe...just MAYBE its not your effing computer but the printer?<br>
<br>
4)If you call me to reset your password understand that I can reset it but I cannot reset it to the damn same one you just forgot.<br>
<br>
and there are a couple more but this gives ya an idea on how we as proffesionals do not LIKE iwannabe-proffessionals trying to do something they are not trained for. That would be like me trying to go to a dentist who works out of a trunk *shiver*<br>

<br>
As sysadmin at my last job, I knew the passwords of over half of my office because they would only change them by a digit.  I would bet if I walked into their work places right now (those that do have jobs... the market is horrid right now), I could log on to each of their comptuers... What month is it? 7.... okay... dog/cat/child's name and 7.<br>
<br>
And how many times does someone need to be told you cannot install 3rd party software before you don't see Gator installed on their new computer?  Grrrrrrr that one really pisses me off because of it's horrid nature.  I even talked to this one person about it for an hour... and she insists she has to use it because it manages her passwords and stuff (dog's name, plus number for the ones which have to change every 30 days).<br>
<br>
And support people who have no idea how to format a floppy or copy files on to it to send to a customer.  ARGGGGGGH!<br>
<br>
Worse is the company/office that thinks they don't &quot;need&quot; a sysadmin but can jsut assign the duties (as jsut extra duties, no extra pay or time) to someone in the office... the person in the QA department... me.  I did the work, it wasn't a title, so, unless my manager is queried, I won't get credit for having done it.  Not too good in today's market where QA is generally the first department to get cut.<br>
<br>
Oh... and while on a ranting roll..... Why in the name of what anyone thinks is holy do development companies think the QA dept is expendible?  They merely test the code to see if it actually works.  Oh but developers can test their own code, they say.... Yeah RIGHT.  They're suppose to test stuff before handing it over to QA to say it's finished, but I would hazzard a guess each an every person who has ever worked QA has gotten so much raw untested code it's not funny.  The developer's excuse, I don't have time to test what I write to even make sure it works let alone does what it is suppose to do, isn't that what QA is for?<br>
<br>
Ironically.... I want a job again in sysadmin but will accept on in QA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trump13>Trump13</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/4/03 3:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3617.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Wow... don't get me started on passwords.

<br>
At work I have FIVE different things that take passwords.  I can't even make them the same!!! One has to be 10 characters, one has a max of 6, etc etc.  Not only that we have to change them every month and a half, and they can't repeat any of our twelve previous passwords.   And you wonder why people make up dog/cat/child + number???  There is NO WAY IN HELL I can remember what password I'm using for which application when 1 password every 2 weeks is changing!!!!!!  <br>
<br>
All you are doing is getting people to write down passwords.  I see is ALL the time at work.  If you rummaged around someone's cube chances are you could find a persons passwords.<br>
<br>
Passwords suck.<br>
