When you see a post that matches the description, take the number of drinks indicated. Drink
counts are cumulative. Feel free to add more to this. Will likely update it as time goes by.

Have fun... get wasted.

Btw, this is all in good fun. If you happen to take it personal, go have a drink. Shame you 
have to make such disclaimers these days.
