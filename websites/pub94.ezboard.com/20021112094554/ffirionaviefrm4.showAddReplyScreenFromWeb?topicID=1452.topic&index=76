Like I said I like healthy competition.  Again, there are always 2 sides of the story and they'll never be the same.  <br>
<br>
I want to know where this will end.  You beat us to KT fine.  You start forming and have the numbers to do him, fine. That wasn't the case this time.  Recall when you had the numbers to do him, so did we, but only sooner.  <br>
<br>
It makes no sense to fight over a mob like this, this will be especially true when PoP comes out.  I only hope another situation like this never arises.<br>
<br>
You had apps there, hrm, I guess I didn't bother to count ours or our guests.<br>
<br>
As for Vel's comments, well that's expected from somebody that nothing to back up the statement.  In fact, let me look through the logs again to see when I did /who all zone.  <br>
<br>
You have the logs, let's see them.<br>
<br>
Kzan, reread that post, he said he didn't train you.  Basically it states he was trained and when he died the giants continued to follow the trainer to the zoneline.  But that's a nice spin you put on it.<br>

Come on dead horse.<br>
<br>
Straight facts is FCFS no one had the right of way.  One fucking group sitting in a zone for 2 hours isn't claiming a mob.  We both got there you had more numbers ... we had what we felt comfortable killing him with ... you kept bringing in more people.<br>
<br>
FCFS is bs if you are bringing in more people and another group is ready to pull buffed and all.  and yes a lot of people are applying to join FnF sorry to burst your bubble but there are some people who do want to join us.  <br>
<br>
As for your mod rods ... like you said you will never know neither will we.  As for the train quite a few of us got plowed to say it was one side or the other is complete bs when no one knows but the fact that the train hit before you guys started rezzing is one to point that it was aimed so that FnF couldn't finish KT off should you wipe (which we had no plan to do we simply zoned).<br>
<br>
So why don't we just get it through our head that FnF and Reso will be killing the same mobs if we happen to show up in the same zone the leaders should figure out SOMEWAY to handle it.<br>

<br>
We both know we will be shooting at some of the same mobs.  Like I said before, competition is healthy.<br>
<br>
<br>
To clarify:<br>
1 group of 6 was doing the plate cycle in icehouse prior to any of this.<br>
<br>
When coinfist zoned in there were 8 reso 0 anybody else in the zone.  At this point we headed to WL zone to gather for KT.<br>
<br>
This is when 3 of FnF zoned in.  2 other people were in the zone besides reso/fnf, they were in AS.<br>
<br>
These are just the facts, nothing more.  It all went downhill from there.<br>
<br>

So you stopped bringing people in when you had 19 and were &quot;ready&quot; to pull him?  Funny how you ended up with 25.<br>
<br>
Somehow you think you'll end up on top of this.  Sorry, but with 4 clerics in a good (no lag) CH rotation with mage, KT goes down very easy if you have some DPS to back it up.  When you were &quot;Comfortable&quot; we had 27 reso + recruits/guests.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I will not /rand on a mob we have clear rights to according to all the rules shy of agroing King T himself.  (which we did later)<br>
<br>
Come on, /rand on a mob like this?<br>
That makes it open season to bring a raid party to every mob you're buffing up to do and say, let's /rand 0 1<br>

Then Reso wiped on KT and FnF zoned OUT. FnF did not try to take a weakened KT after you wiped.<br>
<br>
We did nothing to interfere with your KT attempt so why in the world would we train you guys AFTER the attempt? It seems far more plausible that a sore loser from Reso tried to train the FnF folks that were there because they were bitter after their wipe out.<br>
<br>
Why would one of Reso post on FnF boards trying to explain he was not responsible for a train? I dunno, you tell me. I would hope its because he wasn't responsible and was trying to clear up any misunderstandings. His post certainly seems sincere and Bako's response as well.<br>

At this point I think something should have been done.  And as for the numbers when the shout was made we had roughly 26 people in chat channel in Kael fully buffed and ready to go.<br>
<br>
We were stopped from pulling because to do so would be to train you guys.  2 hours later you guys come running back to where we are and say you are pulling KT to us.  <br>
<br>
Are we supposed to be pushed out of the zone?<br>
<br>
When we both start amassing you do one of 2 things.<br>
<br>
When one group can pull the other group backs off and doesn't sit in the way.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
The two groups get together and try to make workable conditions so that the two groups are not pissed at each other.<br>
<br>
As for why we ended up with more people ... well hell people logged on and came to raids.  We weren't waiting around for people to log on and waiting to pull til they got there.  We couldn't pull because to do so would be to train Resolution and as low you think of us we don't do that shit.<br>

However, I have little doubt that nobody in FnF cast a spell harmful or helpful.  That is not where the interference comes from.<br>
<br>
Let's forget about the train and let's forget all about the mods which nobody can prove otherwise.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about a fair attempt at a mob we had clear FCFS on.  We failed to KT, that part is certain.  Could we have won with the exact same people under different circumstances?  You bet.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about lag at a zoneline that 25 extra people can create regardless if they are moving, emoting, chatting, etc.<br>
<br>
Hardware, software, network, lag is lag and it can cause a wipe for anyone.  Drawing 25 more chars in a tiny space = lag.<br>
<br>
Let's also talk about confusion and why Oog was first tank instead of our usual.  Simple reason.  Our MA was too busy dealing with the crap FnF had to say.<br>
<br>
The entire guild was confused where to pull, who was pulling, when we were pulling because FnF wouldn't back down after they lost the FCFS.<br>
<br>
No, I don't blame FnF directly for our failed KT attempt.  I know we had the people and the skill to take him with what we had in the 3+ hours we were there.  I will say that we did not have a clean attempt at him, that much is for sure.<br>
<br>
To deny otherwise would be untruthful.<br>
<br>
Seems FnF couldn't handle rotations so they claim FCFS.<br>
<br>
Fine we played to your FCFS.<br>
<br>
Now it seems if you can't beat us with FCFS, then you try to bully your way in and force a /rand<br>

I'm not disputing that fact.<br>
<br>
18 was the number established long ago on FCFS.  But again this was long ago, who knows if it applies now.  If it does, we had 18+ in the zone when you had 12+.<br>
<br>
If it doesn't then what constitutes FCFS, the exact number it takes to do the mob?  Well then we clearly had that number before FnF.<br>
<br>
What is your angle?  Where is your support??<br>
<br>
When you were ready, we were ready.<br>
<br>
When you were ready, you moved to the snowline. <br>
When we were ready we do what we always do and move to the icebridge.<br>
<br>
Really, if at any point, I thought we were on equal ground, a /rand would have been in order.<br>
<br>
If you had the upper hand, then we would have ran off and did Klandicar (like we did anyways).<br>
<br>
I don't like wasting people's time, and apparently FnF does.  They were beat in FCFS and wanted to bully into a position they had little room for.<br>
<br>
If you amassed 20 players to do a mob and I only had 12 and I know it takes 20+ I'm not going to say &quot;Hey let's /rand 0 1&quot; that's total BS.  You beat me to FCFS, you won, your mob, we leave /grats to you, end of story.  I would only expect the reciprocal from the competition.<br>
<br>
Instead of using time wisely, you all would rather watch someone else do a mob, hope they fail and take your whack.<br>
<br>
Sure you may not interfere directly, but you are there creating tension and causing problems.<br>

<br>
So about KT.  I never knew there was a set number of 18.  No i am not saying its made up.  I think a set number is a very good thing, especcialy if it enforced fairly.  One issue is will alts count as a second person? cause then Rollen brings ulgar, Klang brings Mordag, Calvin brings Hobbes (maybe other way around), Coin brings kordalf.  Do alts count? Fire and Fury rarely uses alts on raids, not true for Reso.   No this is not a flame trying to set standard thats all.<br>
<br>
Personally i would like a rotation.  I also understand that Reso leadership will not make a rotation due to misunderstandings in our guilds pasts (lets be civil and not bring these up guys).<br>
<br>
So that leaves us with FCFS, which works for me.   I wish it could be handled smoother but the way the game is set up there will always be contested mobs.<br>
<br>
Maybe make a liason between the guilds, but I just dont realistcly see that happening.<br>
<br>
I hope all you flame hungry people out there realize i am not here to be the Model FaF member i am here to have fun.  I have nothing against Reso, well aside that Okane looks like a cat but we cant help that.<br>
<br>
So maybe we can start being civil.  start communicating and start setting standards.  But the problems come because both guilds are to stubborn to back down once.  And if one guild back downs will the other guild have the decency to back down the next time a situation occurs?  Anyone see where i am coming from?<br>
<br>
well rambling over  btw all your Flippy darkpaws are belongs to us.<br>

<br>
this satement bothers me for one it is prety comonly pulled to zone cuz its a fairly long fight.  the face beo would make this coment is silly. utterly.  beo u know i like you but that was such a jack ass coment if ive ever heard one.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Since we weren't going to pull KT past you, at the threat of you petitioning, we calmly sat at the zone and tried to work things out&quot;<br>
<br>
sorry once again but if u were not going to pull it past reso you must have know they deserverd frist shot.<br>
then why not zone.<br>
FnF in a situeation never dose sitting around calmly, sorry.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Then all of a sudden here comes your entire guild back to the Wakening Lands zone with KT on your tail.&quot;<br>
<br>
thats so far from the truth its funny.  there was a 10 mint windo where every one was at the zone cuz i was there if u reber i buffed every body and shot the shit with all my friends there. it was not like reso ran to zone and KT was there when they turend around.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; I don't see how you can blame anything on lag when all you did was bring it upon yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
well if reso was only people at zone in. there would have been no lag. at all however with reso and fnf there 65 to  70 people in the same hall way its rediclous.<br>
<br>
<br>
look the fact is reso was in the zone frist i showed up about an hr and 1/2 befor this hole ordeal went down and a group of 8 were there i said he what yall up to. they said killing befor we start KT.<br>
<br>
in face i talked to rohal earler that day and he said they were doing KT.  <br>
<br>
fnf has clamed mobs with small numbers.i rember a lend or 2 where 4 to 8 people sat at zone out wateing for more to log on.  i was one of those people at zone out along with others.<br>
<br>
there is a common respect in that. let the people who were there give it a try.  that means not sitting at the common pull spot eating there mods.<br>
<br>
regarels to what people say i was there and there were fnf people all over sitting every where. next to mods next to pull spot next to clerics next to zone.  i will not belve that there was no fnf person to pick up a mod.  and if u say ohhh i thoguht it was our mod. well why the hell did u need a mod if u were wateing till reso failed.<br>
<br>
<br>
that day i was asked by many friends plz dont help them... <br>
<br>
and i was asked plz help us on some heals or what not. <br>
<br>
<br>
thats not a fun position to be in so u buff every one and go on.<br>
<br>
but as soon as a GM showed up fnf zoned out for some reasion.  /shrug maby some one can explain that.<br>
<br>
all in all this is a crock of crap imo.  fighting over a mob thats relitivly simply mob to kill that u could get next time. and he will probly have the same loot.  <br>
<br>
bottem line i bleve it could have been handled much much better<br>

<br>
This is what I know.  We were ready to kill him.  I do not know if you were or not, but I have to assume you were not seeing as we sat there for another 15 minutes waiting for you all to do something.<br>
<br>
Your guild moved ahead of us, Sat right in the middle of the pull path, and then your GL threatened to petition our monk if he pulled.  At this point you had 28 people in Kael.<br>
<br>
After 15 minutes of you stalling, magically you have 34... And seeing as you got plowed with 34, I'm guessing 28 is pretty much out of your range of capabilities as well.  So basically you stalled because you were waiting for more people.<br>
<br>
Now as for training your CR.. I'm sorry it didn't happen.  Every person in FaF knew there was a GM in Kael watching you guys kill Tormax.  I know we aren't all rocket scientists but I don't think anyone in FaF is stupid enough to train your CR with a GM watching....<br>
<br>
In the end, it makes no difference.. We sat back and gave you your turn, and you didn't return the curtiousy after you got plowed.  No problem, lesson learned, thank you Resolution for wasting 2+ hours of my time on an otherwise happy night.<br>

Shout your pull, give 'em a few minutes to move, shout again, and do it.  If they die, it's their fault.  I've done that with a GM watching and didn't even get a message from him.  It will be a royal mess, but it's the fools camping the path that will get the warning for disrupting your raid, not you.<br>
<br>
BTW, you can pull to EW instead of WL if you have a puller with good 'rif faction and (more important) a skilled adaptable raid team.  You can even pull him to the wolf pit or the arena gate if you've got a good tag team.  That would force your &quot;blockers&quot; to get up at the KT gate, which would be really funny and obvious to any GM.  He'd spank 'em hard.<br>
<br>
OTH, 15 minutes is very reasonable as far as slack time goes for a raid that is obviously most all there already unless y'all both started gathering like 10s after he spawned.  It's down to the wire in that case and the guild not ready to pull should just back down when one is good to go.  Really shows a lack of class to sit the pull path, but then it shows the same lack if you came second, edged and rushed their raid, then whined about them sitting the path.  /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
