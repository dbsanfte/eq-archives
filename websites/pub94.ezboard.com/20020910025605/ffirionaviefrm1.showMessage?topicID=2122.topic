<br>
Here is question, lets say im wandering around and I see some people killing treants would it be ethical for me to heal treant? After all he is my ally.<br>
<br>
Other situation would be some DE is getting killed by wolf,bear etc.. should I help out? I got bitched at once for not helping I said I will NOT help anyone who will harm nature. He answered I will remember your name and put you on a black list.<br>
<br>
Here is another one. I am wandering in LGuk some DE shouts for help due to fact he is overwhelmed by undead frogs... I will help out since we are fighting for same cause in this situation since he is helping me rid evil and bring back peace. <br>
<br>
I try to play my char as best as I can. So those who have experience in this matter please answer as I do not want to be blacklisted or make enemies cause I try to play a Ranger.<br>

<br>
you cannot heal npc's (this means treants &amp; such).  when the game first came out this was possible, but they changed that due to the fact that it was being abused by players.  basically, it allowed players to 'use' an npc to kill other players.  not very nice behaviour, but whatever is possible is what humans will do.<br>
<br>
as for roleplaying~you should do whatever your character feels is best.  if that means not killing natural things, then so be it.  if that means not helping others kill natural things, so be it (athough it might be wise to send them a /tell saying &quot;no offense, but my character doesn't do those things&quot;).  just remember that people are possibly going to hold it against you.  if they do and you've explained the reasons behind your actions, then you have a handy way of finding out who to avoid in future.<br>
<br>
i've always found the irony of playing a ranger (or druid, for those out there) is that you are supposed to be in harmony with nature, but your spells give you the best weapons to hunt animals as well.  it's hard to put away those &quot;charm animal&quot; and &quot;fear animal&quot; spells because your character can't bring themselves to abuse critters that way.  but, i guess it could be done.  or it could be justified through a roleplay reason (nature is not kind.  it's a cruel, savage, &amp; bloody race to the finish kinda thing).<br>
<br>
as for helping the darkelf, that really depends upon how strongly your character holds its views.  who is the lesser &amp; who the greater evil?  the dark elf, or the undead frog?  determine who your real enemies are, and work from there.<br>
<br>
another thing, and this might get me blasted on this board but ohwell--i firmly believe in allowing your character room to grow, and make up its own mind about things.  just because two races are usually pitted against each other doesn't mean that they will be in every instance.  perhaps they are using each other for their own ends, or have been forced into a situation where they must help each other to survive.  they might even *gasp!* fall in love!  <br>

<br>
For the two options given, i would say both your decisions are fitting. Fitting to rp, that is. And whenever you do something as that, you run the risk that the one on the other side wont like it. If they too are roleplayers - thats fine, and nothing will happen. They wont trust you to save them - but then again, you most likely wouldnt. It might offer a chance for some roleplay.<br>
<br>
 But there are people on FV who dont come for rp, but for other reasons. I would say the DE you met there was one of those. For those, you just watched them die for no reason. If you want to run in their circles, your actions were wrong. So you end up on their blacklist. Personally, i wouldnt worry about that. Fortunately, there are many people around who prefer rp over the normal 'blue' method of 'lets <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> work together so we can get the nifty and powerful things we want'<br>
<br>
Now two suggestions:<br>
<br>
if you can, scare the lions, bears, whatever away. Don't snare them. Dont make it easy for the DE to kill them. Don't heal or buff the DE. And then give the DE a piece of your mind. If you hit a rp'er - fun. If not, chances are you'll notice at the first response,.<br>
<br>
For the undead.. just grab one and kill it, then grab the next and kill it. But be prepared to get a mouth full from the DE you saved. And do be careful about killstealing. Make sure the DE really is in trouble. <br>
<br>
And two comments to Lunathreee's note :<br>
<br>
I think the charm animal and fear animal spells are nice to save people *without* harming those animals. Of course, since they are animals, they wont understand why you did it, and in turn, try to eat you. But you can run.<br>
<br>
Development is the life blood of rp. And falling in love with a so called enemy can be fun. Just.. if half the dark elf necromancers have wood elf druid lovers, it tends to get very silly. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

THis can be tough for me.  One common situation is grouping.  I mean, we all know that this server has a lower population, and I sympathize with people looking for groups.  But, I am role playing (and in a role playing guild) that I would not group with an evil character, particularly a necromancer or shadow &quot;knight&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have been in a coveted High Pass group and left when they invited a dark elf shadow &quot;knight&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have said &quot;no&quot; when I was leading a group in Netherbian Lair, had an open spot, and was asked by a gnome shodow 'knight' to join in.  I did ask the rest of the group, not telling them that I intended to leave the group if they wanted to invite.<br>
<br>
So, I hope no RL hard feelings to anyone affected by this! <p>Wraithbane<BR>

As for helping a dark elf against one of my protected beasts: If it's a wolf or a bear their fighting, they may die unless my player is in a very humanitarian mood. If it's a lion or a bad doggie (war wolf, gorge hound, dark stalker) I will assist in culling the population of the corrupted animal.<br>
<br>
I will also fight alongside a dark race if they are battling against forces Tunare deems enemie's. Goblins, undead, gnolls, etc. are all abomination's to the mother of all. I will therefore do anything in my power to reduce their ranks.<br>

   Yeah!  Someone that thinks as I do.  I play a High-Elf Cleric, and my husband plays an Ogre Warrior.  We are married in game as well.  I've had people tell us that we have no business playing on FV, because we couldn't _possibly_ be roleplayers, no way no how.  The fact is, I am roleplaying a spoiled rich girl who is rebelling against her father, who took up with the ogre basically to piss him off.  Then she came to love the Ogre (Lenny) because he has a good heart, and he does what she tells him to.  My husband plays Lenny as an especially stupid ogre, who loves Teapray because he does basically have a good heart, and because she tends to keep  him alive so he can kill more stuff.<br>
     I don't expect everyone to approve of our union, but I do wish that some people would understand that there is more than one way to roleplay a particular race or class.   It's fine with me with someone doesn't want to associate ingame with either me or Lenny because of how they role-play their character, but I don't like the ooc comments that I ought to find a different server.<br>

<br>
Perfectly agree with you, Teaprey. Anybody has the right to chose which way they want to roleplay. See: My guild leader is a wood elf, and I occasionally even group with a paladin, but doing this is roleplaying! I do this by emphasizing my dark side (dark, not evil). Sure, I have IC-conflicts with them, the differences are big, but that makes roleplaying even more interesting. You make the decisions for your character. It depends just on you. And if others think this is bad roleplaying, just ignore them.<br>
I'd never want to play an evil hateful maniac liar just because other people think I should do that for &quot;roleplaying reasons&quot;.<br>

<br>
There are just alot of folks who are cross-alignment/cross-race/cross-whatever grouping because of powergaming stuff, just like they do on the other servers. And people don't like to see FV turned into another regular server, even somewhat.<br>
<br>
When you've seen 20 lowbie d00dz in the past week with a paladin and a shadowknight and druid in their group, it is understandable that the first reaction to an elf/ogre group is one of annoyance. Give yourself some time, get known here, and you will find a much warmer welcome - you will be &quot;those cool folks with the elf and ogre love story&quot; instead of &quot;oh, yay. another evil/good group&quot;.<br>
