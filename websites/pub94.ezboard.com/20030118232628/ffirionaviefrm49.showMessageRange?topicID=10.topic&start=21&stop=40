It was nice of Tzaroth to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to RP with him. I would have had /ignore locked and loaded though.<br>
<br>
Did a lot of that on my old server. Hate to see stuff like that happening here, but its a reality, so we all have to deal with it I suppose. <br>

<br>
I sometimes feel like (and this is pure speculation) that some members of AS (and possibly many other folks, not to entirely single AS out) have double standards of decency when it comes to &quot;fellow ubers&quot; (defined loosely) and all the rest of the peons they may encounter.  This is just something to keep in mind, when some folks report harassment and offensive behavior while others seem not to have bad experiences.  I do notice a bit of a pattern, when it comes to Strete/Taill in particular.  It seems to be higher level folks in major guilds who haven't had problems with him, and lower level folks who have.  That doesn't invalidate anyone's experiences, but personally, if I know someone is being a bastard to other people, it doesn't matter if he's always polite to me.  He's still a bastard.  That's a general statement, btw.  I've never personally interacted with Strete at all, that I can remember, he's just a name on the table.<br>
<br>
Now, that all being said, I had a perfectly civil encounter with Awakened Souls in Sebilis today, and I'll give them their due by mentioning it.  They were gearing up for Trakanon, I think, or going in deep regardless, while I was sitting on the ledge with a guild group killing beetles and such.  Dirfrops, who was raiding AS, got agro on him and apparently he was instructed to train whatever was attacking him to an AS group.  Well, he got confused and trained it at us instead.<br>
<br>
Now, you can imagine how tense that situation was.  We had the zone all to ourselves before AS showed up, and owing to rumors and board traffic, I would be lying if I said I didn't get at least a little tense about the idea of sharing the zone with them suddenly.  And being trained, quite clearly and intensionally, will bring out the worst in most people anyway.<br>
<br>
Well, Dirfrops realized his error, ran elsewhere to die (sorry Dirfrops) and then a whole group of AS (who he was supposed to be going to) showed up trying to save him.  Explanations and appologies followed and they took his corpse and went off to do whatever they were doing.  <br>
<br>
Now, I don't know if there's a moral to this story, but the following points seem obvious to me:<br>
<br>
1)  If that had been anyone else and any other guild, I would consider their conduct entirely civil and reasonable, and the same applies to AS.<br>
<br>
2)  If it had been any other guild, I probably wouldn't have been so edgey to begin with, and I would have been less likely to contribute to a blow-up that didn't happen.  But I did shout at the zone in block capitals at least once (just telling the Dirfrops to stop and deal with his train, since we could probably have handled it) and that's provocative.  So my nervousness at having AS there could actually have provoked a conflict.  Paranoia isn't good.<br>
<br>
3)  I still wonder, as in my earlier points, if they would have been as kind and civil towards lower level folks (probably not to be found in Sebilis anyway) who weren't in a somewhat-major guild.  That's not to say they would not have been, but I think it's a question that needs to be considered.<br>
<br>
So anyway, thanks for a good experience, Awakened Souls.  I, at least, will be less likely to judge you before the fact next time.<br>

P.S.  Tarnished reputations aren't *that* hard to repair, after all.  I hope that any folks in AS who were inclined to give up on their public perception entirely will remember that, and take another crack at it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufroscheto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Froscheto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/02 2:44:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here's a tip for you, AS</span><hr size=1> nm <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=308109>

I don't care if he was just joking around. He verbally molested me and then made fun of me, and now there's a bunch of people defending him. His AS tag has nothing to do with why I put this up, but I didn't feel inclined to forget about it when I wrote out the original post. His AS tag also had little to do with why other people made posts about him.<br>

This is not roleplay.

Before the log started, he sent me a tell randomly in a language I didn't understand. Had I been thinking I would've turned a log on before asking him to repeat it differently. He basically said, &quot;I have added you to my friends list in hopes we can continue this web of romance. I know you're playing hard to get, but I'm as persistant as I am long.&quot;<br>

Kind of like in the way people are laughing about me having to have dealt with this jackass for no reason other than just having been in the wrong place at the wrong time. I'm not entirely devoid of a sense of humor, but forced sexual &quot;RP&quot; isn't among the funniest things I've encountered. Harassing me the next day in /tells doesn't improve my assessment of this individual.<br>
<br>
I really, really don't understand why there's defending of Taiil's actions. You know, like in some Middle-Eastern countries, where a girl is punished for being sexually abused? It's her fault in their culture. You might argue, &quot;there's a difference between being raped and what this guy said to you.&quot; Sure there is. And I'm not even going to compare the two, other than that it's the same principle; blaming the wronged.<br>
<br>
What's next? If you're KSed, are you going to be blamed for it? If you hadn't have been killing that monster right in front of someone, they wouldn't have felt the need to take it from you? How about if you're trained? Well, you should have known better than to stand there.<br>
<br>
Maybe I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have /reported him.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I'd also like to reiterate that I know a log can be faked.<br>

It's a guy with a record in a guild that tolerates him.

I don't mean to sound like I am defending someone who may be harassing you, but I have to agree, calm the hell down.  No one appointed you, or anyone else, guardian of FV.  I'm getting to the stage where I'm almost tempted to harass you myself sometimes.<br>
<br>
Does it make it acceptable to harass you just because you are vocal, have an opinion, and make an easy target?  No.  Does it make it just a little more understandable Why he's chosing you?  Hell yes.  Spend a little less time being publicly indignent over how this game isn't good enough for you and isn't what it should be, and a little more time playing the actual game, and you might have more fun <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> find you are less of a target at the same time.<br>

I hate to say it, but you are making youself look very silly as well. I say this in respect: maybe you shouldn't post such inane stuff. I think Valquiss is right, you're not going to solve anything and you're only gonna add to your own harassment.<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck and have fun. And stay off of message boards. The trolls are bad for you health <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Snout<BR>

I am not acting as a guardian to FV. I can bitch to my heart's content about he-said she-said, because that's in the description of the forum. Until Jaxy or Apep or whoever change it to say that only certain people can whine about certain things, I intend to say what I want.<br>
<br>
He started harassing me while I was doing nothing but sitting on a platform at Nexus. I doubt I'm even significant enough of a presence here that he'd know who I was, not to mention the fact that up until now I've changed user names a bit. I'd also like to know from where you pulled out the &quot;this game isn't good enough for me&quot; and &quot;it's not what it should be.&quot; Your ass, I'd wager.<br>
<br>
As far as the idea of playing more than posting, I'd agree. But that applies to a lot of people here.<br>
<br>

I did /ignore him. I did move on.<br>
<br>
You think <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> this</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is inane?! I wish I had the motivation to drag up a few links for you, because this pales in comparison to the random e/n posts that I've seen come across these boards. If you're talking about this forum in particular, well -- it's here for a reason, and I'd like to think with all the &quot;freedom of speech,&quot; &quot;right to an opinion&quot; talk I've read (and not from you specifically), you'd respect the fact that it's equal-opportunity. What's a horrible experience to me is obviously capable of being a waste of time to read for someone else.<br>
