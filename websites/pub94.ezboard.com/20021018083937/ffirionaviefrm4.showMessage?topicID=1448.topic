You can't.  Not then, not now.  You can't move any character through SH to any server but the server you came from.  What you can do is move both FV and non-FV chars to Legends and move all your items to FV on the FV char when you send it home.<br><br>There are supposed to be lots of checks on moving home, but IMHO they just random sample and/or scan for a few big obvious items, like manastones.<br><br>What I think ebay'ers are doing is using this to smuggle gear to FV and sell it at a large proffit.  Then they send the plat back to SH for resale.  There are no checks at all on the return to SH.  My guess is that about 40% of SH at any one time is ebay'ers and monthers from 'zeks looking to cash in on safe levels and loot.

I think you guys have some wrong ideas about SH though. You make it out to seem that as soon as you transfer to it you get all these super loots and plat. I moved there with my one and only character and *gasp* earned what I got on there. Albeit I did not get these things on FV, however that doesn't mean I didn't earn them. <br><br>Its not people moving to SH then coming back, its the people that move to SH and get all the VP loots and other various bullshit like raiding the planes and looting all the extra stuff, because; well noone else can use it ever, except those on FV. When I moved back I noticed that there were people other then Nexen doing this too. I saw Phara Dar(The boss of VP) as well as other mid-high level stuff  that I am pretty sure there either, never dropped on here, or if they have, would be so very few that you could name them out of the top 3 guilds, there aren't that many 60s on here at all, so there can't be no hidden guild that eludes everyone and is anon. <br><br>The problem is that, those items, like VP items, are no drop on other servers. Which means that if you can only move a character back from here, that was made here means that someone must have went to SH leveled up to a high enough lvl, than went and did the VP key(very huge timesink) and obtained these high end items on raids they went on. But see, that doesn't make much sence to me, because who would bother to level up to that high get loots, split then sell. What I think is that either when that no drop bazaar bug was around people saw the chance and took it and moved stuff to FV chars during the day that you could. Either that, or somehow they are allowing character transfers to this server from other servers with items.<br><br>I can't really see how some of the things get back on this server, at least from what I experienced. The few cases its happened, the prices on some of those items was so highly overvalued that you would have to be in a high end guild to see. There must be a ton of plat floating around on this server if someone can be buying a pharar dar robe for 100k. I couldn't imagine more than a few dozen people that could even amass that much this quick. Although this is also because this  server is way overinflated to do the fact I don't think many people were at the 55+ range before, so they overvalue some of the things that are common, like planes armor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 386<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/24/02 11:59:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1448.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Is FV VI's whore house?</span><hr size=1> They stopped you from bringing a fungal tunic back because people complained to VI about other people bringing them back, but I know other people have brought back a circlet of shadow pre-nerfed and a fungi tunic.
