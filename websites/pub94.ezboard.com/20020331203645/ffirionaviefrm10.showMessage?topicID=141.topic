<br>
Kyrial the enchanter, in her 55th level of experience, stood reading the message from a friend.  &quot;To arms&quot; it said… &quot;The Coldain Dwarves need our help.  Signed, Nostradomas&quot;  Nostradomas had once been in her guild, a brave shadowknight, who had left to join friends in Darkblood. It had been an amiable parting.  The folks of Scarlet Horizon readily agreed to help.<br>
<br>
So finally the day had come.  The masses of allies met in the great Divide.  Twohundred and 3 heros had gathered to fight.  Twenty and seven of those had mastered their craft, after sixty seasons of training.  From all guilds did they come… I did count at least ten different guilds involved, my own, that of Scarlet Horizon, had brought around thirty adventurers.  Darkblood had brought their forces in full, amassing fourty and eight adventurers. <br>
<br>
Strategy was discussed… one force was sent of west, another south, another east. Fast runners were to be sent in between as informants, to ask for reinforcements as needed.  Groups of fighters were formed, and grievances set aside as they were told &quot;The giants are our enemies, not eachother.&quot;<br>
<br>
So Nostradomas handed in the battleorders.  The Seneschal, standing by the gates of Thurgadin, shouts:  &quot;All children, disabled citizens, and inexperienced travelers are advised to evacuate immediately.&quot;   Royal Archers form up, three on each side of Thurgadin.  More Coldain fighters are out front, ready to defend the city.  Us allies are at our posts.<br>
<br>
And so it begins….<br>
<br>
Narandi, the Leader of the giants, shouts over the Great Divide… &quot;So you have come to challenge me, you fools. I shall send my giants to fight you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first wave of giants was not much of a challenge… true, an adventurer did fall here and there, but mostly it lay quiet.   We heard the shouts of &quot;ENEMIES AT THE SOUTH&quot; and &quot;GIANTS COMING FROM THE EAST&quot;.  It seemed that we were doing well.  The three of us were waiting at thurgadin, Docc the cleric, Megabuzz the druid (to drag corpses), and myself.  Docc turned to me, saying how he'd expected business to more brisk, and I simply replied… &quot;The day is not won yet.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Finally a messenger arrived, out of breath, saying the giants charge had stopped.  We breathed a sigh of relief… then the Seneschal announced &quot;The giants are amassing anew.  You have a few minutes to recoup your losses and reform.&quot;   I groaned… <br>
<br>
A few minutes later, Narandi shouts again &quot;So you have defeated my giants? I shall send stronger forces, to test you…&quot;<br>
<br>
Worried, I look around.  The coldain guard are still out in front of Thurgadin, a dent here and there in their armor, but mostly still whole.  Allied forces were everywhere, waiting for the giants.  Another shout arises &quot;Giants from the west!&quot;, at the same time &quot;ENEMIES FROM THE SOUTH!&quot; and and Garandier Glacierbane &quot;I am under attack, send reinforcements!&quot; … the fighting had begun in earnest.<br>
<br>
So our warriors fought… and more corpses lay still in front of Docc, waiting for him to call upon his god to resurrect them.  He was no longer saying much to me, being busy keeping up with the steady stream of the dead. [&quot;Bring out your dead!&quot;]  We all were quite busy… and somehow we all knew this wasn't the end yet.<br>
<br>
So we fought for hours… sometimes we fell back, sometimes the giants did. Finally they were defeated, again.  Their second wave of attacks had been stopped.<br>
<br>
Narandi shouts &quot;So you have stopped these… I shall send my veterans now… whether you can stop them!&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't normally believe in gods, but at this moment, I sent prayer to Rallos Zek, to have mercy upon us.  <br>
<br>
The fighting begins, and the previous fights had merely been preludes.  A stream of the dead were coming in. I stood aghast as I saw the strongest warrior(ess) in my guild had fallen.  &quot;Rush order on Symbiosis!&quot; Her corpse was rushed to the front, for Docc to pray upon next, for we badly needed her help.  As soon as she had come back to her senses, and retrieved her items, she rushed back into battle.  Twice more did I see her still corpse in front of me, and I knew other clerics were casting spells of resurrection in the battlefield.  Others of our most experienced fighters and casters were falling left and right… I was feeling panicky, this was not going the way we needed it to go.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no&quot; someone mutters next to me. As I look up, I see a Kromrif Veteran near me.  Quickly I readied my spells and rushed to help, knowing that retreat was futile.  Desperately I tried to slow his attacks, but he shrugged of my spells like they were nothing.  Beyond him, I see four more veterans giants and I worry, for I am no mere weak illusionists, but before their might I am like nothing.   I fall back to my companions (Megabuzz not being there, as he is out retrieving corpses) and just watch… <br>
<br>
The Kromrif Veteran I had tried to slow, finally fell, his body impacting on the ground with a giant shudder.   I breathe a small sigh of relief… then I see the other Veterans moving up, past me!!!!  Oh no!  I quickly invis myself, knowing there was little I could do… the giants had moved to the spot we were resurrecting at.  Invisible, I look around.  I see another giant at the very gates of Thurgadin… the High Priest of Zek.  Everywhere around me are corpses of our allies, with the Kromrif Veterans pounding on the few fighters left standing.   Shouts are going up &quot;Need reinforcements.&quot; And &quot;The Kromrif Warlord is still around!&quot;  And &quot;Narandi is about!&quot;   All of the coldain fighters had fallen that I could see…<br>
<br>
I lost hope. I really did… I thought the fight was lost.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Then the High Priest of Zek fell… and I must've missed it, but our mightiest warriors and allies must've been on him… suddenly those mighty Kromrif Veterans weren't so mighty anymore, and they fell, as well.<br>
<br>
A small group volunteered to distract Narandi while others dispatched the Kromrif Warlord and Veterans.  Caitlinn the Hierophant attempted to distract him by herself, and felt the fury of his flurry of attacks as he made quick work of her.  (I was told this as Docc resurrected her.) Others fell just as quick. We realized we would need all of our forces.  <br>
<br>
Quickly a main warrior to face his attacks was decided upon (Winian), the healers would keep him alive, with others able to attack without facing Narandi's wrath. &quot;ENGAGE&quot; was the shout…. And the last fight began.  Initially six mighty warriors were faced against him…. A quick survey showed only 3 left standing when he fell, uttering &quot;Rallos! Please accept my soul… I pray that you find me worthy.&quot;<br>
<br>
We had won!<br>

OOC: This is the story of the 10th ring war.  It was about the coolest thing I have ever done in EQ. Lots of liberty was taken with quotes, because quite frankly my memory isn't that good!  The entire fight took about 3 hours. The lag was so bad, on a cable modem I couldn't move.. I had to turn off all the luclin models to be playable.   <p><center><i>
