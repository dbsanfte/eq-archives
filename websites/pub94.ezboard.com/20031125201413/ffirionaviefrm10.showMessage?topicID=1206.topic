<br>
It had been years now since she gave birth to Tolanas, and years more before Kaeltius. Tolanas was named after her father, a warrior Feir'Dal. Kaeltius was named after Maeltreus's grandfather, also a warrior. When they were born the parents could see something very special within them.<br>
<br>
However, Sarah became very worried one night when Tunare sent her dreams that seemed too real, too frightning. She saw herself and Maeltreus, blood poured from them, wounds all over. The blood retreated however, and they both seemed fine, but to her horror she saw their children dead. She knew this was more than what it seemed... it was a vision of the future.<br>
<br>
Every night she kept it secret from Maeltreus, as not to worry him. Also when she woke from the dream she prayed to Tunare to keep her chidren safe. One day, that call was answered, however not to her liking.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear young druidess... You must have known tragidy was not far ahead when you became involved with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
She started to cry at the joy of just even hearing her goddess's voice.<br>
&quot;I know... I know Tunare but... I just wanted this so badly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know... however... the future brings dark tidings. There will come a time when you must make a choice, them... or you. You will know when, I cannot stop it I am sorry to say. I can ensure their safety, however.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please... do so Tunare.&quot; She pleaded with all of her soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;No... I can but won't. These children are cursed, one is destined to become a greater commander than any to walk this world before. The other will be at his side, a tactician of the best quality. I will not save them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sarah stood up, her rage building so much a storm brewed around her.<br>
<br>
&quot;DAMN YOU TUNARE! HOW COULD YOU?!? AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF LOYALTY TO YOU AND YOU ALONE AND YOU DENY ME THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF KEEPING MY BELOVED CHILDREN SAFE? YOU ARE NOT THE GODDESS WE THOUGHT YOU TO BE! YOU ARE A FAKE!&quot;<br>
<br>
However, with saying these words she regretted them. Because she was so close to Tunare she felt the pain that Tunare felt with those words.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Very well child...I will help protect them... I will give each a gift. For Tolanas I give the gift of spirit sight. The ability to look into one's soul and know their potential, and who they truly are. For Kaeltius...&quot; She paused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kaeltius... seems to have his own, from you two... I do not see how but... nevermind, just know he is protected.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sarah breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Thank you ,Tunare... Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
However.. another was listening to them. Innoruuk was furious that a follower so great could be so weak. And now his children might sway to the lightbringers. He would have none of that.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will give them gifts as well Tunare, ones to keep them with me. Tolanas will be the great commander he was supposed to be, for I will personally council him and give him to ability to speak with the gods directly at any time. Kaeltius will be the master tactician for I will give him the ability to see into any opponents weakness instantly by just glancing at them! May these children bring my fury across Norrath!&quot;<br>
<br>
A last one was listening to them all, they did not know though.<br>
He merly laughed at the situation.<br>
&quot;Give them your gifts pitiful ones, I will be able to reach them soon enough. Then I will use yours and give them my own, they will be great. But not for you, for me, they will be great for me or they will die. My time is comming, I will return soon and destroy you all for what you did.&quot;<br>
<br>
10 years later...<br>
<br>
Maeltreus and Sarah were almost out of breath, running frantically as fast as they could. Kaeltius now grown a bit was still very young and could not run as fast on his own so Sarah had elected to carry him. Tolanas tried his best to keep up but in the end Maeltreus had to carry him along as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?! Why cant they just leave us alone!?! We are none of their buisness!!&quot; Sarah shouted through tears.<br>
<br>
More arrows wizzed past their heads and struck the ground of Butcherblock. Teir'Dal swarmed all over, firing arrows and greading their swords. Maeltreus knew them quite well, he knew they would not give up and that him and his wife would sooner fall over in exhaustion then loosing them. He had only one choice left.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sarah! Come here!&quot; He yelled at her as he stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;What Maeltreus? We must keep moving!&quot;<br>
<br>
Maeltreus looked down at Tolanas, who was now clinging to his fathers plate armor for his life.<br>
&quot;Tolanas, my son... Can you run now? just a little further I promise you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas nodded quickly and hoped to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sarah... Take Tolanas and Kaeltius and leave here now! I will hold them until you are far enough to lose them.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked frantic now, she yelled back at him. &quot;I won't leave you here! You are a part of me Maeltreus! If you die I do as well!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not today Sarah, you will live on... for our childrens sake. I know your strong Sarah, be so for them if not for yourself. NOW GO!&quot;<br>
<br>
She reluctantly nodded, tears flowing down her cheeks. She took Tolanas's hand and ran off to Greater Faydark, hoping that the Koada'Dal would bring them protection.<br>
<br>
Three elite's from the Indigo brotherhood now stood before him.<br>
&quot;It is no use, we will find her and kill her and your children.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maeltreus never responded he charged them full force and stabbed the one who was talking in his stomech. His deathblow however caught Maeltreus on the shoulder. Another sword went into his side but he would not fall. He swung his blade cutting into the other. The third warrior raised his blade high but Maeltreus cut across his stomech, spilling his organs to the ground.<br>
<br>
He looked at his side where the sword peirced him, the armor stopped most of it so it only went in a little, but enough to hinder him. He was thankful he made side plates that day, encumbering as they were they just saved his life. But the fight was not over.<br>
<br>
Five more ran at him, he knew he would die here but he wouldn't give up. An arrow landed into an opening in his armor just behind his knee. He fell down on it as soon as the arrow struck. The first warrior had already decended on him, Maeltrus acted quickly swinging his sword up and into the warrior.<br>
<br>
Thunk! Another arrow landed into the opening behind the elbow, rendering that arm useless by severing the tendants.<br>
His other arm got cut off by the next warrior. Maeltreus looked up into his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;My children... will one day rise above you... and kill you all like the scum you are....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly likely&quot; One said, then he swung down, decapitating Maeltreus.<br>
<br>
Sarah stoped dead in her tracks, just before reaching Felwithe.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's....gone...&quot; She said as a tear slid down her cheek.<br>
<br>
She walked up to the entrance to the city and talked to the guards.<br>
&quot;Please... you must help us, Teir'Dal are comming to kill me and my children.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard looked at her &quot;Don't worry, your safe here, they wont get past us. We will call fo-&quot; He stopped as he saw Tolanas peek out from behind her leg.<br>
<br>
&quot;Abomination!! We wont protect such things!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?!!? They may be half Teir'Dal but they are still MY children! you must help!&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard took out his sword &quot;And how do I know your not a spy using these children as a ploy?! I should kill you now to be safe and them to prevent future burdens.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was dazed now, confused as to what was happening. She had gone completely numb, she only knew one thing now. Everyone was against her and her children.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU WON'T HURT MY BABIES! STARFIRE!&quot;<br>
<br>
He was blasted back into the other guard, dead on impact.<br>
She launched another into the second guard and ran off to lesser faydark. Tolanas looked up at her &quot;Mother pleeeeaaase, can we stop running now? I'm tired!&quot;<br>
<br>
She did not even look down to him &quot;No Tolly I'm sorry... we are going to be running for a very very long time now.&quot;<br>
<br>
5 Years later...<br>
<br>
She had been able to avoid them for years, killing off Teir'Dal and Feir'Dal who had wandered away from their camp trying to find them. Every so often she would find a camp inhabited by one or the other, either looking for her. She would kill all of them, no exceptions. After moving away all the carnage she would bring her children from hiding and take their rations for noureshment and use their camp for cover or safety.<br>
<br>
Today more than ever were in the woods, and they spotted her quickly. Bows flew past her by the second, it was a wonder how they did not even hit her. She found a large tree and hid behind it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh... Tolanas, why cant they just leave us in peace? we wouldnt harm them if they just left us alone!&quot;<br>
<br>
A Teir'Dal rogue landed beside them from the tree and dove for her with a dagger in hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;STARFIRE!&quot; <br>
<br>
He was dead. She looked around, panicking when another arrow hit the ground beside her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Run Tolanas... Take your brother and run!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas stood defiantly and shook his head. &quot;I won't leave you mother!&quot;<br>
<br>
She placed her hand on each side of his shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tolanas... I have been using my powers to just keep us alive for so long now, I havent had enough to transport us anywhere else for a long time... I am exhausted and have no power left... You must run Tolanas, run away now with your brother. It's the only chance we have left!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not quite.&quot; She heard from the tree above.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no! They found us!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Teir'Dal man jumped off the highest limb like a cat and landed softly to the ground. &quot;No. I am not one of them, but I can help you... at a price.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How? how can you help us?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can, trust me.&quot;<br>
<br>
She was reluctant, looking around as if another option was in front of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have much of a choice... either be helped... or die. I can ensure your children reach Neriak safetly and are well taken care of there. But like I said there is a price.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything.&quot; She said exhausted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent&quot; He smiled, reavealing two canines longer than normal.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaeltius>kaeltius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/25/03 1:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1206.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tolanas and Kaeltius, gifted,yet cursed.</span><hr size=1> &quot;I miss them Tolanas.&quot; Kaeltius said. He was now much older, equivelent to that of a 13 year old human. Tolanas was equivlent to that of an 18 year old human.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know Kaeltius.&quot; He put his hand on his brothers shoulder. He could see the anguish and pain in his brothers soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;I miss them alot to... but they are watching over us now.&quot;<br>
<br>
He couldn't bear to tell him the truth, that he had just found out what happened to their mother. That she was stripped of her soul and her body tainted by the blood of a vampire, one who calls himself Mayong Mistmoore. The price she paid was too great, had he known, Tolanas would have thrown himself into the fray just so she wouldnt have to suffer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... I guess our father... I am kind of ashamed to even call her my mother. Imagine, our mother... a druid&quot; He said in a disgusted tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I guess she gets some credit seeing as how she gave us birth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas narrowed his eyes oin his brother. &quot;No matter who she is you NEVER talk about her like that! She is still our mother damnit!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius was a bit drunk at the time, Tolanas never liked it but with the harshe training Kaeltius had to endure at the lodge of the dead he thought it alright.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya ya i know... But all she did was cower there... that other man saved us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas had enough of this, he could not hear this anymore.<br>
&quot;COMON! You're comming with me NOW!&quot; He yanked his brother out from his seat and dragged him to his horse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tolanas! where are we going?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas only said one word &quot;Mistmoore.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When they arrived many ghouls looked upon them with disdain. They could smell their blood though, and knew they were HER children.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't attack you fools! She will kill us if we kill them!&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas didn't even bother to converse with them, he marched past them and straight to the castle, Kaeltius follwing behind.<br>
<br>
When he reached the gates he glowered at the vampires beyond.<br>
&quot;Open the gates now so we may see our mother or I will break them down.&quot; He reached back and grabbed a sword... his fathers sword. The argent protector. It wasent different, it was the exact same one, the initials M.S. were carved into it. Maeltreus Shadowblade.<br>
<br>
The gates lifted and he motioned for his brother to follow. His brother looked nerveously about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tolanas! The walls, they move!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm yourself it is only the ghouls watching us.&quot;<br>
<br>
They were instructed to wait in the main hall. As they did Kaeltius turned to his brother.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tolanas? Why did we come here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Our mother is here Kaeltius.&quot;<br>
<br>
His blood ran cold when he heard that. He felt like ice as the chills ran down his spine. He looked at his brother, his gold eyes looking as if they were pleading with Tolanas to take what he said back.<br>
<br>
&quot;O-O-Only... vampire's and undead live here... Tolanas... isnt that right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas nodded. <br>
<br>
&quot;But.. you said our mother was dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;For all technical reasons Kaeltius... She is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not entirely. I only was reborn my dear son, it does me very well to see you here. I am very happy to see how much my two babies have grown.&quot; She walked down the steps, her chestnut colored hair seemed to flow with a life of its own as she walked. Her eye's no longer held the beutiful gold they held before. They were dull and grey, and though she looked youthful, to Tolanas she was more disgusting than anyone he could ever imagine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Reborn? Don't you need a soul to do that? Last time I checked you have none.&quot; Tolanas said sternly.<br>
<br>
Kaeltius could not believe what he was hearing. His mother lost her soul?! It had to be immpossible!<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear... My darling baby... I have not lost it, merly placed it aside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Spare me the humor you crazed lunatic. Last time we met you tried to make me like you. You are not our mother just a remnant, a burden hanging around where it is'nt wanted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry you feel that way... You will have to die then. Kaeltius!&quot; She smiled as she looked at him. She walked up to him and hugged him.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been so long, you won't be like your brother right? You will join us won't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother... I can't believe.... this is what you gave for us..&quot;<br>
<br>
Tears spilled from his eye's as he remembered everything he had said through his lifetime about her. He hugged her back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am so sorry mother! If only I had known what happened!... I .... I could not be more proud to have had a mother like you... I am such an ingrate, an ungrateful poor excuse of a son.. I'm so sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at Tolanas and grinned evilly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can make it up to me you know.... Join me and live the rest of your days here... I can forgive you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I wasent talking to you!&quot; He shouted much to her surprise.<br>
&quot;I was talking to my real mothers soul!!&quot;<br>
<br>
She saw he was going to back away. She opened her mouth and was about to drive her fangs into his throat.<br>
<br>
Tolanas's eyes shot open &quot;NO! KAELTIUS!&quot;<br>
<br>
Then... she stopped. She unfolded her arms from him, shaking she backed up and looked down at her stomech. An enchanted dagger had embedded itself there.<br>
<br>
&quot;May you be damned to an eternal torment. We will release her soul by destroying you!&quot; Kaeltius said in a rage.<br>
&quot;Innoruuk!!! Goive me the strength to battle this thing!&quot;<br>
<br>
He charged forward unknowing a vampire's attributes. She quickly pulled the dagger from her stomech and was ready to stab him, but she noticed a shadow engulfing hers. As she turned around the last thing she saw was the Argent protecter slicing into her neck. Quickly the body turned to dust.<br>
<br>
&quot;May your soul be set free mother.&quot; Tolanas turned to his brother. &quot;It's done... and now you know what she sacrificed to save us. No more badmouthing her got it? you do it again and you get a ticket to the emergency section in the clerics temple of Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius could only nod. To shaken by the events to do anything else. Tolanas had already been through the shock to be shocked again.<br>
<br>
Tolanas pulled a small sack out and shoved their mother's remains inside. He took out a small bottle and handed it to Kaeltius.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time to go back home, drink this.&quot; Kaeltius did as he was instructed and dissapeared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Too bad I only had one.&quot; Tolanas said as he heard the angry screams of the undead around him. They clawed at the walls and doors breaking them down. Tolanas knew the futility of fighting them back, but was going to make them work for their next meal. Slowly he raised his sword, waiting for them to come after him.<br>
<br>
The noises rose more and more, they were striking the doors harder.... no.... it wasent the doors he heard. It was someone else fighting them. He was surprised when he saw his old friend, the one who used to be second in command in his army. Priestess Llandra now the commander of his old army stalked him and smiled. &quot;Happy to see me Tolanas?&quot;<br>
<br>
Two years later.<br>
<br>
Kaeltius had seen his brother a few times, here and there. His brother had now turned to work with the lightbringers, and though he disagreed Kaeltius still respected him. He learned long ago not to disrespect family for what they do or where they come from. However he still disliked lightbringers alot.<br>
<br>
He was now wandering the wastes, exploring became his hobby. When he was not fighting or working he was exploring. It was relaxing to him and he enjoyed it very much. He stopped in front of a very menacing tower, dark blue with spikes all over it and many guards around that looked like dervishes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can outrun them and get inside before they even notice.&quot; He smirked.<br>
<br>
Tolanas has always said with his attitude he should change professions and join the Ebon Mask. Kaeltius said only if he couldn't cut it doing the family buisness of a shadowknight. Tolanas, who of which resided just inside.<br>
<br>
He was sitting alone, having jsut taken out a few skeletons and weird hooded spectres. He pulled out some halas 10 lbs meat pie he had recently bought in the bazaar and began to chow down. He never even nopticed the shadows gathering to the side of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tolanas... is it?&quot; The thing asked. He quickly got up and took his sword out.<br>
<br>
&quot;You made me drop my halas pie, I am not happy now.&quot; He scowled at what looked like someone made from pure darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not come as an enemy. Please, we have much to talk about.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Like?&quot;<br>
<br>
It seemed to float over and sit across from him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I... am someone who transends this realm. A being of power, a god in your words. I have watched you for a long time and want to ask you to leave your pitiful life and join me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas would ask Innoruuk about this but he has long sinced ignored Tolanas. Also no other god would speak to him save Tunare out of respect for his mother. Tunare was gone or busy with some divine thing now.<br>
<br>
&quot;And if I say no?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will kill you, and convince your brother to.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Doubtful. In any case no, so lets get this over with so I can go back to eating what pie's I have left.&quot;<br>
<br>
The creatures hand reached out and engulfed the room in darkness. A kind of darkness that choked out all life, locked out sound, and banished light. Tolanas felt weird at first, then his hand went to his chest. It wasent until he was going to die did he realize, the darkness also locked out the air.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kaeltius hoped through the portal, happy he wasent caught. Once on the other side he saw his brother, covered in blood and many many wounds on him. Kaeltius froze in fear for a second then ran to his brothers side.<br>
<br>
&quot;TOLANAS! wake up Tolanas! comon please! No please don't go! Tolanas please, your the only family I have left.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tolanas's eyes opened weakly, though he knew the situation, he was glad to see his brother one last time before he died.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kael....Air....gone....so much...cut...was...light..betray...&quot;<br>
<br>
He could not even make a sentance. His last seconds were up, he had passed away.<br>
<br>
&quot;What? Are you trying to say the lightbringers did this?!?! TOLANAS WAKE UP PLEASE!&quot; He knew it was too late.<br>
He grabed his brothers body close and just sobbed into his shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn them! They will all die for killing you! I swear I wont let a single one live!&quot; He looked up and shouted as loud as he could.<br>
<br>
&quot;DO YOU HEAR ME?! i WILL AHNIALLATE EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU FOR THIS! NOT A SINGLE ONE WILL BE LEFT ALIVE! NOTHING SHORT OF YOUR EXTINCTION WILL EASE MY PAIN!&quot; <br>
<br>
He fell back into his brothers shoulder and sobbed. His hatred for them building up with each second, with each tear that fell the fires burned in him that much more. To truly know he was alone, this was the worst he had ever felt.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaeltius>kaeltius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/25/03 1:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1206.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kaeltius has been claimed.</span><hr size=1> It had been so long since it happened. His brother had died, been buried, and his soul went to join their family. Kaeltius had hunted lightbringers on a daily basis ever since then. The hate and pain in his heart never ebbed. But he will know true pain now.<br>
<br>
He was sitting on a rock in the Karana's. He pulled out some food and started to snack away. His hearing picked up movement behind him. The rustling of grass was clearly heard, as well as a tight string being pulled back. His head jerked up immediatly as he ehard the arrow whistling through the air.<br>
<br>
He brought his sword up and deflected the arrow with ease. Using this manuver he purposfully fell back behind the rock for protection. Arrows deflected off the rock and landed beside it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would they keep firing when they know they cant hit me? Unless they are putting cover fire... SHIT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Bringing his sword up, doubling it as a shield, he jumped out from behind the rock to notice two paladins almost on him and others advancing.<br>
<br>
He brought his sword up and stabbed the one in the stomech. The next one got to know his harm touch more personally.<br>
<br>
The third was on him and threw a heavy strike but it was blocked. Just then he felt a large stabbing pain in his neck. To his surprise he saw an arrow sticking out of it, blood pouring from where it hit. He blacked out from the blood loss.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wearily he woke up, He took in his surroundings. A guard saw his head moving about and turned to the other. <br>
&quot;He woke up, I'll go get the general.&quot; The other guard nodded.<br>
<br>
He noticed he was surrounded by brick. It was damp and moss was creeping up the walls. The place was very old by the looks, the stone used to build it was decaying. His arms ached and he tried to move them but when he did he found them shackled to the wall.<br>
<br>
The creak of his cell door was heard opening. Heavy footfalls advanced on him. As he lifted his head he saw a man, He was an older Koada'Dal, paladin by the feel of the power within him. He seemed to be higher in rank because the guards stood behind him seemingly obeying him.<br>
<br>
Kaeltius couldn't be sure of what he said to the others, he never learned their language. The man turned to Kaeltius.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are our prisoner now... I guess we will have to heal you more. You see the arrow was only ment to put you out, not bring you to the brink of death. Those damned rangers attatched a type of arrowhead that tears alot of flesh as it goes through... no matter your still alive thats what counts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius did not care to hear this. He began calling forth a disease spell but found his powers were gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry young fiend, we have runes set up here to disconnect you with your...god. Doing that thus negating your dark power. You are now helpless, so lets make this easy on you.<br>
Tell us what we want to know... and you wont be tortured. It is very painful I assure you, more so then what pain you are feeling now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius motioned his head to the side as if to ask him to come closer. The man leaned in to listen &quot;Hrm? sorry I did not get that.&quot; Kaeltius brought his head around quickly, hitting the Koada'Dal dead in the nose, breaking it.<br>
<br>
&quot;ARG! SO BE IT, YOU HAVE CHOSEN YOUR FATE! TORTURE HIM UNTIL HE BEGS TO DIE!&quot; The man walked out holding his nose.<br>
<br>
Two years later.<br>
<br>
They finally stopped on Kaeltius, they had givin up torturing him even if just for no reason. So they broke every bone in his body, cut his tendant on his arms and legs, and threw him in their deepest cell to rot and die. It seemed to be where they threw all their captured to die for many skeletons laid around.<br>
<br>
'No power, can I go to Innoruuk when I die?'<br>
<br>
&quot;Fraid not.&quot; A voice from the corner said.<br>
<br>
It was a man made of pure darkness, he walked forward but seemed to have no form. His eyes were the only thing that gave him away, they glowed red.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see, this place disconnects you from Innoruuk completely. Your soul will stay trapped here forever. However I can help you.&quot;<br>
<br>
'who is this...have I gone insane? probably, i am seeing and hearing things, i guess two years of torture do that to you; Kaeltius thought to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, you arent, I made sure to restore your sanity prior to comming here.&quot;<br>
<br>
'you can hear my thoughts?'<br>
<br>
&quot;Master of the obvious are we? Well lets get down to buiosness. You need me, and I have chosen you to help. I can free you and give you great power... but at a price.&quot;<br>
<br>
'what price?'<br>
<br>
&quot;Small one, you be my servant, do whatever I say without question. That is it, nothing more to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
'sounds like slavery'<br>
<br>
&quot;bah, call it what you want, I am your only hope. I will let you worship your gods if you still wish, as long as you remember you belong to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
'How do I know this is for real?'<br>
<br>
The shadow walked over to Kaeltius and touched his back. The pain ebbed and Kaeltius found he did not need food or water anymore.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok... now that I can speak again... I.... you will own me... will I be able to return to Innoruuk when I die, can I still serve him when he asks?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As long as it does not interfere with what I tell you to do, sure go nuts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius lifted his head slowly and looked at it.<br>
<br>
&quot;And my revenge... for my brother... for those people driving my mother out of her home... You will give me the power to kill them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In time you will have it but... yes. However each favor you ask requires a price to be paid.I cant figure what I want them to be but eh well... so.... do we have a deal?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius saw no other way out, if he was to serve his lord again, get his revenge, and all around just get out of this place, he would have to agree.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
It smiled at him &quot;Thank you. I shall grant you a new power now... oh and one thing... this is REALLY going to hurt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shadows gathered all around him, swirling around they seemed to tear into his back. He grunted out in pain, they seemed to mend his bones and heal his wounds. Then it stopped. <br>
<br>
&quot;That wasent so bad.&quot; He said as he got up.<br>
<br>
&quot;We arent done yet.&quot; He heard in his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha-&quot;<br>
<br>
He felt pain like he had never known, not even being tortured. Actually that was like being kissed compared to how this felt. He couldnt describe it, it tore through to his very soul. Burned, frozen, poisoned, stabed, beaten, all the pain sensations that could ever bee seemed to converge on his body to the fullest extent. He screamed out so loud and so long his voice went horse.<br>
<br>
He wished for death to take him, he wished to go back to being tortured by the lightbringers. He begged for it to stop. The pain was too much for him to bear, he felt like he was being torn up sliver by sliver. all in an instant, he passed out.<br>
<br>
When he awoke he still felt some bits of pains till there. For the most part the worst was over... maybe. Though it seemed like an hour or day, five years had passed, five years were needed to fuse his powers to Kaeltius, but Kaeltius would never know how long he was down there. He probably wouldnt care anyway, he was getting out.<br>
<br>
As he wreaked havoc throughout the stronghold when he raced out the creature watched him. <br>
&quot;You are now mine Kaeltius, disobey me, and you will feel that pain again. obey me and i will reqard you greatly in the end. For now though, you may do what you wish. I'll be watching very close.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaeltius>kaeltius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/25/03 1:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1206.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The mark of darkness.</span><hr size=1> *BAM!* <br>
The fists of Koobie were showing quite powerful. Kaeltius was quite impressed as he quickly got behind the Patog Phlargs and slashed like lightning.<br>
<br>
*BAM*<br>
The creature was struck in the face and fell back on Kaeltius. It horrid breath sprayed out the mist that caused rashes.<br>
<br>
&quot;YOU BASTARD!!&quot; Kaeltius screamed as he was once again breaking out all over in rashes. The creature was dead but it's marks were left on his skin. A slightly reddish spot amung the dark blue. He began itching like mad, scratching the first layer of his skin off. All of the sudden he felt relieved, Koobie had once again saved him from an uncomfortable night with his spells.<br>
<br>
Around this time it had been late, Kaeltius was going to go to bed. Koobie was headed to the bazaar.<br>
<br>
Kaeltius shook his backpacks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not bad made around six plat off those little creatons scales.&quot;<br>
<br>
The merchants paid a bounty of 2 gold for each one. When Kaeltius showed dissaproval of this price the shopkeeper merly said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then take it elsewhere, I'm sure someone else has a bounty for a creature not bothersome to them.&quot; He smirked.<br>
<br>
He was a bit disgruntled but it was better than nothing to him. Shortly after he had used the book to travel to the plane of knowledge. He hoped up into his favorite spot, the tree near the main bank. He liked high spots alot, somewhat of a habit from his Feir'Dal side.<br>
<br>
Settling in he took out some halas pies and began munching away. It had not been long since he discovered why his brother loved them so much. As he was eating he felt a small itch, first on the back of his hands... then on his neck... then the edges of his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;DAMNIT! Those little shit's better not have snuck one in!&quot; He complained thinking it was another rash. Much to his surprise, and dissapointment, it wasent. <br>
<br>
Black tendril were rampant throughout his skin. They seemed fused to his skin itself, like veins showing up. He panicked a bit and began to try to peel them off but they wouldnt budge.<br>
They seemed to pulsate as if they had a life of their own.<br>
<br>
He grabed his dagger and started gouging into his shoulder. Blood poured from the wound but the tendrils seemed to stay no matter how much flesh was cut away. It wasent long until he just cut for no reason that he began to notice something... his mind had been slipping away momentarily.<br>
<br>
Grabbing a few bandages he started covering it up as he headed for the great library.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnit! What do I keep you guardians around for if you can't even find some simple books!&quot;<br>
<br>
The grand librarian was in a rather grouchy mood today. <br>
<br>
&quot;You! Paladin! Go find my book! I swear if it isnt back by next morning you better start looking for a new job!&quot;<br>
<br>
The paladin huffed. &quot;Well....considering I'm not being paid...it isnt really a job now is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome began sputering before he made a coherent sentance. &quot;JUST FIND IT! All you do is stand around here all day long twiddling your thumbs anyway! At the very least be useful! Huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
The sound of the elevator reaching the top. Visitors had been rare lately so it surprised the little librarian to see anyone. The young rogue walked forward, some of his steps being tripped for no aparent reason.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello wise one... it has been awhile.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome adjusted his glasses and got a better look at the visitor. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do I know you?...&quot;<br>
<br>
He nearly jumped back in surprise.<br>
<br>
&quot;KAELTIUS! My my it has been a very long time since I have seen you. Last time I did I believe you were only as tall as myself! And Tolanas had just passed his tests and become a full fledged shadowknight! He was so curious of the world that one, stayed in here for days. We almost decided to make this his home away from home!&quot; He laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is good to see you again though... Even though the last time you were here you nearly set the bookshelf on fire... But I digress, where is your dear brother?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius looked down at his shoes, sadly, he still remembered every second of that moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;He...he died, not to long ago... three months to be exact..&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome took his glasses off. &quot;Oh dear....I-I am terribly sorry to hear such a thing. If.. it is ok, how?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lightbringers, slain him when he was in the tower of shadow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see... He was a good one, that was for sure. I had really hoped he would still be around for your sake at least.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius nodded and began itching a bit again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes but I am not a child anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome walked over in front of him and laughed.<br>
&quot;Ha! You may be able to fool others Kaeltius Shadowblade but not me. You are equivelent to that of a human 17 year old and in my book that still makes you a child.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius sighed &quot;Only in years not in action, if you spen-&quot;<br>
<br>
He was stoped by the gnome mid-sentance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats this?&quot;<br>
The gnome point to his face and hands.<br>
&quot;Oh my...nonono that is not good at all... Kaeltius what have you done?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius looked down. &quot;It's...a long story... do you know what it is?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. It's been a very long time since anyone has seen it but yes. In an ancient language it is called nota ab caliga... The mark of darkness. This was given to the followers of one who was born of the darkness and brings utter chaos. Kaeltius... you have sided with him havent you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No! Well...I did not know who he was... he offered to help me. I was ina lot of danger.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old gnome shook his head sadly.<br>
&quot;ooohhh Kaeltius, you have gotten yourself into more than you bargained for. Right now his essence is being flowed through your veins, his flesh overtaking yours, he is curropting your soul. In short Kaeltius, he is going to become you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius stepped back, he began feeling dizzy.<br>
&quot;N-no...no that can't be right... I havent fel his presence or heard his voice in days! he is gone!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No Kaeltius... merly concentrating on other things...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius held onto the desk to steady himself.<br>
&quot;How do I stop it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome walked over to the shelf behind him and picked a book from it. He seemed to know its exact location as if he knew this time would come. Laying it down on the desk he flipped through until he came to a page, inside was another page wrapped in some type of material Kaeltius had not seen.<br>
<br>
The gnome skimmed the page until he found what he was looking for.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here... Four ways... one as a last resort. You wont like any of them Kaeltius.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius felt his blood boil for no aparent reason.<br>
&quot;I DONT CARE YOU OLD FOOL!!&quot;<br>
He noticed it and calmed down immediatly.<br>
&quot;I-I am so sorry...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's quite alright. Well... here are the ways.<br>
First: You must find a vampire, one of particulary strong power, for a weak or even adept vampire would be overtaken by the evil within the afflicted.&quot;<br>
<br>
He Looked up at the now fatigued rogue.<br>
&quot;Kaeltius, the only one I know now that is strong enough is Mayong Mistmoore, there may be others but he is all that I know... This may be hard to swallow but you must go to him for help if it comes to it. I know your history with him, and it wont be easy. As you probably know this will ultimatly end with you becomming a vampire.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Kaeltius nodded.<br>
&quot;I figured as much, but I will try the last resort before I go to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome nodded slowly, knowing Kaeltius ment what he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;The second is to use this spell. You must find an extremely powerful magic user. This spell will rip apart your body and soul, and purge everything within. if not done right, you could lose your life and soul... This one, Kaeltius, is the most painful and difficult, I urge you to try this last.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And the third of these?&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome shook his head.<br>
&quot;Is to give in to the power.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought this was to rid myself of it!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It isnt exactly that, it is how to deal with it. as for the last... complete oblivion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius gave him a questioning look.<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You... must destroy not only your body... but your soul. It.. would be as if you never would have existed... that is a last resort Kaeltius, do NOT do that!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius nodded.<br>
&quot;I will try not to... but if it comes to it... I must.&quot;<br>
The rogue now extremely fatigued, passed out on the floor.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kaeltius>kaeltius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/25/03 9:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1206.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The truth never told.</span><hr size=1> (last one for awhile.)<br>
<br>
Wearily he walked across the plains of the Karana's. He leaned heavily on a walking stick, weak now from his... disease. He tried his hardest not to show it, but now it was starting to seep through. He could no longer hold back the insanity that ate at his very mind. The thing inside of him was struggling to get out, and he was to weak to fight back.<br>
<br>
He yelled out when the force had broke free from him. Soomingly comming from his skin a blanket of darkness covered a large area around him. It floated to the ground and lay there for a moment. A cracking could be heard, what sounded like fire came from beneath it.<br>
<br>
Slowly Kaeltius felt his strength return to him. The blanket was pulling back and as it did so he notice the grass that was once green and full of life was now dead.<br>
<br>
&quot;It...took the life of the plants to give to me...&quot;<br>
<br>
He shook his head and continued onward to his destination.<br>
<br>
It had been a day and a half of him walking. He never stopped, just kept walking, aparently no where. His eye's glazed over he would drift off every so often. He no longer struggled to hold the thing back but struggled for his very sanity at that.<br>
<br>
He stopped in the middle of the fields and just stared forward for awhile. Then he spoke to the air itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am here to see if he is...&quot; Was all he said.<br>
<br>
It did not surprise him to see a large pair of yellow eyes open out of thin air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who might you be, who knows this place? Speak quickly, and hope you are allowed in, for I will kill you if you are not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Kaeltius Shadowblade, golem. I have something to discuss with your master.&quot;<br>
<br>
The eye's narrowed on him, the golem stepped out from hiding. It easily towered over him, but he showed no fear, mostly because he had nothing to fear.<br>
<br>
2 months after the death of Tolanas...<br>
<br>
Kaeltius wandered around lesser faydark, he remembered ever leaf here, every tree, every plant. His brother had taken him here often but he remembered one time in particular. He turned and headed for mistmoore, on a killing spree of sorts.<br>
<br>
It was no trouble to find it, already he saw a few warriors heading in to find what treasures they could. Before he walked in however a figure stepped in his way and blocked his path.<br>
<br>
&quot;You would do well to get out of my way while you are still alive.&quot; He growled low, weilding his sword up.<br>
<br>
However his threat fell on deaf ears, and with good reason. A Teir'Dal, larger than any he had seen towered over him. The man looked Kaeltius in the eye grimly, yet sorrowful somehow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Kaeltius Shadowblade...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius's eyebrow raised. &quot;Do I know you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The man merly shook his head.<br>
&quot;No...No but I do however remember you. You have aged quite a bit I see. Quite a bit from the last time you were here. I think you should refrain from slaughtering those within for now, at least until you hear what I have to say.&quot;<br>
<br>
He needed no introduction from this man. He saw the garments the man wore were that of a noblemans. A decorative yet powerful sword hung at his side. On it's hilt was the crest of Mistmoore. When he spoke Kaeltius noticed fangs, and now he knew if he were to strike he would die.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mistmoore... I have no need to listen to you whatsoever... You are only second to the lightbringers when it comes to my hatred.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayong sighed at the childs feeble talk.<br>
&quot;Look... What happened with your mother was not my intention... One of the higher amung my people had carried out the buisness of dealing with her and I was quite upset to hear it. I was actually more upset with the fact of her birth than anything. Reguardless, I do not waste much time with people like you, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
He reached into one of the folds of his robe and pulled out a rolled up partchement.<br>
<br>
&quot;My own had wrongly robbed you and your brother of your birthrights to have a mother... I do not know why I do this or why I feel pity for you... but take this, if you need help from me go to this location. I will only grant you one favor however, and within reason. Be off with you now before I kill you here and now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Present time.<br>
<br>
He pulled out the partchment from one of his pockets. It was now torn a bit, old looking and crumpled. The message on it however was what mattered, and even more so the hidden crest in it.<br>
<br>
The golem took it when Kaeltius held it up to him. Looking it over he could see the symbol, invisible to others by means of magic. He nodded to Kaeltius and parted the magical curtain that hid a rather large mansion. Kaeltius merly shrugged and knocked on the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;ugh...&quot; He grasped his head. The thing within him once again was attacking his mind. It sent visions of chaos and destruction through his head. It kept poking and prodding to see what his weakness was, however he fought it back and it retreated.<br>
<br>
He looked up now to see the door open. A servant seemed to be standing at the door. She looked at him sternly with her hand on her blade. However see looked behind him, seeing no signs of fighting or the golem acting hostile she jerked her head to the side as it to say it was alright to come in.<br>
<br>
The mansion had an old look to it, much like his castle back in lesser faydark. Everything looked as if it was cleaned to perfection, the only mess was the one he tracked in. He did not care however, he sensed around for the power of the vampire, when he found it he marched on.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must wait here!&quot; The served called out, he didn't listen however, too intent on what he had to do here.<br>
<br>
She walked after him pulling her shortsword out to stop him. Much to her surprise however she realised she made a mistake.<br>
<br>
He turned quickly and tendrils of darkness shot out from his back and arms. They entwined her arms and legs, much to her horror.<br>
<br>
&quot;I could kill you now if I so wished, at this point and state of mind it would not bother me. Leave....me...be.&quot; They pulled back into his body, leaving the young woman shocked. He turned and walked on.<br>
<br>
He came to a large room with a table in the center. Seven or so chairs sat around the circular table, at the other side of it was Mayong, seemingly expecting Kaeltius.<br>
<br>
&quot;It took you longer to decide to seek me out than I realized Kaeltius... Please, have a seat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius noticed a cloaked figure beside him. The person... or thing starred at Kaeltius. It's face was well hidden by the hood though.<br>
<br>
&quot;No... I see you have company so I will make this quick. I have come here to-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know why you came Kaeltius. I am sorry to tell you this but your journey was in vain. I cannot do what you wish me to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?! You will not deny me this! If you know why I came then you know I can suck the energy from your rotting corpse and leave you for dead!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayong merly sighed, rolling around the wine in his glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Control yourself Kaeltius, I did not say &quot;Won't&quot; I said I &quot;cannot&quot; there is a difference you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why can't you then?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayong leaned back in his chair. <br>
&quot;The gnome... he told you he knew I was one who could do this. Oh do not look so surprised, I have spies everywhere. Anyway, he told you I could but how does he know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius merly shrugged and shook his head.<br>
&quot;Don't know and don't care, get on with why you...&quot;Can't&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, I cannot do it now because I have done it once before, and as such if I were to do it again it would drain me completely of my power. You would get stronger, unhealed, and still having made no progress from whcne you started.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaeltius let a low growl escape from his chest. Annoyed he tunred to leave this place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kaeltius, wait... Perhaps you should sit there is more that is needed to be discussed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No there isn't.&quot; He replied. He turned back tward the door but the robed figure was blocking his way now.<br>
<br>
The blanket of darkness once again extended from his body and swirled around her allowing only one place to go.<br>
<br>
&quot;Out of my way or die.&quot;<br>
<br>
A soft voice spoke from beneath the hood.<br>
&quot;Kael... Please stay awhile, we mi-&quot; She was stopped mid sentence when he grabed her arm and threw back the hood.<br>
<br>
His face contorted in disgust and hatred. Quickly he turned to Mayong.<br>
&quot;Why am I not surprised by this Mayong?&quot;<br>
<br>
He casually took another sip of his glass.<br>
&quot;Because you probably knew the truth... What you killed was only a puppet. No life added to it other than her blood. This is the real one.&quot;<br>
<br>
He merly glared at Mayong then proceeded to walk out again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please Kaeltius! I want to help! We can still help in other ways! I...still care about you so much.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned his head to the side to look at her.<br>
&quot;Spare me... Even if you did I care not, for you are not my mother anymore, reguardless of what is said. My real mother is dead and gone...goodbye.&quot; He slammed the door on his way out.<br>
<br>
When he was far away from the mansion he stopped and droped to his knees on the ground. He was exhausted, the day's activities took their toll on his body, mind, and soul. However.... it was here he felt another peice of his sanity leave him. <br>
<br>
He decided he should not rest, he still needed to find a way to rid himself of this curse. And so, with that, he walked on.<br>
