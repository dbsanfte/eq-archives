It was sucessful but dropped poor loot.  One of the drops was Gauntlets of Fiery Might, which were won by Ericco.  Note that Need Before Greed was clearly posted, and announced during the rolling.  Less than a day later, Ericco posted that he was selling the Gauntlets (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm2.showMessage?topicID=3066.topic">link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->).  Backlash from the community was immediate and fierce.  Another thread was spawned in the Soapbox forum (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=1015.topic">link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->).<br><br>After monitoring the threads for a couple days and unsuccessfully trying to contact Ericco and Bobmata (his guild leader) in game, I finally posted my response in Ericco's Market Square thread.  Essentially, until we come up with a way for him to redeem himself he is banned from my raids.<br><br>So, the question I have for all of you reading this is the following:<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  What does Ericco need to do in order to be redeemed in the open raid community?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Ideas I have so far:<br><br>1) Return the Gauntlets for redistribution (already sold so not very likely)<br>2) Hand over all proceeds for use to fund future raids.<br>3) Hand over twice all proceeds for use to fund future raids (or some other multiple)<br>4) Attend 1-5 open raids without rolling on any loot.<br>5) Attend open raids until he wins 1 or more items, but doesn't get to keep the item(s).<br><br>In a day or two I will consolidate a list of ideas and post them as a poll to get public opinion.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Some people have brought up the issue of what to do with open raid loot when you will no longer use it.  My perspective on this is to do one of two things with it:<br><br>1) Pass it on to a guildy, with the condition that they treat it as open raid loot as well.<br>2) Bring it to another open raid and random it off.  Possibly use it as incentive to get people to help you on a raid.<br><br><br>Thats all for now,<br>Findra<br><br>Edit: Got booted to the Soapbox from General.  Didn't think it was that controversial.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br><br>(Syll edit: lol, the dancing post.  I'll just put it back in general.  It's not a scheduled event, so events seems off)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>Edit 7/19/02 Midnight<br><br>Thank you all for your input.  I have decided against putting up a poll, partly because I'm lazy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>I spoke with Ericco briefly online earlier tonight.  Unfortuneately, I was in the middle of a Coldain Ring quest and he didn't have much time (sorry bud).  He has delivered 2K plat to me that he said was the proceeds from the guantlets (if he actually got 2K for them all I have to say is &quot;WOW&quot;).  I will be using this to fund future raids that I throw (roughly 3 raids worth of peridot).  Ericco is no longer banned from my raids, and I will allow him to participate fully (including rolling for loot).  As was posted several times, he has apologized and I see no reason to believe this was anything other than a big misunderstanding.<br><br>I had intended this thread to spark a discussion for future raids, and I think it has to some extent.  As someone pointed out, the Gauntlets are not 'uber' loot, but are still nice.  I kinda wanted us all to start thinking about how we (the open raid community) would react if we saw someone selling off a Cloak of Flames, or worse yet a Red Dragon Scale.<br><br>It's late, and I can't think of anything else constructive to say.<br><br>Findra <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=findra>Findra</A> at: 7/19/02 12:13:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 824<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/17/02 11:24:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2350.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open raid NBG violators - can they be redeemed?</span><hr size=1> A guy like this clearly has no respect for other and is only looking out for himself.<br><br>I would say he is beyond redemption and should be banned from any of your raids.

Obviously his guild leader seemed a little surprised at the turn of events, so the person in question does not seem to be one of those players everyone hates.<br><br>Personally, it looks to be an honest mistake, he did not try to dodge the blame or make excuses (other then not knowing NBG was decided for the raid).  He seems to deserve a second chance to prove himself to the community.....    <br><br>As for Danilil's post.....has anyone had problems with this person before?  I would find it very hard to believe that he was able to hide his 'true colors' (as you so put it) for so many levels.  If I'm wrong then tell the community what other problems you have had with person in question.   Of course since I haven't played over 'such&amp;such' level, you'll probably tell me that my voice doesn't matter.....<br> <p><b>Kaldesh<BR><i>Servant of Solusek Ro<BR>Wizard of the 4th Circle of Flame</i></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uirexes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irexes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/18/02 4:10:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2350.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open raid NBG violators - can they be redeemed?</span><hr size=1> Perhaps option 6 should be,<br><br>Take his apology and forgive the guy, then let him decide how he makes restitution.<br><br>Or do the only possible resolutions to this situation have to result in his head on a pole, paraded around as a warning to others?<br><br>If so, option 7 should be<br><br>Make him change his name to Greedbeforeneed and roleplay that it is branded on his forehead.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, its fine to seek apologies (already given) and some form of repayment, I just wonder what will be achieved by doing so by public vote?<br><br>Yours<br><br>Sticking my nose where it's probably not wanted<br> <p><A HREF="http://www.irexes.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/dactylos/tales.html" target=new><IMG SRC="http://www.irexes.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/irexessig.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukironkeensong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiron Keensong</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/18/02 4:22:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2350.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open raid NBG violators - can they be redeemed?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And above all that, they're gauntlets of fiery might... those things suck<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>huh? do i smell irony? if not, i will glady take these newbie gauntlets off of you next time.<br><br> <p><i><b>~Kiron MacNight</i></b><br>Twilight Bastion<br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eqmolsone>EQMolsone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/18/02 5:42:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2350.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Open raid NBG violators - can they be redeemed?</span><hr size=1> Although I don't recall ever meeting Ericco, I feel bad for the guy, he was probably naive about the whole thing..

If you're taking the time to lead a raid, and you feel you can't trust someone, then certainly it's your perogative to tell them no.

Unless I'm mistaken, gloves of fiery might sell for a few hundred platinum.  Anyone high enough to join a Nagafen raid can make that cash easily enough in Paineel or fighting hill giants.  If one knew this kind of activity was frowned upon, gloves of fiery might wouldn't be worth the risk of getting caught.<br><br>   I'm suspecting the guy just doesn't speak English very well, and/or is young, and didn't understand the rules even though they got explained.  If you're gonna continue to shake your fist at him I just think you should wait till he gets back from vacation so you can at least say you tried to talk to him and he told ya to sod off or something.<br>   <br>- Syll <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A> at: 7/18/02 11:04:27 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2350.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2350.topic&start=41&stop=51>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2350.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2350.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2350.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=2350.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2350.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2350.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
