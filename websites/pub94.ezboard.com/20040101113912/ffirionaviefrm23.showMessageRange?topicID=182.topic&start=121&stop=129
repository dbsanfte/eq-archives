You speak of Love as though you are an expert – are you trying to seduce us with your words and your actions? Do not bother, I find it revolting and see that you are but a victim and not an expert in any such way. <br>
<br>
The function of Love and those who promote it is to motivate everyone to accept things at face value.  Love at first sight? HA! A blatant disregard of oneself! That you would toss yourself to a stranger like a bone is tossed to a dog is indicative of Love.  Trust Love? Why, when any fool can love? Shintou is right when he said that Love is worthless.  It is worthless because it is diluted – and given away so freely. <br>

Do not think so ill of us Nessarose.  We are not without passions…not without attachments.  These feelings are reserved however, for those most deserving of it – those who work towards improving the species and driving the darkness forward. We reserve such emotions for those that recognize the natural hierarchy of the lands and have dedicated themselves to preserving it.  All others are not worthy of such regard. <br>

Chain clad arms folded across his plate wrapped chest. All in black, he melded with the shadows in that dark corner. Pipe smoke from a nearby table wafts about him and cloaks him further. White light from the table candles flicked on his dark eyes. Below those eyes, an amused smile as he watched little Nessarose, seated by the bar, confront the Teir'dal knight.<br>
<br>
For all his long years, loud mouthed zealots of hate and fear would preach, and what good has it done them? It has brought war to their lands..Wars that they tend to lose. It has brought poverty to their people...Though, he mused..Poverty does spawn more hate..So perhaps that is their goal? To be poor and spiteful?<br>
*shaking his head*<br>
It reminded him of that ruin he was born in called Cabilis. This Iksar had long ago stopped pondering these matters. For now he just leaned on his wall and watched...Ever ready to jump in front of Nessarose, should this knight tire of the sharp wit and words of the little rogue.<br>

After Shintou finished speaking another Teir’Dal stepped over toward where she and Mettlach sit. As she moves closer Nessarose recognizes her to be the Lady Noxxia. <br>
<br>
*When Lady Noxxia is close enough she too speaks to Nessarose, only she speaks to Nessa of Nessa’s self. Nessarose snuggles a little closer to her Husband, Sir Mettlach and sips her Yukon Jack as she quietly listens to her talk.<br>
<br>
*As the Lady finishes speaking Nessarose empties her glass and signals to the bar keep for a refill. She sits quietly until he returns with the bottle she had given him to keep here for her, she tells him to leave the bottle and bring a couple more glasses. Then she looks straight into The Lady Noxxia eyes and begins speak to her.<br>
<br>
*”Lady Noxxia it is a shame that you see the way of life that I have chosen for myself and feel disgust. It is a shame, but I do not mind. You are not the first nor do I imagine you will be the last. It is your choices that make you feel so. And I can respect that. <br>
<br>
*If fighting to save Norrath from the destruction that the Greater Darkness would see done to her is to forsake my own kind, then it is what I must do. You should understand Milady I made this choice long before I had inclinations to explore the usefulness of men. I have much pride in Being Teir’Dal; it is not my kinsmen that I have forsaken but their need to hate. Hate serves only to distract us from, reaching our full potential.”<br>
<br>
* “You speak of my husband, Sir Mettlach as though he where no better than a light bringer. He is no more a light bringer than you or I.” Nessarose grins evilly at her husband. “While it might be true that this bard has polluted my mind, you can be sure the things that he… we have shared have nothing to do with the light.” Nessa smiles at Noxxia with a smile that hints of mischief. <br>
<br>
*”I do not claim to be an expert on love. The facets of love are so many that I will enjoy taking many more life times to explore them.” For a moment Nessarose’s eye seem almost clouded over as she is enveloped in some thought, then she sighs heavily as if to shake off something to painful to wish remembering. “In my lives I have been love’s victim and I have without intent brought pain to another through love. Yet these acts of love have only enriched who I am. Yes in the end there was great pain, but it is pain that reminds us we are alive. Now, many life times later I can look back on those relationships and thank the Great Maker for allowing me to share a small part of eternity with those souls.”<br>
<br>
*Nessarose takes a long sip from her glass, as she tries to put the words she wishes together “It is not love’s function to accept things at face value, on the contrary, to accept things at face value, is to see what is and accept that it is what you see. Love on the other hand asks you to have faith in what your heart tells you is the truth and put your trust in that faith. Even if it contradicts what you see.”<br>
<br>
*”Lady Noxxia, you said that any fool can love? I say the same can be said of hate, we need only look at Sir Shintou to see this to be true. Yet love can only be given freely, because its worth is priceless. You can not buy love; you can buy the vessel in which you wish sees you with love, but that does not guarentee that it will love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
*”Lady Noxxia, I do not think ill of anyone. With the exception of late, for this god called Bristlebane.” Nessarose’s eyes turn toward Shintou as she continues. “Although I must admit there are some that I pity. I pity anyone that would not embrace love for love’s sake. Those are one’s who’s live will only end in loneliness’.”<br>
<br>
*Nessarose smiles as the barkeep brings fresh glasses. She picks up the bottle of Yukon Jack and asks the lady. “Please come sit for a minute and have a drink with us. While I remind Sir Shintou of how he distorts my words and then we can continue this discussion.” Nessarose pour the liquid from the bottle into the fresh glass and offers it to Noxxia.<br>
<br>
*As Nessarose turns back to Shintou she sees an old friend in one of the taverns dark corners and ponders how she had not notice him when he had entered. She gives him a soft smile and turns to look at Shintou.<br>
<br>
 * “Forgive me these questions Sir Shintou. But, when did I speak of hatred coming out of love? Or when did I say that one needs love to hate? Of the later 2 questions I believe I asked ‘How can you say that you are even close to mastering hate if you do not understand love? Sir Shintou since we began this discussion you have resorted to putting words into my mouth and name calling. Neither of these validates your arguments. Except to say that your use of them is a good example of how hatred keeps you from reaching your potential. Are your arguments so weak that you must resort to name calling and putting words into my mouth?”’ <br>
 <br>
* “As for envy and jealously, they are just the emotions of people who do not see the abundance in their own lives.  Whether that lack of abundance is in love, material things and for you, it would seem power.” Nessarose begins to laugh again remembering Shintou spoke of his envy and hatred of those who are stronger than him. “How is it that you are so dependent on your God for power? Power is earned, by actions and seasons of endless hard work. To think that a god has given you, something that you have earned, that you given yourself through your experiences only shows how little you must believe in what you are. Earlier in this discussion you said you did not need your god to put you on a throne, yet you must wait for him to give you power?”<br>
<br>
* “To be exact Sir Shintou the opposite of hate is apathy. To feel an emotion as strong as hate…the only thing that could possibly be its opposite is apathy, to have no feelings for something at all. If you tolerate or accept something you are required acknowledging it. Acknowledging it requires in the end having some sort of feelings for it.”<br>
<br>
*   “While I can not say I approve of your abuse of love, in your own words Sir Shintou,  ‘You relished the pain you brought others ‘ it sounds to me in your own way love has brought even you joy, pleasure and some form of happiness. And while I can not speak for those ones that you cause to take their own lives, I can speak for my own soul. When the Lady Stargazer had been abandoned by her life’s love, she did just that, end her existence. And while her pain keep my soul at arms length with love for many life times, when I thought of her love mostly I remembered how happy she was while it was a part of her life. The thought of how happy she was, gave me the courage to allow love into my life. And if Sir Mettlach’s and my love ends tomorrow, then joy he has given me will have been worth the pain of its loss.”  <br>
<br>
*On that note Nessarose turned and smiled at her Husband. She then picked up the bottle of Yukon Jack and a fresh glass and filled it. Smiling she tells Sir Mettlach and the Lady Noxxia, “I will return in just a moment” and she turned and walked over to the Iskar who was listening from the corner.<br>
<br>
*Nessa smiled as she approached the Iskar. “Sir Gozrath it is good to see you in such good health. Although you look like you might be thirsty.” With that she handed him the glass of whiskey. “This is a strong, bold drink, for a strong, bold person such as yourself.” Then she leaned close to him and whispered softly, “Dear Gozrath when you grow tired of holding this old building's walls up we would welcome your company at the bar. That is to say if you would like.” Nessarose smiled softly and winked at Sir Gozrath, then returned to the bar and the on going discussion.<br>
<br>
* “So, Lady Noxxia where were we?”<br>

<br>
That is an incorrect statement, for you can hate without loving at all. The two are not connected, and love is not needed in this world.<br>
<br>
I am dependant upon Innoruuk? Of course I am. We are his creations, no matter how much we hate it our only purpose in life is to serve his will. If you wish to take it further, Innoruuk is the Son of Hatred. Serve Innoruuk and you serve hatred.<br>
<br>
This potential you speak of is nothing but a lightbringer view on how we should be, meak, weak, accepting, upon our backs and legs spread so they can play out their little fantasities.<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but I carry a sword. I've had my fare share of lightbringer women, comming up to me pleading to be my slave, my pleasure toy to be used at my own command. I however carry a sword. I cut them apart from the living, every single one of them.<br>
<br>
That body of yours does not belong to you, it belongs to Innoruuk, and it should be put to a proper use in the service of the Father, not seeking some &quot;Potiential&quot;.<br>
<br>
But, I am just a ShadowKnight who refuses to die in the past with these views that I hold, of course. The &quot;Any Fool That can Hate&quot;. <br>
<br>
For Envy, you see it as seeing the lack in someones life? Perhaps that is true, but without that Envy most would settle and become, well.<br>
<br>
Become like you, the lightbringers. Happy and complasant with the way the world is, pleased with what they have. <br>
<br>
I am not pleased. I never will be, happyness is something I do not need nor desire. I wish them all to die, I wish war to be brought back to Norrath, for within war their is the purest of Hate. And within war, Darkness will hold Norrath once again. It is the only way to bring the world back to some sort of sanity.<br>
<br>
...But I tire aruging these things. And by no means am I in the business of killing people because they do what you do, namely sleeping with elves and defowling Innoruuk's Body that he granted you, and serving the lightbringers. What you do is your choice. I remind you that it was you who decided to speak out against my little message to the world about my city..<br>
<br>
I leave you to that pitiful wastrel of a man, I believe you call them Woodelves. I have lightbringers to slay, and wars to start..<br>

<br>
Claiming to look for free will as opposed as following a god's path is just a lie you are telling to yourself ever and ever.<br>
<br>
How can you imagine you came on Norrath if not by gods will ? Believing you can live out of gods paths and calling it free will is just a blasphemy.<br>
There were, are and always will be blasphemous people but it doesn't make their foolishness more valuable.<br>
<br>
Rejecting the gods ? Saying others are just their minions ? Aye, minions people are.<br>
That's why gods are gods and we are not.<br>
Are we supposed to follow their paths ? We are.<br>
Otherwise why gods would have placed the many races on Norrath if not to have their share of pawns ?<br>
<br>
Looking to escape from the gods tutelage is unnatural. That is the most unnatural thing to do if you need to find something unnatural in Norrath.<br>
<br>
We are not created to escape our creators will.<br>
Gods power your priest, shamans communicate with their gods through spirits, gods give power to the various arcane casters, they incarnate elements and concepts, from the Fire of Solusek to the Fear of Cazic Thule. Everything on Norrath is gods creation and will.<br>
<br>
You all who claim free will are using the gifts of gods. You're just able to use them without paying hommage. It's just lacking to recognize from whom your power come.<br>
<br>
Each god has its agenda, each god had and still has plans for Norrath.<br>
<br>
So there is no gray or twilight. There is no &quot;gray&quot; god, no &quot;twilight&quot; concept to follow which could allow you to escape the divine battles.<br>
Believing being in a gray, shady area, out of the dark and light battle is a lie you repeatedly tell to yourself.<br>
<br>
The acceptance of a Teir'Dal among good organization or a &quot;shady&quot; one at Neriak is just proving you can fool others residents of Norrath. It's not a proof &quot;twilight&quot; exists.<br>
<br>
What defines primary your role in the divine battle is the god you choose to follow. Race is the secondary aspect as every races trace its origin to gods so the divine battle.<br>
Teir'Dal are not supposed to choose their side, they are all tools of Innoruuk. Those who reject the role that were assigned to them at birth (otherwise why would they have born ?) are just traitors or weaklings.<br>
Claiming being a friend of darkness because you can come close or in a dark city just prove you're avoiding opposing darkness because of weak will.<br>
You fooled the guards, probably, you won't fool every inhabitants nor the gods.<br>
<br>
Being in the &quot;twilight&quot; is just being superficially friendly to both side of the war.<br>
Did you engage into human sacrifice and Fear rituals as much as you go curing people from Plague and make sheer display of kindness ?<br>
Probably, you just happy enough to say you're able to sell and buy in both Neriak and Kelethin. Trade is defining twilight maybe ?<br>
<br>
Protesting against the idea of being a tool, a soldier or a pawn of gods is like protesting because the sun rise and set every day. It's pointless. Norrath is the creation of gods, their battlefield and we are here to serve.<br>
Free will doesn't exist. Twilight doesn't exist. It's just an illusion for weaklings or cowards.<br>

With all that the gods had put her through of late Nessarose could only feel contempt of these gods of which she spoke.<br>
<br>
*Once the newcomer finished her speech, Nessarose empty the last of the Yukon Jack from her glass and set it on the bar. With a glance she signaled the barkeep she wished a refill, and then she turned, slipped off her bar stool and looked confidently at the Teir’Dal.<br>
<br>
*“These gods of which you speak, I turned my back on them when I was born to this body. It was a gift to me by my parents who choose that I am agnostic, that I may choose my own path here on Norrath. I have found no god worthy of my homage. If someday I cross the path of a god worthy of worshiping, then and only then will I bow to a god.  While it is true that I am Teir’Dal, I owe nothing to the god call Innoruuk. I am a product of the Lady Elpheba and Sir Firero’s lust, no more, no less. And then they to abandoned me and my sister, at the whim of the house of Ebon.” <br>
<br>
*“This ‘Gray or Twilight’ of which you speak, you say that it does not exist. I ask, how did you come by this theory? If one who fights for good is light and one who fights for evil is of darkness, then those who sit in the middle must be a shades of gray. I gave up long ago trying to define if I was Light or Dark. I am Teir’Dal and because of this will never be seen by those of the light as light, but because I fight to defend Norrath against the darkness I will never be accepted by my own kind, therefore never truly dark. Where does that leave me? Somewhere in the ‘Gray’!” <br>
<br>
*“I serve only Norrath. The Lady Norrath has always provided for me. When I hungered or thirst she provided me nourishment. There is not a day that passes that she has not filled my eyes and soul with her beauties and wonderments. I have sworn my blade and my life to defending her from the greater darkness that has descended upon her. Norrath was here before the gods ever descended upon her and if those that fight as I, in her defense, succeed she will survive long afterwards. The Gods only use Norrath to play out their games, without a thought of defending or preserving her.”<br>
<br>
*“I do not deny that the gods created the forefathers of the greater and lesser races and placed them here on Norrath. That fact is burned in history and is done. The gods created them. Once created they bore children and those children bore children. These children where not created by the gods, they where created by a male and female, their parents.”<br>
<br>
*“If it is to be a traitor to turn my back on the gods then I shall embraces being one. I will hold to it and be proud. I Am a Traitor and Proud to be so! Do not think for a moment that it is that I am weak. Weak is to bow down to a god when that gods demands it. If you wish to be used by a god at his whim and then be forgotten when you are of no more use to them, all the time, you are praising him, this is your choice,  For me, all I have ever seen of the gods is the torment they have brought upon me and those I encounter. If I am to bow down to a god, that god is going to have to prove worthy of my homage not the other way around.”<br>
<br>
“Of late one of these gods, the one called Bristlebane began a toying with me. He pulled me to the sleeping realm on the day of my wedding to Sir Mettlach Darksong only moments after we had completed our vows only to return me to him later as a child. While I am sure that Bristlebane no doubt found great humor in this ‘gift’ he bestowed upon me, I can not. If this is his way to bring me to my knees to pay homage he is mistaken. It has taught me two things.”<br>
<br>
“One; that hatred is truly a powerful force that none of us are immune to. All he has done is by his whim is given me a hatred so powerful that I have swore to find the accursed lair to which he hides and slay him. And while I have no doubt I that now I would not succeed, I will go someday, until then this hatred will only spur me to increase my skills until I am certain of victory.”<br>
<br>
“The second beginning; it is true, we can not hide from the whims of the gods, whether it be Bristlebane, Innoruuk or that Goddess ‘whatever Marr’. If they decide that we will become their toy, then we are powerless to being used so. This does not mean that we have to play their game, what ever it is. Whether we cooperate or are dragged kicking and screaming, does not matter to them. For when they are done with us they will toss us aside for more entertaining pawns.”<br>
<br>
“I can see no use for a god that will use me but not hear my cries when I am in need. No I have seen no god in the gods of Norrath that listens to much less help his followers, unless it serves his own purpose.”<br>
<br>
“As for Walking through the cities of Norrath. There are few that I may not enter, the ones that I am welcome in, I am welcomed by all.” Nessarose chuckles for a moment, picks up her glass and takes a long drink, then continues. “Well perhaps not all. For it would seem that many a banker in Norrath finds my occupation a little unsettling. For reasons I can not fathom they prefer to kill a rogue rather than allow them access to their banks.” Nessarose shrugged and grins a bit mischievously. “To be sure this has nothing to do with whom I have killed or the god I may or may not pay homage to but rather it is an occupational hazard. One to which I have become accustom.” <br>
<br>
*Nessarose sighs deeply as she realizes that she grows weary. She turns back to the bar and slips back up on her stool. She takes another long drink from her glass, hoping to numb the pain standing has brought to her legs. All the time she stares at the ice and liquid left within. Wondering why she even bothers to speak, she knows that her words fall upon deaf ears, when spoken to those that choose to be pawns of the gods.<br>

<br>
&quot;Gods are not supposed to prove they are worthy enough to be worshipped. They are gods.<br>
<br>
Newborn are not the 'product' of their parents, free from any kind of link to gods. Newborn exists because their race exist, because gods wanted that race exist.<br>
The link doesn't weaken with generations. Newborn are not remotely linked to gods, they are their creation.<br>
<br>
Are people expecting each newborn is the result of a divine intervention ? Are people expecting gods coming to each of them during their youth and say 'yes, you are my favored child' ?<br>
<br>
You just suppose you may refuse a god because he didn't pay a special visit for you, bringing gifts with him to please you. You just suppose because no god came as an avatar or sent you visions or anything else, none of them deserve your worship. You just have a high and misplaced opinion of your own value.<br>
<br>
You also seem pretty aware of what gods think about us, saying how we serve don't matter to them or that they will toss us aside for more entertaining pawns at their whims.<br>
How can you be so sure of gods thoughts ? Do they speak to you ?<br>
<br>
Are the ones serving gods forgotten ? Do they ever have a reward ? Divine powers and flowing magic are the rewards given. Secrets and knowledge are the rewards given.<br>
I just doubt every priest will say 'My god never rewarded me' be it in terms of powers, knowledge or enlightenment.<br>
You just prefer to imagine worshippers as disdained servitors to refuse reality. Gods are rewarding the ones who serve them. They are not forgotten.<br>
<br>
Your opinion about gods is also built on the theory they are childish. Gods 'play' with Norrath.<br>
You are supposing a mortal mindset to gods and try to find mortal motives. Gods are gods, they are not mortals. Believing you are able to discern their motives and being able to judge their actions is plain arrogance.<br>
Anyway, they don't play like children, they are battling. Refusing to acknowledge Norrath is theirs and a battlefield doesn't make the gods childish.<br>
You just prefer to think about them as children which makes you, in turn, wiser. You're wiser than a child no ? So you're wiser than gods.<br>
<br>
Gods are helping only the ones who serves their own purpose. They are. Why would they help their ennemies or people who refuse to pay them homage ?<br>
If you serve a god, you serve his own purpose, so you are helped.<br>
Gods are helping their followers. You just choose to ignore it and behave as if they don't.<br>
Maybe did you expect a personnal appearance of a god when one of his followers is in trouble ? An avatar sent ?<br>
A high opinion of his own value someone must have to expect such display of power.<br>
<br>
The fact 'twilight' or 'gray' attitude is followed doesn't mean it is valid.<br>
Someone sitting out of the divine conflict is not creating a 'gray divine area', he is just sitting.<br>
<br>
Your whole conception of godly existence is linked to the fact gods must do you favors. From your very birth to your daily life, you believe gods have to prove you they are worthy.<br>
You are reversing the relationship between gods and mortals.<br>
<br>
You are mortal. They are gods. Not the opposite.&quot;<br>
