But I thought, I need a valid id, because you never know when someone is going to question if you are you.<br>
<br>
I got down to the Secretary of State. They have a system where you get asked at the door what you are there for, they make sure you have what you need before they give you a number. I tell the guy, I'm here to get a state ID, as my driver's license expired. I show him my passport. Oops, that expired last month. So he askes for a credit card. I show him, he gives me my number, I sit and wait. Ok, 25 minutes, not bad, really. <br>
<br>
I get up there. I'm not in the system. But here is my expired driver's license. No good. Since I'm not in the system, I need a social security card, birth certificate and credit card. <br>
<br>
Why? None of those three items have a picture of me on it. The DL issued from the same state does. Because it's expired, means I can't driver legally anymore, but, I haven't stopped being me, have I? I still look the same in the picture. The DL has my SS#. I pay taxes, I'm a registered voter. All in the same state for 8 years now. <br>
<br>
But I'm not in the system? What system, the screwed up, I don't know how to do my job system? They asked who let me past. I point to the guy I talked to. Mind you they give you a printed number, saying why you are there to hand to the person behind th counter when your number is called. <br>
<br>
He comes over and says that he asked me if I was in the system. No, he didn't ask me that, he asked why I was there, I said, to get a state ID. He then asked for a passport or  credit card, and based on the credit card gave me a slip saying I was A026, and told me to wait over there. <br>
<br>
Since I have an expired tamper proof ID from that state, obviously, I was in the system at some point. And all the information needed to be entered, is, oh, on my expired DL. Not on my credit card.<br>
<br>
So now I have to go back down, because I didn't have my Birth Certificate on me. Which, when I called, I was not told I needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=llilywillowfyre>Llily Willowfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Canadian Proud<br>

When you call they ALWAYS ALWAYS say you don't need your birth certificate, yet when you go there they say you do.<br>

Always.<br>
<br>
It even happened to me.  <br>

Ok, so it didn't...<br>

But it happened to someone I know.<br>

Ok, so it hasn't.  <br>

Now I will simply go do first thing in the moring. I hope the time I was given is correct.<br>
<br>
The stupidity didn't end there. I'm going to New York with my room mate for a festival. Well, we have two people splitting the time we are gone, looking after our apartment. <br>
<br>
But we have special locks, and the keys say do not duplicate. The building was sold recently, and the new owner said, that doesn't matter, you can get the copied anywhere. Wrong. So I call the locksmith company on the key.<br>
<br>
They ask what kind of key I have, I read them all the information on the key. Sure, no problem, just come on down and have your picture id with you. So my roommate and I go down, since he has a valid id. <br>
<br>
They don't have the blank key instock to grind your key, it will take a week to get those in, can we call you then.<br>
<br>
This of course, happened right after the state ID thing, and I wasn't a very happy person then. <br>
<br>
I could understand how much it would be all my fault since I didn't call for information first. But I did, and the people doing their jobs just didn't know what they were talking about, or didn't care enough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karlyana>Karlyana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/14/03 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3864.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.adelphia.net/~kotso/images/Ded.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm Me, Dammit!</span><hr size=1> Oh it the system... there so many screw up system believe me.<br>

I discovered it is much faster and easier to get a passport.  Now I keep that current and don't worry about a state ID that I don't really want.  I have a federal ID.  But... I have had some places -demand- a state ID and be flustered at a passport and then insist I have to have a state ID (i.e. paying with a credit card or cheque).  If they declined my request to speak with a manager, I left and did not return.<br>
<br>
Why is it easier, in my mind, to get a passport?  The system is built to actually issue passports and not just to create lines.  If you don't have a picture ID, you do need to have a person with a picture ID come with you to vouch for your ID while you provide 4 or 5 other forms of ID including your bith certificate, your social security card, and a credit card, library card, or other such (usually ask for more than one of those and preferably with a photo on at least one).  Renewing a passport is even easier.  <br>
<br>
Renew your passport and then you should be able to get your state ID with it. <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">
