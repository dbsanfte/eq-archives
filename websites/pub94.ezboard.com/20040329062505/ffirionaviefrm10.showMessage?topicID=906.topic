<br>
It was too easy.<br>
<br>
Ridley was a decent opponent.  He was fairly skilled with the blade and had a good set of chain armor.  The armor was better at turning a blade, though, and didn't provide as good protection against the crushing blows from her mace.  Besides, his real weakness was in his footwork and in that he wasn't skilled at defending low.<br>
<br>
Theresa turned his sword stroke on her shield and hefted her mace for a blow.  His eyes followed the motion.  Idiot.  She stepped closer, bringing her back foot up and kicking with full force at his knee.  There was a gratifying, fleshy snap and then an equally gratifying scream of pain.  Ridley staggered, falling to his other knee.  All defense was gone.  The mace came across, caving in the side of his face and crumpling him to the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; Brutol's harsh voice commended.  &quot;Cleric, get him up.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the cleric moved to heal the fallen boy, Theresa turned to her teacher.  She didn't smile.  Injuring her opponent pleased her, but more, feeling her instincts and skill merge and seeing the results gave her a satisfaction she'd not felt before.  She was good.  She'd get better.  The lessons with Wendel Vaughn had been worth it.  Learning to put a leash on her emotions let her think clearly while fighting.  Her hate channeled into the blows added a strength to them that her small frame did not show.  Her opponents still didn't see it.  They underestimated her, only seeing the young girl.  Well, that would change.<br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Hot water. <br>
<br>
It took effort to bring in the water from the well outside.  Her bruised and aching body welcomed the activity.  The combat and exercise had toned and strengthened her and she'd grown to like the feeling.  It took patience to stoke the fire and wait until the water was heated properly.  Opening the sluice let the water out of the copper boiler and filled the small, wooden tub.  It was worth the effort.<br>
<br>
Theresa stripped her clothes off and laid them over the stool.  A couple of others were in the room, bathing as well.  There was no privacy in this place, something everyone just accepted eventually.  Some even helped one another bathe.  She stepped into the hot water and let her body adjust to it.  Then, she crouched and slid under.  Hugging her legs, she rested her head on knees which barely broke the water's surface and sighed contentedly.  The aches and pains began to fade.<br>
<br>
When she'd soaked thoroughly and the water had cooled some, Theresa stood.  The warm air now felt chilly as she soaped and rinsed.  The sponge and warm water washed away the caked blood and dirt that the soaking had loosened.  It was strange washing blood away from a wound that no longer existed.  The clerics  fixed the serious wounds.  Bandaging and time would take care of the rest.  Even the marks that Wendel had left upon her during their training had all but faded.  The other marks, the ones he'd given her after training ... well, they were fading, too.<br>
<br>
The wounds she'd left on him would never fade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rhaksen says you've shown remarkable improvement over the last few months,&quot; Pietro said as she was wringing out her hair.  Theresa turned to find him leaning against the wall, watching her.  The others had left at some point.  She hadn't noticed.  She felt strangely modest, wanting to grab a cloth and cover herself.  Thinking herself foolish, she shook the thought away and met his eyes.  He was still as unreadable as ever.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm glad he noticed,&quot; she said with some sarcasm.  &quot;Most of the students haven't, yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They only see the woman, not the warrior.  Their mistake, your advantage.  While it lasts.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Theresa paused.  That was the first time he'd not called her a girl.  She tried not to seem hurried as she took the rinse bucket and poured the cold water over herself, washing away the last of the soap.  Even facing away, she still felt the heat of his eyes upon her.  She was a woman, now, young as she still was.  She'd thought her &quot;sessions&quot; with Wendel had killed any feeling she might've had for men.  Something about Pietro made her doubt that.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Here,&quot; he said, much closer.<br>
<br>
She turned and he was next to the tub.  He handed her a towel.  His expression still gave nothing away even as his eyes danced with their usual wickedness.  She took it from him.<br>
<br>
&quot;We've turned up Vaughn.&quot; Pietro said.  It broke the tension.<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot; Theresa asked.  She began to towel herself dry.  &quot;Where?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He seems to have had a room at the Freeport Inn.  He'd been meeting a lady there that he didn't want us or his family knowing about.&quot;<br>
<br>
Theresa just shrugged, &quot;Is he coming back?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.  He's dead,&quot; Zarn said, quietly.  &quot;At least, we believe it was him.  The inn keep, Hunter, said that was his room.  The body was so cut up we just had to assume it was him.  Maybe the girl killed him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frankly, I don't care.  He wouldn't have gone far in our ranks.  Whoever killed him just saved one of us from having to do it, later.  Strange they didn't take his things..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Strange.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We can put it to good use.  Go see Quan Nektogo.  He'll take your measurements,&quot; he ordered.  His eyes went slowly down her body, then up to meet hers again.<br>
<br>
She wrapped the towel around herself.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So he can re-work the acrylia to fit you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Pietro walked back to the doorway.  &quot;You.  Take his gear, keep what you want.  Sell the rest, use that and his money to get what you need.  Not armor, though, that's taken care of, it seems.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I still don't know why you'd ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Zarn stopped her.  &quot;To the victor, the spoils.&quot;<br>
<br>
He knew.  A small smile and nod where the only answer he gave the surprised expression on her own face.  Then, he turned and left the room.<br>
