I was standing in the Nexus, talking to a higher lvl player of my same class, and minding my own business. Along comes Phaedrax, human female warrior. She peers at me and then runs off. Now i'm wondering why this person is peering at me, so I sent a tell and Asked her &quot;if there was something wrong, lady? &quot;<br>
To which she answered, &quot;I know who you used to be and I do not nor will I ever forgive you for removing my lover from me in that life.&quot; I asked her,&quot; Excuse me?&quot;<br>
To which she answered, &quot;Be ignorant of your past, but I know you hide from your past and your past does not wish to see your image.&quot; <br>
Now i'm really wondering what's going on, and I sent this tell, &quot;Lady, You are bereft of your sences. What is this past I supposedly hide from?&quot; <br>
She tells me,&quot; I know who you are, and you are no friend to me.&quot;  I tell her ,&quot; Lady I have made no such claims, and before a few minutes ago, I knew nothing of your existance.&quot; She aslo tells me, &quot;She will never forgive me and i answerd I am puzzled but can nae stop how she feels. &quot;<br>
&quot;You may please ignorance of your past, but my eyes and my memory cross borders. She tells me, &quot;Your actions in the bazaar and Neth lair, deny your case. Tis no matter, you worry my lover no more. he is rid of his demons. &quot;<br>
I asked her,&quot; Lady, What hath i done? True I am often in the bazaar for i seek desperatly for research pages I need.&quot;  <br>
She answered, &quot;speak no more to me. you shall never be forgiven though you may have paid with your life, perhaps that is not enough for my pain. &quot;<br>
<br>
Ok so i /report her, and take a couple SS so i have  record of this bizaar conversation. i send an OOC tell in parenthesis stating she has been reported and to leave me alone, there is no IC reason for her attack and tell her goodday. <br>
Phaedrax tells you, '((then you are also Out of line for this was totally IC..and following your own...story ..so if you do not wish to Roleplay it..dont start it))'<br>
 Phaedrax tells you, 'On ignore'<br>
<br>
Now then, If you read all that. I ask you this. If you reroll your character, you are a new character. What ever you were, or did, would in RP terms DIE with that character. So therefore someone comming up and trying to say you were still responsible for what that character did or didn't do, would not be IC. It would be PoThat person carrying over their grudge to a new character whic IS ooc. Because their character would have no issue with your new character, You don't know each other. Now this being said, and i'm prepared for those of you who say this is a personal matter, and shouldn 't be on this board, however it's not a personal issue, as MY character and HER character did not meet until this evening when this exchange took place.<br>
so let's hear your opinions.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.travelersrealm.com/wendyfred/acat1.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:x-small;">Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,<br>

Dunno if you did bad things IC or OOC in EQ, but when you pass on all the things you earned with your previous character, you most definitely have not left those deeds behind.  You are in fact, still wearing them on your sleeve, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Just like a KS'er, ninja, or scammer seeks to launder gear from a bad rep to a good rep character, that's what you're doing here -- even if it's just an IC storyline bad rep with another particular RP'er.  You could, for instance, RP that you murdered the previous character and stole his gear or perhaps some other deus ex machina that explains the hand-down.  However you do it, I'm sure those you've interacted with will react to the hand-down in some way.<br>
<br>
I have absolutely nothing against twinking or passing down.  I think that twinking is a very good thing that significantly extends the lifetime of the game.  OTH, it sounds here like it's not purely an IC/RP issue, too, but that there's some other bad blood involved.  If that's the case, gear-laundering is revolting.  If you truly want to start over with a clean reputation, stop clinging to past gear and really start over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lethecerulre>Lethe Cerulre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DE Enchantress<br>

I would hazard a guess the &quot;stealing of mate&quot; was seen as OOC so carrying it from one to another character because of OOC knowledge was carrying the IC to the new charater. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hateschild>Hates Child</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/23/03 11:25:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3082.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.travelersrealm.com/wendyfred/catchme.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: If you pass on gear, ..</span><hr size=1> but it doesn't matter if i AM or not.

My characters now, neither of them, are Sarhea.  I let Traelle be known as me, because I mod here.<br>
<br>
But if, oh, say, Beren(sorry man, just pulling a name outta Sar's past*grin*), came to Traelle and said &quot;Fer things ya did to me in another life..:&quot;/d<br>
<br>
I'd ask him to pass that pipe over here.<br>
<br>
*comfort*<br>
<br>
I don't know who ya were/are/whatever.<br>
<br>
It's none of my business, *as a roleplayer*. <br>
<br>
Now, there are two people who's incarnations I'll put on ignore, the moment I find out it's them. Thankfully, one's gone &quot;ubar&quot;, so I don't look for a reroll, and time has mellowed me on the other one...but in both cases, it's due to ooc, and I certainly wouldn't be IC telling them about it. <br>
<br>
a quiet /ignore is lovely.<br>

Sad truth is, all I can hold against poor ol' Sarhea, (in terms of personaly injury), is her steppin' on my toes a bit when I was tryin' ta teach her ta dance blades proper-like....she sure'd never accidentally be called &quot;Tinkerbell&quot; eh?<br>
<br>
I reckon she could never run me through because deep down she knew Karana was still in 'er heart.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

However, your /reporting of her was equally lame.  She gave you a /peer.  ALL conversation was started by you, and you could have dropped it at any time and just written her off or /ignore.

If there was any harassment it was on your part, Hates. All she did was come up to you, peer at you, and then leave. I did not know that look at someone was harassment. You, Hates, are the one that pursued the matter, you are the one that started the conversation, and you are the one that would not let the matter drop. So what if someone does not like you for whatever reason. Just let them leave and go about their business. Don't deal with them. All I see from your post is a conversation, no harassment. I hope she took SS as well.<br>

To answer your question, when you reroll I see it as the old character dieing, retiring, or whatever and the new one being different. But not everyone plays that way. Some people have their new character connected to the old one in some way. Each person can play however they want, especially when it comes to their story. On the other hand, if a player has done something that was not very nice or acceptable then rerolling cannot save you from your past. But roleplay should not spill over into a new and unconnected character. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hateschild>Hates Child</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/24/03 6:44:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3082.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.travelersrealm.com/wendyfred/catchme.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What the heck is the deal?</span><hr size=1> *smiles* i will admit reporting was over the top. *bows*<br>

<br>
I'll answer that for you. No you dont.<br>
<br>
You hold onto the good most of the time. The good being your friends. Usually you send them a /tell and go something like hi remember me soandso, yeah I rerolled. Cant wait to catch back up in levels so we can hang again...yada yada..<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the point is that no one ive ever met truely drops all their previous characters past. Ever. Period. Therefore how is it so inconceivable to think someone wont remember how you slighted them with your past character. I mean, good god, who hasnt tracked Niomial or whoever because of the shit they pulled in the past. Ehh?<br>
<br>
Ohh and if you say 'well Imasu, that was different, cause that was ALL OOC shit they pulled'. Well this case sounded like you took her RP and turned it personal and OOC.<br>
<br>
'Well Imasu, I wasnt RPing that story anymore. *pouts*' Tough. You have a rep of being a house recker in your past life, to them that is. Lets say they believe in reincarnation. Hmm, a reincarated house recker...hmm, not someone I would ignore completely myself. All situational for sure, but I can see someones point of view in this instance.<br>
<br>
All that being said, I actually applaud you for trying to find out what the problem was. It sounds to me like your a careing person, to just pick out random people that stare at you too long and send tells asking if they are alright. Actually, no I dont applaud you now that I think on it....that sounds vaugly antagonistic to me, like you intentionally picked a fight.<br>

I agree with Takkon, Bjond, Fallnangel77, and Imasu.  Though Imasu said it best probably.  And Bjond probably meant what Imasu was saying.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't think you should have reported Phaedrax for this.  She probably had you mistaken for someone else.  AND since you didn't know Phaedrax beforehand, why do you care how she feels about you?  Just put her on ignore if you can't convince some stranger that you are not the reincarnation of she didn't like.<br>
<br>
Anyway Imasu said it best.  When/if we reroll we do not change our friends or our enemies, though we may be selective about who we tell of our new persona. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
