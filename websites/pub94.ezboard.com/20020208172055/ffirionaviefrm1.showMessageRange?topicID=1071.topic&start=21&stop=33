A skilled wizard deals out more damage on epic fights than any other class sans Rogues ( Rogues are THE highest end game damage dealers btw ). Something to remember is the insane regeneration high end mobs have and the importance of 'closers' i.e. wizards. My personal favorite AE group was always puller, enchnater, cleric, 3 wiz. Crazy xp for Karnors or Seb or anywhere else really. But enough of the wizard hijacking of this thread and back to the lacking class.<br>
<br>
RANGERS !<br>
<br>
The lack of higher end rangers on this server is going to severely delay the killing of many mobs like Tmax, Dain, etc.<br>
In addition to Predator buffs, good Trueshot damage, etc, Rangers are THE best transitional class in the game. When you start trying to take down mobs that last longer than the Warrior defensive disc. and must transition aggro to the next warrior in the progression, noone can do this as seemlessly as the Ranger. 2 per battle are usually needed ( a mob like Tormax is generally killed on third warrior in progression if damage output is typical ) but I am doubtful if one can be fielded. Certainly there are other ways of transitioning, but they all involve a lot more headache. On a brighter note. FV is still a ways of to 'Big' encounters ala Velious ( to my knowledge at this writing none of the Kunark baby dragons have even been killed ) but that time will come. Will be interesting to see if the rangers present will be of the homegrown variety or a doublefisted second account player from a member of one of the higher end guilds. Would be a shame IMO if necessity forced the latter. Guess we'll have to wait and see. Oh, and if ya missed it the first time, the lacking class on this server is ....<br>

 You be completely wrong, Wizards OWN on high end encounters. Wizards are not that desirable in exp group though, due to higher damage output over time from melees. <br>
<br>
 Wizards are only casting class that gets a bonus to land thier spells. (after lvl 30) Thier spells cover magic, fire and cold. Maybe if you actually participate in higher end encounters, you would see how everyone in the raid eyes the Wizard group with envy, for the group with high level wizard almost always get the xp. This is how Wizard class currently stands, maybe you speak of EQ in the past. <br>

In log parsing, wizards come out on the bottom, always.  There are a few special cases where wizards are nice for the final push once the MOB is very low -- traditional &quot;old-world&quot; dragon tactics still work on a few of the bigger MOBs, but that's about it.<br>
<br>
As far as the wizard group getting the xp on the kill proving they do the most damage, that's a running joke.  I would regularly compete with other wizards to &quot;ks&quot; the kill and get the xp on a raid.  I can cast just one spell during a high end fight using a solo wizard and get the xp pretty much every time on huge MOBs.  It's not the group that does the most damage that gets the kill.  It's who does the most damage most recently.<br>
<br>
It's not the size of the spell that matters, it's how much damage you can do over time.  Wizards don't start to be good contributors until after they get some of their very top end gear -- the clickable DD items really make wizards shine at the upper end.  Sure, wizards can do AE for xp.  Bards are far and away better at xp AE, though -- after the pull, the wizard has to sit down for 5-10 minutes and you need an enchanter to keep the wizard alive.  After a pull to a bard-AE group, you just go out and pull more and you don't need an enchanter.  Bards have to be pretty high level before AE starts to pay, though -- wizards can do good AE quite low.<br>
<br>
The wizard class can be fun and a good wizard is always a nice find.  I just wouldn't encourage people to go out and start more wizards.  It's not for everyone and if you're looking for utility, it only has a few very specialized uses.  If you love seeing huge damage numbers when you hit, wizard would definitely be the class for you -- no one will ever see bigger numbers than a wizard.  If you want your log-parser to regularly list you as top-damager during a fight, play a rogue.<br>
<br>
For needed classes, I'd list them like this:<br>
<br>
1. Clerics.  You can't have too many clerics.<br>
2. Warriors.  Big huge warty solo-wall will make high level wars rare on FV.<br>
3. Bards.  Can't have too many bards, but twisting songs is not for everyone.<br>
4. Rogues.  Damage and more damage.  Rogues are a great class!<br>
5. SK, Ranger, Monk, Enc &amp; Sha.  Each has nice niche and general utility, always good to have around.<br>
6. Druids.  I'd have put Dru with 5, but there are enough to kill Wuoshi just by gating in so many she chokes trying to eat them all.<br>
7. Mage &amp; Necromancer.  Nicer for xp than raids.<br>
8. Paladin &amp; Wizard.  Low damage output, low or very specialized utility.  Takes real dedication to play these classes. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/10/02 5:25:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=enheduanna>Enheduanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 2:54:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Auno ..</span><hr size=1> Well, I guess I'll practice standing around and looking pretty then, since it seems magicians aren't good for much else...<br>
<br>
Seriously though, I am curious if people do find much use for mages. I've only met a few in my 32 seasons, and only grouped with one, I think. The discussions I've read here indicate no particular desire for more magicians. Even so, I always seem to be welcome in any group I join. Is it possible that the gods have changed the world enough that we magicians are going to be useful?<br>
<br>
I also wonder if those log parsers would take into account the damage my pet does, as well as the effect of my damage shields, in addition to my nukes. (I expect they would, just checking -- and I have no idea if DS is effective at high levels.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 5:21:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mages fit in ..</span><hr size=1> .. about with wizards.  They do much better damage but the good and bad of it is that it's pet-based.  I completely forgot about them on my list of desired classes mostly because there always seems to be one or two around on a raid and that's about all you need.  Same thing with the twitchers, err, necromancers.  For xp, I'd prefer mage or necromacer to wizard or paladin.<br>
<br>
BTW, I don't know if Verant removed the 4-pet rule.  It used to be that if you had more than 4 pets (charmed or summoned) on the same MOB, the extra pets wouldn't do any damage.  They would stand there and follow the MOB and look like they were attacking, but you'd not get any extra damage messages.  They put this one in back when folks were using the &quot;pet army&quot; technique to soften up Vox and Nagafen before the fight.  I'd definitely check this out in-game again before believing, though.<br>
<br>
I don't think anything will ever top the cleric/warrior combo unless Verant really changes the game quite a bit.  Casters suffer a lot at the upper end.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 5:22:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> gah .. double post</span><hr size=1> [delete this one please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ] <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/10/02 5:23:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umheddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mheddik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 8:20:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm, I disagree</span><hr size=1> &quot;I prefer the enchanters but then again you need a group with them.&quot;<br>
<br>
I solo 1 to 5 mobs at a time in The Grey as an enchanter. Only tried five once, three shimmering rockfiends, a timeless golem and a shissar stalker. Got xp for four of them, missed one of the rockfiends. This isn't a once in a blue moon thing - I'd say I've probably solo'd at least 2/3 of the time, much in The Grey (I like the danger factor), but elsewhere as well. What can I say, I like A) the experience I get this way, B) the adrenalin rush when you have several mobs that can kill you easily breathing down your neck, and C) the on-the-fly mathematical computing and assessment you have to do (and do quickly) to pull this kind of thing off consistently. Yes, yes, wizards and druids can quad kite (which I find personally rather boring). But sometimes after four mobs, I am still at 50m or more, with clarity 2. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, enchanters don't need groups. They are excellent in groups, they help groups a lot. But in no way does an enchanter NEED a group.<br>
