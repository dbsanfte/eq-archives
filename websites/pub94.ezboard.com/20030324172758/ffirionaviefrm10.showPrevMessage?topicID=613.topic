<br>
She was big with child, and content in Davin's arms. For there, they could forget who each was, and just be together.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Davin, what will become of the child?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The human smiled softly at her, looking into her eyes as he lay a hand gently over her rounded belly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
My love, no matter what the child looks like when he's born, he will grow up loved.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Airgiod grew pensive, then finally spoke, softly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Xas...he will be loved...by only one of us...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She looked up at the knight, pain in her eyes.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
But we will have to be apart...Is there another way? I can live here, in the Karana's, with the child. You can come whenever you can get..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Davin put a finger to her lips, the pain obvious in his eyes as well.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Love. My heart. You know that this is how it must be.  The child would not be safe if we were to be found out. We must do this. For the babe.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Airgiod knew in her heart that Davin was right.  Their love could get either of them killed if it were found out.  And to think what would happen to the child of such a union, even in Qeynos, where halfelves were a common occurance. <br>
<br>
What would happen to that child if it were born with blue skin?<br>
<br>
So she knew that if that were the case, she would take the child and go back to Neriak, and raise the child as teir'dal. <br>
<br>
Airgiod was a member of the Indigo Brotherhood, and as such would not be questioned on the birth of a child. They'd already seen her, belly poking out from refitted chainmail.<br>
<br>
And then what if the child was pale at birth? She couldn't take the babe to Neriak. She would be killed, and the child sacrificed.  So Davin would be responsible for raising the child, among the humans, if that were the case. <br>
<br>
His fellow knights of Thunder knew that he had a woman that he was secretive about. They assumed that it was because he was ashamed of her poverty or some such, and he let them, because that was safer to both of them than the truth. And it would be easy enough to explain the child by claiming the mother'd died in birth.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Airgiod shook herself out of thoughts and tried to smile for Davin.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
xas.  Ussta quortek, you will always be with me, through all time. You are part of me, and I, you. Together, we make one.<br>
And we will suffice. <br>
<br>
For the child. <p><center><b>Airgiod</b><br>

<br>
She looked at Davin, and smiled a bit at the look on his face. He was more frightened than she was.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
My soul. I'm fine, this is how it normally goes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She looked at the druidess that Davin had brought, who nodded at Davin, and went back to work on Airgiod, chanting under her breath a spell to lessen the pain, and speed the process.<br>
<br>
Over the next hour, the labor progressed, and finally, Airgiod heard the druidess say, firmly, through the haze of exhaustion and pain,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 'Now, airgiod, now! Push!'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And minutes later, the sweetest release she'd ever experienced. A release of mind and body and soul, unlike anything she'd ever experienced. <br>
<br>
Then, she heard the baby's cries.<br>
<br>
She looked anxiously at Davin, who's eyes were awestruck, and pained at the same time.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The druidess, a halfelf, looked up at Airgiod, from between her knees, smiling.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She's beautiful, lady.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Then laid the babe on Airgiod's belly, still full, and heaving from the exertion. <br>
<br>
The tiny girl baby had a thick shock of white hair, and the lavender eyes of Airgiod...and skin as pale as Davin's.<br>
<br>
Airgiod swallowed her panic, and sadness, and kissed the baby repeatedly, whispering to her in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
Davin, openly crying, laid his head on Airgiod's shoulder, kissing her, and whispering small nothings, as he caressed the child's face.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She's perfect, Davin. Please, let her know of our love, as she grows.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The human looked at her, stricken, as he realized that there was no going back now.<br>
<br>
The druidess stepped forward with a small cloak.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Davin, we need to take the child and go, quickly.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She wrapped the little girl, and handed her to the knight, speaking to Airgiod.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I will be back in moments. I want to get Davin and the baby to Surefall, then I will be back to tend you. Lay still, and...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Here, the druidess looked kindly at Airgiod, and touched her shoulder.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There will be a time when you two will be together. Love this strong isn't held by society's stigmas, not forever.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And she turned and put one hand on Davin's shoulder, the other on the baby, and muttered an incantation.  Airgiod watched, forlorn, as they shimmered, and then were gone.<br>
<br>
Once Davin was gone from her site, Airgiod could not hold back. Sobs wracked her tiny frame.  <br>
<br>
She was truly alone now. Truly. Her soul, and her child, both gone from her.  <br>
<br>
She damned the gods, the fates, and everything she could think of, for the folly of her love for the paladin, and his love for the Hateful little bladedancer that she was.<br>
<br>
In the midst of her sorrow, and self pity, a wave of pain hit her womb, causing her to gasp, and nearly faint.<br>
<br>
She quickly calmed herself, pondering vaguely whether this was the afterbirthing process that the druidess had told her about. <br>
<br>
Over the next few minutes, the pains kept coming, Airgiod growing fearful. <br>
<br>
Well, if I die...then Davin can move on...<br>
<br>
Suddenly(or so it seemed to Airgiod, in her haze of pain), the druidess was at her shoulder, speaking quietly, and reassuringly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yes, dear, you're fine, everything is fine, you're not dying, there's a second babe, that's all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The tier'dal woman blinked, sure she'd heard wrong.<br>
<br>
The druidess, moving quickly, took position between Airgiod's knees, took a deep breath and said</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
When I tell you...push. I know you're tired, but you need to do this one more time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Airgiod closed her lavender eyes, and prayed. For what, she wasn't sure. <br>
<br>
<br>
And then, she heard  the crying of a baby, and knew it was either over, or she was dreaming.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
She had a thick mat of white hair and clear lavender eyes.  Eyes that looked curiously around from beneath the wrappings the druidess had gathered up.<br>
