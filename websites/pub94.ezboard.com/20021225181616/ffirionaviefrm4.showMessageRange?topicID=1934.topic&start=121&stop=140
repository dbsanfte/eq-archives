On pulling the dragon to tunnel entrance. I have only seen Her being raided twice during my many trips from DL to FV Both times she was being pulled to the tunnel entrance and fought there. So while more experienced players may know this is not the norm. For some that may be the only thing they have seen done.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I've been on many server and EQ firsts in my time playing EQ.  Griefing others during those firsts when no one had ever done those things before was never even a minor option.  If we couldn't do it safely, we just plain didn't do it.  Back before Gorenaire had ever been killed, my old guild on Tunare wiped a bunch of times on many occasions trying her.  Moving to a zoneline or the tunnel to make things easier on us at the expense of other's play never even crossed our minds.  Now you have new guilds claiming newness as an excuse?  Sorry, I don't buy it.  Not only have I been in that position before, but there are tons of people here that know better.  All you have to do is ask.  That's part of raiding -- asking other folks that have tried it for appropriate tactics and advice.<br>
<br>
That's the difference between responsible people and your natural born griefer.  The later badly needs the rules in order to figure out what is right and wrong.  The former don't.  Take a look at the mature raiding guilds on FV.  They don't need the rules because they think about how their acts effects the server and consequently, the worst you see about them here in the 'box is just interpersonal drama.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Gore takes 30s&quot; and &quot;no one was near&quot; comments don't hold water either.  A lot of the folk likely to run by will die to a single AE or fear and of course they aren't there because they gate and run to KC or FM or wherever -- they might show up at any moment completely unsuspecting.  A newbie raid guild is far more likely to die to Gore than vice versa, especially if they have a lot of under 60 folk vulnerable to fear.  And Gore will corpse-camp.  She doesn't always roam away promptly after a wipe.  Fail at the tunnel and you've created a problem for a lot more than just your raid.<br>
<br>
When you raid, it becomes much more important to consider how your tactics effect populated hunting zones for two reasons: raids are not precise and they magnify small mistakes.  Think about it.  Especially think about it if you're in NC.  Imagine what you'd think of a guild that killed you without warning as you were running through the tunnel on the way to KC and a raid leader that just shrugs and says, &quot;Sorry, I'm new.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rbnice1>rbnice1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/7/02 1:50:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I'm sorry, but ignorance is no excuse</span><hr size=1> I dont think thats what borble meant bjond. I think what he meant is that in his expierience (the same as mine) the only times he has seen anyone kill gore they pulled him to the cave. Im not saying thats right or wrong. Its just a fact. Now I have learned something new and will use that to my advantage if I ever get to attept gore. I would have assumed that you pull gore there too, just because thats what I have seen. Now I know different. And as to kethlar. I have never seen him be an ass in game to anyone. I actually have only seen him get pissed once and that was because someone was not only rude but I cant even say everything that the person said to us. Just sticking up for a old friend. But he is right 90% of the people flaming I have never even seen much less met ingame. Not saying im willing to step on people I never met, just saying since I dont know ya I would have to go by what a friend says before someone I never met.

But that's wrong ...  Borble for one (read his post again, many read it wrong) and a few from Rbniceone.  Anyone who ASSumes he has no support .. WRONG<br>
<br>
Lets see... This thread started and took off ... all in ONE DAY!! .. now i dont know about most of you all, but i do not visit boards EVERY SINGLE DAY, EVERY SINGLE HOUR ... sooo I come to the boards this morning and this is what i find... and here is my support<br>
<br>
Kethlar is an Advisor to the Call and for reason ... his values, choices and decisions are supported 110% by his fellow-guildmates, so if something transpired, whether it be an outcome of a negative or a possitive, it was done with good intentions ... he does not need back up to fight his battles ... we (NC) trust him as well as all of our other guildmates to be big enough to handle things on their own<br>
<br>
My 2 cents...<br>
<br>
Personally I have done Gore a handful of times ... each time as a guest to a different guild and each of those times Gore was pulled to that tunnel enterence ... I too asked why since it's a travel spot, and was told that Gore cannot travel through that tunnel so if it looks like a whipe, some have a chance to escape .. now whether this is true or not, i'm not really sure but the point being is that it has been in common knowledge to pull her there, whether it is being the right, wrong or indifferent spot to pull ... I also, in my early seasons of doing Yeti's and traveling to KC have seen MANY large raid groups pull her to that tunnel... i've seen shouts of incoming GORE to DLTunnel ... so i can't see why such bafflement on why that choice was made? ... She was hanging around there ... she can't get through the cave ... makes sense to me ... and i know that if Kethlar did not see anyone camping in that area then HE DID NOT SEE ANYONE CAMPING THAT AREA...  <br>
<br>
Perhaps many may be confused on what CAVE is being spoken of ... in my knowledge, there is a cave and tunnel in the dreadlands .. the &quot;Yeti&quot; cave where there are set Yeti spawns .. which is what i've always known to the be the Yeti Cave.  Then there's the first tunnel (which is being spoken of) where some Yeti's roam around outside of it ... this tunnel being the one when you port down into the DL that you travel through to GET TO the yeti caves ... i have seen people pull to that entrance before but that is not the Yeti Cave ... that is the DL Tunnel in which Gore commonly roams ... (to my knowledge that is)<br>
<br>
Rumor has it that the server was down the entire day yesterday and it seems that some peeps had not much to do other than hang around the boards waiting for the server to go up ... so perhaps that is why so much flamage on one topic?<br>
<br>
I didn't count off, but it seemed to be no more than 10ish different people that replied to this post ... about 4 being consistantly reposting and replying ... now u see, i dont find that to be no support by the NC guild for Kethlar ... I find that to be that those hand full of people so happened to be on the boards, bored as hell cause the game was down (damn Verant! &lt;giggle&gt;) and they found a hot topic to be able to put their 2 cents into ... If i had been on the boards, i would have posted my support and 2 cents as well  LOL ... but i wasn't<br>
<br>
And please know i would love to post comment to a few pot shots ... but, it's not my way to do that in a public forum ... i shall take that up vias tell one on one ... <br>
<br>
I hope this thread ends here ... this was one damn long ass post on something not quite so large<br>
<br>
Good hunting to everyone and safe travels ...<br>

All the Paineel guard-killers refuse /duels. I shouldn't be surprised. If they're too scared to go to a real dungeon, they're obviously going to be frightened of a guy with a short sword * and newbie tunic.<br>

Oh yeah, one exception. I challenged Teapray and she refused, but her husband Lenny challenged me so I accepted.

Kethlar and i had a talk with both of our guild leaders... which were there during what happened.  Eviah told the same story that she told here.  Uncamike told his side as well.  <br>
<br>
We have come to a resolution at least and both parties apologized.<br>

Just a fyi but i dont think we all hate eachother.  It was just a bout between two hardheaded, stubborn people.  *smirks*  Im glad you all enjoyed it.<br>

<br>
If Kethlar's guildmates support him and his decisions 110%, I don't think I want anything to do with anyone from Norrather's Call anymore.  I wasn't there in the dreadlands, I don't know what happened in the dreadlands, but Kethlar has made it very clear, within the context of this thread, that he is selfish, childish, arrogant, and just about as dumb as a box of dead fish.  If you stand behind that, stand away from me.<br>
<br>
If you can read over Kethlar's posts in this thread, and think to yourself &quot;Wow, this guy is guild advisor material all the way!  110%&quot; you've got some issues that need to be dealt with in front of a certified psycologist.<br>
<br>
If you want Kethlar's posts here speaking on behalf of the ENTIRE GUILD, then so be it.  My opinion has been drawn, as have the opinions of others, I'm sure.  Second chances come after meaningful apoligies.<br>
<br>
Take it or leave it.  You probably don't care one bit if Leani Sidhe likes you or not, but I just wanted to let you know that the way in which Kethlar is carrying himself in this thread is an embarrassment to your guild as seen through the eyes of someone who doesn't really care one way or the other.  And I highly doubt I'm the only one who sees this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rundonundodundo>Rundo Nundodundo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ghetto Cleric</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/7/02 6:38:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=132>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: uh Jaranna</span><hr size=1> Alright I am NOT going to read this entire thread but here is what is common courtesy:<br>
<br>
You have a raid in a populated hunting zone you should SHOUT what you are going to do and where you are going to do it.  If someone tells you you are intruding then you move elsewhere.  A raid needs to realize that hunting groups have a right to be there and it is your DUTY to try to protect those groups from your pulls.  An example would be Reso hunting in Kael.  We, for a small time, do pull a tremendous amount of giants around which could seriously damage a hunting group, but we will always first confirm where the other groups are in the zone and then make sure our pulls don't intrude on their space.  We also inform them of when and where we are pulling the giants.  If you want to continue raiding with any respect from this community you MUST adopt those policies.<br>
<br>
As a side note, to think you have a perfect reputation Kethlar is a joke, while I don't mind joining an experience group with you I do remember you on your first Nagafen raid when you made a complete ass out of yourself and where subsequently banned from Saurix's open raids.  You claimed the clerics were retards because they didn't heal you and you were summoned back when indeed you shouldn't have had that much aggro and gone to the cleric station, you could have sacrificed the raid.  I remember these things because this server is full of nice people and when someone immature runs around and thinks they are the boss I know exactly how to pass judgement.  Just from the title of this thread I would have pronounced you guilty.  Welcome to Firiona Vie. <p>Venerable Rundo Nundodundo<br>

If someone petitions you, you will be spanked.  I've seen it happen.  Just because others have done it in the past does not make it proper behavior.  Rundo said it perfectly.  It's your responsibility to ensure that your raid does not unduly impact others in the zone.  If you are with a raid leader that insists on doing this, you are just as guilty as he is -- ask him to shift his tactics or just walk out.  If you're there, you're part of it.  If your entire guild supports this type of activity 110%, you've got a guild made of assholes and griefers.<br>
<br>
BTW, I happen to know that 110% number is incorrect, since there are nice folk in NC that have said they don't like this.  IMHO, they need to vote with their feet, but that's often a difficult thing to do.  /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aailin>Aailin </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/7/02 7:21:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: uh Jaranna</span><hr size=1> ummmmm couple of points:<br>

<br>
Huh?? Where do Fnf and Reso fit into all this? Yes Keth your right both guilds abilities increased with flames /sigh.<br>
<br>
Keth your wrong in this man.  Dead wrong.<br>
DL is a huge zone, you could easily have just pulled her anywhere.  I have pulled gore with RS 3.  Simple Stun and run.<br>
If you were going to pull to where they were camped you could have at least asked them if they would mind much.<br>
99% of resonable ppl would not mind you overriding their camp for the 30 seconds it takes to kill a dragon.  I'm guessing someone in your raid came off as a jerk and thats the reason this all happened.<br>

You were the only person who ever complained at any of my open Naggy raids, way back in the day - because you were one of 1 or 2 deaths, and you got YOURSELF killed because you didn't have a fucking clue what you were doing.<br>
<br>
It sounds like you still don't know.<br>
<br>
Why do you do this shit?  Just to cause problems?  That was sure what it was about at my raid, or at least the impression I got..  and now you're training some people who're hunting, having fun, and start whining and making up bullshit excuses?!<br>
