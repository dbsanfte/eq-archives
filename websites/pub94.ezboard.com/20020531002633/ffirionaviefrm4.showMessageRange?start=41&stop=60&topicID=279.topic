<br>
we don't need you to give us identity. we don't care what you think or do, because we know who we are. we don't need your permission and we don't need you to justify our actions. we don't need you to legitimize our existance. you are not the 'guild reputation police'. you are not the vigilante that is going to do anything about it, if we had done something wrong. you act like such an expert at judging character. you don't know jack. you sit in the peanut gallery while we are in the trenches.<br>
<br>
i know who itchy is. itchy is a tattle and an instigator himself. tattles get no respect from me.  there are other reasons i dislike itchy but i have no tangible proof to produce about them so i do not mention them. guess that will just remain cryptic.<br>
<br>
maybe you don't care, but if you do, you better gauge how much smack you talk about 'tags' because you will find yourself a very lonely individual. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/27/02 9:09:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Whoa, very touchy Hitam</span><hr size=1> Bjond:<br>

This is an utter aside, but the reason my EZBoard name does not match my in-game name is because I've been using EZBoards, for some private political boards, for some years now, with this name.  And &quot;Robin&quot; was already taken on FV when I signed on.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This post was a heads up.<br>

I had the chance to bullie my way into stealing a camp from some high elfs I (along with many others) can ks any camp we want from the lower levels, what keeps us from it? We do not want it happening to us, its is the fact that it happened not the fact of what it was that matters here. If this guy ks me I have no problem bringing more to him, (like the famous bard on sullen zek) I take it as that, and I take every other post here to learn from it.<br>

I don't know why people would say it is -newbish- just because it was an orc_spawn that was involved in the incidence.  Just because you've stared Ragefire dead in the eyes does not grant you the right to determine what mobs are subjected to the KS policy and what mobs do not.  Let me repeat this one more time, Kill Stealing is Kill Stealing is Kill Stealing.  <br>

I am not a bad person, I just hate being threatened. Sorry if i missed the big banner above the orc's camp that read 'Itchi's Orc Camp&quot;, I was just showing my friend around the WC. If anything I was extremely pleasant to the Dwarf, sorry if I'm a bit rusty on my Dwarf speaking skill (I'll work on that). I had no intention of 'KSing your friends'! In fact, I didn't know what that meant before I met you! Itchi I'm sorry that I was a jerk to you! When you first gave me a tell I took it as a big insult. Instead of just trying to work our problems out, you just started insulting me. I come here now, because I was informed that my name was being slammed, and this is my reply and my apology. If anything Itchi, please give me a tell whenever I am on, I'm sure we can work this out I can clearly see you are outraged! Like I said before, I had no intention of 'KSing' you pals. This is my reply! This is my defense! As well as my Apology. I'm sorry Itchi for my actions, I will remember your words every time i fight side by side with another.

I have spent alot of time with both guilds and can say neither is perfect... but then again who the heck is?<br>

Free for all usually only happens when there is intense competition for mobs. On FV there is NO competition for upper level mobs so I just can't see it happening. Thats just my 2 bits anyhow.<br>

Figured this was a clear cut case but to answer your question Marvell I was playing my Druid slave and not Ichi who, and hes 45 Now ROAR! eheh.<br>
<br>
So the KS was made of the dorf cleric that was there and not Ichi.<br>
<br>
But anyways I accepted the appology and will plan on watching the offender in the future and ignore Haegen who obviously has issues with me beyond my understanding and beyond the point of this post which was has already been clearly stated and beat with a large stick like the dead horse that it is eheh.  <br>
