<br>
I'd been tracking things since I was six years old, but hunting down the old cleric took a set of skills of a different ilk. <br>
<br>
The old elf had been busy. He left sightings and clues in Shadow Haven, Freeport, Shar Vahl, Erudin. He was definitely no longer in Felwithe, and for this I was grateful. <br>
<br>
I met a satyr in the Plane of Knowledge who spoke briefly of him, an elf so old he showed signs of age, whose hands shook when he held things. <br>
<br>
My hands were shaking all the time now, except when I fought. My shaking hands were the reason I searched the old elf out. <br>
<br>
In the end I learned that the cleric had taken refuge in Firiona Vie, playing the part of a pilgrim. <br>
<br>
I went to him. <br>
<br>
II.<br>
<br>
He had a cabin in the outpost town, by the water. I waited until nightfall and then sat outside his window, watching him write. Quelarian. A physician, of sorts, a cleric of Tunare, though he often used methods of healing not proscribed by his goddess. <br>
<br>
Quelarian. The elf who had fought for two hundred years to find a cure for my family's strange illness. The one that had taken my mother and sister from me. <br>
<br>
The one I feared was slowly creeping into my veins. <br>
<br>
I wrapped myself in a shadowy spell and waited for him to step outside. <br>
<br>
III.<br>
<br>
I grew tired of waiting and decided, just prior to dawn, to simply knock. The old man had been at his desk reading all night anyway. <br>
<br>
He opened the door slowly, and before he could open the door fully I was upon him, pressing a cold, cold dagger against his neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hush, Quelarian. We need to talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man's face was a mask of terror and confusion; I let the spell that masked me fade away,and his face changed from terror to recognition. <br>
<br>
&quot;By Tunare's love,&quot; the old elf whispered. &quot;You're Selindria's boy.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lest@firionavie>Lest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/02 5:46:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=623.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> cure</span><hr size=1> IV. <br>
<br>
Quelarian and I drank elven wine as the sun crept over Kunark. The old man provided me answers, but not the kind I was looking for. <br>
<br>
&quot;I tried, you know,&quot; the elf muttered. &quot;To heal them. By the gods, it was the greatest challenge I'd ever known, this disease with no cure, this thing that crept into one family and slowly tore them apart. It ruined me eventually.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man nodded, sipped his wine, stared into his glass. <br>
<br>
&quot;When you're driven from the Elven lands, you come to appreciate this wine more.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can understand that.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man's eyes glassed over. He was looking at something decades or centuries gone. When he spoke, his words were little more than a whisper. <br>
<br>
&quot;They never understood. My fellow clerics. They never understood why I went to the others for answers. But they couldn't see. They couldn't understand how long I worked without answer.&quot;<br>
<br>
He drained his glass, placed it on a small table, sighed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who else would better understand death than the necromancers? Who else fully understands the darkness to a healer's light? They are monsters, yes, but rational monsters. There are great minds among the necromancers.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And you went to them to cure my mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. I went to them for answers. I betrayed my own people, but only because my own goddess could not provide me the tools to help your family.&quot; <br>
<br>
My hands were shaking violently; I did not even bother trying to hold my glass. <br>
<br>
&quot;And they could not help.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. They were as powerless as I. The followers of the Plaguebringer were enthralled at the idea of a cureless disease, but it was too clean an illness for them. Its victims died beautiful. And the others... I met a heretic who wanted to help. For selfish reasons. But... well, as you know...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not sick, boy. I can tell. It's not the same illness that runs in your family.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The old elf shrugged. <br>
<br>
&quot;There is a gnome you should speak with. I'll give you his name, and tell you where to find him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is he a necromancer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. Just a gnome. Nothing more, nothing less.&quot; <br>
<br>
We sat in silence for a moment, listening to the waves lap against the Lost Continent. <br>
<br>
&quot;Will you give me time to leave before you alert the paladins of my presence?&quot;<br>
<br>
I shook my head.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a bit of a lost one myself, Quelarian. No harm will come to you because of me.&quot; <br>
<br>
The old elf nodded, satisfied. He frightened me. I saw a sliver of myself in the fallen cleric, broken by his own fear, tormented by sins that were not sins. And I hated it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lest@firionavie>Lest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/02 12:20:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=623.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> cure</span><hr size=1> VI.<br>
<br>
I found the gnome in a deserted farmhouse in the Karanas. Not the most likely place to find a gnome, but then again, he was an uncommon gnome. <br>
<br>
The old elf had said the gnome was no spellcaster or healer, and I could tell from one glance that he had spoken the truth. But if I were going to hazard a guess, I would have thought the gnome was a monk. <br>
<br>
His face was peaceful and looked to be carved from a block of age-hardened wood. His head and face was completely bald, accentuating the tiny points to his ears. His eyes were the color of glacial ice. <br>
<br>
&quot;Been expecting you, Ravenfolly,&quot; he said from lotus position in the center of the barn. <br>
<br>
&quot;You wouldn't believe how often I hear that.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Spoke with Zebuxoruk a few days ago. He told me you'd be by, asked me to deliver a message.&quot;<br>
<br>
I raised an eyebrow. <br>
<br>
&quot;He did?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. He said, 'hello.'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just hello?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And, 'you can thank me later.' That's all.&quot; <br>
<br>
I smiled and walked slowly to the gnome, joined him in lotus position on the floor. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've heard you studied the poses,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ghost in Shadow Haven taught me. I'm not very good.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;No such thing as good or not good in the poses. The poses are all that matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
I nodded, closed my eyes. My head was humming again, that low distant not-pain. <br>
<br>
&quot;I understand you're not well.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot; <br>
<br>
We sat in silence together for a long time, only the sound of our breathing breaking the hush. Finally the gnome stood up, walked towards me, looked me in the eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;A wise man once told me, you only need three things in life to be happy: someone to love, something to do, and something to look forward to.&quot; <br>
<br>
I chuckled. <br>
<br>
&quot;One out of three isn't bad, is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome shook his head and returned to his seat. <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you the wise man, gnome?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay. I'm just a gnome. I walk, I listen. I take advice, and when I can I pass it on. I'm no wise man.&quot; <br>
<br>
We meditated together for a while. For the short time I was in the presence of this strange gnome, my hands had stopped shaking. Finally he broke the silence. <br>
<br>
&quot;You heed those words, boy. You want to be well again, you need to be happy, and to do that you'll need those three things. Without happiness, life is just waiting until your turn is over.&quot; <br>
<br>
I got up to leave. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you, gnome,&quot; I said, bowing. My hands had already begun to shake again. <br>
<br>
As I made my way to the door, he called out. <br>
<br>
&quot;I won't be here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't be here. When you need to talk to me again. I'll be gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you know I'll need to talk to you again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; the gnome chuckled.<br>
<br>
&quot;And how will I find you then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As the ravens. Ravens know everything. You just need to ask the right questions.&quot; <br>
<br>
I walked away into the tears of Karana, and I did not raise my hood against the rain.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=serinityoffv>Serinity of FV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Leviathan Paladin</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/02 7:30:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=623.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: cure</span><hr size=1> *blinks back tears* <br>
