<br>
I joined FV (and in fact EQ) less than a week ago and I have had a great impression of both FV and EQ so far. What little of Norrath I've encountered so far and the people I've met have been encouraging. <br>
<br>
The level of RP I've seen (at least in and around Neriak) has been much more than I expected.  I'm glad I chose FV and I'm glad that &quot;RP preferred&quot; as shown on the server list truly lives up to its name.<br>
<br>
As a matter of curiosity, I would like to find out what people's impresions and thoughts of PvP characters are in relation to RP.<br>
<br>
From my browsings so far, it seems like the majority of players abhor the PvP concept and see it as being repugnent to RP, whereas I view PvP as having its place in allowing full and meaningful RP to occur.<br>
<br>
Is PvP seen as only being the domain of power levelers and blood thirsty characters who take pleasure in PKing and looting? Or do people think that PvP has a place in RP?<br>
<br>

You can have conflict where the characters involved never physically harm each other, but to totally eliminate that element of conflict, especially in a violent world like Norrath, seems pretty inapprorpiate to me.  It's one reason I'm so looking forward to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com">Shadowbane</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
It's also one reason I don't really feel that EQ in general is a great platform for roleplay, there is really no solid support (game mechanics-wise) for PvP.  Though I am glad that Firiona Vie isn't a PvP server, because then that would be its main draw for a lot of people, not the roleplayers... and we'd have to deal with the griefers and everything else that comes along with PvP in a game that was never designed for PvP.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do though, don't hand in the tome of order and discord to the Priest of Discord.  It has implications beyond just being able to PK and get PKed yourself.  It means that you cannot heal or be healed by non-PKs, or cast any sort of beneficial spell on one another.  This drastically reduces your effectiveness in groups and makes you a liability to 99.999% of the population of the server.<br>
<br>
Also, you can't loot player characters on any server except on Rallos Zek, so that aspect of PvP here is a moot point.<br>
<br>
However, I do think that /duels, arena battles and the occassional guild war can have a role to play as far as enriching RP on this server. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

<br>
PvP on FV would be fine if there were a way to make sure it did not become a PvP griefer server where people come here only to PK, but there is no way to do that in EQ, so I'm content with duels/arena/guildwars. <br>
<br>
I think PvP, done with ooc respect and consideration, can add a great deal to roleplay. <br>

It wasn't until last Dec that someone told me there is no PvP in EQ except on particular servers or if you -want- PvP.<br>
<br>
Yes.... RP -could- be enhanced by PvP; however, a major element that is drawn by PvP generally has no desire whatsoever to RP and only wants to kill for killing's sake.  Those type view other players not as people (behind the character) but just as another mob, or maybe a more attractive mob since they can really hurt someone (emotionally) by killing them.  It is the same element who thinks it is perfectly acceptable to train on someone to get them killed so they lose XP.<br>
<br>
I know arena and /duel are not the best of components, but.... it does make a playing field.  If you have OOC agreements about what is and isn't allowed (benefial spells by others in /duel)  you can even simulate a conflict in a controlled setting.  <br>
<br>
My guild, Saga, does not /guildwar out of deferance to some of the people who don't want to go PvP since that mechanic makes the entire guild &quot;vulnerable&quot; no matter where they are or what they are doing.  Those of us who might want to set up PvP scenarios are still free to do so without hurting those who don't wish it.

<br>
We have very set rules for when we do guild wars, and all my people follow those rules. <br>
<br>
We've had several wars and you can talk to any of the guilds we fought, we had very good times.<br>
<br>
Court of crosswinds tried to retake Halas from us, then we attacked Oggok and they defended.<br>
<br>
Crusaders reborn met us in Gfay and we fought them all night.<br>
<br>
PvP puts alot of excitment into the game, if you set the rules ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Out firm rules are<br>
<br>
War Rules<br>
<br>
- One Kill.. then move on, try to assist in res'ing or recovery <br>
- No Corpse camping<br>
- No Running or fleeing from battle(my guild only )<br>
- Keep Honor and dont turn down challenges regardless of level (my guild only)<br>
- Keep it In Character<br>
- And show some respect.. <br>
- No cross guild help, as in healing<br>
- Dont cause exp lose, as in no attacking while they fight a mob, attack right after <br>
- No public bitching in shouts or to others for die'ing, remember its all in fun.<br>
<br>
And then we add rules as other guilds ask, sometimes making safe spots, or other rules.<br>
<br>
You can not loot people on this server no matter what, and I think alot of people dont know that.<br>
<br>
So we look forward to anyone who wants to do something different over a weekend or a couple days. <br>
<br>
Wars can be as long or short as you would like to set, we just like the fun of stiring up the server.<br>

Obviously nothing ever came of it though.<br>
<br>
I suggested that on FV almost every zone be given at least one 'arena' type area. Basically a place where you become PvP as long as you are there. These should be put in places that make sense for conflicts to occur. Along roads for people who play bandits (a stretch of the EC tunnel), in frequently contested camps, borders between two hostile groups (the river area between Painwheel and Erude).<br>
<br>
Arena zones should also be coded to bloc LOS for spells and ranged attacks; thus you can't heal someone from outside the arena.<br>
<br>
This would make things more convenient for groups who want to duke it out, and allow PKs a place to play a killer, but still allow those who hate PvP a way to avoid it.<br>

Sullon Zek could have been a nice environment for roleplay.<br>
<br>
I actually went there hoping there might be some roleplay, and that good, evil, and neutral would mean something.  I started a neutral dwarven cleric.  As soon as most of my companions levelled high enough to PvP, they wanted to go attack the elves.  Dwarves are neutral - why would we attack for no reason?  I told them I wanted to go to the border of Butcherblock/Greater Faydark and set up a toll booth to pass.<br>
<br>
There was stunned silence.  Then most of the neutral dwarves ran off to kill the elves just because they could.  Another person complimented my idea, but told me that would never work on Sullon Zek.  I sighed and agreed.<br>
<br>
I realized the goods were outnumbered, so I rerolled as a good, and there I am in Halas.  I listened to the shouts of surprised neutrals being attacked by goods, and the goods replied there were no goods on Sullon Zek, only three evil teams.<br>
<br>
They were right.<br>
<br>
Tallon Zek is (was) a four team PvP server, but mostly divided along the light/dark lines.  Some people would form guilds including all four teams and dominate the high end of the game - completely against the spirit of the server.<br>
<br>
Why did these things happen?<br>
<br>
Because the desire to win will creep over a desire to compete, or even to play fair or nice.  Even in places where intentions are good, this happens.  Remember the instances where a group attacks the NPCs of an opposing city, and ends up getting trained?  (Felwithe, Ak'Anon, Neriak)  This happened because someone really really needed to &quot;win&quot;, not for roleplaying reasons.  There is nothing roleplaying about stabbing your own guard to get his attention.<br>
<br>
Yes, PvP *could* add a *huge* amount of flavor to the roleplaying scene.  It might actually make the conflicts between the races seem real to the people who don't get enough of a sense of that from the established game background and history.  The problem for me is my observations have proven to me that PvP is used to further a desire to win and dominate, and much less for roleplaying reasons, which tend to be cast aside.)) <p>Baroness Titaisia Lightheart<BR>
