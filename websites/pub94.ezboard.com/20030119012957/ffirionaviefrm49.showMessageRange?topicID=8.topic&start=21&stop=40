One doesn't know that in real life, and one certainly doesn't know it in EverQuest.  One could quite possibly offend someone without knowing it.<br>

I don't have to give people the benefit of the doubt on this one.  If they want to make monkeys of themselves in front of me...  they're free to do so.  I will call them on it--I think that's my obligation.  I'm not calling for the term to be &quot;censored&quot;, but don't run around using it perjoratively and then cry foul when I call you on it, or cry foul when I say, &quot;Gee, I really don't feel like grouping with you again.  I think I've got some toenails to watch grow&quot;.<br>

It's not &quot;PC&quot; to challenge someone on the stuff that's coming out of their mouths.  It's just freedom of speech.  They have the right to say it, but I have the right to respond, and I have the absolute right to think poorly of someone because of the things they say.  That's life, not political correctness.<br>

<br>
Yeah, that's one of those things.<br>
<br>
To some people, there's a degree of empowerment that goes along with taking one of the most insulting words someone can use against you, and using it yourself as a non-insulting phrase.<br>
<br>
I personally am not fond of keeping the word in use.  I wouldn't use it myself.<br>
<br>
They would likely get insulted if you used it because there's some feeling that you have no reason to use that word.  You're not black, and thereby have no reason to throw it back in the face of your oppressors by using it, etc.<br>

<br>
   I think the phrase &quot;Such n such is gay&quot; is offensive.  It implies that there's something wrong with being gay, and thereby something wrong with whatever they're calling gay.  I would love to go through life and never hear it again.<br>
<br>
   A lot of people use that phrase w/o giving consideration to how it could be insulting.  Between jumping on them for using an offensive phrase and calling them a homophobe, and explaining how that phrase could be read offensively and encouraging them not to use it anymore, I choose the latter (and I've seen people do the former).<br>
<br>
   &quot;Fag&quot; on the other hand is generally a direct insult.  Someone can't really use it and not know it's insulting (they're usually going for the insult).  I'd be a lot less tolerant if I heard someone using this one.<br>
<br>
   Make more sense?<br>
<br>
- Syll<br>
<br>
PS: The reasoning behind it is that I think some people are gonna change, and some people aren't.  If you're talkin to someone who has the potential of changing their behaviour to something less offensive, and you respond with something they could perceive as an attack, it puts them on the defensive and you're not gonna get anywhere.  If you give them the info they need to come to a nice conclusion, and don't go passing judgement on their personal character, they're much more likely to come to a decision about the use of that phrase that you like. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A> at: 8/1/02 8:56:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1048<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 9:01:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is so str8!</span><hr size=1> Thing is, maybe one person doesn't think of it as meaning anything other than stupid... but then some kid hears someone really is gay, and they think stupid, right away.

Let's say for sake of argument that in RL Apep is a raging homophobe (I don't think he is, but we'll use that for this argument).  Have his actions as a board mod been unfair in that regard?  Have homophobic insults been sneaking by his patented &lt;APEP EDIT&gt;s while other ones are removed?  Has he been sending mean anonymous e-mails to Lasgalen?<br>

<br>
Actually, it doesn't imply that there is anything wrong with being homosexual.  In fact...maybe it doesn't dawn on some people, but words can have more than one meaning.....  <br>
<br>
in fact, the word gay can have a few different meanings.<br>
<br>
1. happy<br>
2. homosexual<br>
3. slang<br>
<br>
you need to look at the context of the word.<br>
<br>
Some people have unique choices of words.  If everyone talked the same, the world would be a boring place.  Maybe some people say gay instead of &quot;sucks&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.  Sure it may not look intelligent to you. Personally, i dont go around saying &quot;that's gay&quot;, but i *LIKE* people thinking i'm dumb and a loser <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I like to say peaches and cream or just peachy instead of happy.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
...i bet if someone wrote a rant saying that they didn't like it when people said &quot;jesus!&quot; when something bad happened (like say they stubbed ther toe, or something), you'd rant that they were dumb and over-reacting.  Maybe they weren't really dissing on you for being christian.  (i have a sinking suspicion that they aren't dissing on my religion...i may think it's a negative use of the word, but i realize that they aren't doing anything to offend me, so why worry about it? who cares? it's one of those trivial things.)<br>
<br>
anyway, they aren't trying to diss you, it's just an expression...the sooner people quit focusing on stuff like this and start trying to get people to quit using &quot;PST&quot;, the world will be a better place *grins* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://eo.yifan.net/users/j/extra/woos.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 899<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 9:17:45 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is so str8!</span><hr size=1> The Los Angles N*ggers.

Man, by your unwillingness to 'Give them the Benefit of the doubt', you are expressing the same Intolerance that you seem to think he was espressing towards you Robin. Thus, you are being the same as he is, meaning you are the Monkey. Funny how that works out..<br>
<br>
Or.<br>
<br>
I use that term from time to time. I ain't got nothing against Homosexuals. What you do in the bedroom is your business.. I've acually RPed a Bi male Charrie or two a LONG time ago. Meaning that I'm making a 'Monkey' of myself. Monkey is a term used by people way back in the day to down the 'Black' man. Thats a Derogaty Term. I'm offended. By offending me, you've completed the circle and just done the exact same thing I have done. Thus, you would be the Monkey.<br>
<br>
Yeah. I'm having fun with this. I love PC, I can fuck with this kinda thing all day.<br>
<br>
Seriously,<br>
Two way street man. All it takes is a private tell, an E-Mail. Thats respectable. Their's no need to post a rant about it.<br>
<br>
Getting all rilled up for no reason like this isn't needed, and in fact, its just really gay. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A>

Let me be clear about my position.  If you want to say &quot;that's gay&quot; to mean &quot;that's dumb&quot;, fine.  But don't expect me to continue to respect you afterwards. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

<br>
I understand that it's offensive to you, Las. I don't use it. But Kerridwynn brought up another word...<br>
<br>
Phat. <br>
<br>
One gets ripped to shreds when using a word the gay/lesbian/bi community finds offensive....but, in the US,anyway, you can see any number of those same people doing the ripping to shreds, talking about someone's fat ass, often within hearing range.<br>
<br>
I understand tolerance, but like Shin said, it's a two way street.<br>
<br>
And I won't say they are just words, because while they are...they can still be hurtful.<br>
<br>
Think about that, all of you, the next time you point out an obese person to make fun of them, or the next time you call your buddy a retard.<br>

<br>
Yesterday, we had an Image removed from the Boards because of Nudity, rightfully so. Quite franky, it displayed a Halfelven female topless, edited in Nipples. Was a bit much.<br>
Removed and rightfully so.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that we have many LDS and other highly religious people about. Do you think that a picture depicting a 'Devil' and a 'Angel' is approiate?<br>
<br>
However, you see here an Image displaying pratically the same amount of Nudity. It should not allowed to be, who knows who might get offended out there. And we don't want that, unless you wish to continue the Double Standard and keep it about.. meaning its really up to you.<br>

<br>
bigotry: &quot;The attitude, state of mind, or behavior characteristic of a bigot; intolerance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Read that.  When someone says &quot;that's gay&quot;, they aren't showing you any intolerance.  In fact, by taking offense, i'd argue that you are showing intolerance by not acknowledging a completely seperate meaning of the word.  Sorry, but at least in my town (which happens to have a very high percentage of the homosexual population of the state, by the way), when people say something is gay, they aren't dissing homosexuals.  Usually if they say &quot;fag&quot;, they are, so maybe argue about that word.  Gay is a term used to describe a circumstance, or an object...  <p><img src=http://eo.yifan.net/users/j/extra/woos.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 901<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 9:53:08 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is so str8!</span><hr size=1> Wow.
