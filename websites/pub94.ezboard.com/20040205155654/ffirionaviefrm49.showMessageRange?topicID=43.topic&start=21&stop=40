These characters have no sense of our RP server, they're simply there to farm no drop, be abnoxious and eventually exxy out when they get bored.  Probably not all of them but given the fact they're obviously easy mode transients they'll get bored quickly and so don't really care as much about our server or our rules because quite frankly the first thing they did on our server was break the rules right.<br>

Buying PP or trading sigs for PP is not quite so annoying to me because its transparent.  Still annoying and in the former against the EULA but not as annoying<br>

Back in the day, it was worth opposing e-bay. But now it's too late in my opinion. The floodgates weren't closed in time.<br>
<br>
That's not to say that e-bay should be supported, per se, but seriously labelling a whole guild &quot;e-bay&quot; because some of the people in it have used e-bay is stoopid.<br>
<br>
Like I said, every guild has / had people who at some point bought or sold characters for cash.<br>
<br>
And besides which, I know a few people who've used e-bay who are actually really nice. There's a difference between the people that use e-bay for convenience, and hence are just like you and me deep down, and those who use it for profit /point Exxy.<br>

<br>
This game isn't real life.  Its entertainment.  It's only entertainment.  If somebody is doing something in game that ruins the way you enjoy the game do not associate with them.  If somebody bought their character or bought items or in game money using real money or trade it doesn't hurt you one bit.  The use of commerce does not effect your pocket book nor your enjoyment of the game.  It effects only the parties involved in that transaction, not you.  Ultimately its none of your business if somebody sold or gave their account away.  I know because I have given max level accounts and other accounts away in the game I played before this.  Hell I have even been sent IM over AOLIM saying &quot;Hey girl I just waxed your ass on _insert_game_here_ it was fun to kill your bitch ass&quot;  and you know what I laughed about it.  I still think its funny that my friend enjoyed the kill.  You know why?  <br>
<br>
ITS ONLY A FRIGGIN GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Ohh Zsu did not ebay the account because I know the person who plays Zsu now and the account was given.  So if your going to call somebody an Ebay you better make damn sure that E-bay or playerauctions or any other auction sight was involved before you start throwing that word around.  Hell better yet how about you mind your own business and spend time sniffing your own ass before you start sniffing other peoples asses.<br>
<br>
Step away from the keyboard.  Yes I know its hard but trust me your going to thank me for this later.  Look out the window.  Is it windy? Is it cold? Is it raining?  Grab your coat if yes was the answer to any of those questions.  If yes was the answer to the third question grab an umbrella.  <br>
<br>
Now here is the hard part.  You must now find a mode of transportation. Do you have a car?  Do you have real friends that you can like physically see and touch?  If so, I suggest you go drive in your car or better yet if you have a real life friend call them up.  Now go with your friend or alone and do something.  I suggest seeing a movie, going out to eat, some light shopping, if you have the cash, or window shopping if you don't.  <br>
<br>
Once you have done this if its a late hour you might want to go like dancing, or out to a club.  If your drinking age, wherever you live, you might want to get a beer or a cocktail sit down and talk to the people around you.  Meet new people!  I highly recommend this.  <br>
<br>
If all things go well you may meet somebody that makes you feel kinda funny in your private parts.  If things go well they will invite you over to their place. This is what we want. You go with them to their place and they are going to make you feel things that you never felt before.  These are good feelings.  Now go do this NOW!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=larraquemeleagrance>Larraque Meleagrance</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Radical Dreamer</span><br>  Posts: 1443<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/1/03 7:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebay Guilds (the post that will give you fuckers a clue)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While I am sure this is going to turn into a horrific flame, he does have a very good point.

This seems just going to far. There are plenty of people on FV that never come here (are they smarter then us?) that may have well bought something off Boog and Shanana.<br>
<br>
If you got to a pawn shop and buy something (And trust me, you can get some great deals for good stuff), and it turns out to be stolen, you don't get arrested. <br>
<br>
I don't buy from them because thier prices are outragous. I also don't think everything the sell is from purchased toons that are stripped. I wouldn't be surprised if they are buying in the bazaar as well, any high end items and marking them up. <br>
<br>
Basically, trying to put a strangle hold on any high end items that come into the game, since there often tends to be less of those. Now, what they do with all the plat, if they are selling items, that's a different story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stavehamvaliant@firionavie>StavehamValiant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/1/03 8:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebay Guilds (the post that will give you fuckers a clue)</span><hr size=1> Nidge, the person selling plat for real life money is making a prophit off the game.

The person making sigs for plat is providing a service out of game, that is a natural extention of the game, and is not prophiting from it in real life. It's similar to as if you pay someone plat to make you some armor. He is selling his services and talent, which Sony does not own, for ingame plat, and makes no prophit off it.<br>

Right, he said he didn't eBay it, he sold it for money. There was a huge thread on this some time ago when two players announced that thier characters where not longer being run by them, that they had sold them.<br>
<br>
If by give you mean it like this &quot;If you GIVE me X amount of money, I will GIVE you my EQ account&quot; then yes, he did give his account to someone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=larraquemeleagrance>Larraque Meleagrance</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Radical Dreamer</span><br>  Posts: 1444<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/1/03 8:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ebay Guilds (the post that will give you fuckers a clue)</span><hr size=1> I didn't ebay<br>

As for you not liking the farewells ... well I guess thats your decision. I wanted to say goodbye and start a new life here as a new character. For all the people that are upset at me selling I know I have a few that realize that as a friend I will still be here and thats all that matters to them.<br>

If this ruined my reputation (as if I really had one ... I wasn't THAT well known) then I guess its ruined. If people have bad thoughts about me I sure won't lose any sleep over it.<br>

As for Ancient Darkness, I will go on the record as being wrong about thinking any such thoughts of ebahness. I think it was just residue from the Demented merger. Even then I was only aware of the fact because of one member, Gore.<br>

Seriously, I think selling accounts and purchasing them for money is something really bad. <br>
Even though there might be some circumstances where you can justify it (for example if you sell your account because you are starving), but it still remains something bad! In that case you are just doing something bad, to avoid even greater hardships.<br>
Or if you have a good friend who is doing it. Just that he is your &quot;friend&quot; doesn't make his actions better!<br>
<br>
And don't think it's just little money. Characters 50+ are sold for several hundred dollars, even if stripped off completely! <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"><br>

Ebon Storm has unoriginal owners too.<br>
<br>
my friend bought the original disc and paid for 6 months of service.  At his peak he had a level 3 erudite shadowknight with some cloth arms and a rusty sword.  I then took over the account as he had no interest in playing.   I admit it I moved over the 1.5 plat (lucky bastard scored 2 cracked staffs earily on) and rusty sword and armor to my first character. <br>
