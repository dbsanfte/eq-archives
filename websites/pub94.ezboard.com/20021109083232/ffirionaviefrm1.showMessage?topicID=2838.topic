<br>
I played a Rogue into the Tier 2 game on another server (we were up to NToV and Velious Kings level) and usually when I gained aggro for any length of time I would die. I started to notice this around 48 or so in Karnor's castle. Before, I could take a bit of pounding and still be ok, but at around 48, the mobs start to hit so fast and hard that you will drain the cleric's mana always having to heal you.<br>
<br>
Now, this isn't a 100% truth, it is possible for a Rogue to tank just like it's possible for a Rogue to solo, it's just not as practical as fulfilling your role as a sneaky, attacking from shadows damage dealer who tries to not attract attention. I would think that in Sebilis, a tanking rogue would die. The cleric couldn't heal you fast enough when you pull 3 frogs before the chanter could mez them all unless you had extreme high end +AC and +HP gear.<br>
<br>
Now about the shield - you would be decreasing your damage output by about 2/3 by tanking anyways (no backstabs and no offhand if you use a shield) so your killing would be rather slow and you would be a constant drain and irritation on the Cleric (Superior Heal and Celest Heal isn't quite enough and CHeal is overkill). The extra 25AC wouldn't help you get hit that much less to really make a difference when things are quadding for 100+ a hit.<br>
<br>
These are just my experiences - the Bladestopper is a Cleric and Shaman shield IMHO. Pallies and SK could use it also, but due to the high availability of great ratio 2hs weapons out there for a good price, I would think they would rather go 2h than 1h+shield with a few exceptions.<br>

<br>
I think the groups that Siffo is tanking for are all lower level than he is, so he won't be fighting level 47 or 48 mobs.  I am not sure, but I think in the groups he is in, he would most likely have a druid as a healer.<br>
<br>
I think the kind of meanies he is looking at fighting is probably things like Great Divide giants, and things like that.  He doesn't want to be tank in his level range, but he can probably manage to take hits better than a level 34 or so ranger he might be fighting with.  I think that is the situation he is in.  He will probably be keeping aggro most of the time, anyway, I think.  (Correct me if I am wrong, Siffo?)<br>
<br>
In that context, with him fighting less powerful meanies and tanking for his weaker groupmates, would the shield save the druid healer any mana, or would the longer fights (from not stabbing, most likely from the front, with both weapons) use up any benefit of the extra armor?<br>

<br>
As she said these are lower level mobs, many of them I could probably solo my self. I have to be able to absorb a lot of punishment but still use evade and backstab.<br>
<br>
My choices are.<br>
<br>
Use my equipment as is. In which case after asecond into the battle the only way to try and loose aggro so I can BS is to evade and move out of range of the mob and even then they often turn right back to me when I get close.<br>
<br>
I could remove my SCHW and bump my AC with better gauntlets this would lower my aggro a bit and give me a slight increase in AC (about 5points I think) but my BS will also be much slower loosing a lot of DPS.<br>
<br>
Or I could carry a really good shield lossing my off hand weapon (Including BS in the equation lets say I loose 25% of my DPS output at most) I am still hasted so my BS is fast, I raise my AC significantly(AC 25 for the shield in question that is better than my best piece of armor) I have lowered my aggro some so hopefully I can evade and use my BS each time for high damage strike (BS is around 50% of my damge out put or more I think) .<br>
<br>
All and all it looks like the shield would be the way to go for these lower level groups where I am tanking. I don't know this for a fact and I haven't met any one who has tried it so there is no impirical evidence. I guess I will just have to try it and find out. Like I said in that other post the Bladestopper shield would have been a good test for this experiment. OH well I will try it.<br>

I guess it would also depent on the makeup of your group. If you have a nuke heavy group where things die fast but you have occasional med breaks, you only will be tanking the mob briefly so your DPS makes less of a difference. In that case I would think a shield would be more of a help. If the fights last longer - maybe you are letting DOTs work or there are some secondary melees fighting like lower level Rangers or Shamans I think the offhand weapon would be better because it would mitigate damage by ending combat sooner.<br>
If you have decent equipment at your level, you will actually have a hard time avoiding aggro even with a warrior in your party. At 50 I was using a Trak Tooth in mainhand and a Locustlure in offhand with a FBSS. In Karnor's, unless the WAR had some low delay weapons and taunted constantly, Drolvargs would eventually turn to me and I would have to trust in evade. With a group of lower level melee, you might be able to time an evade/backstab combo just right. But you would have to be quick with the backstab because even if evade worked, it would turn back to you after your next hit or 2. So basically, I'm not sure - it would be more based on the particular situation and group makeup. The one thing I do know is that after 40, I hated being hit as a Rogue, then after 45 it started to become a problem if I attracted aggro, at my low 50s it often became deadly if I couldn't get rid of it and in mid 50's raids I would die if I attracted aggro for more than a couple seconds.<br>

<br>
SCHW is silver chitin hand wraps - haste gloves from Velks, 22% haste, 10AC , some stats and save. Siffo, you can try and get Rohal's gaunts instead, 25AC, to gain 15AC and lose the haste, but I hate to lose haste <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'd rather haste and evade, and if needed turn attack off to control the aggro the way you want it.<br>
<br>
Vulrath, you were using two very high speed weapons, a slow proc, and a haste belt - I'm not surprised you were pulling aggro. Putting a nice slow non proccing weapon in off hand, with a good ratio, will get you more damage and less aggro. <br>
<br>
Siffo, backstab is nowhere near 50% of your damage output. Not until after 55 when you get double backstab. At your levels, from my parsing, you are at about 25-33% from backstab, depending on how much you get to see the back. When you tank, it's a lot less than that. 25AC, even if it's better than any single piece you have, is not that much. What's your AC now ? 700+ ? it's not a huge difference, really. And you'll be losing a lot of damage potential. That is probably why no-one tries it any more - I'm sure  that at one time someone did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Bippin Tenderfoot <BR>

Even when the MT is closer to his level.  I think the idea of putting a shield in the offhand is to purposely reduce DPS so he can do an evade, get a backstab in, and get aggro back when tanking.  That way he still gets the main hand DPS and the backstab DPS, just losing offhand DPS.  Right now by not being able to shrug off aggro long enough to BS, he is losing BS DPS while keeping offhand DPS. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
One, rogues can tank at high level, in exp groups.  I do it plenty in velks and sebilis.  We need good gear for it, but if we have the gear, we dish out better taunt than warriors.  That said, a shield is brutal to our damage output.  Assuming roughly equivilent on and offhand weapons, a rogue does about 30% of their damage offhand, when backstab is not available.  Also, if you evade off the agro, lacking an offhander will make it hard to get it back.<br>
<br>
So lose the shield, you don't want it.  Assuming 20% of your damage output is backstab (pre 55 and without a high damage mainhander that's quite likely) and 30% of the remaining 80 is offhand, you lose nearly 50% of your damage output by tanking with a shield.  Remember, you can't bash.  BAD IDEA.  <br>
<br>
If you want to tank, here's how to do it.<br>
<br>
Get fast weapons.  Traks tooth comes to mind.  That will raise your mainhand damage output when not backstabbing.  Locusluster and Shadowrager are amazing tank weapons for rogues.  Cresent Blades of Luclin too.  That will keep taunt firmly on you and allow you to do respectable damage, on par with warriors. (ew)<br>
<br>
Now for your armour.  Keep the haste, you want that.  But there's some nice tank gear available for rogues.  Ravenscale Belt has 9 ac 25 hp and 5 sta, making it nice for the purpose.  Axgoreth's Belt of defense is wonderful too, and not too expensive.  Crystal Chitin gear is also high ac with some stats.  And get those hitponts up, you need all you can get.  Bracer of Fortitude and Bracer of Quickness will help you tank, though I prefer Might to Quickness.  If this gear sounds too expensive to you, well, just remember you're not built to tank, so you need good gear to do the job right.  Getting an 8th Coldain ring will also help.  If you need AC on your weapons try a Longsword of Ethereal Energy.  But for god's sake don't get a shield.<br>
<br>
With all this said, a rogue is not really a tank.  You have to be equiped like crazy to do it right.  If you can't find a tank to work with, try an enchanter, them chainstunning works fine.  Bards, necros, and shadowknights fearing also works.  Heck, you can try instill doubt a bit. <br>
<br>
But not a shield.<br>

Mithlin actualy said what I am trying to say. I can't get rid of aggro most of the time. I have spent a lot of time and plat rigging myself to do double duty (light tank or Rogue) so I kinda have best of both words and I am trying to fine tune it.<br>

Like I said I am well set up to tank for lower level mobs or even moderate soloing but I still like to experiment with other combinations.<br>
<br>
I appreciate all the help you have given me, I will consider it strongly. I may need to experiment (mainly cause I'm stubborn) but you are probaly right a good shild won't help but who knows I am finding a lot of the old ideas don't hold as true with all the new equipment available now. <br>

Your weapons are quite nice, but nothing completely absurd... so let's see what can be done.<br>
<br>
One, get a slower weapon offhand.  Centi Longsword, Longsword of Ethereal Energy, something slow.  You'll do the same damage but with less taunt.<br>
<br>
If your weapons are procing, that's a bad thing... procs make for extra taunt.<br>
<br>
Stay back, at the edge of melee range, and make sure your tank gets closer.  Proximity agro is your friend.<br>
<br>
Pickpocket (on failure), beg, instill doubt, and disarm all build taunt, so be careful there.<br>
<br>
Evade evade evade.  <br>
<br>
That's pretty much all I can say, the rest is experience.  But you should be able to hold your agro just under that of the main tank, so you can take it when needed from the cleric/enchanter/wizard/whatever.<br>

<br>
Also, some degree of tanking is necessary to keep your defensive skills up, you should try to cap them every level.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree, you realy should'nt be getting agro with a warrior in the group who is near your level, assuming the warrior is not the problem, lets look at causes.<br>
<br>
Is your hide skill maxxed for level ?  If not, fix that, its the single best thing you can do for evade.<br>
<br>
Are evades getting interrupted ?  Make sure you stand dead still and time the evade with the MOBs strikes, sometimes you have to be patient and take a little bit of a beating.  Also if you are using an evade macro with other skills in it, lose them.  Alot of rogues put several doability commands in an evade macro and each one adds just a little delay which can cause it to be interrupted.  <br>
<br>
Fight at maximum melee range and train your tanks to stand right in the monster's face, proximity helps agro on alot of monsters.  (Training groups to be rogue friendly is something you just have to get used to).<br>
<br>
Anyway, yes I do have a character on FV, yes I do try to roleplay when I can and enjoy it, so I feel like I can comment on this board =b<br>

<br>
I don't have a tank or I wouldn'd need to be tanking.<br>
<br>
We are fighting lower level mobs many of them I could solo but I don't want to have horrible long down times either while every one waits for me to gain back the much higher number of hit points than they have to heal.<br>
<br>
The problem is as Mith said I build up such a massive aggro load I can't throw it off properly a lot of times to get in a Backstab I often have to back way out of aggro range while in evade and still they often turn back to me when I get colse.<br>
<br>
What I am tring to do is keep my aggro border line so I can evade have the mob turn away I can backstab and regain aggro so the other lower members dont get mauled much.<br>
<br>
My idea was to increase my AC and loose a little DPS  whether or not it would work I have no idea. It seems that I can't explain very well because nobody seems to look at it the way I am describing it. <br>
<br>
I keep getting suggestions to get a tank : I can't or I would. <br>
<br>
That if I am tanking I should want aggro: I do but I want to loose it so I can baskstab which gets it right back but I can't loose it cause I get so much.<br>
<br>
I typicaly have some rogues and a ranger maybe a druid all usualy a fair number of levels lower than I am. What I need to do is be able to hold aggro and absorb damage but have my evades effective so I can get in backstabs.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1464<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/5/02 8:54:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2838.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tanky rogues</span><hr size=1> Siffo... on evasion success you are automatically put between the highest agro and second highest agro people other than yourself, so you can still evade and stab with or without your shield... but with the shield you will do far less damage, which is less helpful to you than the AC increase.  <br>
<br>
Believe me, I solo and tank at times.  You don't want a shield.  Maybe a high AC weapon, but not a sheild.<br>

<br>
I'm reasonably sure that evade is based on the hide skill or that hide skill plays a role in successful evades  However I've been wrong in the past and &quot;reasonably sure&quot; is by no means certain that there is a direct tie.  Lets say I feel safe operating under the assumption but 66 percent sounds about right as well.  Although at times I'd debate that after failing 7 in a row and doing some involuntary tanking.  <br>
<br>
Rememeber at low levels it was possible to &quot;fail&quot; a hide and still see a scowls con even when hidden ?  I really do think evade does a skill check on the hide skill,  In part it comes down to thats what I was told when I was &quot;growing up&quot; and I've never seen anything either posted or in game to make me doubt it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not going to claim to be &quot;all knowing&quot; because I certainly am not :-) <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11990"><img src ="http://acropolis2.premiumchat.com/Sakharra/Saksig2.jpg"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usakharra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sakharra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/7/02 2:30:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2838.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tanky rogues</span><hr size=1> Oh Siffo, I apologize and I did indeed misunderstand the question early on.<br>
<br>
Lowering your DPS will help fine tune agro but its always going to be a very careful balancing act.  You could even got to a slasher or basher mainhand and swap in a piercer to backstab but the DPS drop there may be so extreme you cant keep agro when you want it.  I'd do that before I went piercer and sheild however.  Small gains in AC wont help much because rogues just dont work like that, your always going to get hit relatively hard compared to a true tanking class.<br>
<br>
Also here is something that was HARD for me to understand until Gayana rammed it through my thick blue skull in alot of duos.  It may be best just to let whoever you are partnered with hold agro so long as its not a &quot;robe&quot; caster.  I always looked at the shaman as a healer who needed to med, but with her &quot;tanking&quot; for me we were far more efficient that we were with me tanking.  <br>
<br>
Do you hunt with anyone who can root ?  If so then root is perhaps the best agro control in the game as it mostly nullifies the hate list.   Under melee it will have to be recast alot but it may be the solution you need.<br>

<br>
When most mobs are rooted, they work off proximity agro.  Basically they hit whoever is closest and still on their hate list.  Root the mob, step in very close when you want agro, step back far away when you don't.  Keep that mob perma rooted.  Just make sure your groupmates are doing the same thing...does no good for you to be bouncing back and forth if half your group is stepping right on the mob's toes the entire fight.<br>

<br>
You say a 25AC shield is better than any piece you have?  You need to get forhals gauntlets, 25ac.  For haste, decent AC and good stats get the grimling skullcracker belt.  I think that combo is more effective.  You give up maybe 7 percent haste but you get alot more AC.  If you are taking alot of hits you want the best AC you can get.  It will help alot more than that 7 percent haste on just you.  Factor in the total amount of dmg from your whole group and you are giving up very little dmg output.  Getting better AC will make you avoid more hits and take less dmg overall.<br>
<br>
For the price you can get for your SCHW you can pick up the grimling belt and the forhals gauntlets and still have some coin left over for some food and drink.<br>
<br>
Then again as a bard haste equip does not mean nearly as much to me, I carry my main haste in my songs so YMMV.<br>

Rogues exist for damage output.  That is, first and formost, your job.  Having someone root was a good suggestion though.<br>

But always get the best haste and weapons you can.<br>

<br>
Depending on exactly HOW much agro you build up.<br>
<br>
Often proximity itself is enough without root.  If you can have the person you want to agro on to step in close to the MOB, a successful evade will probabily flip it, then backstabs will flip it back on you.<br>
<br>
Make sure your designated punching bag knows to step back after you get your stabs in to make sure agro transfers properly.  <br>
<br>
Again, root is the most sure way here but root tends not to hold long under heavy agro.<br>

Probably the best thing is to see whether you can borrow someone's shield to try it out... <br>
