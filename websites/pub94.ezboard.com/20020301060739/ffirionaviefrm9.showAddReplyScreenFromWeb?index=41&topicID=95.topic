Let me reiterate.  He was not a General in the war.  He was however the sole survivor of an attack and stood up for German beliefs.  He told the people that they were not the trash the world had them painted as and that they were militarily as strong as any other nation.  I don't know about you but in that I see a war hero of the people.  They do not have to be the commander of a great victory they have to be a symbol to the people and that's what he was.<br>
<br>
2.)  Funny you should check out some literature about Hitler.  While debated there are a LOT of historians that will says his father was Jewish.<br>
<br>
3.)  Didn't I say he wrote while in prison?  So no disagreement here.  Sorry I did not give you the name of it as it is his only major work of literature I figure you would know that already if you were reading it.  He also read about Karl Marx while in there.<br>
<br>
4.)  Germans literally got screwed in the Treaty of Versailles.  France was the major instigator followed a bit by England and the US was powerless to intervene for one reason.  Wilson brought home the troops.  I am not for leaving troops overseas when there is no need but let it finish before you remove them.  To symbolize what France thought of the US is in their president saying something of the sort God gave us the 10 commandments and we have broken all of them Wilson gives us 14 let us see.<br>
<br>
5.)  Hitler asked for power and it was given to him.  Whatever the man asked for he got from the German people.  He knew how to motivate them and get them to support him.  If they thought they could control him well I guess they screwed up huh?  What my point was it wasn't the hostile takeover that he had tried the first time.<br>
<br>
You make me laugh.  You sound as though I think what happened to the Jews is right?  No I wasn't defending their hatred I am just telling you why.  Yes a lot of Jews were poor so were others.  You have heard the phrase, Don't let the JEW you haven't you?  Yes there was a lot of scapegoating going on and some of it even happened in the times right after the Roman era.  But to say they were all poor good honest people is a load of crap.  Maybe I am too pessimistic but then again maybe you shouldn't glorify them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now to the other argument going on here.<br>
/cheer McStump.  Thank god someone else said it I would not have been as nice.  <br>
<br>
Call me pyscho but here is my plan to reduce racism.  Ill give a few major points.<br>
<br>
1.)  Take down all race specific groups.  NAACP is probabaly the biggest instigator of racism in America today.  AA is one of the biggest failures due to the aftermath of it.  Hell people are scared of highering a white or a minority even if the white has higher credentials solely because they might get sued. <br>
<br>
2.) Drop the African from African-American.  Am I running around claiming to be a Spanish-American.  Now I am fine being an American since I an the past how many generations have been American.  Not saying discard your culture but don't expect black history month when blacks and whites have the same history.<br>
<br>
3.)  Try and understand racism will not fade.  How shall I say turn the other cheek.  I see people that are not racist yet get into an argument with a minority and it gets turned into a racial argument.  If someone gets racist with you live with it.  I have taken plenty from living in a Mexican-American neighborhood.  People did not want me there but I refrained from talking about the &quot;wet backs&quot; to my white friends or to my Mexican friends.  Let it die out somewhere.<br>
<br>
4.)  Forget slavery.  This I need money because before the civil war happened my great^10 grandparents were slaves is a bunch of crap.  I am sorry if some members of my family ever held slaves but as far as I ever traced back they didn't for one reason:  They were too damn poor.  To say that you should get special treatment over those of white background will need to the non-educated or passionate white to harbor a racism towards you.  Hence getting rid of NAACP.<br>
<br>
In closing for anyone arguing with this point I just have one question.  Would you be able the NAAWP or the White American Scholarship fund?  Let the racism dwindly to nothing somewhere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/01 5:50:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> Historians who say that Hitler was part Jewish are simply wrong.<br>
<br>
Just because there are sayings about people doesn't make them true. Are all stereotypes true just because there are fools who run around spouting them off? I'm a mutt but mainly Irish and Scottish, does that mean I am a penny-pinching drunk to you? Let me just give you a slight little clue, most of the Jews who could afford to escape the Nazi's did so. It wasn't very many. Yes, there are bad people in every culture, and I did not accuse you of saying what was done to them was right, but your posts seem to imply that Hitler was just a good ole boy sent down the wrong path, and that well, hey, nobody likes Jews anyway, cause some of them had money. That's screwed up.<br>
<br>
Yeah, the Germans got screwed in the Treaty of Versailles, but they had just lost the bloodiest war in human history, I don't know what they expected would happen.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zsuzsanadracul>Zsuzsana Dracul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/01 10:47:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> Well usually historians try to base what they say on historical data so your argument is as simple as saying just because scientists tell us gravity is the cause of the earth's rotation are they right?  Okay get real man it is debated but there are historical lineages they point to.  Let's get off the point it was a very minor detail of everything you criticized me about.<br>
<br>
As for the Jew's with money getting out of Germany that is simply not the case.  Like you said the Jewish people had been treated well by Germany and did not fear that would change.  Even when people started getting taken away they assumed they had broken laws or whatnot and did not want to be taken away.  This is the majority opinion of not historians, but the speakers that lived through the Holocaust have recounted.<br>
<br>
My post was stating why the Germans gave him power.  To them he was the fix to all their problems.  And in reply to the ending statement what did they expect?  They expected the 14 points as they were notified beforehand that was the basis for the treaty.  The treaty held few of the 14 points as Wilson was an idealist and I really think he meant well it is just his action of not being able to enforce it that I really disagree with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/01 12:48:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> I would suggest the dropping of African American too, and calling yourself African instead.<br>

<br>
The forget slavery argument is null. It isn't as though slavery is the only wrong we've done blacks. Do you realize that segregation is only one generation ago? A time when it was alright to beat and persecute blacks for assembling? You don't forget these things when you're one generation removed. We don't ask Jewish people to forget the Holocaust...<br>
I do apologize for name calling at McStemp. It isn't truly my intent to slander, just to offer another perspective. I'm not politically correct at all, but I tire of those who live with a white priveledge acting as though THEY are the ones at a disadvantage. It's a bending of certain statistics toward your case, but anyone with eyes could see it isn't the truth.<br>
It's just the history of the white race to persecute and oppress those of differing nationalities. I don't expect it to change anytime soon except by forceful means. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukaeliic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaeliic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/20/01 10:08:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> /sigh <br>
The &quot;white&quot; people are not the only one who enslaved other races.  Many of the slaves that the whites brough over from Africa were sold to the traders by the chiefs of the tribes.  This doesn't make it right, but I don't think I owe anyone anything because of what my great great grandfather might have done.<br>
<br>
And people are going to argue until they are blue in the face about Hitler...it all boils down to his charisma and him knowing what to say and when.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
