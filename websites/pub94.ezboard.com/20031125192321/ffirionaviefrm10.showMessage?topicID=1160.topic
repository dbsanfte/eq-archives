<br>
Do you remember the way we used to hold toes beneath the covers at night? My big toe would curl around yours, and every inch of our bodies would touch, making us a seamless whole. The way my body fit perfectly into the curve of yours as you told me stories by candlelight? I can hear you even now, your soft voice somehow carrying over the thundering waves just outside our window, as if the Ocean of Tears were as rapt as I to hear your voice. Is there such a thing as a silent scream? For that is what the crashing waves were: an earthquake of silence enthralled by your tale spinning. Even the ocean loved you.<br>
<br>
Do you remember the day you slipped a twisted strand of grass onto my finger, promising your heart for eternity? We played in the water that day, echoes of our childhood together, your smile unchanged, a boy’s smile on a man’s face. <br>
<br>
I loved you even when we were both toddling along in baby britches, exploring the world by putting everything and anything into our mouths. Remember the gnoll droppings? You called it candy, and somewhere in our imaginations we convinced ourselves that it WAS candy. Amazing we lived through that period, but we did, to the great relief of our parents. <br>
<br>
My heart broke the day you went to Qeynos with your father for training. Remember the letters we wrote, our love transcending the distance? Or the celebration we had upon your return? I walked bow-legged for days. Thank the gods for long skirts, or else my papa would have had your head mounted on our wall. <br>
<br>
Poor papa. You were my strength when he died, your warmth always near enough to grasp whenever I would weep. You were such a gentleman, taking mama’s arm as we said our farewells to papa and lit his bier. I remember clearly the trepidation I felt as mother watched papa’s corpse burn, the father of her children, the lover who once filled her loins with desire, as you did mine. I knew then that I never wanted to let you go. <br>
<br>
Don’t you see how much I loved you? And you loved me too! But then... well, we all make mistakes, lover, and I forgive you. We all sow our wild oats, I suppose. Well, I didn’t, but can I blame you for being young and confused? When you said you were going to marry her, you were just confused. I understand that now. I’m so glad you understand it now too. And now nothing will separate us. You have repented for your folly, and now you know that you can’t live without me. Just like I can’t live without you. <br>
<br>
Together forever, you and I.<br>
<br>
My Eternal Love,<br>
<br>
Fajera</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Fajera’s lips twitched into a small smile as she blew the ink dry on the curling parchment. Her eyes captured the light of the candle, glinting with love and remembrance. The door scraped open behind her, and her smile broadened as she stood and turned. “Lover! You’re back early. I hope you finished all my errands! I was missing you so much I decided to write you a letter. Shall I read it to you?” The door creaked to a close, sending a woosh of fresh air into the dusty chamber. Fajera reached out to stroke her lover’s face, beaming brightly at him. Her lover stared vacantly back, his empty eye sockets seeming to swallow the dim candlelight, leaving the room cold and dark. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fajera>Fajera</A> at: 10/6/03 7:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nedagda@firionavie>Nedagda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/03 10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1160.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Lover</span><hr size=1> Ok, the story got me.

The tail of the large beast swayed slight in curiousity as he watched the human through window. He was somewhat amused at how the followers of darkness enslaved the undead. Clawed fingers rapped across facial scales as contemplated how it came that these beings controlled the undead.. He wondered why the undead did not revolt in legion against their masters, as in Cabilis many a revolt was lead by the froglok.. Perhaps the undead knew of the futility of it all, or perhaps soulless they cared not about such things.<br>
<br>
Drawing his cloak near as torch weilding guard past he shifted his body into a crouch, as to look as the next common vagabond within the human city.. The guard payed little attention to the cloaked terror passing him by without a second glance. Vonask rose up once more, peering through the hazed window. It was rare that he watched the man beast. He was a bit suprised the life of the female he stalked was restored, did her god find honor in retreating from a foe? Or perhaps her god merely found humor in restoring her life.. Vonask tried not to dwell on it too much, he was a Legionnaire, skilled with the blade, not with the mind.<br>
<br>
A snort was given as the human, and her skeletal slave seemed to do nothing but exchange stares. He found it odd how the human adored the undead. He never understood how fleshbeasts spread their seed, and remained with their mate. His people merely mated to expand the size of the Empire, no such thing as love existed.. At least not to him..<br>
<br>
&quot;Interesting fleshbeast.. Perhaps I'll learn more after some time..&quot; Vonask turned upon heel slowly sauntering down the streets of the human city the clicking of talons upon feet resounded.. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.intense-design.com/Vonask.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fajera>Fajera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/2/03 5:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1160.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dear Lover</span><hr size=1> Lover slowly turned toward the window, and Fajera sighed in frustration. &quot;What's wrong?

<br>
&quot;Look at me! Why are you so distant and quiet lately!&quot; the woman demanded, grabbing her lover's arm to spin him back to face her. &quot;Talk to me! Please!&quot; she pleaded, her mind going back to that night a month ago when his mysterious silence started. <br>

She had been busy as a bee that night, scrubbing clothing behind the house. A storm was coming; she could taste it in the salt on her lips. The frothy waves of the Ocean of Tears crashed and sprayed against the rocks beneath a ridge of clouds dark as pitch. <br>
<br>
Lover would stop by soon on his way home from work in the smithy, and she had a special present for him. She smiled, thinking of his face, his smile, the way his eyes gazed upon her with love. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, he'd be home before the storm broke. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hurry my love,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought, lifting her basket of damp laundry. Best to let them dry in the house this night. Yes, await his coming in the house, warm by the fire, protected from the lightning, wind, and rain. <br>

Rivulets of rain streamed down his already saturated cloak, soaking into the floor mat near the door and pooling on the freshly scrubbed wooden floorboards surrounding it. But that made sense; the storm had arrived with force just a few minutes before he arrived. What caused fear to take root in the depths of her heart was the lack of greeting, the absence of smile, indeed, the stiff way he removed his cloak before hanging it on the post. <br>
<br>
Lover found joy in everything, most especially the wind and the rain, but his countenance was far from joyful. For the first time in her memory, his happy glow was replaced by a grim, dark aura. Fajera shivered, and threw another log onto the fire. <br>

<br>
But that was the past, and he had to look to his future. And Myrielle was his future, now. Reluctantly, he pushed Fajera out of his arms, turning away from her searching gaze in shame.  <p><i>Lover and I went down to the fair, <br>

What's wrong?&quot; Fajera asked, gently turning the man's face toward hers. She rarely used his given name, having called him &quot;Lover&quot; since they were children, first in playful imitation of her own parents, and then, when they grew to understand the meaning of the word, in earnest. <br>
<br>
The first time she had called him Lover had been a warm, rainy morning. They couldn't have been more than eight summers old. Ten years past, now. Seems like an eternity. They were playing beneath the dock next to the inn where they boarded under Uncle Lunce's care while Papa was out at sea. Mama cleaned the inn and worked in the kitchens beside the cook, helping Uncle make the inn a cozy, hospitable place. <br>
<br>
That day in particular, Tobias Fireheart had snuck away from his chores at his father's smithy to catch crabs with Fajera, her squealing as they skittered out of the sand and he swooped them up in a bucket. They had retreated to the shelter of the dock when the rain was the heaviest, the rising sea water not a concern to immortal youth. He played the fisherman coming home with his catch, and she busied herself &quot;sweeping&quot; the wet sand at her bare feet. And, echoing her mother's words when Papa swept in from the sea, she exclaimed, &quot;About time, Lover mine!&quot; when Fisherman Tobias first entered the &quot;door&quot; of their playhouse under the dock. From that day on, the name stuck like wet sand between the toes.<br>
<br>
But now, the way Lover resisted meeting her eyes sent a shiver down her spine. Even when they argued, his way was to hammer out a solution face to face, eye to eye. Her brow crumpled with worry as he took a seat by the fire, not even removing his boots to stay a while. <br>
<br>
&quot;I made soup,&quot; she said softly, kissing his cheek gently before retrieving two bowls from the sideboard.  <p><i>Lover and I went down to the fair, <br>

I won't be staying long---I *can't* be staying long. Fajera, things have changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The glazed, scared, and confused look in her beautiful dark eyes made him pause and his words caught in his throat. He loved this woman, would always love her, and if things were different, he would have spent the rest of his life with her. But men make mistakes, and he made a mistake, and it was his duty---no, his father's words came to mind now---his *privilege* to father Myrielle Ironforge's child. Not only was marrying the girl Tobias's duty, but it would herald the profitable joining of two forges, securing trade in both the east and west of Antonica. There was no way around it; his duty to his father was clear. Perhaps he and Fajera could still love one another, it wasn't unheard of for prosperous men to keep a mistress. And Fajera really wouldn't be his mistress, but his true love. The marriage to Myrielle was really just business, anyway---he just unwittingly brokered the deal the night he took her to his bed in Qeynos. Even that Fajera might understand. They were very open and frank about discussing such things. <br>
<br>
But no, Fajera would never be a mistress. He knew that even before his thoughts grasped at the hope. And he wouldn't want that for her. She deserved someone devoted to her, as he was, but who could also be her lifemate, companion, husband. <br>
<br>
He reached for her, how could he not? The tears ran freely down his cheeks as he pressed his lips to hers, felt the tremble in her shoulders. &quot;Oh my love, I'm so sorry. So sorry. Please forgive me. Oh gods, forgive me,&quot; he whispered brokenly as she melted into his arms. <br>
<br>
&quot;Shhh,&quot; he heard her say. &quot;Shhh, my sweet Lover. Whatever it is can't be so bad. We'll work through it. Talk to me, Lover, talk to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The fear was gone from her face as he pulled away, and the hope shining there was even more terrible to him than the anxiety. He realized that she truly had no idea how bad it could be. That she was so confident in the commitment of their love that she couldn't foresee what he was about to say. <br>
<br>
Steeling his nerves, he wiped his eyes with the wet cuff of his tunic, then hung his head in his hands. He could not look her in the eye. <br>
<br>

The men worked barechested, the women in thin shifts, leaving little to imagination. The days were spent bent over Master Ironforge's forge, the nights at Crow's downing ale at Ironforge's most gracious expense. The hot nights and ale did something to a man, especially a man missing his woman as fiercely as Tobias missed his. <br>
<br>
Fajera sent messages as often as she could, and not a day went by that there wasn't something waiting for him at the Ironforge estate. Sometimes a letter, sometimes a trinket from their childhood, and sometimes a once-worn article of clothing for him to smell and hold as he slept. He was a man in love, sickeningly, pathetically, hopelessly, marvelously in love. He had been since childhood, and he loved it. <br>
<br>
But somewhere in the periphery of his apprentice work at the forge, Myrielle Ironforge had taken a liking to him. By this time, father was already back in Freeport, running their own forge. Had father been there, maybe Tobias wouldn't have been quite so lonely; maybe he wouldn't have been caught unaware. But father had his own business to run, so he wasn't there the day Myrielle finally made her first move. <br>
<br>
And who would have thought that the woman would conceive after one bedding? One moment of weakness. An eternity of pain. <p><i>Lover and I went down to the fair, <br>

A marriage of the Ironforge and Firebright families bode well for the struggling Firebright forge in Freeport. <br>
<br>
Now, as Tobias shared the news with Fajera, his only feeling was shame. Shame for betraying his beautiful Fajera, shame for giving in to his urges, shame for buckling to his father's demands. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
&quot;But Tobias, what about us? What about OUR family? Please, Tobias. Please. What about us?&quot; Fajera's voice cracked like bone as she clung to the back of a chair, the drying laundry billowing behind her in the ocean breeze coming in gusts through the window. <br>
<br>
This couldn't be happening. No, this was impossible. Mistress Darkbriar had promised they would always be together. Fajera searched her memory for an alternate understanding of Opal's prophecy and found none. <br>
<br>
After Fajera's father died, she had spent weeks questioning the meaning of life and death. She had wandered from Priest to Priestess, seeking answers to dark questions stirring in her soul. Why did some live, while others die? She could not stand to lose Lover, not ever, for any reason, but especially death. Would Lover die while she was doomed to live without him? All the answers given by various faiths were unsatisfactory, save one. For the price of her eternal service, Innoruuk, Prince of Hate, would answer her prayers. <br>
<br>
The words of the prophecy came drifting back to her now, as her gaze lingered on the shaggy auburn of Tobias's downturned head. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Your love will be transformed, replaced by an even greater power, binding you to him and he to you for all eternity. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Eternal service seemed a small price to pay to spend eternity with Lover, for how difficult could that service be with Lover at her side? She was initiated not long after speaking with Opal Darkbriar, becoming a follower of Hate for the sake of Love. Little did she know the price Innoruuk would exact. <br>
<br>
But now, with the threat of losing Tobias so real, Fajera shook her head, her lips moving wordlessly in disbelief. &quot;No, no, Lover. You can't leave me. The prophecy... the prophecy...&quot; she stammered, her eyes wide and crazed.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Tobias raised his head and the firelight glinted off his wet cheeks. &quot;Prophecy? What prophecy? Fajera, what are you talking about?&quot; he asked, his tears for the moment forgotten in his confusion. Was his love having a nervous breakdown?<br>
<br>
&quot;Fajera, what is wrong with you?&quot; he said softly, rising to steady her tottering form.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Somewhere in her mind, Fajera heard Tobias's voice, but even louder was the voiceless command that throbbed in her head. &quot;Serve me now and the prophecy will be fulfilled.&quot; She listened to the silent voice, nodding as she digested each word, pushing Tobias gently away as he reached for her. <br>
<br>
Then, her mind clouded by the power of the silent voice, she obeyed, taking the knife from its place in the bread, and stabbing it directly into the wide, blue orb calling her name. Again and again, hot liquid gushing onto her face, Lover's screams muted by the silent voice, stabbing, stabbing, obeying.<br>
<br>
Then all went dark.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
When Fajera awoke from her trance, she lay bundled in a blanket in Neriak Foreign Quarter. She immediately looked for Lover and found him standing near the fire, staring at the dancing flames. She spoke to him, but he didn't answer, and a terrible chill raced through her bones. <br>
<br>
Tobias looked pale, with dark rings beneath his lovely blue eyes, his auburn hair a shaggy mess, but he was alive, and he was with her, and that was all that mattered. Lover had lost much of his ability to speak in his illness, responding only to her, and even then only to confirm her requests. And he called her Master, which irritated her to no end, but Perrir said that was simply his way of saying thank you now that speaking was so difficult to him. <br>
<br>
And Fajera processed each inconsistency in her own way, only accepting information that confirmed her worldview: That Lover was ill, but alive, and that they were together forever. She hoped in his recovery from this strange illness, blaming it on his time in the storm the night they had their big fight. But to Fajera, he was still Tobias, still Lover, handsome and vital, just ill. <br>
<br>
To everyone else, he was a fleshless horror, a pile of living bones. <p><i>Lover and I went down to the fair, <br>
