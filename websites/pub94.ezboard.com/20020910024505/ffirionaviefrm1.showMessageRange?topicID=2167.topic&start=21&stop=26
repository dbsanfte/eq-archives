For this reason, I can make a pretty good argument about why my character would wish to group with dark elves and those of evil alignment (hey, a fight's a fight and creating chaos wherever I go seems like a good idea to me).  I also have a roleplay reason to group with those of evil alignment (which I won't bore you with here).  <br>
<br>
Since I am not of good alignment, I cannot speak directly to the &quot;good/evil&quot; grouping issue presented in this post.  However, I can speak to the issue of being berated for grouping with dark elves and with those of evil alignment by players who profess to do so to protect their roleplaying experience.<br>
<br>
Many times, players simply see my human face and forget that not all humans are created alike.  Accordingly, I have received a number of OOC tells from certain &quot;roleplaying purists&quot; berating me for ruining their roleplay experience because I am grouped with dark elves and telling me to play on another server.  The irony of the practice of sending an OOC tell to someone who is roleplaying to berate them for not roleplaying &quot;correctly&quot; is certainly not lost on me.   <br>
<br>
For those roleplaying purists who seek to police the way in which other characters roleplay, I would suggest that your interpretation of the term &quot;roleplay&quot; may need to be expanded.  Those who are &quot;good&quot; are sometimes &quot;bad;&quot; those who are &quot;bad&quot; are sometimes &quot;good.&quot;  And sometimes there is no time to explain the detailed reasons behind your roleplaying (I have a set dialogue hotkeyed now due to the number of times I have had to explain the reasons behind my roleplaying.). <br>
<br>
I can say that my best experiences in this area are those characters who send me playful roleplaying tells to the effect that what I am doing is &quot;shameful&quot; and urging me not to consort with &quot;inkies.&quot;  This sometimes leads to a roleplaying exchange where I get to trot out my own roleplaying beliefs and the other character gets to trot out theirs.  My best experience along these lines was a three day drunken, brawling binge that I went on with one of my fellow roleplayers to show him the ways of a neutral discordant warrior who follows Rallos Zek.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I am failing to grasp the gravity of the situation, but I was under the impression that Everquest was a game.  While there are certain OOC practices that upset me as a resident of Firiona Vie, seeing possibly good characters grouped with possibly evil ones isn't one of them.   <br>

<br>
Now, this is how I would approach the situation.  Although, being human myself, I am well aware that not all humans are good and would not find it at all unusual to find a human grouping with those dastardly Tier'Dal.  However, I would wonder why the Tier'Dal would want to group with a human.  I've found most to be quite ethnocentric.<br>
<br>
I would never berate someone OOC for how they group, but you might, indeed, hear a few words from me IC for your choices.  After all, it is my chosen profession in life to bring the light to those who cannot see.<br>

Worse, I am having a hard time understanding why part of me wants to be friends with him even though I know what he stands for though he didn't express that to me.

The evil ones will spin seductive tales of power and fame if you but follow their ways.  Even the best are tempted at times by their blandishments.  It is their way to try to sway you to the darkness, but you must always resist!  It is only by the power of the Light that you can be saved.<br>
