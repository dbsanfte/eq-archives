13 wisdom is a LOT of wisdom for a ranger or paladin and 13 intell would do wonders for a shadowknight as well.

Sure, the tribal shield from C-T is fairly common and easy to acquire, but it is inferior.  Sarnak and ashenbone shields are better/comparable, but no more easily obtainable.  If you aren't in a raiding guild (and most people who do open raids aren't), there's a good chance that the Bladestopper is going to be a nice shield for you, the best you're going to see in a while.  I'm still using the one I won in an open Nagafen raid several months ago.  And proud of it.<br>
<br>
And I'm sure there was someone on that raid who would have used that shield as a shield and not just the Rune.  As long as that was the case and you were rolling based on who could use the item, it should have gone to such a person.  And there's no excuse for attempting to shield the next day, whether you used up all the charges in 24 hours or not.<br>
<br>
And you should also pay attention when loot is being distributed during a raid.  It is good that is has been offered back, but the fact is that an item that was supposed to be NBG was rolled on by someone who didn't need it... surely this could have been realized before the raid broke apart, and it could have been offered back on the spot.  Instead, a day later it was being sold on the bazaar.  That's fishy, even if the greed was &quot;unintentional.&quot; <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

<br>
Yes, I'm aware that PAL and SHD use spells that are based on WIS and INT respectively.......but their spells are mainly supplemental in nature. Sure they both have very useful spells but a raid isn't going to be made or broken on the size of a PAL or SHD mana pool. On the other hand, if your Clerics go OOM or your Shamans go OOM before being able to land a slow or...or...or... there are lots of bad things that can and will happen if you deprive the pure casters items that would increase their mana pool.<br>
<br>
Refer to my post again - it isn't about trying to come up with some use for an item to get in on the roll. It's about who can use it more. Sure, a SHD or PAL with a huge +INT or +WIS item is going to be helped a bit. That's one more lifetap or stun that they can get off. But you might be depriving the Cleric the extra edge that will let them get in another CH and save the raid.<br>
<br>
I play a Shaman - I melee a bit when I solo especially when the creatures start running - however, I'm not going to roll against a WAR for a jade mace, or a ROG for a willsapper because they are not vital for my class, while the other classes would be greatly benifited from these. And yes, I have refused to roll on big ticket items before even though I was a useable class. I refused to roll on CoF on an open naggy raid on another server with my Rogue because I knew once I got my epic, the CoF would be on the trade block.<br>

You do realize the torque is ONLY USABLE BY HYBRIDS/tanks.  /bonk thevolcanoidiot<br>
And it's a very nice item for any of them.  For tradeskills as well as regular raid use, since the ac is pretty decent on it as well. Now.. what was your point? <p><center><img src="http://www.sa.il24.net/~saran/kyrial/kyrialsig.jpg">

I only dare set foot in here because I was speaking with Medite last evening and he told me it was going on.<br>
<br>
Second of all, Knor has turned over the shield to Ledbane.  Whether this was a result of this thread or a casual conversation with Medite, I do not know... nor do I really care.<br>
<br>
Third of all, and possibly the only good thing to come of this post, is that I think the shield was not handed down correctly.  I don't remember the numbers, but if you review the log posted by Knor, Ledbane's high roll (830 something I believe) was for the first shield.  His second roll for the second shield is listed lower down the post and was not second high.  It seems to me that this shield should be awarded to Marika.  I could be wrong, but that's how it looks from this piece of log posted.  Could someone with the full log please review and let me know, I don't want this if it belongs to someone else.<br>
<br>

  You all are amazing!  I do not know this slob, and I do not think I know any of the poeple who have posted here.  So this guy Kore wins a shield and tries to sell it, he is instant flamed.<br>
  The guy comes back and gives a reasonable explanation, stating he rolled becuse he was told to, won, and everyone baled before he could give it back.  Although people doubt his story...none of the original flamers are saying he is untruthful, but they are still pissed!<br>
  But that is not good enuff. Some say he is obligated to spend days in game time finding all who may have been involed and asking them, beggin them, to take this from him. (of course he will be slamed for what choice he makes as to who he gives it to). <br>
  You all scare me.  As I get higher and higher in level, I realize more and more I will not be doing a lot of raids, and if I do raid, it will only be for specific quest items, I can use.  <br>
<br>
Good Luck to you all,<br>

<br>
Everytime you do this it makes you look like a complete fool. You see those little numbers below the last post that say (1, 2, 3) - that means there are other pages full of posts that people have written. You click on them with your mouse and read them to understand what people are saying so you don't post wasted comments and make yourself look stupid by going off on something that was explained fully already.<br>
<br>
Just to recap...yes, Mithril Torque is Hybrid only like I posted already...no we are not talking about the Mithril Torque now, conversation has shifted away from it and it was just used as an example anyways so it doesn't even matter right now.<br>

I have know Knor Through EQ for many years now and i can say the following He is Not a Loot Whore in fact the exact opposite ive seen him help out guildies multiple times in Fact he equiped me and has help many others get equipment in and outside of Clan twisted !<br>
     I myself have  rolled on items and then  realized that i didnt need them either through pressuer from Raid member s friends etc saying its a mage item roll  and have your screen plaster with tells .this a type of peer presure that will even make the  strogest person fold at times in attempts to shut people up .<br>
    Now knor said  the he said on raid channel that they should reroll on piece or give it  to second highest roller i can garentee u that that is the truth (im sure we all have raid expierence and can pretty much say that on open raids that how people listen is generally the equivillant to about a room of 40 4 year olds so it was probably missed) <br>
   Guys give it a break its a crap shield (besides the 10 casts of instant  ruin )he offered to give it back during the raid he has given it back to what is suppose to be the appropriate winner.<br>
  I came to this server to get away from this nonsense concerning arguments over loot This is suppose to be a roleplaying server the joy of hunt should be that of killing Naggy. Secondly if your not big into roleplaying im just curious how many of peeps went on the raid for this shield ?  how many that are complaining  where even there? what about the person who started the post was he there ?in Retrospect how many people that are on the log that rolled for this item really needed it ?imo probably 80 percent of that list decided it was a consolidation prize since niether scale or book dropped . (just stop and think about it for a sec)<br>
From what i can tell this whole string of posts has been nothing But  Greed SIU enjoy the game. flaming people on boards is not only inappropriate but cowrdly as it dosent give the person your flaming about a chance to defend himself in real time<br>
<br>
This has been nothing more in an attempt to ruin sombodies reputaion in a game that is suppose to be that a game !<br>

<br>
But folks, he is right. I haven't been a member of Clan Twisted for long, but if I know one thing about Knor is that he will drop everything to help out his friends. If he says he was in tell hell I can certainly believe it. He is the one people turn to when things go wrong... and he will do everything in his power to help them resolve any issues they might have. I also know that this is just a game. To the person who posted that if you go on to sell something you won in a raid only days before you should know by now that you are going to get flamed here... that is only relevant if you visit these boards regularly. I know I don't. And I don't believe Knor does. Some of us have lives outside of Everquest. Knor is a good man. He probably lost his temper when he responded to these posts as I imagine I would if I came to a board to see myself flamed by people where NOONE had the balls to come to me and actually ASK me what had happened before they proceeded to try and destroy my reputation. He probably should have given the shield back to Medite when he realised he wasn't going to use it. He didn't. He screwed up. He has subsequently given the shield to the &quot;wrong&quot; person?? Whatever. Get over it. It's done. It's resolved. And I shall think less of most all of you as a result of this whole thread. <br>
<br>
As a side note Blight, Hammer of the Scourge was for sale this morning on a naked human vendor. So, it's okay if you are EQ obsessed enough to buy another account simply for screwing people over anonymously?? Whatever. <br>

<br>
A quick note to say I received word from Ledbane that Knor turned over the Bladestopper to him.  For whatever reason, Knor did not send me a tell about it and did not respond to my tells.  Knor, if you are out there, I believe that I have been honest about the situation and gave you the benefit of the doubt from the very beginning.  You returned the Bladestopper and I'm glad that you did.<br>
<br>
As to the issue of who should get the shield, the roll at issue was the roll that was seen in the log Knor posted.  For whatever reason, Marika chose not to roll on the second Bladestopper.  If Marika was confused about the way in which the items were being rolled; if she thought that we were rolling once and that I'd take the highest of the two rolls; she did not mention anything to me during or after the roll.<br>
<br>
Ledbane, according to the way the items were rolled, I believe you are the rightful possessor of the shield.  If you do not feel the same, you are free to award the Bladestopper to Marika if you choose.  <br>
<br>
Marika, if you are out there, what are your thoughts on this.<br>
<br>
Must go,<br>

<br>
I am a 47 rogue, I often group with lower level members and end up tanking for them. I rolled on the shield because I thought the boost in AC and a little bit less aggro would work  for the light tanking I do.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on this? Has any one tried it and do I try for another one of these shields if I get a chance or would it be a waste? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubippinfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bippinfv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elf-hugger</span><br>  Posts: 798<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 12:44:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=54>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Knor the loot whore</span><hr size=1> Siffo, if you tank, you don't want less aggro, you want more. That's the point in tanking. And getting less aggro as a rogue is easy - evade. When I tank for lower levels, I do just that. Get the aggro, evade once, and backstab immediately - most times you'll get the aggro right back, before the mob even landed a hit on anyone else.<br>
Another issue is of course, you're giving up DPS by wearing the shield, making the fight that much longer. Assuming you have good dual wield/double attack skills, and a decent off-hand weapon(I know you do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), you'll be giving up , let's say... one third of your damage output or so? The fight will last longer as a result, and you will suffer more hits accordingly. Not sure you'll take any less damage with the shield, I'd actually guess the opposite.<br>
Look at warriors - I know of no warrior wearing a shield when tanking.<br>
As a rogue, I'd avoid rolling on any shield (except Lodizal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p>Bippin Tenderfoot <BR>

When I duel weild I pretty much get all the aggro unless I evade and then I have to back off usualy to loose it so I can come back in for a back stab and even then I have so much aggro the turn right back to me. <br>
<br>
My thought was I could absorb a lot more abuse and still get in an occasional Backstab when using evade but not having to back way off.<br>
<br>
It was just a thought and I would like to test it but it would have to be a damn good shield to make it worth while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1029<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 1:20:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Let's put it this way</span><hr size=1> For anyone but a pal or sk, this will be at best a rare situational piece of gear.

<br>
25 AC is higher than any piece of armor I wear (BP or tunic is only 22) so it would be significant not including any bonuses.<br>
<br>
So some thing I would use approximatly 50% of the time something that would significantly improve my performance and survivability. And some thing that I am researching to find out if it is viable.<br>

For instance, I've yet to hear you say that shield in your hands would be used at least as often, for as many levels, or for as much tanking as a pal or sk.

1) Asking how well using the sheild would work to see if it is some thing I should roll on = &lt;rationalizing a want and having trouble doing so, but still working at it.&gt; <br>
<br>
2) Using it approximatly 50% of the time = &lt;You're saying you'd barely use it at all&gt;<br>
<br>
3)  Having an additional AC item higher than my highest AC piece of armor = &lt;only in situations where you don't even need more AC&gt;(lowering damage is stricly an AC, Agi issue)<br>
