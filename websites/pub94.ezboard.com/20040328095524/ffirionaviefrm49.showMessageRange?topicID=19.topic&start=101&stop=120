And if they had been there to get an Epic im sure they wouldnt have been so brash or even said much of anything to the people there. Randomly raiding a city for no other reason than to get your rocks off is silly and IS laughable. They were not there for an epic they had finished that part in nektolous forest.Did you read that part or were you just spouting random crap to get your own rocks off? And obviously their taunting was taken to far or it wouldnt have ended as it did. I doubt there was much RP intended behind the encounter. Looks like RP is just a smokscreen to cover up their actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
And by no other recourse I meant it was the only way they could come out on top. Just as in my comparison to the kinds that shoot people in schools. Their only recourse to actually win in their particular situation is to use forces greater than their own. Are there other avenu's they could take probably. Did they know about them? probably not. Did they see them as a viable option if they did know about them, obviously not. <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A> at: 9/4/02 10:29:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 10:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Why do they have to come out &quot;on top&quot;?<br>

Obviously they were not wanted there and were causing grief on other players or they wouldnt have been trained. You must have one ounce of sense in that little pea brain of yours. &quot;Yeah everyone had a great time we RPed our asses off&quot;. But the one thing that dosnt make sence in the whole thing is they got trained. So obviously everyone wasnt having a &quot;great time&quot;. RPing a jerk and forcing it on others IS greifing.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for the last time quit puting words in my mouth. I never said they deserved to get trained. I simply stated the fact that they caused it to happen to themselfs. And he showed poor taste in his tells to the guildleader and obviously in his RP (if you can call it that). And being a bully IC or out of character is still being a bully period. You cant defend being an asshole with RP it just isnt gonna fly unless everyone around you knows thats what your doing and agrees not to take offence. <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A> at: 9/4/02 10:42:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 10:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Check the timestamps, buddy. You posted almost two minutes after, so it wasn't an edit caused by your post. Anyway, you DO say they deserve to get trained (or at least you're unintentionally stating that) -- you just try to add that it's not 'right.' <br>
<br>
Who are YOU to tell me how to RP my character? And even if you aren't telling me to do it, you're kind of forcing me to change by griefing me. If you want to play in a world where every character is nice and generous (which sounds kind of boring IMHO), then just ignore the mean characters. You can always /ignore, by the way. You want me to pass out consent forms to everybody I could possibly, at any given time, interact with before I make an arrogant, pissy character? That's a ridiculous idea.<br>
<br>
Note that this does not advocate having a mean character and also being a griefer, and trying to play off the griefing as roleplay. But what you're saying is that just RPing meanly is a form of griefing, and it isn't. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 11:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Note that this does not advocate having a mean character and also being a griefer, and trying to play off the griefing as roleplay<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
By this statement alone you are basicly agreeing that RPing a mean person could be construed as greifing by another player. Once again use some comon sence, and do it tactfully for god sakes. Walking into someones home town and taunting them in shouts and challenging them to duels is hardly in good taste. And this my friend is the issue at hand that we are talking about. There is a limit to everything and im sure if you Rped a mean person or a cranky one you wouldn't go to these extents. Im trying to point out he isnt a golden god that hath done no wrong. He is almost if not equally to blame for this happening. And the fact that he brought it here makes him even more at fault. And the guild leader of Sisters of Myth in my eyes shouldnt be at fault in the slightest. Forcing her to apologize for somthing she had nothing to do with is just sickening in my eyes. <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 11:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Errrr.... eye that is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 11:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Feh...Tzaroth has a point.

The line right after that says that I don't think that RPing a mean character is the same as griefing. That simply isn't true. You have no say whatsoever in my character's personality. You just don't. You DO have say in whether or not I can get away with KSing or training you, which is just one of many differences between the two. And again, you are demonstrating to me that you think that all characters should be nice and hold hands, and that if they don't they get what is coming to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 11:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why are you bothering the boards with this?</span><hr size=1> Just as he stated in his apology he forced his guild to leave Ak'anon to not taint the RP for other people.

Ill conced the fact that there is no excuse for training.

<br>
Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them. As harassment can take many forms, the EQCSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would feel harassed and act accordingly<br>
<br>
<br>
RPing a mean person can VERRY easily break this particular PnP rule. Dont give me that RPing a mean person can't be greifing because your just plain wrong no matter how you try to defend it. <p><img src="http://hotrainnads.homestead.com/files/Dorphen.jpg"width="200" height="200" border="0" align="middle"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 11:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=117>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> gimps</span><hr size=1> Fuck that.<br>

Killing CITY guards doesn't violate PnP, and it isn't silly.<br>

It was specifically stated that no bankers or merchants (except one) were killed. That ain't griefing.<br>
Could they have been /petitioned for abusing /shout? Probably. Hell, let's train 'em instead though.<br>

Since it seems to a lot of people here that training is ok in certain situations, like when it's 1am, or you're irritable, etc..<br>
I'm gonna have to make that bard, only play at early AM times, and make sure to always be grouchy.

<br>
I did i little checking and all the 3 mobs that were trained on you were 40th level casters. I believe there was 1 Necromancer and 1 Wizard among the 3 of them, looking at the spells they cast. These 3 mobs spawn at the top wall before the first few structures of the Neriak foreign quarter. A fall from the wall would most definately have badly hurt or killed a 12th level character. Now, faced with 3 40th level casters, how could a level 12 character possibly hope to survive when even a 52nd Knight like yourself could not resist their root spell (Not to mention snare, fear, 200pt dds as well as DoTs)? Or even get to the zone for that matter? The hits from the NPCs alone would have been enough to kill her.<br>
<br>
Like Vivienne said, she seems relatively new to the game, so it seems unlikely that she was able train you and your companion. Now, if she was able to stand by and watch you get attacked, then she definately did not train you, because if she did, the NPCs would have gone straight for her because she would have gained aggro by attacking them, nothing short of a spell or taunt would get them off.<br>
<br>
You said there was another person that possibly &quot;aided&quot; in the training. Perhaps it was this person that trained you and Mythrilia was just a spectator that decided to tag along? In my opinion, with all the fighting going on, i think you may have been mistaken, because there is no way a level 12 character could have survived before bringing the train to you. <p><center><a
