It is a rant on pick up groups and the situation that resulted, not any individual member.<br>
<br>
I would probably just drop it, but I want to make the apology, and to do that, I need to explain the situation.<br>
<br>
With that out of the way.....<br>
<br>
I was looking for a LDoN or a planes group last night, as I was on late night and missed most of my guildies.  After sitting lfg for quite a while (3 54 to 57 level SK's LFG at same time) I grabbed a KEI and a Temp and started to run to BW to solo a bit, so the night wasn't a total loss.  Just as I zone from PoK, I finally get a tell for a group.  Yes.  Instead of soloing, I'm going to PoI for some decent xp.<br>
<br>
I meet up with the cleric and the warrior at the PoT stone.  Warrior same level as I, and I believe the cleric was as well.  Two wizards soon join us, and now all we need is a slower.  We wait for a while and look, and then the message comes up in group that we have a 54 shaman coming.  Wootage.  Soon as he gets here, we will zone in.<br>
<br>
And we wait.<br>
<br>
And we wait.<br>
<br>
Wait some more.<br>
<br>
You get the idea.  Finally he shows up (something like 20 minutes at least after he said he was on his way from nexus) the group asks for HoS.  We get SoW'd and SR'd.  *raises an eyebrow*  We zone into PoI and he summons a pet.....a warder.   Ahhh.  He isn't a shaman after all.  He is a beastlord.  That explains the lack of HoS.  Oh well, I think.  Ghetto slow is better than nothing, so we start to set up.  We set up near the zone in, there is already another group on the other side of zone in.  I have never been to PoI before, I have no idea what spots can be shared, so since the group was setting up here, I figured we were ok.<br>
<br>
The BL asks who is going to be MT, and the group responds that the warrior will be handling that.  Although my HP are higher, he has a great AC buff, and since I have never been in zone before, I keep quiet.  The BL tells the group he has 2k or so more hp than the warrior (virtue/HoS vs Temp I think) and asks if he should be MT.  The answer is no, the warrior will do it.  So I voice the warrior and get ready to be DPS.<br>
<br>
On the first kill I realize this is going to be slow going.  Tanking these mobs with only ghetto slow was eating up the clerics mana pretty quickly, and the BL started complaining almost immediately that we weren't pulling fast enough.<br>
<br>
On the second kill aggro started pingponging between the warrior and the BL.<br>
<br>
On the third kill, one of our wizards ate it.  Over nuked too early and there was no pulling it off him til death.  The cleric called OOM just as we finished the fight.<br>
<br>
As we sat around for a few waiting, cleric rezzed the wizard back in, called OOM again, and the BL went LD (ahem....*coughpulledtheplugcough*)  So goodbye ghetto slow.  We sit for a while, letting the cleric regain her mana, and then the warrior goes off to pull.<br>
<br>
I had a bad feeling about this.  With a slower, he needed 2 CH's a fight, and had a death.  He comes back to camp with his pull....and an add.<br>
<br>
No slower plus no CC.  Nice.  The cleric tries desperately to root the add, which just gets her a nice dose of aggro.  The warrior falls rather quickly, I start screaming EVAC, nothing happens, then the cleric drops.  I call evac again, one of the wizards either dies, zones, or self gates, the other succors us....to the same spot we just were, except now without aggro.<br>
<br>
Now to the apology.<br>
<br>
The only name from the other entrance group that I can remember is Khaylee.  I know those mobs aggroed on you all, and I hope that it didn't cause any deaths.  As I told Khaylee last night, if you ever have need of me, either for a summon or just to stand and tank for you, just ask.  Because it was my first time in the zone, I sat back and didn't speak up after we lost our slower.  I should have went with my instinct, and told the group that we either needed a slower or a new hunting spot.  I apologize if our adds cost you all anything.<br>
<br>
I take pride in knowing how to play my class and the game itself.  I am ashamed that I was part of a cluster like that, especially since I knew it was going to be a cluster and let it happen.<br>
<br>
*sighs*<br>
<br>
On the plus side, after that mess I found a great LDoN group, suceeded in my first mission, and got our bard a great breastplate.<br>
<br>
*looks over the book he just wrote*  Sorry, espresso's and loratabs.  I can never shut up with that combination.<br>
<br>
Oh, and to the wizards, the warrior, and the cleric from last night, if you ever want to group up again, shoot me a tell.  The disaster of the evening was due to not having the tools for the job in my opinion, not lack of skill.  I bet we would own a LDoN adventure, especially with a shammy or bard in that sixth slot.  As for the BL?  sorry I don't wait 30 minutes for someone just to see them pull the plug on the third kill.  The rest of the group seemed to think you went LD, but going LD right after the OOM call from the cleric after bitching about slow pulls for the whole time we were there, then not coming back just seems a bit too much of a coincidence.<br>
