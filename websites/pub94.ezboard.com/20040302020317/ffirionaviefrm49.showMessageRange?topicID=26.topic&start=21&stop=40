For what she did IC I gave her choices and consqequnces of how APep would react. She chose to let it drop and I decided to discontinue to acknowledge her as a RP'er for the lack of assumign responsibility for IC actions.<br>
<br>
As you are getitng all hot and bothered ooc about over someone who quit over ooc feelign I certianly hope you don't rp either. As I can tell you can't seperate either. You are goign of biased information and a one sided story.<br>
I have rp'ed a long logn time on this server. It is well known fact that Apep rp's very extreme. He wasnt trying to make friends when he raided Ak Non. He is out shakign hands or have tea with the loacals. She well knew the reaction for the actions she took. She knows how APep rps.This did nto happen over night.<br>
You can be pissed all you want and see how much I give a shit. I can tell by your posting your an irrational spaz bot. So I eagerly await your next post.<br>

I do that all by itself and it isn't warranted here....yet.  Comments Kuladen likes to make is what got Saga flamed by me earlier here in the soapbox, and I am glad to say that most of the problem children are gone from Saga.  <br>
<br>
But not all of them.  <br>
<br>
I never considered you a bad person, just like I don't consider Caillou a bad person, what I railed on the two of you for was in talking upfront about other people and not listening to what they are saying.  <br>
<br>
What I say is meant to generate thoughts, internal discussions or soul searching rather.  I never attacked a single person the entire time I was in Saga.  Not one.  When I left, you damn straight I lit some people up.  <br>
<br>
I know you agreed with me then and you agree with me now, that is why I try to leave you alone, but just because you enjoy my viewpoint doesn't mean I won't show you where you are making a mistake.  That doesn't apply to you in this case, you aren't making one.  But I won't hesitate if you do. <br>
<br>
Only by policing ourselves can we make a difference.  <br>
<br>
When Saga said they were one thing and did another, you damn straight I jumped in and corrected it.  And I will again.  Kuladen sits back flapping gums with nothing typically to say.  That silent yet stupid attitude that degrates Saga, nothing more.  Too stupid to shut up, too informed to walk away. <br>
<br>
Yes, you got wronged, and what happened to you is an extension of people not policing themselves.  Who ever said anything about sleeping with the GL?  That has to be pretty stupid as it's own statement and I hope you are just grabbing that as an example.  Nina can kick enough ass to keep Saga going regardless of how much damage people like Mixxi do.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry to put you through the crap that I do.  I don't particulary like getting into problems until I understand that both parties refuse to communicate.  That is when no problem will be solved.  <br>
<br>
No shouting, no name calling, no insults.  Just pure quiet talk.  That will solve all problems, maybe not like each party wants, but it will solve that problem sure as shit.  <br>
<br>
And when that doesn't happen.  Well, then, you got me.<br>
<br>
And why are we blaming Amae in her 17 year old life experiences? What happened to Apep's wisdom and understanding?  <br>
<br>
Why the fuck is he being given the nod when a little effort on his part could have avoided that whole situation?<br>
<br>
FFS, where is the responsiblity? That is the easy lame way out.  <br>
<br>
I don't blame Amae for any of it, why? Because she didn't know, and wasn't looked after to know it.  That means it can't be her fault.  No matter what outcome to that problem, she was going to suffer anyway.  Where the fuck was compassion in helping her deal with it?<br>
<br>
Fucking weak bastards.<br>
<br>
Word of Brell, who sure as hell doesn't hide behind 17 year olds<br>

<br>
I know more than most about this situation, and even I don't really know all the details about what happened.  All I know is that Apep &amp; Amae had some kind of dispute that led to her quitting EQ.  <br>
<br>
I've only had positive experiences with the both of them.  What can I say?  I could drag in snippets about why Amae said she left, but that seems quite disrespectful.<br>
<br>
If it's just something you want Apep's answers on, why post it here?   If you want the community's input, then why not include all the details?  And if you don't want to include the details out of respect for Amae's privacy, then again, why are you posting this here?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry she left, I liked her quite a bit, I dunno what happened, that's all I can say really.<br>
<br>
And if that's all I can say, it shouldn't be too surprising that all Kuladen can say is that he likes coloring books <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I can die happy now...<br>
<br>
And let me clarify, since I was kinda wound up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When Fatallia caught me, and we found out what Amae was up to, we were both very very worried because we knew a little bit about PoAmae oocly, and thought that this route was a very VERY bad idea, because we foresaw something like this possibly happening. We actually tried to talk her out of it. There is a certain level of life experience that lends you a *little* more help with dealing with stuff like this, and knowing her age, we were a tad worried. She is a good person. Maybe too much so. Hence our concern.<br>
<br>
And no, no one gets off scottfree. Everyone involved has to take some responsibility for what happens in the end. And EVERYONE needs to take responsibility for their own actions. It goes both ways. Amae does have to accept that she chose this route against much loud advice, however the other members involved have to own up to their parts as well. Yes, we are all characters on a screen, but as players we need to assess the person on the other end as well, and try to not do real, actual damage. It seems to happen far too often. I actually had a nervous breakdown in the middle of that Saga mess and now have yet an extra paper to finish on extension from last quarter, on top of the other 5 I have to write for this quarter. In the next two weeks. So I'm not innocent of letting this stuff get to me, I won't act like I am. The lingering problems are when not all of the involved parties are willing to admit their roles, or where they screwed up. That's where we end up with very hurt feelings, and people leaving.<br>
<br>
Would be nice if we could avoid that, but seems we don't really learn, do we?<br>
<br>
Oh and *chuckle* the sleeping with the GL thing was you, but I was too busy throwing popcorn at you at the time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Don't bother even considering what your role in the situation was, it's okay to look at it like she was the unstable one, and while you are at it, you can throw in all your past RP trophies so you can keep slapping yourself on the back.<br>
<br>
The question dumbass, is whether you did something right, or did something wrong. <br>
<br>
And it doesn't make any difference if I think you did or someone else.  What about you?  <br>
<br>
Of course, you are probably too dimwitted to see that, but deep down, you know I got you.  <br>
<br>
And Syll, I am not here to give jackshit to Kuladen.  So what did I give him? Exactly what I wanted from him, nothing.  <br>
<br>
What do I think of people who like to make a lighthearted or funny post on someone's rant? Not fucking much.  <br>
<br>
And when you get bit in the ass after doing it, then just make sure you keep your mouth shut.  Because if your medication has worn off and you just feel the need to step in and flap gums, then know that I will be there to remind you that at one point you made light of the situation.<br>
<br>
And Apep, a little flamer bot?  Attacking the RP baby?  I have RPed shit you know nothing about.  You don't compare to what I have done.  Is this a contest? Hell no, I am not so stupid as to try to cut your RP down.  If that makes you feel comfortable, go for it.  Maybe it will help you sleep at night.<br>
<br>
That doesn't change why I posted.  Don't ever pull that crap again.<br>
<br>
If you don't take responsibility then don't rub it in. <br>
<br>
I am not impressed with you showboating, I am impressed with you PROPERLY kicking ass and taking names, but mindless destruction shows nothing but insecurity.<br>
<br>
And I am not just flaming you.  I am telling you that it isn't too late.  Set this bad situation straight.  It costs nothing to apologize and leaves your opponent with no choice but to apologize.  And I have never known anyone to walk away from that still upset.<br>

I am sorry you had those problems, I really am.  But I deal with stupid extreme situations by being extreme.  Fight fire with fire they say.  Yes, I can be caustic, but I don't let people hide from their mistakes, especially when they don't see it, and I don't expect to hide from mine.  <br>
<br>
You have grasped the context of my post and sum it up better than I actually do, but Apep won't ignore me, he will be pissed and think about it and then the message will sink in and all will be better.<br>
<br>
Yes, perhaps Amae herself took the wrong path, but to hold her to blame is wrong.  Especially so because it was a Master/Slave relationship and within the context of that relationship, what happened wasn't wrong.  <br>
<br>
That is the big indicator there.<br>
<br>
By far I want to follow what I espouse and calmly, quietly talk things through.  Only when it becomes impossible do I go on these little sprees.  <br>
<br>
But I never back down because I fight for what I believe in.<br>
<br>
I also do not just blindly argue for the sake of argument either.  This always has a purpose and I don't mind getting beat around to see to it someone else profits by it.  That is called strength and coupled with caring, can change the world.<br>
<br>
No one can do it alone though.<br>

<br>
No, Apep.<br>
<br>
What I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>am</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> saying is, as an adult, with a bit more savvy and clue as to shit in general, you need to acknowledge that you were, in fact, dealing with a 17 year old kid. A female kid, even, which makes it even more sticky, because for those of us who remember high school, the word &quot;stability&quot; didn't exactly lend it's way into most situations. So no, she very likely wasn't going to handle anything too difficult ICly very well. It's why her friends were worried, but at the same time, we have no right to tell her what she can and can't do. She made her decisions on her own. However, by agreeing to enter into the roleplay with her, you have to accept that it could have gone badly, seeing the level of maturity we are dealing with here. No right or wrong, just an acknowledgement of responsibility.<br>
<br>
Do I, player of Bridh, think she overreacted in deleting Amae?<br>
Yes, how can I not?<br>
<br>
Do I think maybe the black or white, Door A or Door B, choice was a little harsh when dealing with someone in her particular situation? Probably. And you were the far better equipped person to have worked that out with her. I don't see her salvaging that on her own. It requires a tad more finesse than a rambunctious, impulsive teenaged girl can possibly possess.<br>
<br>
THAT is what I am saying.<br>
<br>
No idea what Brutin is saying, was busy making popcorn...<br>

You are mixing what Bridh and I said.  And you ended up attacking us both, but that is because we agree.<br>
<br>
I keep hearing you say, strongly,  that you feel nothing you did was your fault and that you are fine with the situation as it is.   <br>
<br>
If that was actually true and you weren't acting defensively at this point, you are an incredibly stupid person.  I can't believe that is true.<br>
<br>
I have no problem backing off or shutting up altogether if the message has been received.  But I won't just go away.  <br>
<br>
I don't like how you handled that situation, who cares how Amae handled it?  She is dealing with it, and responsibly and in a mature way.  I have nothing but praise for her. <br>
<br>
And then there is this shit.<br>
<br>
I don't know whether to slap you awake or feed you a baby bottle and check your diaper.  Perhaps your age is in question too? That would explain alot and I could be asking too much, but no one has hit me with a hammer and tried to get my attention that was the case.  <br>
<br>
As a grown adult above the age of 18 (I make certain assumptions here) you are responsible for your actions.  Taken into account the further type of relationship it was that increases your share of the responsibility, and yet I don't see one iota of anything falling from your lips in the form of a &quot;sorry it had to come to this&quot; which you should be able to say because again, we assume you are the better, more responsible and mature person.  <br>
<br>
If I am wrong in any way about the above situation I will gladly go back to name calling and insults.  Because it will have gone from wake up time to earning time.<br>
<br>
Flame me, beat on me, pee in my cereal, but it won't take away from your own responsibility, and as I mentioned before up above, you are the only one that you have to answer to, but people are watching.<br>
<br>
If you don't think you owe us all in the community a little more respect, then we have had our warning for future dealings with you.  <br>

<br>
Apep ive never had anything against you, in my previous characters we have talked a little but not much, we dont know each other, we dont RP with each other, this is coming from someone who before this was completely tabula rasa with you. Saying it very plainly i think that what you did here was wrong. I think you blew things out of proportion. I think you took liberties that you had no fuckin right to take and most importantly I think that you are the reason that this situation ended the way it did.<br>
<br>
You want to know something? In the years ive been playing ive found out that RP only works if there is a good ooc relationship between players, what you did shows very clearly that you not only do not know that but you also could care less. As of this moment ive lost what little respect i had for you, because yes beleive it or not my respect is earned not just birthed into existance by someone's reputation/name. If you had a problem in character you should have a) come and talked to Inthul as Apep instead of just reacting as PoApep without considering the consequences and b) actually thought about what your selfishness would cause.<br>
<br>
To be very blunt I am with Brutin on this, everything youve posted here just makes you look more and more like the silly ass you seem to be. Congratulations Apep, youve shown me what a true bastard can do when he sets his mind to it.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL22/566694/847606/16089876.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
I would state this:<br>
<br>
EQ is a game.  It is meant to be fun.  If you are not having fun, stop playing and get down the pub/club or whatever you do.  The person who quit was not having fun.  Good luck to her.<br>
<br>
Apep has fun playing his game.  Let him play it his way.  From the sounds of it, he did warn the offended about the possibilities of the roleplay, warnings not heeded, not his problem.<br>

Hey Apep.  Just a small warning for that small mind.<br>
<br>
You are acting tough, but we can see through to that little boy interior.  <br>
<br>
You aren't proving how tough you are or how righteous I am.  I didn't just blither away (blither means bitch for no reason) because I listened to others on here, notably Bridh who said the same thing I did in a very calm and quiet tone.<br>
<br>
Now perhaps the others can see why I go to the extremes I do.  You won't listen to her calmly, but you damn well listened to me.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know what I am dealing with in you.<br>
<br>
I expected too much of you.<br>

<br>
(*seal of approval*)<br>
<br>
Brutin, And Bridh, and Syll and Sar and whoever else wants to.. you can really attack me all you want. I really don't mind. I set up Kuladen to be 'that guy'... the guy everyone makes fun of for the joke. If you have read any of his stories or his Rp you'll see that. He's a walking punchline. <br>
<br>
So when I talk about coloring books, it may seem vapid to you, but alls I am doing is trying to bring a little smile to the people playing the game. Reminding them that this is ALL ABOUT A GAME.. because frankly sometimes I think people forget that. They get huffy, and puffy, and start pissing on the other guilds, and whatnot. <br>
<br>
When you attack me, then, for being all flapping gums, and whatnot.. you do not deter me. You don't injure me, or even make me pause. If nothing else you goad me. Whether you like it or not you are the Moe to my Curley... the angry one who bops people on the head. I don't mind being a stooge. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying everything I say is funny. Sure, I'd like it to be, and I do try... but I realize that I'm not. <br>
<br>
That said:<br>
<br>
I don't know a lot about the apep/Amaelwhatever/Brutin thing. I know she quit only because of some notes she left some of her friends at saga. I knew she was a slave of Apep's. I know enough math to put 2+2 together. <br>
<br>
I have dealt with Apep's rp before. Kuladen the gnome had silver lances driven underneith his fingernails for trying to warn his wife of the attack. THEN he was tortured and killed. When I read what happened to my beloved creation I can tell you I'm not the only one who sat staring at the screen for a couple of minutes. <br>
<br>
Apep, and some of the great RPers in Ebon Storm, are dark. Like he said, they are not light, fluffy Drizzts. <br>
<br>
That much I know. <br>
<br>
Again, I don't know much about the sitatiuon. I didn't know her, I didn't know she was 17, I don't know what made her quit. <br>
<br>
End of that.<br>
<br>
Brutin.. I've never really had a problem with your ideas. More people should have ideas more. Like Bridh.. sometimes I even agreed (though it was rare). Because you are too confrontational. You bring out a nail-gun to press a thumbtack into cork board. Like I have said before.. you can almost imagine your fingers flying over the keyboard, your eyes red, and spit on the screen from the anger you seem to have. <br>
<br>
I have a master's in communications. And so I do know this: the WAY you communicate is almost as important as WHAT you communicate. Just something for you to think about.<br>
<br>
<br>
To sum up<br>
<br>
Kuladen: walking punchline<br>
Po Kuladen: A good guy really<br>
Apep: Known to be dark<br>
Brutin: Watch how you say things<br>
<br>
Tear me apart if you will. Frankly I'm surprised people are paying attention to me. <br>

I know you think you know what you are talking about.  But consider what you just said.<br>
<br>
It's just a game and if you aren't having fun, do whatever it takes to do it.  And it seems regardless of what it does to others.<br>
<br>
Pretty poetic for a dumbass.<br>
<br>
You are responsible for your actions, in and out of this game.  That is reality my little unstable friend.  That doesn't give you the right to sum up what Dickless did by saying &quot;Hey, somewhere in there he most certainly have had to warn the poor bitch, not his problem.&quot;  <br>
<br>
You will understand this more when you are old enough to vote.<br>
<br>
What irks me is people giving an opinion who don't take the time to consider what they are saying and stand for the wrong side.<br>
<br>
Fuck Apep and what he did, he was wrong, he is acting like a jackass now thinking he is saving face and along comes your dumbass trying to tell him it was okay because she should have known better.<br>

Apep, I talked to you at length about this.<br>
So, there's no point in dragging that back out.<br>
<br>
I'm saddened that you're missing the whole point...<br>
<br>
Or maybe I am. I still don't know what your issue was.  An IC issue would be you, as Brutin said before, powermoding, and I didn't think that was your style. Sar asked for permission and got it.  That should have been the end of it.  <br>
<br>
I was only made a bit angry by being told by you that you weren't gonna bother RPing with me because my silly ass couldn't handle it.  Not your place to take the choice out of my hands.  But since you did, it just seems to me that you're mad about something happening that you didn't want.  Apep should have asked Sar what she was going to do with the slave, if he'd have given a shit about said property at all.<br>
<br>
I'm not angry about it anymore, but I'm not going to sit here and let you trash Amae, me and Inthul(even without names) without defending myself, IC and out. <p><center><b><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner"><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sarsig2.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kuladen@firionavie>Kuladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/25/02 7:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: </span><hr size=1> (*pulls to try to get himself out of the hole he has dug himself*)<br>

I'd like to point out again that I don't know anything about the Amea situation. Like Syll said.. most of us don't. <br>
<br>
to be clear: I REALLY don't know what happened.. don't think I want to.<br>
<br>
I just know what happened with me. And I know I was warned that if I continued down the line I was that bad things were gonna happen. I went anyway. Granted.. I thought bad was being thrown in jail, not having silver roses driven through parts of my body.. but Kuladen was going to be rerolled anyway so I went along with it. He died off camera (thank God!) heh.<br>
