<br>
It really is a pity that fellow gamers have grown into such hating individuals. Your persuit of a Roleplaying Server has left you blind and bitter, I only wish you will some day realize how you yourselves transformed into the very people you are out to hunt.<br>
<br>
If it is your intent to spread the word about me and my friends, telling everyone to add my name and theirs to the Ignore list, making everyone promise not to interact with us - Well, then I truely pity you. It wont make us leave, it will just make you look ever-so-more foolish.<br>
<br>
I consider this pointless rant over, I will not reply to it anymore. I will read and reply to the other Forums, offering my tid bits, untill the Forum Administrator would see fit to ban me. This is as much a home for me as it is to you, if you cant grasp the concept of co-existance, then I dont think you were wronged in any way by the previous &quot;d00d&quot; encounters. But I'm certain whatever treatment they gave you, is exactly what you would warrant for carrying the &quot;Holier than thou&quot; attitude.<br>

Non-Rpers on &quot;our&quot; server.<br>
People forcing me to RP a certain way.<br>
<br>
I would really hate this to become Firiona Vie (intolerance server - flaming recommended) after such a promising start. I to will start ignoring the heated argument threads - I don't play Everquest just to enter a world where anonimity gives people the assumtion they can be unreasonable.<br>
<br>
I wish everyone could now realise that we have our long sought after RP server, and we should do everything we can to make it the most pleasant and friendly server in the game.<br>

However, I can speak for myself and I am sure many in the fist feel asimiliar...I will not do so at the behest of sacrificing values and beliefs because others wish to impinge upon them. I myself am by nature an open minded individual.<br>
<br>
Sure everyone is going to have their own views on RP and what not. Great, fine...look at RL D&amp;D groups...thats why there are so many groups out there. But as to the point when I have to log into this server someday and be a minority on an RP server because non-rpers show up and decide they don't want to RP...somethings wrong there.<br>
<br>
I think EmberMae pretty much summed up everything in the other thread that touched on that last statement. I don't hate anybody in EQ, hate is a strong emotion and one thats a waste of energy in my opinion. Quite frankly I'd rather be doing other things.<br>
<br>
No one will spread any word of any kind whatsoever. People know why this server was made. It is no secret. People that go against the grain of the server will find themselves unhappy because they arent playing along with the rest of the server. Think of it like breaking the law. Guys go into rob a bank...someone gets upset.<br>
<br>
While these non-rp'ers might possibly be good people, that does not excuse coming to do something thats the exact opposite of specifically explicit intentions. This is exactly how EQ became the way it did in the first place.<br>
<br>
At release everyone RP'ed and NO ONE ever broke character. I not once ever saw anyone break character or uber out. This in mind considering I am someone that likes to sit back occassionally and chew the fat with the brotherhood over RL stuff on occassion as I would sitting at a table over a D&amp;D game when theres a break.<br>
<br>
Then uber guilds came into play. Now we have all the blue servers as they stand right now. The role reversed. Now Verant makes a spefic server for role players. Now people show up stating they do not wish to role play nor do they have the patience. They get mad when people are upset they appear. No offense, but you really have no right at being upset. You all knew this was a server for Role Playing, NOT powergaming. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umorrizarthesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morrizar the Sorcerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/2/01 2:01:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: and yet again I am forced to say, Hrmmm</span><hr size=1> Um, although at release a few more people did RP, nowhere near 100% did, probably 30% on my server anyways.

Eventually the Pyramid group says run on down we need ya. Then finding that they have one of those AWESOME bards who not only plays their class well but also RP's well even when the rest of us don't. I absolutely love this type of RP'er, they are make EQ a joy to play.

<br>
The only people you will probably ever find in sebelis fighting there are going to be evils. Why? Because frogloks follow a GOOD god. Now if Angelic Descent is planning on being good, which makes sense for the name...then your going to have an awfully hard time grouping with people or finding pick up groups. Something to consider.<br>
<br>
I believe in the mindset, never attack another...only defend. If someone does make that sort of character and flames you...that to me (RP'er or not) is not someone I want to be around or associate with.<br>

Its not that they hate powergamers or ubers, its that they don't want to see what they so desperately wanted to become ruined by an influence that would go against the grain of the inception for the server.<br>
<br>
Example, in a game of D&amp;D you don't play with people that won't refuse to RP. It's pointless. <br>
<br>
If you had a hobby that you liked and did this hobby at a certain spot where it was curtailed to your needs...then someone else comes along with a different way of doing your hobby and its not anything at all like how the place was built that was curtailed to your needs, how would you feel?<br>
<br>
Consider you were already elsewhere and saw what might potentially be. How would you feel? I think thats what people are trying to convey. They don't want to see their place ruined.

 <br>
They simply despair at what everything else is,and believe that the fact that Verant has set up a &quot;roleplay-friendly&quot; server to mean that we should roleplay here.<br>
 <br>
Not roleplaying here is throwing sand in the gears of everyone that does. And there's a good number of ways to roleplay,many many ones in fact-but NOT roleplaying or intending to trips em all up. It takes an unbroken circuit of players for an RP server to work properly-and here you are telling them you're going to pull up stakes and drop a  _guild's_ worth of non-RPers to play here.<br>
 <br>

This is what will happen, alot of the RP'ers have said it. I'm more then happy to interact, I just haven't got the time to RP for half an hour before a raid, theres enough BS before a raid as it is.. This is a tired argument all of my points have been lost and I'm holding myself  back from all out flaming. Raikor said to me to give up, he was right. We are the proverbial boogie-man. I would just like to thank Bludge Dredd, he took the time to think out his posts and tried to look at it from our viewpoint. Firiona Vie was designed mainly for RP'ers but verant killed 2 birds with one stone. They stopped RP'ers whining &amp; they stopped people looking for a challenge whining. This isn't about being first, although it will be nice to attempt raids w/o awesome gear, this is about renewing that new feeling everything had when you were a newb, of course short of a stroke, its impossible to renew it completely, i spent 2 and a half hours looking for the necro guild, I'm not about to fake I don't know where things are =P.

If that's the way you feel, play on a different server.  It's really that simple.  I don't think you're wrong, per se, but I do think that this server (based on what you've said) is wrong for you.<br>
<br>
Would an alcohol salesman be welcome at a al-anon meeting?<br>
<br>
Would a spiked hairdo go over well at a prep-gala?<br>
<br>
Would someone demanding that everyone speak english be welcomed at a bar in Calais?  I think not.<br>
<br>
You seem to have misconstrued why this server was set up the way it was.  This was not to allow people to raise in level without great gear available, or to add additional challenges.  Verant themselves said that they regretted the necessity of adding the restrictions.  Heck, in a month all that super gear is going to be flowing around for sale.  This server was set up for RP and to combat the points that RP'ers have been complaining about:<br>
<br>
1.  Rampant Twinking--hard to twink when there's 1 char per account.<br>
<br>
2.  Auction making zones unplayable -- EC on Druzzil Ro comes to mind.<br>
<br>
3.  Power-gaming -- it's not worthwhile to camp a mob for days on end if you're getting neither loot NOR xp.<br>
<br>
4.  Uber guilds -- yes, I'm sure there'll be a couple of ubers out there, but they'll be the minority.  Tough to make the 'perfect' raid party when you can't have the Necros and the Clerics in the same guild/party.<br>
<br>
<br>
There you have it.  I can't tell you that you shouldn't play on this server and I'm not going to.  I will say that, if you do play on this server, then you shouldn't allow your actions to negatively affect others.  Otherwise you're going to have a very boring time of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unumtini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numtini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/01 5:52:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What Bane said.</span><hr size=1> I read the Angelic Descent webpage, I don't believe you belong on this server.

On bertoxxulous the economy is so screwed up it isn't funny. The jewlery economy is now screwed completely, THANKYOU ELEXXIE. (Just a heads up to anyone who plays on Bertox, Elexxie is intentionally crashing the Jewlery economy to make a killing, she was actually dumb enough to tell me that.) Any items farmed will be kept in the guild if at all possible, I have friends on bertoxx still wondering whether or not to come and I will help them get up with the rest of the guild.<br>
Why do you feel the need to pick apart my posts Numtini? Don't deny it, I've said multiple times that we want to co-exist. I'm no longer replying to these posts because I can't stand everything positive I say being completely ignored.<br>
Please go and read the rest of my posts if you haven't.<br>
The use of these posts has come to an end. I think Bludge and Fritz (Amongst others) were being quite reasonable and actually taking a look at our posts. In hindsight I wish we hadn't posted, at least then you could have made an Unbiased decision. <p><font size="2" face="verdana" color="Gold"><b>Morrizar<BR><font size="1.5" color="black">Sorcerer of Angelic Descent <BR>Guild Merchant</b></font>

It's called PnP. In accordance to PnP you MUST share a camp spot. If the current campers in question refuse, then petition and wait for staff to intervene. If the campers refuse to share, the campers are physically removed from the zone by staff. I know, I've seen it happen with my own eyes. I for one have used this when dealing with greedy ubergamers or powergamers. I will in fact do it again.<br>
<br>
Laws are made to upkeep balance and see that all things are kept fair, true, and even. If these individuals break this enough, they will be banned. It's very simple. Most of the ubers and powergamers that I have met have always stated they do not wish to adhere to PnP. PnP is the LAW which governs EverQuest's playability. No one is above that, despite what they may think. They tell people things such as &quot;PnP is weak and for a wuss to follow&quot;, so that they may continue to abuse others and try to suppress and downtrod upon others that they may have their way regardless of who is in their road.<br>
<br>
Will I support PnP? You betcha, I encourage it. I have also yet to date encounter a role player that will not share and will not support PnP. Rules were made to keep the peace and keep people safe and see that all people get a fair shake. This includes those that would attempt to Farm. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukatieeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katie EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/01 12:20:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What Bane said.</span><hr size=1> My problem is with the PnP is abused.  If I were a druid and I sat waiting for the spawn in HHP for the testament of vanear I'd be pretty upset with someone who walks in 30 minutes before the spawn, enforce the PnP and have me ported out.  I can see PnP when someone is repeatively camping something over and over.<br>
<br>
I have never used PnP, I do what someone has mentioned.  I see something camped, I move on.  If it is something I really want, I ask the people there to notify my when they leave.  To me it just makes things more peaceful, and things run more smoothly.<br>

<br>
I will be encouraging and using PnP against ANYONE that I know has stated they fully intend to farm. That includes anyone I see wearing Angelic Descent guildtags if that indeed happens to indeed be the continual intentions of you and your fellow guildmates.<br>
<br>
As I said before, the people that do not want to see PnP enforced are always the people that wish to abuse the rules. NO ONE is above the law, and those that think they are oft are the ones to see a rude awakening.  <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubludgedredd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bludge Dredd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/3/01 12:43:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   and yet again I am forced to say, Hrmmm</span><hr size=1> Every time I've ever seen the play nice policy invoked it has been in relation to bullying tactics.  I've been in groups where a member has petitioned for PNP and I've been at a camp when someone comes along and invokes it as well.  Never once have I seen it used to &quot;driver off ubers&quot; or whatever.  Most typically it is used by people who have no respect for others and do not want to wait to get their spawn.  <br>
<br>
The way the game works is for people to sit on long spawns for ages until they get what they came for.  The TLC will do wonders for alleviating some of the tensions that come with spawn, but you will still see people fussing and fighting over camps.  <br>
<br>
It is and always has been my opinion that people who invoke the PNP every time someone is hunting the critters that *they* would like to hunt are simply troublemakers who are impatient and can't bear to wait a bit for their chance at &quot;what they deserve&quot;.   The PNP has been a miserable failure and always results in hurt feelings.  More often than not it is not evoked to resolve a particular spawn dispute but rather as a means to intimidate and coerce other players into bending to the will of the petitioner.  Far from the scenario laid out by Banegrivm, it is usually the PNP invokers who are the ones looking to suppress and &quot;downtrod&quot; others. When someone uses the PNP on a group I am in, I usually leave.  If I am in a group and someone decides they want to steal a camp from another group by invoking PNP, I disband and go along my way.<br>
<br>
When I come to a camp and it already has someone there, I ask to join. If they say no, I move along. Simple and easy.<br>
<br>
I am beginning to realize that there is very little difference between the people who are most vocal about FV and those who are most vocal about SZ.  Same strategies, same tactics, same attitude. Simply different language.  I just wish people would be nicer to one another and not be so aggressive and hateful.<br>
<br>
On SZ, I was strongly against corpse camping and griefing in general. That view is the exception as most people view it as &quot;the intention of the no rules server&quot;.  Those people tend to get upset when you differ with them on that issue or any other.  Here it is the goosestepping rhetoric of purity that is the chant.  &quot;This is the RP server&quot;.  Again, differeing with those people with the goal of trying to achieve a little bit of mutual respect for each others is shouted down as not &quot;hardcore RP&quot; enough.  Instead of &quot;Go back to your bluebie server poon!&quot;, here it is &quot;Go back to your phat lewtz dOOd!&quot;.

Quite simple, they do not want to be in a RP environment and plan on abusing the economy, go to another server. Its pretty plain and simple. Common sense.<br>
<br>
I have only used PnP twice. Will I do it again? Anytime I see ANYONE trying to throw their weight around or outright state they will farm. They don't like it? Their are other servers.<br>
<br>
First time I saw an uber in unrest who tried to steal my groups camp from us and started KS'ing us. He was 50 plus, we were hunting there. Why wasn't he in kunark or vellious getting uber gear? He claimed he needed boots for his warrior. I petitioned, he got booted.<br>
<br>
Second time was a lad that tried to start KSing my group at the Loathsome individuals and then he tried to train us. I petitioned, he got forcibly ejected. They want to be abusive, they want to throw their weight around...then they are welcome to meet the brick wall called PnP. It is plain and simple and no one is above it.<br>
<br>
I never hesitate to share and myself and my guild have oft even invited strangers from out of the blue and even other guilds to our camps. We have even handed camps over to those more in need then ourselves. I don't see the problem. We respect others and the system and laws as they may be. I do not respect ANYONE who abuses them or thinks they are above them. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=9.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=9.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=9.topic&start=61&stop=66>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=9.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=9.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=9.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=9.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
