Here's why:<br><br>After reviewing (way too?) many posts on alternate advancement, I determined &quot;run speed 3, regen 3&quot; was the &quot;norm&quot; for alternate advancement for a warrior.  While I understand the importance of run speed (allows you to run at pseudo sow speed in dungeons and thus able to pull mobs back to your group without getting battered to a pulp before getting there), I never really got the argument for putting points into regen.  <br><br>Sure, regen allows you to....regen faster (wow, pure brilliance!), but as a warrior with all those creamy hit points, I didn't see the value of improving my regen rate since it seemed like it would take soooo long (even with improved regen) to...regen that many hitpoints (wow, how many times can I use the word regen in a paragraph?).<br><br>A few words on lifestyle -- I often find myself in that most unenviable position of being solo (must be my sparkling personality).  Therefore, what I often need is the ability to solo something (ANYTHING!!!) that will allow me to gain experience while I am in social outcast mode.  I have the ability to self-buff to improve my ac over 1000, I have good weapons, (though Wavecrasher would make my life complete...anyone have one for trade?), so here I am, all dressed up and ready to solo.<br><br>I often go to the area outside Karnor's Castle -- plenty of Drolvargs and Cockatrices and spiders to keep me happy (and earning a modicum of exp).  I fight one (or two as the cae may be, depending on mob), and this takes me down to half my hps.  I bind wound to 50%.  Now, if I did have improved regen, I could sit on my duff and wait to recover hps before going back into battle.  However, I am a warrior (dammit!) and I want some action...NOW! (ARGH! WOOF! WOOF! GRUNT, SNARL).  So I bind wound to 50% (max before aa), and take on another doggie.<br><br>Since I am starting at 50% hps, it's a close fight...very close...too close....ok, I've died several times cutting it just a bit too close (yes, I know the zone is right there).  If I had juuuuust a bit more hps, I would be able to solo dark and light blues nonstop (without an excess of duff sitting) and I wouldn't even mind that I have been spurned by all of Norrath.<br><br>Now, how can alternate advancement help me in this situation (a situation that I find myself in quite often)?<br><br>I could put my points in regen which would allow me to sit on my duff and regen faster.  Thus, I could bind to 50%, sit and med a bit longer before starting in on that next mob.  That would solve the problem but sitting on my butt is not my style of play (well...ok...I am sitting on my butt while playing the game and I like doing that...but....um..../scratches head and continues); bottom line, no patience, it's not me (or...er...Medite..really, I can separate the two -- it's ROLEPLAYING...WEEEEEEE).  <br><br>Or I could put alt advancement into improved stamina, which would increase my hit points.  Hmmmmmmm.  My thinking on this is that increased stamina and hps can be obtained through equipment, so why waste a &quot;skill&quot; point improving something that can be improved with better gear.  I realize that there is (in theory) a limit to the amount of stamina and hps you can get from gear, and that at some point (in theory) the only way to get it any higher would be to have increased stamina as a natural ability, but I have to believe that this point is waaaaaaaaay down the line for me and that from 51 to 60, I will be able to steadily improve my stamina and hps through the acquisition of better gear.<br><br>Finally (well, there are more alt advance choices to discuss but my Rallos this is a long post), I could put my points into improved bind wound and start the fight at 60% hps instead of 50% hps.  I chose this route.  I think the extra 10% hps (280hps gained this way) has helped stabilize my solo life.  I think that it would take longer to regen 280 hps than to bind 280 hps, and I also think that one point into improved stamina would not get me an additional 280hps, and on top of all this I can now bind my heal-deprived bretheren (and sisters...hubba, hubba).  <br><br>Now, I realize that by doing so I have simply replaced sitting and medding with hitting that damn bind wound button (and I've also incurred the extra cost of all those bandages and the inconvenience of having less space to carry all that phat Cockatrice lewt), but for me (um..Medite), being a better wound binder (say that five times fast) has been great -- I can now edge out those doggies, it adds to that whole self-sufficiency aspect of my personality, and gives me an excuse to lay my grubby mitts on beautiful warrior women all under the guise of binding their wounds past 50%.<br><br>Lunch time is about over, why can't I be smart like my colleagues and just call in sick on Fridays before long holiday weekends?<br><br>Medite Marconus<br>51 Seasons of Dreaming of Improved Bind Wound and Seeking to Justify It in Anyway Possible<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthavian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thavian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>always dead halfling druid</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/30/02 5:05:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Run Speed 3 - Now what?</span><hr size=1> I don't know why a soloing warrior doesnt have AA bind wounds as well as regen 3.<br> I have 3 AA Regen and I now regen 8 points when resting(no regen items either) after soloing as well as binding to 50%(almost to 1 AA BW).  <br>I am putting most of my exp into AA points to get BW &amp; RS as well as the regen i have so I can solo as much as I can carry in bandages. <br>Once I have between 7 to 9 AA points done i should be close to 55 and can save those new aa points for the good AA skills. <br>I can also buff myself to 115AC depending on weapons i use to 120AC with turtle skin(lodi boots), so soloing is a pain in the arse but makes for good aa points. <p><center><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=318896">Takash Bladedclaws</b></center><center>52nd Champion of the Vah Shir</center><center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/theindigovoid">Indigo Void</a></center><center>Firiona Vie</center></center><center>Defender & Slave to the Teir’Dal Priestess Braraa Escrire</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umediteman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mediteman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/30/02 6:36:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Run Speed 3 - Now what?</span><hr size=1> Takash:<br><br>I love dungeons and I do find (good?) groups from time to time (though not as often as I'd like) so the thought of run speed 3 is still enticing to me (sow speed inside a dungeon at all times, what a concept).<br><br>I will likely put three aa points into bind wound and then decide if I want to put points into run speed.

The extra 60hps would do you well now perhaps in getting you through levels faster but in the end youll have 255 regardless of what you chose wether to hit up the general skill for 10 total stamina or use it elsewhere.<br><br>Coin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubloodandsin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bloodandsin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/31/02 8:25:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Run Speed 3 - Now what?</span><hr size=1> I took a  little bit of everyone's advice.
