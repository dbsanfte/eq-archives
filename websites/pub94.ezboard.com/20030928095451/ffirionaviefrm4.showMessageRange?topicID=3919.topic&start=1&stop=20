I'll go ahead and don my flame-proof jacket now, as I have a feeling that as I reveal my own stupidity and gullibility, flames may come my way.  Sobeit.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I was the victim of a scam.  I was auctioning to trade PP from FV to Morell Thule - a large sum of it.  A player named Dirfrops responded and a conversation ensued.  He informed me he had PP on Morell Thule and wished to do the trade.  Now, understand - I've done cross-server trades many times.  I did a cross-server trade to get PP on Firiona, and over the last few years, I've never had a problem - because I've learned the golden rule of *never trust anyone*.  Always trade in small increments.  Always be cautious.  Anyway, Dirfrops did something that other players in the past had not offered to do - he offered to call me on the phone and talk one-on-one to ensure confidence in the trade.  Immediately I agreed and he called.  He seemed nice enough - a teenager obviously (19 at the most), who obviously had some knowledge about EQ.  We spoke for 15 minutes or so when we finally started the trade.  During that time, I figured &quot;What the heck - the guy seems nice enough, honest enough, and he's on the phone with me.  So I'll go ahead and trade my PP to him lump sum.&quot;  And that's all she wrote.  The next thing I know - *click* the phone is hung up - and I no longer get replies when messaging Dirfrops.  It's immediately apparent to me that everything this person has told me over the phone - where they live, what they do, their name, the fact that they even had PP to trade on Morell - was a lie.  Of course I'm feeling amazingly angry and stupid all at the same time.  It's obvious that it was a scam.  <br>
<br>
I'm a 5 year EQ veteran, have come across all types, and generally error on the side of caution usually.  This time was the obvious exception.  My point is twofold.  I got taken because I had faith that a person's word MEANS SOMETHING.  It doesn't.  One would think that actually SPEAKING on the phone to a person, talking about life, work, etc would make a difference and would say something about their integrity.  Well it does say something about their integrity - it says they have none.  It says you cannot trust anyone, regardless of how well you think you know them online, how much you've spoken to them on the phone.  What it also says is how SAD it is that people have absolutely NO integrity or honesty within them whatsoever.  It's SAD that someone would lie to your face and take that which took you 3 years to earn and then go and sell it on PlayerAuctions or for some other use.  Frankly, I don't know how these people sleep at night.  I don't know how they can look themselves in the mirror each day and live with themselves.  They wouldn't know the meaning of the word &quot;character&quot; if it hit them across the face.  <br>
<br>
My lesson has been learned and I'll take my medicine like a good boy and go on just fine.  However, I have two things to say.  One - be careful.  Be careful of this person (Dirfrops) and any other characters he may be playing on seperate accounts.  Be careful of people in general.  The moral of this story is also not to do cross-server trades - not to trust people at all.  It's embarassing to myself and others.  I'm not the first - and I won't be the last.  <br>
<br>
Secondly - I have something to say to Dirfrops himself (assuming he reads this).  I want you to know that you got a big chunk of change and I'm sure you laughed all the way to the bank.  I want you to know that you haven't ruined my enjoyment of Everquest in any way.  Yes, it was disappointing, but I intend to log in today and enjoy myself despite spineless exploiters.  I want you to know that all you have done is take another piece of your soul and thrown it down the garbage disposal.  I hope it was worth it.  I hope that it was worth sacrificing your integrity for some pixels on the screen or for a few dollars you might get online.  I also want you to know that there are *always* consequences.  Bet on it.  You will be held accountable for what you've done.  No - it may not be by me, because I didn't get your RL information.  But rest assured - you will pay - and when you do, the &quot;EQ play money&quot; or the RL money you get for selling it, won't come close to being worth it.  It's sad.  It's sad that at the end of your days, your soul with be worth nothing.  Despite all this, I want you to know that I will pray for people like you.  I'll pray that despite your evil tendencies will catch up with you and that you'll see the error of your ways and make amends.  As gullible as I was this one time, I am still better off than you - a person without hope.  I pray you'll find it.  It's never too late.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

<br>
1.  This will be mentioned time and again but this is a risk you take in these types of trades.  You gave a person you have known for all of 15 minutes a substantial amount of platinum and it is naive to assume that their word is their bond based on that limited interaction.  Like most scam artists, he acted in a way (in this case, offering to call you) that would lower your defenses.  You gut suckered.  You seem to understand it was a risk you took and no use lecturing you.  <br>
<br>
2.  That is about the shittiest thing you can do to someone.  I saw Dirfrops in BoT yesterday LFG and, if what you say is true, I am not grouping with him or helping him ever.  I think Difrops is ebayed and the person that did this to you is probably not the original PoDirfrops.  Hell, it makes you wonder if PoKajinn bought Dirfrops.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=3788.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...3788.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
3.  First you say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyway, Dirfrops did something that other players in the past had not offered to do - he offered to call me on the phone and talk one-on-one to ensure confidence in the trade. Immediately I agreed and he called.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Then you say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You will be held accountable for what you've done. No - it may not be by me, because I didn't get your RL information.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you are serious about wanting to prevent this from happening again, you *can* help stop this.  If he called you, your phone company should have a record of what phone number called you and you may be able to trace him down.  Assuming he is a teenager, he likely has parents who would not be too pleased to learn what he does as a hobby.  I would go through your phone records and see if there is any way to track him down (I bet there is).  If you are able to track him down, I would try calling him or writing a letter to his parents.  Of course, it will be hard to prove he did anything as it will be he said/she said.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>

Bottom line - no one is justifying the use of cross-server trades.  No one is saying it wasn't stupid to participate in one.  It was stupid.  What I'm saying is - it might be a good idea to distance yourself from this individual. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chasefv>ChaseFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#339933><b>Keeper of the Trades' Scrolls</b></font></span><br>  Posts: 376<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/03 10:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3919.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warning about Dirfrops - and a lesson for all</span><hr size=1> Cross-server trades are not illegal, and are not specifically addressed in the EULA or other SOE policies. They are simply strongly frowned upon by the FV community, as this is a server where most (not nearly all anymore) of us worked up to where we are from scratch. As a community, FV tends to be less tolerant of d00ds, twinks and ebayers than most of the other servers, because those are the very things that drove most of us here in the first place. It is discouraging to see such things taking place, but it is not illegal.<br>
<br>
It *is* against the rules of this message board to offer cross-server trades here though, but that was a decision made by the Administrators of the board, and in no way reflects the opinions of SOE on the matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teapray>Teapray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/03 1:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3919.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~abenlen/yawn.JPG height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warning about Dirfrops - and a lesson for all</span><hr size=1> If someone is willing to rip someone else of then they are willing to be a thief.

I know that I pay the phone company extra lewt every month to keep my name and nukber unlisted, so I doubt that they will hand you over personal records just because you say you want them. I might be wrong about this, but I doubt it. this could leave them open to all sorts of trouble if say...oh you drove over and killed the guy.<br>

<br>
Cross server trading of Ingame items is ok but generally not smiled upon . . . tends to detract from the ambience of the world of Norrath hence FV doesn't like it - HOWEVER RL transfers of ANY TYPE ie RL money or RL ITEM for TOON-ANYTHING is ILLEGAL and will result in IMMEDIATE BANNING from FV. <br>
<br>

But he/she made it very very plain as to what was ok. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dirfrops>dirfrops</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/23/03 12:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3919.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Warning about Dirfrops - and a lesson for all</span><hr size=1> Im going to respond once and only to this, as im not wanting to start a back and forwarth flame fest among my fellow Firiona Vie players.<br>
<br>
Firslty, I want to state, that I have none, zero, zilch to do with this at all in any way shape or for.  Now on to the fun stuff<br>
<br>
<br>
Your all saying well, hrm Russ that sounds a whole whole lot better, we believe you you didnt do it.  Well thats what I want, but I expect nothing.  But let me say, I have played this server since Oct 24 2001 and my reputation has been nothing but great, except for being a bit drunk an inapropreate with my speech, I am perfect as a 29 year old man can be.<br>
<br>
Nextly onto why this is happeneing to me. To be quite frank I have no clue what so ever. Infact the person accusing me of this hasnt contacted me about it at all, I was informed of this by an officer of a guild I was applying to at the time.  So yea, I dont know what hes or she is talking about.<br>
<br>
Lastly, your all saying well hell, thats the lamest story I ever head.  And well yea alot of times the truth is lame, I could fill this with antics about me saving somone life IRL and being Arnold future Gov. of Cali, but well im not.<br>
<br>
And think of it this way, If I were go in game do a /who all and then take the first name the SoE server spits back at me, and make a post here about how you scammed me in a cross server trade, how would you defend youself.  The accusation is untrue, came out of nowhere, and well plainly confusing to be blunt.<br>
<br>
I hope you all belive me, as I have known you all for a very very long time, and if you dont your entitled to your own oponion.<br>
<br>
<br>
But remember, before you judge somone you should walk a mile in their shoes, that way if they get pissed, your a mile away and you have their shoes.<br>

But if I catch the drift of what Dirfrops says it's &quot;I've got a great reputation, it's my word against his, he can't prove anything, and any of you would be helpless if someone decided to ramdomly accuse you of the same thing.&quot;  I've probably missed something... but that is what I got out of it.<br>
<br>
   Well... there is a way to prove it.  Sony keeps internal logs about this sort of thing.  They can track large plat transfer from one person to another.  If the original poster requests it, it can be checked out to see if the money was ever given.  I would guess that you could do the same thing. <br>
<br>
Set up a chat channel with some trusted people from this server, the petition a GM to establish that the logs don't show such a transfer, and report the finding to the people in the channel.  I'm sure that if you really are a victem, this would be the best way to clear up your name.  If the GM didn't respond right away, ask for them to contact various people other than yourself with the results when they come in.<br>
<br>
Really, a false allegation of a crime is a serious thing.  I hope you don't let this slide.  Because I would think that I'm not the only person who is having a bit of trouble swallow the &quot;The OP is just accusing me for the grins of it!&quot; story. <p>-- <br>
