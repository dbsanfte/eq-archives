The more you limit others... the more you try and impose your standards and beliefs on them, the more you'll polarize the sides.  I for one find it commendable that some of the power gamers that are insisting on staying, are at least TRYING to adapt and not effect the overall environment of the server.  There are SO many good roleplayers here I do not feel cheated at all.  Instead of complaining, go find others of a like mind and have FUN.
