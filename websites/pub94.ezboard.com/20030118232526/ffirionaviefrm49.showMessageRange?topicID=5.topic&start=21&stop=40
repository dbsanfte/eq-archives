As far as waking the sleeper? Who the hell cares? Not one guild on this server has a decent shot at it yet and neither wants to until they are &quot;done&quot; with that zone. Don't draw attention away from the real reason Fuvi did this post. He certainly didn't do it to spawn a thread about the pros and cons of waking the sleeper.<br>
<br>
This post is about Fuvi crying like a baby because the guild he was in would not tolerate his actions. This post is about Fuvi being exposed for what he really is.<br>
<br>
C'mon Fuvi, post something to defend yourself. I dare you.<br>

<br>
You're talking about being a decent human being than make a statement like this? So, because one or two guilds might be able to wake the sleeper, but not going to do so until they are done with the zone, that's what makes a decent human being? <br>
<br>
I mean, just because you CAN do something, does it mean you should?<br>
<br>
As to why the post was made, so what? It sounds more like you're trying to divert attention away from what was said than anything else. I know very few people either who are or were in FnF, but I'd like to think more of one of the (if not the) top guild on the server than that. This is a concern to many people, and you brushed it aside as if it's nothing and we shouldn't worry about it because we &quot;aren't at your level of play yet&quot;. Please, tell me I'm wrong here. I don't want to think that, but that's the feeling I have.<br>
<br>

You seem to assume that everyone else here has a clue. We don't. We see what was posted - here, not on some other private FnF boards.<br>
<br>
Just to clarify, to all the folks who know all the gory details, to the rest of us it 'looks' like Fuvi posted info about FnF's plans to wake the Sleeper soon. It 'looks' like there is alot of bad blood both ways. Most of us don't have a freaking clue as to what this big exposure thing is, so referencing it isn't clearing the air in the slightest.<br>
<br>
It also 'looks' like there is alot of dancing around the big question... no flat denials, just alot of &quot;but look at Fuvi&quot; stuff. Saying that you can't do it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  yet</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and you aren't done there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  yet</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and Fuvi is a big loser, and you don't love him anymore, and he hasn't denied your accusations about why he left isn't really the same as refuting what he said, is it?<br>

<br>
However I will say this.<br>
<br>
Yes it has been discussed, its being discussed and it will be discussed again in the future. Everytime it comes up people offer their thoughts and these range from &quot;facts&quot; to more intangible things like &quot;the effect it will have on the server&quot;. Waking the sleeper has come up at least 3 different times in posts or chats since I joined FnF and considering that 2 of those times were at points on this server where we could have our entire guild in there... well, I'll let you all figure out where were at now when we can only put people with keys in there.<br>
<br>
Fuvi can quote Cap as saying &quot;we're gonna wake the sleeper&quot;. I can also quote Cap on saying, &quot;We have no plans on waking the sleeper&quot;. Hell go through the old sleeper threads on the FV boards. I bet you can find one of his comments there.<br>
<br>
My point is that discussing it and doing it are totally different things (obviously). It will always be something ANY guild will consider doing once they believe &quot;they can&quot;. Hell, I even posted that if were gonna wake the sleeper than we shouldn't enter into any agreement with Reso and just farm the crap out of ST like theres no tommorrow. Guess what? Reso got the last batch of warders.<br>

<br>
If you don't wake the sleeper in near future *month perhaps?* then he gets what he wanted, and if you do wake sleeper, then his post appears to be 100% true and makes FNF look like bad guys *shrug*<br>

IV has the most bad ass ranger weapon that is way better then primal or priceless *imo*  so I am safe... cuz IV in Akevha REALLY wants to give me his sword <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Regardless, my impression of Fuvi's post was not to air dirty laundry, as the only accusation that I noticed was FNF planning to wake Kerefam *however you spell it* after obtaining the items they wanted.  I did not notice him calling any people names as others have called him... but then again I am on vacation so I could have missed em. will re read his post in a sec and edit my post if nassecary.  are all the names really nessacary? I understand what it is like to write a post and being pissed off... maybe Apep needs to make a 24 hour rule for everyone :P cant reply to a post until 24 hours after you read it in the soap box hahaha!!<br>

<br>
Want a quote? here's one of mine: &quot;I have no plans on waking the sleeper, also i do not want to wake the sleeper.&quot;<br>
<br>
how about that? Hell it's better than Fuvi's cuz its not quoting what someone else said. You called him what? An upstanding? prominent? or something like that, member? no, he was a member that was kicked out and has a vengeance and a bone to pick. Are you really gonna bevlieve someone who will probably say anything that they can think of(true or not) to get back at those that rejected him? Are you really going to believe someone that, after getting kicked out of a guild, comes to a public forum and posts things said in private? <br>
<br>
I sure as hell wouldn't, and i am extremely surpised that so many of you so readily believe him. He only posted this here to try to hurt us. <br>
<br>
and finally... The sleeper thing is just a discussion. there has been no announced decision whether to wake him or not. Personally, I dont care what the other reasons are, i dont want the whole server hating me because of whatever decision is made. <br>
<br>
and again, please dont let this one point that has NOTHING to do with Fuvi's deguilding confuse the subject. That is not what this thread about.  <p><BR><B>Baroness Veloxia Voluptuous </B><BR>

<br>
if there is something between him and your guild (his ex-guild) then i suggest you folks take it outside.  if he did it to get back at you, or whatever, 'we' (as in, me.  that's all i can really account for) do not really give a damn.  we're more concerned with the factual content of his post than any personal axes he's trying to grind.<br>
<br>
his stated intention was to decry the impending wakening of the sleeper.  as ellywig pointed out, we're not really clued in on your arguement with him, and most likely don't want to be either.  so please stop dragging us into it with the &quot;he did this, he did that, he's despicable, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
you all rushing in to clamp down on him, and the manner you are doing it in (kzan, i'm flabbergasted!) does not lend much credence to your own supposed altruistic intentions.  if you want to show an enemy up and prove how unworthy their opinions are, it's always best to show more class than they do and NOT sink to their level.<br>
<br>
then again, what the hell would i know about it.  *shrugs* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 886<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/23/02 10:32:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Veloxia -<br>
<br>
Ummm... actually, this is what the whole thread IS about, at least to all the non-FnF folks. Why people are or aren't in a particular guild doesn't affect everyone on the server. So, while it may be kind of like watching Jerry Springer to see the flames fly, that part doesn't REALLY matter. The event that might change the game for everyone DOES matter.<br>
<br>
And old quotes don't mean much. Current quotes do. That is the allegation. If the it-was-private-and-shouldn't-have-been-aired-but-it-was-anyhow quote at the start of this thread is current and accurate, then there IS an issue, no matter how many old quotes could be excavated.<br>
<br>
And please quit being shocked that folks give Fuvi some credence. He may have shot his credibility with you, but he hasn't with everyone else, yet. Vague references to what a crud he is/was/is currently being don't mean alot. And if we are supposed to discount his posts because he was 'kicked' and is mad at you, shouldn't we equally discount FnF posts because he 'left' and you are mad at him? Do you see the problem? It is kind of hard to sort out who has the moral high ground when the fight has already started and everyone is yelling, with nothing but the screaming as data.<br>

Yes... this was a completely idiotic thing for Verant to put in the game. Nothing like coding in a griefer quest. /rude the entire design team that thought this whole idea was nifty<br>

I however, will await Fuvi's reply to the &quot;accusations&quot; made against him and respond to those accordingly. If you are all waiting for proof that Fuvi was ejected from our guild because of morally reprehensible actions then I suggest you just sit back and wait.<br>
<br>
Come on Fuvi, deny the claims. I dare you.<br>

Because it has just caused so many problems. Although if ya really look at it, it wont really solve the problem. But alot of people think it will. There will always be things for the high end guilds to bicker about... Verant's stupidity in the design of this zone only makes it a million times worse. Waking Kerafym wont make the problem go away, it will only make relations worse, and there will be some other thing that will be bickered about. <br>
<br>
Besides... Sleepers Tomb is supposed to be revamped in what? october? this probably wont even be an issue then. <br>
<br>
whatever happens, i implore you all to not judge everyone involved. Most of us dont get a vote in the decision.<br>
<br>
EDIT: if you want to discuss waking the sleeper, please do so, there are plenty of threads specifially about Sleepers tomb, waking the sleeper, etc. but please stop bumping this stupid hateful post to discuss it. <br>
<br>
***EDIT#2: I for one am done with this thread. I'm sorry, Fuvi, that you were so hateful, vindictive, and childish as to not only dredge up the past, but to air things said in private, and all out of context as well.

It <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> looks</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like an attempt to hijack the thread away from an uncomfortable subject, without having to directly answer the questions posed.

READ the posts why dont you? Both Vel and I have already said that FnF is discussing it. Just like we have many times. Were not denying it.<br>
<br>
Fuvi posted here slamming FnF.<br>
<br>
We posted that he is doing this cuz he is bitter and a cry baby.<br>
<br>
Discussion ensues regarding the sleeper.<br>
<br>
We post we dont care because we have no defineite plans to wake the sleeper. If we did I'd have that marked on my calander.<br>

<br>
What was posted to start this thread wasn't a 'discussion', it looked like a 'plan' - something about getting a couple more things then doing the dirty deed. And all the &quot;we disccus this every so often&quot; and &quot;we can pull up all sorts of quotes&quot; and &quot;Fuvi sucks&quot; didn't qualify as a plain answer to the accusation. To wit, was that alleged post an actual recent post reflecting the views/plans/intents of your guild leader?<br>
<br>
I don't know why Fuvi posted. You telling me why he posted doesn't help that situation. I don't know you, him, or Veloxia other than through these boards, so all the drama is pretty meaningless. And while I do appreciate something approaching a clear answer, I do note you left yourself some tidy wiggle room in that answer, still.<br>
<br>
Or maybe I am just a cynical old wench who has seen way too many people slide through the verbal loopholes before to just trust implied promises.<br>

Bako said he wanted to wake the sleeper because he was sick of all the bitching that was going on about it (namely the thread Rollen started).  The &quot;little guys&quot; that may come in the zone later had nothing to do with it.<br>
