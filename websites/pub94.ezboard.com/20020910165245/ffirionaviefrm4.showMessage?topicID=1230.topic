<br>
I have seen a disturbing trend in our community lately, with people not knowing how to Properly play their character. You can see that others have noticed this as well, as the cleric thread clearly shows.<br>
<br>
I think we've lost our way, probably because in our lower server population, we don't have enough people telling us how things Should be done. Add to that the fact that there are a lot of people out there who would use roleplaying as an excuse to shaft another character, even to the point of making it harder for them to gain their epic item, and it adds up to some serious trouble. Too many roleplaying nazis, not enough people who have read and adhere to strategy guides.<br>
<br>
Is it hard for them to find such guides? I think not. They are readily available for a small fee and a VERY tiny security breach to your computer, and can be found by any search engine. Why, most of them even help you out in the future by leaving cookies on your system so you don't need to log in every time you get online, and by changing their popup ad content to show you they care.<br>
<br>
My point is that the strategy guides are available. There is also a lot of excellent help available in this very forum, if you can get over your trepidation and ask. We're all in this together.<br>
<br>
As most guides point out, there's a Right way to play a certain character type, and a Wrong way. If you want to advance at all in the game, you need to do certain things not only for your temporary group, but for yourself in the long run.<br>
<br>
Never, under any circumstances, let roleplaying on a server in which roleplaying is only PREFERRED make you make costly Mistakes.<br>
<br>
The cleric thread is a good place to start. As D&amp;D and years of console gaming have shown, the job of a cleric is to heal people. There are some wishy-washy roleplaying nazi types who will no doubt disagree, but that is precisely where we are erring on this server. Clerics heal. The end. They are walking heal (or cure, most good clerics know a bevy of beneficial spells) spells, NOT, and I must make myself clear in this respect, NOT servants of some god abroad in the world to preach their Path. Nobody wants to hear churchy preaching at them. Developers would not even include clerics in a game such as this if they could find a way to mesh a compu-doc with a high fantasy setting.<br>
<br>
The god that you follow in the game is your path to starting cities, certain items, and a certain edgy demeanor. That's where it ends. Aside from that, a cleric should be kept out of battles (that is the job of the Tank...read your strategy guides!), held in reserve like a vial of penicillin or in fantasy terms a healing potion.<br>
<br>
But this extends to more than the cleric class, I've seen it myself. People get all caught up in the &quot;roleplaying&quot; that they forget to lend a guy a hand. To &quot;put the roleplay aside&quot; for a minute. After all, if Verant had meant people to be in some giant religious feud all the time, they would have given characters a stat for Faith or made the gods themselves punish transgressions. But they did not. You know why? Because roleplaying is fine *to a point*, but after that the realities of game mechanics kick in. If you're low on your health and about to take down an uber mob for big big cash rewards and items, it doesn't matter if it's a Tunare follower or a servant of Innoruuk, so long as they CAST THE RIGHT SPELL. Again, you can find the Right spell in guides or by asking for help. Put away your petty little roleplaying concerns.<br>
<br>
Another big problem is that people aren't taking the advice of the older players (I mean, players who have been at it for a while, not physically older in real life) when it comes to spell combinations and thigns of that nature. They've been there, they know what you should do, and if you weren't so stuck on your high horse and prideful, you'd ask for that help. It'd save a lot of needless character death, that's for damned sure.<br>
<br>
There are certain fundamentals from your console training days that here in the big time of online gaming can be adapted to serve you well. For instance, every team should ideally (unless you can't shout to find them or some rp nazi is taking you to task over class/race conflict) consist of certain core individuals. I won't go into too much detail here since you should all know it already, but a few people you need are a Tank, a sub-melee ranged fighter (also acceptable is a backstab type), a magic user either for buffing or for nuking, and as has been said, a healer. If you're the healer in the group, stay your ass out of the fight, med, and be ready to heal up your other team members.<br>
<br>
Honestly, people are beginning to act like they haven't had the training, or have never seen a military movie. This game is about tactics and getting the job done, not being a roleplay jerk. How would anyone advance to epic level if they didn't know some basic, fundamental strategies about teams and actions? The answer is that they would not, and we'd all be in a right fix then wouldn't we??<br>
<br>
I know you want to jump into combat, to show your stuff. I know that you'd like to experience a big part of all computerized roleplaying games. But if you're the healer, your job is to heal. Learn it. Raids, assaults, hell even regular camping can be a deadly business if it is not planned out in strategic detail. You don't hold up your end, everyone could be toast.<br>
<br>
What I would suggest, but which I doubt Verant will implement, is a very SMALL addition to the game, maybe interfaced with the new UI, (XML is amazing), in the form of a program that would let people learn the ins and outs of how to be an Effective and Proper player for their chosen class. I mean, they chose the class and race, they should know what they're doing.<br>
<br>
This program addition would allow people to use a hotkey or a click button, (something fast, unobtrusive and less likely to be messed up by some ignorant newb) that would act as an on/off switch of sorts. Once in a group and a foe has been pulled, if a new player was unsure of how to act, this program would kick in and immediately start acting Properly. They could watch for learning purposes of course, but keyboard and mouse control would need to be handled by the system. Their character would cast what spells were needed at exactly the right time, or in the case of tanks would choose the best target/fight appropriately/switch agro as necessary. This would eliminate human error, and what's more would act so quickly using the computer's reflexes that everything was done exactly as appropriate at the time.<br>
<br>
There'd need to be tweaks of course. For one, tanks should be able to have command phrases that link into this program, that allow them to be put in a request queue for spells and buffs. If the tank is himself using a program, this would really speed up the game, as all spells would be doled out as necessary.<br>
<br>
The only problem I can see with this system is that all the roleplaying nazis out there would piss and moan until Verant instituted a policy where certain races and classes wouldn't get buffs or heals from certain others. However, if that were curtailed, the game would be swift and efficient.<br>
<br>
I'd be interested in finding out what sorts of behaviour are Proper for the other classes, but I'm a relative newcomer to the scene so others would need to help me there. I don't mean the races, I know those from all other fantasy, I mean in EQ terms. What spell combos are best for which classes, what spells should be memorized, that sort of thing. I'm not too prideful to ask. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usydiushatesu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sydius Hatesu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:25:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Know your /role</span><hr size=1> Indeed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usydiushatesu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sydius Hatesu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:28:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Know your /role</span><hr size=1> Wait what?

Then I began to wonder if you just started off poorly, and had something of merit to say. It was when I reached the end that I realized that you've just found your way to the wrong server, and I'm hoping that you return to the Hell from which you came.<br>
<br>
I'm going to address the little addition to the game you mentioned first, since it seems to be as good of a place as any. This is an insane idea. How do people learn? Through practice. If a friend of yours asked you to let him cheat off your test, and you let him, you're not really helping him do anything but pass the exam. He's not learning. He's copying answers. Such is what you're suggesting.<br>
<br>
This would allow anyone to beat anything provided they are of a level to do so. Raiding wouldn't require skill anymore; you'd just walk up to a mob and hit that little button, and *poof*, this game becomes a fantasy-genre simulation program. I'm sure many people would agree.<br>
<br>
Also, we do, in fact, realize that it's a roleplaying preferred server. You're complaining about roleplayers roleplaying, however, and that earns you a hearty STFU from me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usydiushatesu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sydius Hatesu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:33:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Know your /role</span><hr size=1> I love to roleplay as Cap'n Silverboots, but all I ever get out of RPing are warnings on my account for &quot;cussing&quot; and &quot;harassment&quot;.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:42:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Know your /role</span><hr size=1> It's sarcasm people.

I realise people today want everything spelled out for them but for the love of something you love try not to lose the ability to recognise sarcasm.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to address the writer.  Yes RP allows for a variety of things for people to do and people need to strike a blance between enjoyable, interesting RP and effective game play.  But, the fact remains, game play is harder in the high end.  And once a raid starts there's little room for it.  I like Rping.  But I don't like corpse runs.  If you are going to RP somone it is grossly dangerous to group with why would I ever RP someone who wants to group with you?! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usydiushatesu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sydius Hatesu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 9:45:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Know your /role</span><hr size=1> Yes I want everything spelled out for me, but Id prefer it to be spelled correctly.

<br>
Bascially, I would just have people try and do there best and treat others how they would want to be treated.  No way to enforce it but its how I try and go about the game.<br>
<br>
Besides, how would you disable the computer program for when you felt you knew how to play, or if you dont trust people to make their own decsions why not play Dungeon Seige or something where you can control everyone yourself or let the computer do it for you.  <br>
<br>
Another point is wouldnt this program idea make EQ run like a sceen saver. Ya i dont know how to play at all but me and my buds run ourselves to Sol B and let the computer take us thru Nagafin. Or you could have the computer tell you if you would win the encounter or not, I mean if it knows how to play you better then you do, then it could just run the scenario for you ahead of time, and tell you not to try it.<br>
<br>
The griefers and the maroons will always be there adding angst at them being there to your list will just make you unhappy and unsocial to the point where others will think you are one of the griefers or the maroons. I know its hard to do, and I get hooked sometimes too but try your best to let them go.  <br>
<br>
But yes when someone asks me how to get to the bank or zone etc. Sec and I will show you for more information I suggest checking out eqatlas.com.

EDIT: And I agree with your definition, which allows me to see that the example I contrived isn't sarcasm. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A> at: 8/16/02 10:10:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaptainjamessilverboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CAPTAIN JAMES SILVERBOOTS</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/ME.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 10:42:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sarcasm</span><hr size=1> ARGH Kreelos speaks English what a wimp HAR HAR.<br>

<br>
- Crackbabies are no longer restricted from using messageboards.  When we first developed EverQuest we had no technology to allow crackbabies to access the messageboards, but it has been high on our priority list for the past 2 years to implement this feature, as many crackbabies felt they were being improperly discriminated against.<br>
<br>
To use the new crackbaby function, open your EQClient.ini file and add<br>
<br>
CrackBabies=TRUE<br>
<br>
Under the Defaults heading.<br>
<br>
- We changed some stuff about the Firiona Vie and Sullon Zek servers because we got tired of hearing people bitch.<br>
<br>
- Bard Spell songs should be working as intended now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usanamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sanamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/17/02 12:39:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sarcasm</span><hr size=1> If we could somehow tie auto-follow into the rest of that autopilot function, that would be really great!!!<br>
We won't have to waste endless hours at our keyboards growing and getting squashed on EQ. Just think of it the vacation you've always wanted to take but your EQ time was spoiling the idea.<br>
<br>
Now you can just &quot;press the button&quot; and Voila! your toon can live a life of it's own without your pesky intervention.<br>
<br>
