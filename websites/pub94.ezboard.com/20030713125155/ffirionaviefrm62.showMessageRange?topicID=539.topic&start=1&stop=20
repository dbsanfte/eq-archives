<br>
All our holidays... they're there to celebrate or honor something.  How many people do you think really celebrate that particular something?<br>
<br>
Like... July 4th... It's Independence Day.  It's a day to celebrate our Independence from Britain, to honor the people who long ago fought &amp; died to give us the freedom we enjoy today, and to praise the courage our founders had in implementing such a radical (at the time) system of government which I personally think is among (if not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) best system of governments in the world today.<br>
<br>
But how many people do you think actually think about any of that on July 4th?  I bet a lot of people celebrate that they get to blow shit up with fireworks.  A lot of people celebrate a night out with the family.  Etc.  I'm not saying people shouldn't celebrate... just wondering how many people actually give thought to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>why</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they're celebrating.  <br>
<br>
I don't think it's very many.  I wonder if commercialization of the holidays is part of the problem.  Here in Seattle... it's not called Independence day... or even the Fourth of July.  Know what it's called?  Fourth of Jul-Ivar's... Ivar's is a seafood restaurant.  200 years ago people were risking, and losing their lives to win freedom from Britain... and we've renamed the celebration in spirit of a Seafood restaurant.  I mean... did I miss something in history class where Captain Ivar pulled off a daring tactical maneuver by firing fish &amp; chips at British soldiers, thus distracting them in combat?<br>
<br>
But I also wonder if maybe, we just don't really care.  We celebrate the celebration and that's it.  Our independence is just the excuse to celebrate.<br>
<br>
Memorial day is there to honor the people who've died in our world wars, right?  But the only people I saw at the cemetary were some older veterans, probably honoring lost companions.  Everyone else was celebrating the day off work... the pool opening... start of summer...<br>
<br>
Labor day is there to honor the labor unions who fought to make the workplace something other than legalized slavery.  But again, it's pretty much billed as an end of summer blowout... get all your partying out of the system cuz you gotta wait for the next Memorial day for more barbecues.  It's funny... cuz you can pretty much flag which companies treat their employees like crap by seeing who makes their employees work on Labor Day when not in a critical business (hospitals and so forth... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>points finger accusingly at Blockbuster video</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->).<br>
<br>
Or maybe... maybe it's not so nefarious, and we as people just have some subconcious pagan need to celebrate the changing of the Seasons.  Is it coincidence that our most actively celebrated holidays are so close to Summer/Winter Solstice and the Vernal/Autumnal Equinox?  Maybe people just have a need to celebrate the start of Summer and they can do it w/o calling down the wrath of the Chuch this way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Anyways, not really <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>news</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, just something I was thinking about.<br>

PS: I can't believe they renamed our Independence day after a freaking seafood restaurant, regardless of whether or not they gave money towards the fireworks display <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=traelle>Traelle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon22.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#993366>Prettier than Kuladen<br>Used to be Sar</font></span><br>  Posts: 513<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/1/03 11:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=539.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sartrae.gif height=191 width=143></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How we celebrate our holidays...</span><hr size=1> I never thought about the 4th of July as anything but fireworks, until my exhusband, when we lived in North Carolina, took me to a revolutionary war cemetary.<br>
<br>
Then, I got to thinking about the fact that, buried below my feet, were men, and boys who DIED, so that I know the lifestyle I know. So that I don't understand what having a monarch is like, so that I can worship how I choose.<br>
<br>
Since then, I give a private salute to those men, and all who've come since, on the 4th.<br>

They are EXACTLY what they were created to fight, big business.<br>
<br>
Explain to me how you justify paying a suit thousands of dollar to run the unions while the worker that pays the dues may be called to go on strike and get nothing. Most if not all the Nati0onal Unions, only care how much money they can soak from their members so they can pay the bosses the big bucks. They mostly dont fight for better conditions or better package deals for union members, it is almost always about how much more money they can suck from companys and then because the union members make more, how much more they can charge them for dues.<br>
<br>
Explain how it is Legal to have a Union shop, where in order to work there you MUST be a union member or able to join the union in 6 months, but it is illegal to have a non union shop, were the union is excluded. The Unions fought for benifits and money for workers, for better work conditions, and some of the smaller unions still care, but the National Unions are nothing but money grubbing buisness out to make a buck so they can pay the top cats more.<br>
<br>
I sure dont celebrate Unions on labor day.<br>
<br>
As for the 4th and Memorial day I think about what they mean every year. But I dont spend the whole day at that. Just Like christmas and Thanksgiving day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/2/03 2:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=539.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How we celebrate our holidays...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Explain to me how you justify paying a suit thousands of dollar to run the unions while the worker that pays the dues may be called to go on strike and get nothing<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A lot of unions have a &quot;strike fund&quot; used to help support the workers that are out on strike. Also, we are notified when a local union is having a strike so we can offer support, money and food to those workers affected. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Explain how it is Legal to have a Union shop, where in order to work there you MUST be a union member or able to join the union in 6 months, but it is illegal to have a non union shop, were the union is excluded.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not sure if this is a state thing...but where is it illegal to have a non-union shop??? First of all, in order to have either an open or closed shop, the majority of the workers there had to petition the Department of Labor and have a vote of the workers in order to certify the Union as their sole bargaining representative. If the workers at some shop decide they don't want the Union in there anymore, they would have to sign a petition to the Department of Labor to de-certify the Union. A vote would be ordered and conducted by the Department of Labor, and the majority rules. <br>
Seems to me your biggest beef is with the workers that refuse to decertify their unions. Why don't they do that? Because unions have afforded them decent living wages and benefits. Unions fight for workplace safety and make sure the companies abide by OSHA regulations. Sorry to tell you this, Twotribes, but big businesses would abuse their workers a hell of a lot more if it wasn't for Unions fighting for decent working conditions. Even shops that are non-union benefit from the hard work and blood spilled by unionists by establishing safety standards. Without safety standards and worker's compensation benefits, big businesses would tell the injured worker &quot;Sorry you got hurt, but we're firing you&quot; and replace that person with a healthy worker that they can abuse.<br>
Twotribes, if you don't believe in unions, don't go work at a union job. Let the rest of us enjoy the benefits that were so fought for by our unionists before us.<br>

National holidays are a time of rest, and not much else.  If we have to set aside one day out of the year to be thankful for all we have, or grateful to veterans or unions, or remember patriotic sacrifice, we're pretty stupid people.  You don't need the day off to remember or honor something.  The day off is to enjoy, simple as that.<br>
<br>
I do think you have something there with the seasonal celebrations.  July 4th is High Summer.  Thanksgiving is the Harvest Festival.  Christmas is the Winter Festival.  Easter is the Spring Rites.  To the *day* we have things like Halloween and May Day settling on &quot;heathenish&quot; celebrations, that celebrate the *very* pagan aspects of said days.  Christmas is also much like Yule, and Easter like Ostara.  There are certain &quot;rituals&quot; of form - holly and painted eggs - but mostly celebrations were not for &quot;rememberance&quot; but togetherness over all - and except for the commercial bits, that's what we do now.<br>
<br>
On the slight divergence...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Not sure if this is a state thing...but where is it illegal to have a non-union shop???<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think he's talking about the fact that companies and/or a minority of anti-union workers have no rights to exclude unions from their businesses, but shops that have voted to have unions have the right to force new hires to join said union.  That seems bass ackwards to me.  I have nothing against unions in general, but closed shops are *wrong*.  You should never be able to force someone to join an organization (union) just to work at a seperate organization (the company.)<br>
<br>
Frankly, while unions had their uses in days of yore in fighting the ridiculously disgusting workplace dangers and low wages, now they are more hinderance than help.  (Or, at least, they have been at the three companies I've worked at.)  I'll I've seen of modern unions are strikes that last for years, putting my friends and their parents into poverty and debt...blatant lies about companies and individual members of management on shoddy recruitment material...threats made by union campaigners (often bright eyed extremist liberals from the local university) toward both high level management and common laborers who seem uninterested (including threats of violence) and a whole host of other problems.<br>
<br>
Juliet, I don't mean personal offense.  I realize that my personal experiences with unions are not necessarily typical of all the rest.  However, while you are correct in saying that unions began the trend toward workplace safety, they no longer have much to do with it.  The government now does all of that work - including OSHA and workman's compensation.  Laws exist thanks to the work of unions years ago that prevent those abuses from happening again, but OSHA investigates non-union shops just as much as the union ones.  *shrugs*  Unions complicate matters from my view from the Human Resources office.  It's so much easier when someone in &quot;management&quot; can talk to a &quot;worker&quot; directly about problems without worrying about a mediator all the damn time.  As someone who studies and teaches communication, it's always been obvious to me that third parties just get in the way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/3/03 1:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=539.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How we celebrate our holidays...</span><hr size=1> teaching Unions are so full of shit its not funny.<br>

But seriously, I absolutely agree with you.  Holidays are not seen as special by the majority.  They are just seen as a day off from work/school by most.  Hell, if they fall on a Weekend or in an inconvneient place, we'll move them to a Monday or Friday!<br>
<br>

The problem that some people have that oppose unions is the fact that the workers have a democratic process in place to get a union in. They know if it's going to be an open shop or a closed shop. Is it so terrible that the employees have a right to vote and the majority rules? It sounds like the very basis our country was founded on, democracy. Now if you don't believe in unions, then all you have to do is simply not take a union job. There are plenty of employers offering half the salary a union worker makes that would be more than happy to use you and abuse you.<br>
David- same goes for you. You have said in the past that you are a teacher. Are you in a unionized teaching job? If so, then you are the ultimate hypocrite. There are plenty of private schools that pay low wages to teachers that you could teach at that aren't unionized.<br>
As for the safety issues- Unions are still fighting for new ergonomic standards and other safety issues. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is something that has been around a long time, but fairly recently it has been recognized as a repetative motion injury. You have big businesses out there that hire physicians to contravert those cases. Those same physicians will argue that Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is caused by a lack of nutrients in your diet! As technology advances, more is discovered about repetative motion injuries. As new ergonomically correct equipment is being invented, it's the Unions that are forced to push the issue and make employers invest in newer, safer equipment for the employees. OSHA comes in at the enforcement stage. But it's the unions that are still setting the standards.<br>
Safety isn't the only issue that unions address. They also address equal pay for equal work, discimination, and a whole lot of other issues that are still problems in the workplace today. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/3/03 12:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=539.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How we celebrate our holidays...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Unions complicate matters from my view from the Human Resources office.

I agree with you in theory, but it doesn't work in the real world that way. The problem comes in when &quot;management&quot; tries to break the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the &quot;worker&quot; and reneg something provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The third party you refer to is the Union representative, who will &quot;get in the way&quot; when management tries to break the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The workers, by vote, have elected the union as their sole bargaining agent. If management has nothing to hide, then they should be freely sharing whatever information they wanted to share with the employee to the union. If management does have something to hide, then thank God those workers have a union there to protect them. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Order of Crimson Hands</span><br>  Posts: 1528<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/3/03 12:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=539.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How we celebrate our holidays...</span><hr size=1> The only problems I have with Unions are distinctions drawn between what is Union Labor and what is not.

<br>
I'm not sure I agree with that at all.  It only takes one or two disgruntled employees to get the ball rolling.  The business I worked for (a hotel) had fine benefits, fair wages, etc.  But there were a few people who had a bone to pick with management, and decided to organize.  And it's pretty easy to get the less educated employees who might not speak the language so well to go along with things when you promise them MORE MONEY, whether it is realistic or not.<br>
<br>
As far as it being decided by a majority vote, that was not the case in our situation.  If I recall correctly, a majority of the employees was not required, just a majority of those who turned out to vote, which was a very low percentage of our actual employee base.<br>
<br>
And this is not to say that all unions are bad, because there are businesses and industries that definitely need that kind of regulation.  My experiences though, have not been positive ones.<br>

Actually, it took in excess of 50% of the total number of &quot;bargaining unit&quot; employees at the hotel to sign a petition to the Department of Labor just in order to have the vote. If the numbers were as you stated, just a &quot;few&quot; employees that had a &quot;bone to pick&quot; with management, you would not have had a vote at all. The fact is, the majority of your co-workers wanted to be represented by a union. If over 50% signed pledge cards, then it is reasonable to assume that those employees would also vote to have the union represent them. Maybe you are a member of management there, or just a clerk that didn't want to have more in the way of benefits or a living wage. But it appears the people you work with are pro-union, at least the majority of them. I would encourage anyone that doesn't believe in unions and what they have fought for and achieved, not to take union jobs. It would have been nice for you to describe the position you now hold in the hotel so I could get a better idea where you are coming from.<br>
If you want to see what actually happened with the vote, I think that info is public and can be gotten through the Department of Labor.<br>

As I said, it wasn't a few problem employees that voted our union in, it was a few problem employees that got the ball rolling.  But I'm pretty sure the actual vote was based on voter turnout, not on total employee majority.<br>
<br>
And my intent is not to union bash.  But am I getting the wrong impression, or are you assuming that all unions are working for the greater good of the employees?  When it boils down to it, they are businesses as well, and therefore, the possibility exists that they are doing what is in THEIR best interest, not the employees.<br>
<br>
The union I dealt with gave me the impression of a bunch of used car salesmen.  And I wasn't the only one who felt that way.  And after all was said and done, many of our employees (not all of them of course) ended up making less money due to their union dues. Some made more, some made less, and everyone (employees and employers) had to work under a new, more rigid set of rules.  Maybe some thought that was good...but most didn't.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are many unions fighting the good fight against companies who take unfair advantage of their employees.  Maybe I'm just lucky to live in a state (California) with a fairly strict labor code for employers, and a decent system for employee recourse against companies who violate labor law.<br>

<br>
The church didn't want people celebrating Pagan holidays at all, so they plopped down Christmas right on top of Winter Solstice (even though Jesus was probably born in August).  In that sense I suppose you could say it's a deception.<br>
<br>
But the pagan element of modern Christmas tradition wasn't put there by the church.  Rather, the people enjoyed their traditions and basically dragged all the tree decorating and so forth along with them.  If the Church could've had it's way I don't think Christmas would have any Pagan elements to it (which is why I say &quot;Deceive&quot; might be the wrong word).<br>
