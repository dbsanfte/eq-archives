<br>
If you can't understand at this stage why harping on the same damn point you've been on since *day one of the server* is beginning to wear dry, then I'm not even going to bother trying to repeat it again.  Yes, your threads keep getting locked.  That's because people are sick of hearing about it, even a lot of the people who agree with you are sick of hearing about it, and I'm sick of dealing with the flames that follow in the wake of your 127th time making the same bloody point.  The fact that you posted a thread *looking* for exactly that situation, expecting nothing else, and laughing at it from the get go was the final straw.  <br>
<br>
You think I like going around locking everything in sight?  You may enjoy being an &quot;RP Nazi&quot; (I hate that term) but I personally hate being a &quot;Board Nazi&quot;.  Anyone who starts a thread just so I can lock it takes a serious faction hit.<br>

Oh, and give me a reason NOT to expect that. I post a non flaming petition in a non flaming/ranting/soapbox like forum that has nothing to do with anyone that didn't want to sign it, and it gets flamed to holy heck. I get the feeling if I made a blank post that it would be get the Flamethrower of You know who (I'll refrain from naming names to make this as flameproof as possible, if you flame it its on you)<br>
<br>
Well, I'm done. Either you can flame me, or just ignore me and be done with it. Oh yeah. FV is a RPing server. That was the point of it all, meddled in the rest of meaningless stuff.<br>

<br>
I agree with Shintou here.  Not because I agree with his point; I don't.  Nor do I agree with his fatalism about Firiona Vie; if I didn't think this was a good server, I'd be playing some other game entirely.<br>
<br>
But Shintou didn't break any of the rules in that post:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 1. No personal attacks or harrassment of any kind towards any player. You will be banned from the board if you make any racial, sexual, threatening , hate, religious, or any other type of persecution towards each other that reflects our real life persons. For roleplaying reasons, racial/diety comments involving Everquest characters will be loosely moderated. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
As it didn't personally attack or harrass anyone, I don't believe any reasonable person could see his post as having violated rule #1, so I'll move on...<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 2. If your post(s) are in the wrong forum for the topic, it will be moved to the appropriate forum. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
It seems to me that the post was perfectly suited to the Soapbox.  It was a rant, and that's what this forum is for, so I'll move on...<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 3. You spam, you're banned. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
There's only one post in the thread.  There are only two, in total, by Shintou in the top twenty on this portion of the board.  I don't think you can claim he was spamming, so I'll move on...<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 4. The only trolls on this board should be big, green and scratch thier butts all the time. There is a difference between expressing  yourself, and being a jerk and purposefully trying to make people angry. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
While his post <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>might</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> fall under this rule, that's an extremely subjective call.  Even though I disagree with Shintou's perspective, his post didn't make me angry in the least bit.  I honestly think he was trying to express his somewhat gloomy perspective on the change.  I disagree with that perspective, but he's got every right to express it--and if someone gets angry about that, I would have to say that's really their problem, not his.  I'm honestly not certain how many people would have gotten angry over what he actually said (although they might get angry that he simply posted anything, no matter what its content).<br>
<br>
If you wish to employ this rule on him, then you need to out-and-out declare he's a &quot;troll&quot; and ban him.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 5. No selling or trading characters/accounts on this board. If you're going to do that, take it somewhere else. We can't control if you're breaking Verant's rules, but we can keep it off this board. If you try to sell or trade char/accounts here you will be banned. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Nope, none of that there.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  6. Defining rules on language in posts. If a post contains language that is explicit with overuse of curse words or deragatory overtones, it is up to the judgement of the Moderator or Administrator to edit the post in question. An explanation will be given, and  this is to enforce a general feeling of maturity on the board. Any point can be made without excessive language useage of the negative manner.<br>
-added 12-14-01 &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I think you'd have to really stretch to apply this rule to the post.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 7. All rules can be modified at any time by the administrator of this board. Rules will be added or deleted as needed, so please keep this in mind. Any changes to the board will be posted in the Announcement section. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No rules have been added that Shintou's post might have violated.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; 8. Have fun! &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
It appears to me that you locked the thread because the subject line challenged you to do so.  That's making a judgment based on whim, not enforcement of the rules.  To be completely frank, it struck me as an abuse of power--silencing someone because you could and because you don't like him, not because he violated the rules.<br>
<br>
Just like the ice pairs judging at the Olympics, you threaten your credibility when you make dubious calls.<br>

<br>
Stop trying to act as if the rules are an exact guideline for everything, because they aren't. Now don't start accusing me of taking sides here. Shintou got what he was asking for, and he WAS starting his old fights once more. Valquiss is just being a pain right now with locking every other post and deleting the ones she doesn't lock, however.<br>
<br>
Back to what I was saying about rules. You can't expect them to be inflexible, because then you're asking people to be immoral and perfectly neutral when we all know no one is capable of that.<br>
<br>
But, if you want to play the rules game, I certainly don't see anywhere where it says moderators can't delete or lock threads as they please. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

As a moderator I would expect that you would be given a wide latitude to interpret peoples meanings, predict the outcome of a series of theads, or attempt to discern the future. While that is a noble idea, I would think that you must treat each thread as new and potentialy different from any others. For example if Heagan posts a new &quot;Fiction&quot; thread or Robin posts a new &quot;Sow&quot; thread (no, I am not picking on them those are just fresh in my mind) I would hope those threads could live for a while to see where people were taking them before they were locked.<br>
<br>
We like to have the saftey net of moderators for personal attacks, lies, vulgarity, etc. We can, however, each make up our minds how many times we want to go down a beaten path. <br>

Yes, i am sick of the subject... and  as it continues, i read less and less of the posts on it. i figure thats how it will end. If there were people often hyjacking threads of another subject to complain about a different topic...that i would find highly annoying and if i was the original poster i would ask for moderation. Just my thoughts friend.<br>

<br>
If the &quot;rules&quot; are not actually &quot;rules&quot;, then change them to &quot;guidelines&quot; or &quot;suggestions&quot;...  If you transfer the ideas from the &quot;real world&quot; to this one, rules are laws... and by setting laws and allowing people break them without punishment, or only enforce certain laws when you're in the mood to do so, you set us all up to become criminals, and leave some VERY large loopholes. Loopholes that will eventually come around to bite you in the behind. And the topic of this particular thread is a fine example of it... the rules werent followed, someone pointed out what the rules are and questioned a decision, and the decision maker has nothing to back themselves with other than &quot;they are just a guideline&quot;... <br>
<br>
I am not an advocate for strict moderation. I personally think moderators should do nothing other than delete spam, and the &quot;want to sell my character for $1,000,00 US&quot; posts... <br>
On the other side of that though, I think if the moderators are going to give us &quot;rules&quot; to follow, then the should actually BE rules, and moderate based on those rules. If the moderators want to have more liberal moderation rights, get rid of the rules and hand down some &quot;suggestions&quot;. <p><font color = FF3333>
