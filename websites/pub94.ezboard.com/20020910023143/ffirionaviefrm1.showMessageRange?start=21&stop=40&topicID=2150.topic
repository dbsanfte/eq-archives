I might even (OOC) think quite a few of the guard hunters are just lazy d00dz who are powerlevelling like it is a blue server. But then again, there is the Tinker's Blacklist, and my personal /ignore list to deal with those people.<br>
<br>
Those of you who fight guards for actual roleplaying reasons are exempt from my unkind assessment above. I'll restrict myself to appropriate in-character reactions.<br>

To all those melee types, who think to die at low level is nothing but a transportation device:<br>
For a caster it is quite annoying when you die, even below 10th level. Because you have to memorize all your spells again. At lower levels this can take a lot of time. Also there is always a chance of crash.<br>
<br>
Now my opinion on killing the guards:<br>
I don't do it (though I am necro and really don't have to care about my faction).<br>
I don't do it of IC reasons, because Teiraa doesn't want conflict.<br>
And I don't do it of OOC reasons. It's hard enough to be a newbie, so the guards are very important.<br>
If I see you killing the Nektulos guards IC, I just would say (IC-ly): 'Please don't kill our guards!' It actually helps in most cases. If it does not, you come into my IC suspicion list.<br>
And my OOC opinion: Well, I don't do it, I hope you also don't do it. But if you want to, well, if you are happy with it, so be it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>

<br>
From a RP point of view it is my attempt to rid Norrath of these vile creatures, and hey, every little helps.<br>
<br>
As far as fighting gate guards, I zoned into Neriak with a pally once and tried fighting the ones near the entrance, they have a HUGE aggro radius but they are killable. We were doing ok until someone decided to pull more guards to us and then zone out. I'd like to point out for any of you 'homeland defenders' that this is specifically mentioned in VI's play nice policy as a malicious act, so naughty naughty to whoever it was.<br>
<br>
But, it was a blast all the same, in a way I regret it because I started out indifferent to the dark elves and could go all the way into the foreign quarter which was fun but ... I suppose once I had gotten my staff of the wheel piece I didn't need that place anymore and I do get a great sense of satisfaction from whooping them down.<br>

This has been changed.  Once Charm Breaks on a Mob all Player Buffs are removed.<br>

<br>
I was runnin' home through Steamfont, and what do I see? Some filthy dark elf killin' Watchman Halv!  Now, normally, in this type o' situation, I'd jump in and help ol' Halv, but can I? Nope. He's a PC, I'm a PC. I can't do nothin' to defend me homeland.<br>
<br>
So, I challenges the inkie to a duel. Does he give me the satisfaction? Nay, he just sits there all slack-jawed staring at me. No response.<br>
<br>
What's a gnome to do? I can't help Halv, I can't take revenge without the dark elf's permission. So I do the only sensible thing. I get me arse out to dark elf forest and kill a couple o' guards fer good measure.<br>
<br>
Now, I done hear'd a lot o' ye sayin', &quot;What about the young'uns?&quot; I say, what about 'em? Back in the day when I was a young'un, guards was the bane o' me existence. Whenever I needed one, he'd wandered off to the pastry shop. Whenever I didn't need one, he'd wander in and steal me kill from me.<br>
<br>
And anyway, young'uns today gots it easier. No loss o' experience or dangerous corpse runs or nothin'. Why, back in me day.. [Here Gnosis complains for 20 minutes about how much harder things were when he was young] ... uphill both ways!<br>
<br>
So, I say, if'n there be a good RP reason, kill the guards. Now, if'n yer just usin' RP as some weak excuse to be a griefer, then get yer arse outa her and go to some Zek server. But don't nobody tell me that I can't do nothin' to defend me homeland.<br>

I hunted inside the city, not outside. The outside guards are for noob protection, and are buff'd so as not to be hunted. The inside guards are not there for protection, nothing inside a city to worry about. So I hunted them.<br>
<br>
Alot of role play value in guard hunting and how people react, but when your inside a city you are not hurting any noobs by doing it. <br>
<br>
Yes i was trained several times, by very low level characters.<br>
<br>
But I also had sveral very good role play exp while doing it. I remember this small level 8 gnome wizard I belive.

That stands out though, as a memorible day and a good time, if evil char want to hunt your good gaurds or the other way around, then role play with it. <br>

The entire time I am reading this thread, I am thinking to about the time when I was in Neriak, and Gore was killing guards in the city. My magician Cielo was around 30 at the time, and was upset that Gore was killing the protectors of her home, but was bound in the Nexus. There wasn't a prayer that she would win, so the dread of making that long run won out over any good RP there could have been. (So, I'm lazy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I remember him going back and forth with a female Dark Elf and him saying to her &quot; Fear me, elf.&quot;, and I thought to myself ' Done and done' hehe<br>
<br>
There was quite a crowd that had gathered.I think most of the lower level characters  were more enthralled with the mere site of Gore than with his actions at the time. <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my opinion on guard killing:<br>
<br>
Yes, I kill guards. I haven't in a while, but I used to kill the guards in Paineel for days on end for money. I agree that it isn't cool to kill outside guards, ie the guards in WC. I remember when my character was young and running back to the guards with a griffon in tow, only to see them wandering away from the post, feared by a guard-killing necro. I guess if it is your thing, you are entitled to do it. I WILL duel you if I don't like it, unless I am bound far away, of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=banie>Banie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/17/02 12:50:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2150.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Killing Guards/Helping Guards</span><hr size=1> /bows to Gore<br>

I was hunting Halfing guards the other day in fact - And it was inside the city... halfings are greedy! they wait for the kills and loot fast, i had some people shout at me to stop, but the best was when a halfing was 'asking' me to if i could kill certain types of halfings.. could i kill a cleric? a druid? a rogue etc etc.. it was almost amusing as i would pull from deeper in the vale takeing almost all the guards except for the ones neer the death-squad of (warrior, paladin, ranger, druid, cleric... they are not fun - new armor quest lv60 death squads)<br>
<br>
It was fun.... then me and a friend saw somone train a pack of guards on us - needless to say we zoned.<br>
<br>
I was hunting in felwithe on my own, one guard is easy, it's the next two or three wanderers that get me, again somone trained me, i just left that day it was not worth it.<br>
<br>
People LOVE training guards on people - it's not roleplay and i have left the last 5 slide.. but really. you should stop doing it, some will not be so generouse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 573<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/18/02 8:48:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2150.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I love killing guards</span><hr size=1> Wikkin - Curses!

I kill the guards in Nektulos when they get in my way. I figure I'm doing more good than harm anyway; the guards wander so it's not like you can just run to them when you're in trouble, unless you're lucky and happen to catch one on his patrol route. Much more often they just KS you. Run to the gates if you need guard help; hardly anyone can kill them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utanare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/18/02 2:09:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2150.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Killing Guards/Helping Guards</span><hr size=1> Antoin, you got a membership card?!?!?!?<br>

<br>
oh yeah for the guard killing? <br>
<br>
ooc- i think there's two categories here<br>
1) the guardians of the youngsters and<br>
2) interior city guards<br>
<br>
as far as #1 goes- the guards directly outside the city i wouldn't consider touching since they've saved my behind enough times (though i have noticed in other lands the kelethin guards usually have to be kicked a couple of times before they notice you have a monster or 6 after you). No need to make things more aggrivating for the youngsters i would say and so wouldn't touch them.<br>
<br>
EXCEPTION- if (as an example) one of the lone guards in EK in the middle of nowhere with no one in sight (and/or not too many folk in the zone) i might consider taking a shot at it since there's no one endangered by the loss of a guard until the respawn.<br>
<br>
as far as #2 though- there's nothing but the city folk there to worry about so the only people that would be needing to run away from something would be the attack force itself. And i've noticed folk seem to enjoy watching (have heard tales of other guild groups being trained while there but haven't seen any myself) and doing some RP between fights- last time i was there a high elf from Resolution came by to watch/chat/taunt/exchange insults. <br>
<br>
  As far as reasoning behind it goes with Kyri its partly avenging those poor bridge guards (whom she suspects failed the indigo warrior academy testing.. &quot;Well Guard D'zyt, your first post is...um...the bridge. You are to slay everyone that doesn't have blue skin that tries to cross.&quot;   &quot;Um sir i'm only lvl 14.&quot; &quot;Are you questioning your orders?!?!?!?&quot;  &quot;Er no sir.&quot;  <br>
&lt;Guard D'zyt walks off to an impending death&gt;). <br>
<br>
   However in her youth (aka- my computer couldn't handle the infamous luclin patch of doom so i lost over a month until i got a new one) Kyri was caught trying to sneak into Felwithe and kept imprisoned/tortured for that time. While she tended to fall asleep to the paladin's torture of reading the holy words of Tunare to her and reflecting sunlight into her eyes off their armor, she found the casters a bit more...inventive. She's been a bit scarred/paranoid ever since and is willing to drop whatever she's doping at the drop of a hat to get some revenge on the deziens of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
   Because of guard category #1 though she'll probably never assault Kelethin since the city has the unique situation of being both a city and hunting area at the same time. So by my personal definiton the guards fall under category 1 leaving felwithe her only option of getting some revenge without inconviencing the play of anyone else.<br>
<br>
i would say this is my 2cp but Kyri pickpocketed them while i was talking...<br>

<br>
That being said if VI wanted to make it really interesting they would just have the status of any one attacking a guard change to and open pvp until they die or leave the zone.<br>
<br>
Can you imagine the battles! Some one attacks the guards, the local newbies swarm them while calling for help. more groups of people join in on both sides.<br>
<br>
Soon there is an open battle field with a wide selection of combatants the fog of war and just general mayhem.<br>
<br>
I think it sounds great and would add a whole new color to the RP.<br>
<br>
So how do we convince VI to try it?<br>

<br>
But really, think about what your asking, would you want me to turn PvP and be able to kill you just because I was killing your guards?<br>
<br>
Inner guards are part of the feel of the cities, and for good role play an evil character would go to a city and attack people. So killing guards give you this. It isnt hurting anyone.<br>
<br>
I except all duels, no one is refused, if you see me killing your guards, then do what you feel is right.<br>
<br>
Funny thing today, I was killing those Weak Elf guards of Felwith, made even weaker by the fact they were Paladins. When this tiny elf female, ran off. She trained guard after guard on me, but it was nice of her. I didn't have to pull.<br>
<br>
