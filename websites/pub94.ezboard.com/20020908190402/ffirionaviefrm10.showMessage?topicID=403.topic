&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (KELETHIN, Greater Faydark) Kolani Stormynytes, leader of the semi-mercenary Kelethin Legions, was called before the review board in Greater Faydark today to answer charges that she aided and abetted the iksar outcast Gore Bloodlust in his personal vendetta against the dark elves of Neriak over the nighttime hours last night and this morning. Stormynytes, who has a history of being soft toward the iksar, ogres, dark elves who have shunned Innoruuk and other less accepted members of society was summoned to the ranger guild hall when she went into the city to sell her loot from the venture.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Merchant Iludarae, a longtime friend of Stormynytes, told the Kelethin Courier that Stormynytes brought a longsword to her that she said she had taken from the corpse of a dark elf guard when she came to buy her usual supply of water. &quot;Ko was looking pretty beat up,&quot; Iludarae recalled. &quot;She told me that she'd had a run in with a dark elf reaver and that she'd assisted Baron Bloodlust in a venture into Neriak. I was horrified, even though she said that her &quot;assistance&quot; was basically limited to being a member of his cheerleading squad and forgetting that she couldn't cast wolf spirits inside that awful town. Ko's had a long string of odd friends, I mean she brought that cat-man Zantos to the Greater Faydark, and she's good friends with that dark elf rogue Corinna, and she talks about that nice iksar missionary Jhary - there’s a nice Karana-fearing boy - all the time, but Gore? I couldn't see it at all. Speaking of that Zantos, he's a fine young cat-man now. When he got here, no one could understand him and he almost drank Felwithe out of milk and ate all of Fishmonger Jassa's fish, but he's grown up good.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stormynytes strode defiantly into the meeting clad in the armor set that she'd recovered from the corpses of RyGorr orcs, a stark contrast to the pristine green ivy etched tunics she usually wears to official committee meetings. Fixing her gaze on her guildmasters, she said, in a low voice, &quot;If Gore hadn't been involved, you'd be accolading me as a hero. It's your blindness and stupid aggression toward the iksar that have us here. Venril wasn't working for Cabalis, just give it up already. Firiona's free, and Cabalis had nothing to do with it. It was Venril who approached the emissaries of Neriak looking to frame Cabalis for the kidnapping. You know that, I know that, let's just face it and get it over with.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “True, Kolani,” replied the Heartwood Master. “But that is no excuse for aiding evil. The wanton attack on another city cannot be construed as anything but.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Excuse me? Did you see these cuts? I didn’t get these foraging berries and playing nice with bunnies and little butterfly thingies. I was attacked by a dark elf reaver, and would have died had Tunare not chosen to revive me. Payback, as they say, is a bitch. And so can I be sometimes. Too much evil has come out of Neriak to overshroud what good comes from there. There are fine dark elves who deserve our support for forsaking their homes and joining the fight against the Indigo Brotherhood. There’s even one still loyal to Neriak who stood against the ones attacking the gnomes! But for every one of them, there are ten others dedicated to the Thexes. Need I bring up Tunaria again? Because it seems that all of you forget about Tunaria except when it’s convenient to you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tunaria is in the past, Kolani. Your family put up a fine fight to preserve it, but you really need to let it go,” stated Maesyn Trueshot calmly. “There is nothing that this strife can accomplish. The dark elves are in Neriak, we are here. There is an ocean between us.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;You're blind! You're all &lt;expletive deleted&gt; blind!&quot; Stormynytes retorted to the committee &quot;The Ebon Mask have spies here, in the Faydark! There's a Dragoon with a regiment in Lesser Faydark! DVinn is supplying aid to the orcs! They're growing necromancers up there now! If you'd get out of the damn trees every once in a while, you'd notice these things! But no, all you do is sit up here and dispense your wisdom and tell us how to make weapons and armor to carry out the fight that the young ones are ill-equipped for! We should be doing what Gore was doing, not sitting out here in the middle of nowhere with 40th season rangers of the Mother worrying about what the orc pawns are doing - that means you, Fireshine. If we don't take action, they'll overrun us like they did the gnomes! WE should be pushing the darkness back, not leaving it to a small underpowered and underequipped regiment of halflings!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Baron Bloodlust was seen slaughtering guards in Felwithe not long ago,&quot; noted Maesyn. &quot;And here you were helping him. What does that show the young ones? That it's fine to stand behind a murderer if his tactics work to your benefit?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Oh, get off it Maesyn! I've seen you strike down your trainees who try to say the wrong thing to you! Gore was terrorizing Neriak. Gore was cutting a swath through the dark ones. That's a hell of a lot more noble than striking down a child who says 'hail' to you the wrong way!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At this, Trueshot appeared to be struck as with a lightning bolt, as he rubbed his chin and sat in contemplative thought for several minutes. Finally, he conferred with the Heartwood Master briefly, then stiffly arose. &quot;We will overlook this, Stormynytes. Go back to your troops and resume command. No more will be spoken of this. Tunare obviosly approves of your actions, for reasons that we may not be able to comprehend,&quot; said Trueshot at great length. &quot;Go now.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This reporter was close enough to hear Stormynytes mutter something about fighting a reaver and aiding forces attacking Neriak before she whisked out of the guild hall into a circle of wolves, her sister, Aleyla and her adopted daughter Kegeriene. At least one of the wolves is believed to be her sister Windydaze, who has previously had skirmishes with the council over her war with the Freeport Militia. Recent unconfirmed reports from the Commonlands just outside of Freeport suggest that Kolani may be involved in her sister’s war as well. They teleported away before this reporter could get a quote from any of the senior members of the Legions, but Moondanser, a recent recruit to her forces, offered that she believed that Stormynytes was correct in taking advance measures against the enemy.<br>
