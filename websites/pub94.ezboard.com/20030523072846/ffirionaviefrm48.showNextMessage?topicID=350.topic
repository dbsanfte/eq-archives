Goosebumps break out across his flesh; he could have sworn that he just heard his name whispered into his ear.  He looks upwards and around seeking the source of this discomfort and sees a tall, lithe, fair haired Vah Shir standing before him.  She removes her rain soaked cloak and motions to the chair in front of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good evening,&quot; she says.  &quot;Is this seat taken?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; he replies.  &quot;Please, do sit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One steamed milk please,&quot; she asks of the waitress.<br>
<br>
She turns her piercing green eyes in his direction.  &quot;I have heard about town that you are a collector of tales.&quot;<br>
<br>
He nods in agreement.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am new to these lands of Norrath and would like to introduce myself.  My name is Zyannu Yarlyikchi.  I am a shamaness recruit of the Dar Khura of Shar Vahl.  So what brings me so far from my home you may wonder?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh....thank you,&quot; she says to the waitress as she is handed a steaming mug.  She takes a sip and sighs in contentment.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was born of a poor miner and his wife in the wilds of Hollowshade Moor.  We lived in a grass hut not far from the acrylia mines where my father toiled daily.  I was an only child but never felt quite alone.  Since the day I can remember, I have been surrounded by spirits.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;As a youngling, I had not mastered any form of control with these beings nor did I realize that my parents could not see them.  I did know that if I were flattering enough I could get these spirits to do my childish bidding.  Understand that these spirits can be either malevolent or benevolent, so my biddings were not always answered in the form I desired.  Eventually my parents came to realize that my imaginary friends were not as imaginary as they had once believed.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;My father sat down with me one evening and explained that his mother too had been able to communicate with spirits, and this gift had been passed down to me.  He told me that I must be responsible with these powers and learn to control my urges to send these spirits on silly errands.  As soon as I was old enough, he told me, we would journey to Shar Vahl where I could apply to study with the Elder Spiritists there.  Oh how I eagerly awaited this day!  My dreams became reality sooner and in a more terrible fashion than I could have ever imagined.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The mines are an atrocious place to labor, and my father paid the price one day in my early adolescence.  The miners typically work in groups of three or more for protection from the vile grimlings which have infested these mines.  My father became separated from his crew this day and was attacked and viciously murdered by these foul creatures.&quot;<br>
<br>
A deep rumble issues from within Zyannu's throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me.  I cannot contain my anger when I recall those events.  My mother and I fled to the city of Shar Vahl that very evening for we no longer had protection in these dangerous lands.  As we ran there was a ferocious storm as the spirits I loved mourned with me for the loss of my father.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My mother and I settled into the outskirts of Shar Vahl where she took up baking at a nearby inn, and I petitioned to begin my studies with the Dar Khura and was accepted almost immediately.  Since then I have entered my twelfth thread of learning.&quot;<br>
<br>
She points to the twelve colored bands which line the bottom of her cloak.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Elders remind me that I have far to go in my learning and must seek an inner peace to truly understand and communicate honestly with the spirits around me.  They feel that my father's death is resting too heavy in my mind, so I have come to Norrath now to find that peace.  I would learn the ways of your world and its many peoples, no matter their race or the beings they worship.  There is a balance in all things which my Elders stress.  There can be no good if there is no evil, no life without death.  I have come to learn these lessons and hope to cross paths with many kindred souls on my journey.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zyannu takes the last drink from her mug then rises from her seat.<br>
<br>
As she wraps her cloak around her body once again, she beams a smile towards the bard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for listening to my tale.  I pray that you will record it and pass it along so that others may hear my story and perhaps share their learning with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
She waves farewell, and the door closes silently behind her.<br>
<br>
((Hello everyone!  I have been playing Everquest for about 8 months now.  Firiona Vie has been my server of choice from the beginning, and I have loved every minute of it.  This is my first foray into serious role playing, so please forgive any blunders I may make.  I have been keeping up with these boards for a few months now and think this is a wonderful and diverse community that I would enjoy being a part of.  So if you see me in game please say hello, I am always glad to make new friends.)) <br>
