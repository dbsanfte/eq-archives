When I'm grouped with an over active slower, I'll often hold aggro until the warrior takes it away from me. Especially with the higher end mobs that are immune to fear, I can usually hold aggro on one of them till all the slows and dots have landed, even through a couple resists (yet another ingenious use for the much maligned skill of Intimidate.  Why is it you rarely see monks fear kiting?). I don't like doing this, because it's making more work for the healers, and slowing things because of the added down time, but it's better than watching the shaman get beat on till the warrior pulls aggro, then watching him get beat on again after he heals himself and pulls aggro a second time, and then cann's down far enough to use up another heal. that takes even longer.<br>

At least for shadow knights.  We had the hate on Disease Cloud drastically reduced, which until then was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hate spell for knights.  Unfortunately this nerf/fix came at a time when shadow knights had very little to offer a group but their sticky aggro, and they saw this as enough a problem I guess to give us two spell lines completely devoted to aggro management (the &quot;Terror&quot; line and the &quot;Voice&quot; line).<br>
<br>
These days however, shadow knights still don't tend to use those spells, because we still have more economic and practical alternatives.  I only use the Voice line to help a warrior keep aggro (and seldom then at that, as it forces you to take up a precious spell slot) and these days, never use the Terror line.<br>
<br>
As for your proposal, we could probably get by if they reduced the aggro on the most commonly used taunt spells (Clinging Darkness and Fear at the moment), but generating aggro &quot;like a warrior&quot; would be a disaster for us.  Knights rely on twohanded weapons to do damage, many of which are very slow, which means lame aggro.  So we'd give up a large portion of our capacity to deal out damage by switching to &quot;aggro&quot; gear as warriors do.  And warriors can dual wield... two fast weapons naturally produces a lot more aggro than one slower weapon.<br>
<br>
So either way, spells have to be the way we produce aggro, or else our aggro generation abilities fall behind that of the warrior, and the knight becomes a sympathy grouped class once again, what with our inferior natural mitigation, avoidance, HP and lack of defensive disciplines.<br>
<br>
Relying on less effective/efficient spells for aggro (like the Terror line and the Voice line, and other spells that generate some decent taunt in our spellbook) would be fine I suppose, except it wouldn't really make our class any more &quot;complicated&quot; to play... it'd just 1) Reduce our capacity to improve group performance by not memorizing an additional nuke/DoT/lifetap/AC tap/ATK tap due to more taunts taking up our spell lineup, 2) Reduce the amount of mana with which we have to cast those types of spells due to the fact that we are burning more mana trying to taunt, and 3) Reduce the amount of melee damage we do but a slight amount due to the fact that we'll have to cast more often to maintain aggro, and more time casting means less time spent meleeing.<br>
<br>
Apart from that, I'm already inclined to think I have more to keep track of compared to warriors due to the fact that we do have to worry about things like mana management, trying to cast between swings to minimize melee damage lost to spells, making sure our DoTs don't cause conflicts with mezz, pet management, as well as the fact with regards to gear, we face more dilemma than the pure melee classes because we have to face the same choices (ATK or defense?  STA or raw HP?  AC or HP?) but hybrid choices a well (MANA or AC?  HP or Flowing Thought?  Vengeance or a Focus effect?)  I'm sure most knights have more hotkeys than your average warrior.  So I think knights are already a more complicated class to play than warriors, even if one aspect of our class (maintaining aggro) is more simple for us.  I've already been told by more than one person that they don't play a knight (or don't play their knight anymore), because it's too much &quot;work&quot;.  So I think it balances out in that regard.<br>

That's not the problem.<br>
<br>
The problem is, that if you have a knight tank, you don't have to hold back.  That's the single biggest gripe about the warrior class.  Standing around waiting for the warrior to get agro reduces your DPS, since you could engage and kill the mob faster.  Faster pulls = both more xp, and greater chance of success in LDoN dungeons that rely on # of mobs killed. Faster dead mobs also mean they're damaging the tank less, so healing overall can be equal to, or even better than, healing a warrior (except in cases where a cleric is CHealing once per fight, then it doesn't matter anyway).  But if you've got a druid or shammy healing, having mobs die faster due to the fact that the party can engage faster, and the slower can slow earlier, is only going to help the party.  Toss in the fact that both SK's and Pally's can assist with healing themselves, and the warrior is even further disadvantaged in xp groups.<br>
<br>
Sure, warriors work, but not as well as knights in 99% of fights. It's no wonder they're a dying breed. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=747613">Kozz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
First off Zyphanus said a while back something about waiting to cast malosinia or any others from that line.  Well thats incorrect.  The MalXXX line has very very very little aggro.  Back in the days i would cast it on the mob as it was incoming, all it took to outaggro malos was a single bow shot from the warrior.  So Just keep that in mind, the MalXXX line is a great early debuff cause the mobs dont care.<br>
<br>
As for aggro control  the key is for the supporting classes to be aware of how to play there class.  Sure even the most compentent support class will pull aggro from the warrior sometimes by accident but thats a different story, if the chars are played correctly the warriors shouldnt have a hard time holding aggro.<br>
<br>
Also regarding when is the approriate time to cast slow.  As a shaman who wasnt afraid to get hit i would generally cast slow as soon as the mob was in camp(in XP groups) ussualy the mob would get one swing at me and then the warrior would have his aggro back, really not an issue.  And if the mobs where being resistant or not transfering back to the warrior easy i would  cast a malos (5 sec cast unmodified) as the mob was running to camp and by the time spells where refreshed the warrior would have significant aggro to not loose the mob when slow landed.<br>
<br>
Its all about playing with people who will play there char to the fullest.<br>
<br>
That being said if i felt like tanking i could steal aggro from just about anyone excpet the knights.  &lt;3 cripple line <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170394" target="&quot;web&quot;">Thraall Prophet of Justice</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="&quot;web&quot;">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yethuy>Yethuy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/03 1:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4112.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you warriors think about this idea?</span><hr size=1>  LOL standing around waiting for a warrior to grab aggro.. impaitiant prick.

I even apologized for posting in such an ill-conceived manner in the first place. However, Thraall's latest comment was about a &quot;technical&quot; aspect of my previous posts which he (most likely not intentionally) misconstrued. Here's the relevant passage directly quoted from me:<br>
<br>
&quot;For those of you who didn't know, sending your pet in does generate a bit of aggro and coupled with sitting down immediately, may get you aggro over warrs (though not pallies or sks of course). Debuffs like Malosinia or Mala would rarely be used for 30 second or less fightes and will definitely not take aggro away from any competent warrior.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I think taking a 2nd look at it clearly shows that I am also of the opinion that MalXXX line has negligible aggro. Heck, I pull with it to solo in a lot of places. I think you mis-recalled and was too busy to go back and read it again, Thraall. What you remembered about my saying to &quot;wait&quot; was directed at pet attack aggro coupled with sit aggro. If you guys ever played a mage/necro, or know someone who does, try this to see it for yourself:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Start a fight sitting. When a MOB is pulled and comes within fighting distance of group, send pet in. MOB will very likely come after you unless tank stuns or generates enormous hate really quick.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
This is why you start a fight standing and send pet in, then sit after a short wait. This is also influenced by factors such as proximity which is also zone dependent (for the prox modifier).<br>
<br>
Reason I mentioned MalXXX line at all was because I was accused of casting it to generate aggro. I don't cast it in LDoN (cept mb on bosses) ever. Also, like Thraall says, it has extremely low aggro and is unlikely to make a difference.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't believe people here are griping much about regular exp groups? Just warriors' usefulness in LDoN dungeons? It is easy to say for people to wait till 90% or whatever to begin assisting the melee. This works great in places like BoT where there's no rush to kill the MOB (and they have enough hps that the fight will last more than long enough to go through those motions). Even if the wizard wanted to nuke early (assuming tank can hold aggro), he's not going to up the total amount of damage he dishes out unless he's so uberly equipped that he never needs a slight pause between casts to medd. Unless aggro issues prevent him from dropping his mana down significantly below FM, I see no advantage to having a Knight over a Warrior in an exp group at all. With a warrior, the wizard will still take his chunk (say 25-35% of MOB's hps) and having the Knight makes no difference (he takes same chunk). The only thing the Knight grants in this imaginary exp group is the option for the wizard to do his chunk earlier than he normally could with a Warrior.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I see absolutely no problem with Warrior desirability in exp groups in non-LDoN settings. I think you'll find this is untrue if you've ever been a part of, what I'd like to call, the &quot;45 minute squad&quot;: Paladin/SK, Druid/Cleric, Enchanter/Bard/Shaman, &lt;dps&gt;, &lt;dps&gt;, &lt;dps&gt;. If you use a warrior, you'll still get done, but some people are complaining about the loss in time. I find it acceptable most of the time (takes 60 minutes instead).<br>
<br>
Zyphanus Durga<br>
<br>
P.S.: It is apparent many play styles in LDoN will work as evidenced by the wins and I am in agreement with the people who say it largely depends on the type you work well with. An orderly approach that slowly but steadily, clears out the dungeon will probably be highly successful when taking advantage of the whole 90 minutes. Others may prefer a more active and hurried pace that is not necessarily better (if you wipe, you lose the time you gained). But, this is the tradeoff you make if you want to attempt 2 adventures in about the same time (45 minute wins). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=paladiinkoz>paladiin koz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/03 3:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4112.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: uhhh.....</span><hr size=1> About waiting till a mob is at &quot;X%&quot; hit points...<br>
<br>
I've done my share of giant killing in the Arena (with an open raid there last week).  For 55+ mobs with significant amounts of hit points, waiting till it's at 90% is more than just a few mere seconds - it could be easily 20-30 seconds for the warrior to knock it down 10%, since they're most likely wielding agro weapons, not heavy DPS weapons.  Sure, they're generating agro, but having folks standing around for what seems like an eternity is very trying.  People's first instints when a mob is brought to camp is to jump on it.  With a knight tank, they practically can.  If that happens with a warrior, it's guaranteed ping-pong agro.<br>
<br>
Sure, with some discipline you can learn to wait.  But at what cost?  Aside from the other drawbacks I mentioned above, don't forget boredom.  Having done plenty of those Arena raids, many just for faction hits, some raids can be boring and repetitious.  Add in that you have to stand looking at a giant's feet for 30 seconds before you can attack it, and you're probably about ready to fall asleep.  It's poor for morale, and it can cause you to lose focus, which in itself can be dangerous.<br>
<br>
So I'm not saying warriors can't tank.  I'm just saying many concessions have to be made when they do tank - some would think too many.  No one cares about waiting for warriors to get agro on that big, bad mob that's causing the warrior to burn /defensive.  But over and over, every pull, having to stand around while the warrior builds agro, isn't much fun for the melee'ing classes. <br>
<br>
Not convinced?  Attend an open Kael raid, and watch as they raid leader has to shout, repeatedly, for people to wait for the warrior to call for the engage.  I can't really fault those that do just jump right in - hunting exclusively with knights makes that a tough habit to break.  And one that most aren't in a hurry to break, and therefore look for knight tanking over warrior tanking.  It's no surprise that many warriors are faced with that never-ending LFG'itis. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=747613">Kozz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

And as for speed of pulling and killling Thank God I never have seen a Knight say &quot;Ummm guys we need to take a med break I'm lom.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I usually snare at the beginning of fights even when a warrior is tanking for four [IMO] pretty good reasons: 1) If I wait too long, sometimes I'll forget.... 2) Resists... especially a problem when compounded with #1, 3) My snare is actually a fairly decent DoT.  In short fights it'll only do about 300 damage, but in longer fights it'll do upwards of 900.  4) If the warrior loses aggro to a caster for whatever reason, the slower movement of the mob reduces the need to chase around a fast mob, makes sure you won't be out of range when you try to taunt, ect.<br>
<br>
I can take a few hits, I'm group lifetapping a bit with Zevfeer's Bite anyway, and I can feign dead if I really do need to lose aggro.  My taking some damage may hurt group efficiency in some minor way, but it's a prudent precaution considering the possibility a caster overaggroing and the warrior having some bad luck reaquiring aggro (or being slow to do so for whatever reason), and is a hedge against the possibility against a string of late snare resists, ect.<br>
<br>
As for your comment about paladins, I'm no expert on the class, but if we're fighting undead, I want the paladin using his undead nukes. <p>--Velsor<br>

<br>
Nice...  I guess that helps this discussion...how?<br>
<br>
Are you saying people can't stand and wait for 30 seconds before engaging a mob that a warrior is trying to get agro on because of psychiatric disorder?<br>
<br>
Or is it that people don't want to spend a chunk of their raiding time standing around next to a mob and not attacking because of warrior agro issues, when a knight class can get them into the fight quickly?<br>
<br>
Of course, I don't mean everyone - surely I'm not in this class. I know my role and I know it well.  But having played a warrior MT in more raids than I can count, and personally getting frustrated as people did this, the difference between knight classes and warrior classes are just too large to be balanced.  There's tons of great info (and a fair bit of whining) over at Steel Warriors about this issue, so my little 2cp isn't newsworthy.  <br>
<br>
Still, I find it amazing that people still fail to admit that there's even a problem with warriors.<br>

     Solution - get some offensive AA's.<br>
<br>
2.) Only time warriors 'far surpass' my DPS is when i cast not one single spell. On average any place i can have my pet and be bothered to haste it... i will out DPS warriors, any time i cast offensive sells on the mob.. i will out DPS warriors.. if i choose to burn all my mana in one fight, i have done more DPS than monks... but then it leaves me extreemly crippeled for the next fights until i get mana again.. and on those fights while i cant afford to cast.. thats when warriors out DPS me...<br>
     Warriors should 'far suprpass' out of mana knights though.... i would be shocked if they did not.<br>
<br>
3.) increased taunt would do jack and shit about loosing agro  - only help you get it back after you lost it... There are Taunt buffs in the game and even with them warriors still can loose agro down to DPS.. and in those situations you just have to accept that you are not doing enough DPS and need to find a way to fix it either through AA or wepons exactly what you are faceing with these other classes who more than lickely spent there first AA on offensive skills.<br>
     Warriors should play with some offensive AA and 2h wepons would do you a world of good.<br>

4.) Taunt works!<br>
