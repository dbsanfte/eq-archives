There are<br>no options for subscribing for other periods of time.<br><br>Q: If I register for the Legends server, when will my characters be <br>moved? <br>A: Once you have completed the registration process in the EverQuest <br>game client, we expect your character(s) to be transfered to the <br>EverQuest Legends service within a few hours by an automated script. You<br>should receive a confirmation e-mail once your character(s) have been <br>transferred. Each time you designate characters to be moved, you should <br>stay off of that account completely for a few hours so that the script <br>does not bypass your account (because the account is actively in the <br>game or in chat when the   script tries to modify it).<br>You should be aware that (i) some factors could interfere with <br>designated character moves   (for instance, our script is running while <br>your account is logged in the game or   in chat, which would interfere <br>with the move process), (ii) the level of   demand or other factors <br>might cause a delay in character moves, and (iii) this is a new service <br>and, accordingly, you should expect and anticipate glitches;   however, <br>we will work to get those glitches resolved on a reasonable basis.<br><br>Q: What if I cancel my Legends service, what happens to my characters?<br>A: We have posted a complete outline of the character move policies at <br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://legends.evequest.station.sony.com/showcase/movepolicy.jsp.">legends.evequest.station....olicy.jsp.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Q: I already know that when I move a character to a Legends server I get<br>to keep all my stuff, titles, faction&amp; everything.

Anything you earn on a Legends server you get to keep. We<br>also wanted to point out that all items that are unique to the Legends <br>server will be no-drop if moved to a non-Legends server on which such <br>items are still not available.

That is, these changes generally go well on regular servers, just not FV. FV may not have a large customer base but that should not matter. If Verant is going to offer FV to customers then they need to offer as much attention to FV as any other server.<br><br>Everyone remembers the TLC fiasco that happened a few weeks ago, now there is a huge issue with alignment and the new race/class combinations. No eta on this fix of course, if they decide to fix it at all. I mean honestly... we all signed up for this special ruleset server and started with broken languages (fixed after 2 months), broken TLC (fixed after 7 months) broken alignment (still waiting...) and now this alignment issue with the new classes.<br><br>I no longer care how Verant allocates its resources (oh this design team is responsible for legends, that design team is responsible for planes of power, we can't allocate them to fixing bugs.. thats the other teams job).  And now they tell us planes of power has been in development since January 2002? Isn't this after the release of Luclin? Why wern't these folks pulled off this &quot;as of yet unknown expansion&quot; and put on bug fixes for Luclin? Verants explanation of not being able to allocate resources to fix bugs is just demonstrating their inability to manage their resources to meet customer needs. At the last company I was with (a huge international corporation with tens of thousands of employees), if there was a customer service issue.. it didnt matter what department you were involved in or how high on the totem pole you sat.. everyone worked togethor to make things right. Oh and we didnt charge you more for that kind of service either. We did it because it was the right thing to do.<br><br>I feel bad for our GM on this server. It seems to me she tries really hard and does a great job all things considered. I wonder if she gets tired of having to tell folks, &quot;We are aware of this issue, please do a /bug report so they can have more testers look at it&quot;...these are the same testers that signed off the changes for regular servers I presume... I just wish they would have done those same tests for FV before they released the changes instead of after.<br><br><br> <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A> at: 3/25/02 3:05:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kloevis>Kloevis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/02 3:25:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Verant cares about its customers</span><hr size=1> What really gets me going is how everytime there's a new patch, it winds up fucking up something else that didn't have problems before, EVERYTIME.<br>It's like they just don't even bother testing this shit out before they throw it at us, and now patches have gotten to the point of being a giant joke.<br><br>big patch=guarantee there will be &quot;emergency band-aid&quot; that'll send the servers down an additional day, but after people wind up with loss, etc.<br><br>I know EQ is only 10$ a month to play, but if I rent a video for 3$ and it's broken, I usually take it back, no problems.<br><br>I remember the whole Velius(sp?) and Luclin debacles.....wide awake fucking nightmares.<br>and worse still, you're directed to the &quot;tech board&quot;<br>and they don't tell you shit, except:<br>-blame your ISP.<br>-blame your rig.<br>-delete a post as SOON as someone makes a valid point/possible fix, then RE-post it like THEY were the ones who thought of it.<br>bullshit/beaurocracy at it's finest.<br>amazingly enough, Verant itself has a &quot;good&quot; rating on the BBB.<br>!!<br><br>Planes of Power is just going to be another months long nightmare before it works ok.<br><br>Guess that's all we can expect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/02 3:54:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Verant cares about its customers</span><hr size=1> Personally, I think people need to give Verant a bit of a break.  Like it or not, EQ is a business and it's run like one.  You can say VI doesn't care, they're pricks etc..etc..etc..however look at what they've given you:  THE best MMORPG on the market.  As Sony is now involved with the running of VI, it is run as a separate profit center, the operating results are reported to Sony.  To put things in perspective, VI = &lt; 3% of Sony's profitability, thus you better believe that EverQuest has to run tight numbers.<br><br>I find it funny that the same people who cry and whine about the bugs etc...are also the same people who you see posting stuff like &quot;I haven't been able to log on for 2 hours WTF?!?!?!&quot; or &quot;I can't stand not being able to log on!!!&quot;.  It's called biting the hand that feeds you.  If you honestly hate VI so much and hate the bugs in EQ, then just bloody quit the game. <br><br>&quot;What really gets me going is how everytime there's a new patch, it winds up fucking up something else that didn't have problems before, EVERYTIME.<br>It's like they just don't even bother testing this shit out before they throw it at us, and now patches have gotten to the point of being a giant joke.&quot;<br><br>Aye Kloevis, this stuff pisses me off too.  However I think people need to consider the following:  EQ is far more complex than people imagine.  Programming isn't a static, impervious structure.  When new variables and functions are entered into the system, they effect the variables and functions that existed before.  To presume that VI programmers could foresee every bug or problem that would arise from new code is like asking a set of parents to sit down and give a detailed account of the impact their unborn child will have on the world around it.<br><br>The other thing to consider is this:  the playtesters used for testing new expansions/patches are a relatively small group of players and they are not the best players using EQ - in essence they do not adequately &quot;stress test&quot; the system.<br><br>Look at automobiles - companies run them through rigorous testing and everything seems fine, however when they release them to the general population, the law of large numbers and the miriad stresses placed upon the vehicles when used in everyday applications reveals all kinds of shortcomings, defects and problems.  In this case, the automobiles are recalled etc...because they present a health risk.  In the case of Everquest, what the hell would people do if they shut down EQ for a couple of days?  They'd go berzerk.  <br><br>Think about this:  EQ has been running virtually everyday since release in 1999 and has been rigorously tested by the subscriber base since that time.  Any MMORPG that comes out will either a) have to pour over all the minute detailed bugs that plagued EQ, b) copy EQ's current playtested coding, c) be playtested for over a year to uncover any shortcommings, and/or d) be coded by God.  Translation, EQ and Sony's forthcoming MMORPG products have a head and shoulder's advantage over every other MMORPG that will come out - so you better get used to Sony's operating style or find something else to burn your life away.<br><br>EverQuest cost you 1.4 cents per hour to play.  I beg anyone to show me a comparable form of entertainment with the same intensity and longevity for that price, other than buying a porno movie in the discount bin that gets you off every time.<br><br>Noone forces anyone to play EQ.  It's a luxury.  If anyone thinks they are getting ripped off for $9.95 a MONTH...go to Starbucks and order a coffee and a danish - THAT is larceny.<br><br>Once you accept that you are addicted to EQ, everything becomes a tad more palatable.<br><br>Kurley Greenleaf<br>the Champion of Magic<br>CNN Correspondent <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kloevis>Kloevis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/02 4:05:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Verant cares about its customers</span><hr size=1> &quot;If anyone thinks they are getting ripped off for $9.95 a MONTH...go to Starbucks and order a coffee and a danish - THAT is larceny.&quot;<br><br>no, that's just grotesque.<br>STARBUCKS SUCKS!!!<br>ALL MY ASS ARE BELONG TO DUNKIN DONUTS!!!<br>VIVE LE FRED!!!!!<br><br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/02 4:20:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Verant cares about its customers</span><hr size=1> Crispy Creme R l33t! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/02 4:45:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Verant cares about its customers</span><hr size=1> The complexity of the game / code is irrelevant Kurley. Their whole process for releasing new code is flawed and needs to be modified. When releasing new code, it should be well tested, and I mean tested for the different rulesets.. pvp, FV, etc. Once tested, THEN schedule the release and do the patch.<br><br>Your point about their testers not being the best EQ players is probably very true, but I honestly don't think you would have to be a good EQ player to realize TLC was f*cked up, or that the Alignments werent working properly on FV. You would probably just have to be as smart as a trained monkey. In fact it seems to me that Verant missing those two things just screams that they didnt bother to test any of that at all.<br><br>As far as profitability is concerned. I would argue that its cheaper to do things right the first time, then to have to bring in more people to do an emergency patch for a second straight nite in a row. How many patches in 2002 has there been now that have been immediately followed by an emergency patch the next day? How many folks does verant need to bring in (for a second straight night) to accomplish this?

They dont have to give their customers release dates. Especially for their patches. Certainly they need accountability and internal release dates. But if they had the proper project management tools in place (like project plus, a real time, web enabled, collaborative project management tool) they would certainly know where a patch / project is and how to adjust thier resources accordingly. Frankly, anyone in the software industry that has 1/2 a brain should know better than to release &quot;hard&quot; release dates (Look at NWN this company knows better than to set up their customers with unrealistic expectations which ultimately leads to disappointment).<br><br>The exception would be of course for expansions. Obviously marketing wants hard release dates. But smart companies lead marketing campaigns with &quot;summer of...&quot; or spring of...&quot; and NOT anything specific until the project manager is confident the expansion will be ready. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uermok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ermok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/29/02 1:47:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/lethron/hfv.jpg height=137 width=77></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How Verant cares about its customers</span><hr size=1> 2 cents to add to the debate...<br><br>1) I doubt Legends is the least populated server.  There is a reason they took numerical player numbers off the server select.  They dont have to be truthfull in the &quot;Number of Players&quot;<br><br>2) They mess up TLC.  Simple solution: revert back to before the nerf.  Do they use the simple solution that will make the players happy?  No, they chose the egotistical way that leaves us hanging for 2 weeks.  Its such an obvious show of priorities on their part.  Their objectives &gt; our enjoyment<br><br>3) My theory on the $15 million/year raise they just gave themselves is that Luclin did not sell as well as they hoped and they have to make up for it.  Its the same story of the rushed Diablo 2 expansion by Blizzard.<br><br>Two ways to solve all our problems.  <br><br>One, we can all attend the next Fan Faire with lead pipes, baseball bats, etc. and vent our frustrations to the sound of wet whacking and jiggling noises on the portly design team.  <br><br>Two, we as a player base can organize a strike.  Everyone cancel their account at the beginning of the month.  Companies base everything on short term expeted revenue.  If one month they expect $14 million and dont get it... you can bet it would be a swift kick in the ass.  Legally they own EQ as it is their business.  We pay them for the service.  However, we should control the degree of the service rendered to us.  <br><br>Now regardless of if you agree with me on what we should and should not control.  It is a sure thing that either way, they would shut up and be a lot more receptive.<br><br>/rant off<br>Gee, I dont post here often enough =P <p><p align="center"><img src="http://members.aol.com/lethron/ermoksig1.gif"></p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=464.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=464.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=464.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=464.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=464.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=464.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
