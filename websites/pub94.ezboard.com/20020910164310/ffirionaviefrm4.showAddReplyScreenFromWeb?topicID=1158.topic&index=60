composed of, and supposedly serve the people that live in them. at least ours has always given lip service to this concept. <br>
<br>
and if the people think that their nation is a foul villain and agrees with almost nothing that it does because of their standard of ethics, that nation state is not going to have a compliant populace and may not be in existence for much longer.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That gets into the question of 'what are a nation's interests and how are they set', rather than how the nation state acts upon said interests.  Generally speaking, a freely elected government will have more 'moral' interests than a dictatorship, precisely because of the more communal setting of the interests.  But that is not always the case, and in many cases it is not the preferable way to get things done.  The Founders, and many political thinkers throughout history, have rightly abhorred mobocracy, because just because 90 percent of the populace thinks something is good doesn't always make it so.  That's where 'statesmanship' comes into play, and it is those crass amoral statesmen who oftentimes reap the greatest good for both their nation state, and, ultimately, mankind.<br>
<br>
Now to address the questions about the US 'over arming' and spending so much on defense.  There is a very real, moral, and ethical reason for a nation state in the global position of the US to do so, it's called 'peace'.  Peace is not achieved between nation states because of warm fuzzies or feel good words, peace is achieved when the most primitively barbaric thug on the planet is afraid to realize his ambitions because he knows that there will be a 800 pound gorilla hammering him into the dirt if he tries.  Crass?  Yup.  Crude?  Uh huh.  Uncivilized?  Damn straight.  True? Oh yeah, very.<br>
<br>
Its when the Osama bin Ladins and Saddam Hussein's and Jiang's and Qaddafi's and Arafats and Assad's of the world are trembling in terror of what the global hegemon will do to them if they dare disturb it that there is peace, and with peace comes such nice things as 'not getting blown up by terrorists' and 'not having to go to war'.<br>
<br>
Morally speaking, the US committed a great sin by allowing itself to be weakened by failing to act against previous terrorist attacks strongly, be drawing down its defense, and by weakening its military.  Why?  Because that emboldened the true barbarians fo the world into thinking that they could win, thus they struck.  World War III did not occur because the Russians were nice enough to want peace rather than conquest, World War III was prevented because the Russian leadership knew if they tried that they would die.  9/11 didn't occur simply because somebody hated the US, the US has been hated by much more powerful enemies in the past, 9/11 occurred because somebody who hated the US felt that they could get away with attacking the US without getting hammered.<br>
<br>
Once you have established such credentials that nobody dares piss you off, then you have, not just 'peace', but Pax.  Where the hegemonic power can bend events globally to its liking without the use of force, through the simple fear of the force lurking in reserve.  Then, a moral hegemonic power is able to impose more 'ethical' interests onto the lesser nation-states by making it too dangerous for a lesser nation-state to act on interests that may be seen as immoral (note, IMmoral rather than Amoral, there is a difference, immoral is the opposite of moral, amoral is the absence of morality) to the hegemonic power.<br>
<br>
I don't think that there is much argument that the US is more 'moral' and 'ethical' in its dealings than, say, Iraq.  The US is certainly not a paragon of virtue riding its white horse polishing its stainless escutcheon, but let us be honest, nobody else is either, and the US is certainly closer to the ideal 'moral hegemon' than any other nation-state that has achieved that level of ascendency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Feisty Dwarf!</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 4:21:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nakath...</span><hr size=1> Very nice post Edward Dunai.<br>

<br>
we don't always support the reasoning that the politicians &amp; folks in command give for sending those orders on down to you, but we support you for doing exactly as you signed on to do.<br>
<br>
you are right, it's a tough job and not all of us want to sign up for it.  that you do so frees us from the worry of having to be willing to give our own lives in service so that we can concentrate on whatever it is we like to concentrate on, like mowing the lawn perhaps.<br>
<br>
i've never had issue with the individuals in the armed forces.  actually, i hate the arguement that just because someone disagrees with the policies that set those forces into action, they are somehow disrespecting the people who had to go to war.  <br>
<br>
all of us who have ever been employed by others understand having to do things that we don't always agree with to maintain our jobs.  we may not like it, but we have to live with it regardless in order to pay the bills.  nothing personal, but you must follow orders.  we can all respect that, i'm sure.<br>
<br>
so, as you can see, we do respect you.  the arguements and dislike is for the people who are in command, the ones who actually decide whether or not to fight wars justly or unjustly.  the issue is not with you, it is with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upoppyseedmcmuffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PoppySeed McMuffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Muffin Chick </span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 1:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.namelessofmercy.com/pictures/1025208718.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: US ARMY as well</span><hr size=1> (ooc)<br>

There is so much wrong with this it scares me. A moral hegemony governing through fear. Sounds pretty immoral to me (and incidentally the perfect breeding conditions for terrorists). But as long as the ends justify the means, who cares.<br>

Ok, BA Hons degree in Politics and International Relations, University of Kent and come up with a practical solution to the problem.

Not IMmoral, Amoral.<br>
<br>
The reason that deterrence works is fear, the reason why there was no nuclear war between the US and USSR was fear, we both could annihilate the other if we pursued our national interests vigorously, therefore, instead both sides backed down, and instead made it their interest to oppose the other in ways short of war.<br>
<br>
And the 'fear' works both ways, if two small nations both know that if they go to war with their neighbor that the US will come down on them like a load of bricks, and conversely knows that if their neighbor goes to war with them that the US will come down on their neighbor like a load of bricks, and thus knows that neither them nor their neighbor could possibly win any conflict, might they not then be more amenable to peaceful settlement, knowing that there is a hegemonic force in the wings expecting them to do so?  Or would it be more moral for the two nations to go to war with each other and slaughter thousands of people so that the US can feel good about not making people scared of it?<br>
<br>
Is it more 'moral' to permit war and violence to reign unchecked throughout the world or to increase your own power to the point where the mere threat of you intervening keeps the peace?  Is it somehow wrong for dictators and tyrants to fear the consequences of their actions?  A moral hegemon is one who makes use of its power to further moral goals, and peaceful coexistance is by any defination a moral goal.<br>
<br>
As far as terrorists go, the United States is hated already, irregardless of what we do, by the authoritarians and dictators of the world, and those who follow them.  We will be the target of fanatics regardless of what we do, but with an overwhelming preponderance of power and a demonstrated willingness to make use of that power, few if any nation-states will risk their own existance to sponsor and support terrorist organizations, which reduces the threat to the 'lone wackjob' category.  Sure, lone wackjobs can do damage, but they also are far more likely to get caught before they manage to pull off an attack, and are far less well equipped/trained.

<br>
In fact, during a debate with Gore (the second or third one), both candidates were asked which instances of recent intervention by the US in world affairs they would have supported.<br>
<br>
I remember very vividly that Bush didnt even recognize one of them and stumbled in his answer. The ones he did recall, for the most part, he said he opposed... and he attacked Clinton for &quot;policing the world,&quot; even though Clinton used restrained force and superior firepower during the conflict in the Balkaans to force stability in the region.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Those who say 9/11 changed everything have no understanding of history. 9/11 didnt change anything--it merely underscored lessons that should have been learned long ago, that were forgotten.<br>
<br>
The US is very much a part of the world community, whether it wants to be or not. I hope I live to see the day we realize this and start participating as a member of that community and not as an arrogant god that demands compliance with its standards and beliefs, but then refuses to answer to the inquiries of others.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
There are so many instances where the notion of &quot;peace through superior firepower&quot; can be shown to be false that making that statement and leaving it that simple made me blink.<br>
<br>
Look at the Middle East. Israel has one of the most advanced military machines in the world, and has the US constantly on its side. No greater firepower has been assembled in the history of the world. The Palestinians have virtually nothing. Result? No peace, nor will there be. Not due to &quot;military might.&quot;<br>
<br>
Look at 9/11. Our firepower certainly didnt help us much there, hmm? We sure smacked the Taliban around though. <br>
<br>
Look at Vietnam. My dad's a Marine, and was wounded fighting over there. At one point his unit, while entrenched, got attacked by a bunch of North Vietnamese irregulars wielding .22s and farm tools. Many of them in their mid-teens. His unit had to mow them down... Yet the North Vietnamese succeeded in their objectives, despite US &quot;firepower.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are instances where superior firepower and the threat of its use prevent conflict, I agree. The conflict in the Balkaan a few years ago is a good example, as is the standoff between China and Taiwan.<br>
<br>
But there are also a myriad of instances where it does not, because when determined, commited, absolute willpower and resistance meets superior firepower, firepower will lose more often than not in the long run, unless you are willing to commit genocide.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Edward, you stated earlier that 9/11 was not the result of someone hating the US, but of someone thinking that the US was weak--that they could attack the US and get away with it.<br>
<br>
You're forgetting that those most of those who attacked the US didnt &quot;get away with it.&quot; They died piloting the planes.   Same with the Palestinian bombers. They dont care about &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong.&quot; They were willing to sacrifice their lives because of their beliefs. &quot;Firepower&quot; doesnt figure into beliefs of that intensity. <br>
<br>
Bin Ladin is many things, but unintelligent is not one of them. He knew he might die as a result of his actions. So did those around him. Im sure that, even given the US responce, they would do what they did again in an instance.<br>
<br>
You listed a number of attacks previous to 9/11 that were not responded to by the US as being a reason that 9/11 occurred. By that rationale, the fact that we beat the tar out of the Taliban will mean that such attacks will stop, right? Because the world has seen how mighty we are. <br>
<br>
I hope that is the case, but doubt it very much.<br>
<br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
One last point... Edward, you stated that following 9/11 the US could have launched a few ICBMs, taken out tens of millions of people, and the rest of the world would have &quot;supported us.&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe that statement is STUNNINGLY inaccurate. Amazingly so.<br>
<br>
As much as I respect your knowledge of history and the complex nature of international relations, I would say that statement is an example of what I have said all along--that you, and many other Americans, have such an intensely one-sided view of world affairs its easy, if not inevitable, to become blind to the existence and opinions of those outside the US.<br>
<br>
I believe that, had we used ICBMs to take out tens of millions of innocent people in responce to 9/11, the world reaction would have been immediate, intense, and increadibly scathing.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, that will remain a matter of speculation on my part, since we didnt.<br>
<br>
This time anyway. I hope we never find out for real.<br>

<br>
The example in your post of the Cold War refers to Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) quite the opposite of the above as neither party holds the advantage. And despite the fact that the US and USSR never pressed the button and ended it all, hundreds of thousands died in proxy wars across the globe. In fact one of the hotbeds for the Cold War was Afghanistan where Russia was fighting US supported rebels and we know what kind of mentality some of the children who grew up there now have. Just because tanks aren't driving down Main Street USA doesn't mean there's peace in the world.<br>
<br>
Examples of 'peace through warm fuzzy feelings of love and happiness', tricky one, but Germany and France havn't been to war for nearly 60 years, which is a record. South Africa only turned around once the sins of the past were acknowledged and people started to look forward. The revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe where tanks were stopped by people wielding flowers (and David Hasselhoff on the Berlin Wall). Northern Ireland (closer to home for me), the peace process is built on an end to fear (not a smooth road but getting there slowly). Plus a few recent peace deals in Africa after 20 or 30 years of war failed to resolve anything (and the US, your potential moral hegemon, failed to intervene, not suprising given the absence of natural resources).<br>
<br>
So should the US intervene against whoever out of Pakistan and India goes nuclear first? Should we expect Israel and the Palestinians to stop fighting because the US (the &quot;moral hegemon&quot;) will do what is morally right and smack both their behinds?<br>
<br>
I get the amoral, immoral thing, even without the capital M, I just think it's wrong. Why does an individual have a right to ignore basic morality just because they become President?<br>
<br>
I'm not intending to come off as a US basher here, far from it, I would much rather an active US than a return to isolationism. No reason the US should help anyone really.<br>
<br>
I just think its disingenuous to claim that the rest of the world benefits from the US following its own agenda. Bottom line, if you're Kuwait (or other oil providing country) and you get invaded expect help. If you attack the US or support those who do, expect to get bombed. If you're a small European, African, Asian or South American country at war or sponsoring terrorism in your neighbours lands carry on regardless.<br>
<br>
Fair play to you Edward for discussing all this without it getting personal or offensive. At the risk of boring the board *shouts of &quot;too late&quot; from the back*, I'll make this my last post on the thread.<br>

However, for the touchy feelies out there.. and you know who you are.<br>
<br>
Peace is achieved through utterly destroying your enemies.  It isn't from peace accords, or groups of people holding hands and singing.. or buying your enemy a coke.  It is using the reasources at your disposal to completely destroying your enemy.<br>
   <br>
The end of the cold war had more to do with economics then it did with weapons.<br>
<br>
The US used the reasources at its disposal to defeat the USSR.  It forced the USSR into a spending war.. the space (read SDI) and weapons races intesified until the USSR hadn't the resources to continue while still feeding their own people. The USSR, being communist, did not have the productivity or economic might to challange the US in cold war spending.  Therefore, they had to capitulate.  <br>
<br>
The US soundly defeated the USSR using pure ecnomic might.<br>
<br>
As far as France and Gemany.  You forget the German infrastructure was utterly destroyed.  They were BEATEN and beaten badly.  France was also a mess after the war, as was much of Europe.  They had to work together to rebuild.  There was also a much worse fear than each other.  That of the USSR.  All of Europe had to work together to ensure their own security.<br>
<br>
It wasnt peaceniks who ensured lasting peace in Europe.  It was the utter destruction of the German war machine.  Also following the war it was the military might of the Allies and ever present fear of an even greater foe at the height of its power.<br>
<br>
Peace accords aren't worth the paper they are written on.  Ask Chamberlain before WWII.  That peace accord he got guaranteed that Germany defeated Poland without Allied intervention.. thats all.   <br>
<br>
From a Peace loving Canadian who knows the peace he enjoys was bought time... and time again with the blood of Soldiers.  <br>

Did I read that someone seriously thought that U.S. firepower wasn't up to snuff for the Vietnam war? <br>
<br>
.....<br>
<br>
Go read about what was going on during the Vietnam war please.<br>
<br>
The last time that we seriously met our match was when tons and tons of Chinese ran over the border in Korea and we had to move back to a standstill.<br>
<br>
As for the firepower not affecting 9/11 ... exactly.  When a country or group of people do not respond with normal warfare they tend to use terroristic or other types of damage.  The war that the terrorists fight is a war of attrition.  Without doing &quot;something&quot; about it we would lose that war because our losses have been higher up until this point.<br>

Like I said before I do not comment on whether Bush's plan is &quot;RIGHT&quot; but I without having the knowledge will allow our generals and admirals proper due and not question their decisions.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Feisty Dwarf!</span><br>  Posts: 623<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 7:17:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About Vietnam and 9/11</span><hr size=1> &quot;Irregardless&quot; is not a word.<br>

<br>
Firepower alone is meaningless unless it is backed up by determination or belief.<br>
<br>
Perhaps our retaliation on the Taliban will convince the world that we have the determination to use our firepower, thus frightening future adversaries into submission. Perhaps not.<br>
<br>
I tend to doubt it, because the ultimate consequence we can inflict on opponents, ie death, isnt one that many of them fear. If our firepower and displays of it do not succeed in frightening adversaries into backing down, then proponents of &quot;firepower&quot; are left with one solution: we have to kill them. All.<br>
<br>
Only this is impossible, since killing is cyclic--it results in resentment and hatred, which results in further killing, etc.<br>
<br>
The Middle East is a vivid example of this. Israel has tremendous &quot;firepower,&quot; which they have used at various points, yet the Palestinians dont fear it, nor has it affected their will in any way, so the cycle continues. <br>
<br>
Firepower is clearly not the answer, unless you are willing to resort to genocide, which is the ultimate destination of the &quot;might makes right&quot; train of thought when pushed far enough. The Cuban Missile Crisis is a good example of how easy it would be to reach the point of genocide... of the whole human race.<br>
<br>
Ive found that debating the &quot;might makes right&quot; philosophy and the &quot;firepower&quot; frame of mind with members of the military isnt overly constructive, so Im going to take a cue from Irexes and make this my last post. I do appreciate the fact that this discussion didnt degenerate into a shouting match. Many points were made with a minimum of personal attacks.<br>
<br>
If only the rest of the world could exchange ideas so fluidly.<br>

As for the argument that it won't deter terrorists because they do not fear death ... I will concede for the common terrorist that is the case.  But the people leading these mindless drones around in my opinion do fear death.  Bin Laden feared death enough that he shirked the chance to be a martyr to his people even though he alluded to it himself.  The more of the Bin Laden's who are afraid of us taking them out the less they will send their mindless drones to blow people up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
