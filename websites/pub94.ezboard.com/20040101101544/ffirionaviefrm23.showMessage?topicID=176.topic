His face was tattooed like the men of the north, yet his speech was civilized.  He stood near the great book and spake as follows.<br>
<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:53:38 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'Come ye all, and hear the tale of noble deeds and hearts so true.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:53:43 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'How men did aid the Ring of Scale in sundering their foes of blue.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:53:47 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'The Mistmoore clan did try, yet fail, to steal the Shard, which was to do'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:53:52 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'The parting of the Veeshan Veil, an opening to Sky made new.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:00 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'Come ye all, and hear the tale of noble deeds and hearts so true.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:06 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'How men did aid the Ring of Scale in sundering their foes of blue.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:12 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'The Mistmoore clan did try, yet fail, to steal the Shard, which was to do'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:18 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'The parting of the Veeshan Veil, an opening to Sky made new.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:48 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Sit, lads and lasses!  Come hear me tale of bravery and treachery.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:52 2003] Aelf Tidings motions for everyone to sit down.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:55 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Rest yer weary bones fer a spell, while we wait for the others to arrive.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:56:59 2003] Cata says,in Erudian, 'are they tales of gnomes?'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:09 2003] Thontar says,in an unknown tongue, 'Yea!'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:22 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'It may include a gnome, aye.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:26 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'Come ye all, and hear the tale of noble deeds and hearts so true.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:31 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'How men did aid the Ring of Scale in sundering their foes of blue.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:36 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'The Mistmoore clan did try, yet fail, to steal the Shard, which was to do'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:38 2003] Cata says,in Erudian, 'we want tinkerfest tales of brave gnomes!'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:41 2003] Aelf Tidings shouts, 'The parting of the Veeshan Veil, an opening to Sky made new.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:57:56 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Sit, lads and lasses!  Come hear me tale of bravery and treachery.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:00 2003] Aelf Tidings motions for everyone to sit down.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:03 2003] Thontar thinks he's heard this story before...<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:03 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Rest yer weary bones fer a spell, while we wait for the others to arrive.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:19 2003] Guur gasps at Aelf Tidings in amazement.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:20 2003] Nakai cheers at Aelf Tidings.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:46 2003] Nakai says,in Elvish, 'Tis veeshan who clawed Velious a new whole.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:58:46 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Are there any that be lore seekers among us?  This tale will be of treasure to them.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:15 2003] Squeaker says,in Gnomish, 'i love a good story!!'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:16 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Aye, I shall begin.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:19 2003] Nakai says,in Elvish, 'Tis mistmoore who sought the shard of power, to overcome the light skinned elves'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:31 2003] Aelf Tidings says, '`Twas long ago, ere your time.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:34 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Even the dwarves have lost their memories of that event.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:39 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'After Veeshan had brought life to Norrath, she settled into the Plane of Sky and drew a Veil across the chasm separating the dragon plane from us.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:51 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Then she fell into a long and peaceful slumber.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 11:59:55 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'So too, did the dragons still left on Norrath, as their strength was derived from the Plane, and the Veil kept them from exercising their magical powers.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:04 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Ya see, lads, the Ring of Scale dinna take kindly to mortals meddling in their affairs, and the Veil did well to prevent that.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:14 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Aye, but the dragons slept, and the Veil fell into neglect, until mortals began to find cracks and once more make inroads into the Plane of Sky.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:22 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'On Norrath, the dragon Zavo`Zatanov and her accomplices were determined to remove the Veil and restore the power of the Ring of Scale.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:32 2003] Thontar is scared of dragons.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:32 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Not your normal group of travelers were these.  Though they called themselves brother and sister, they were clearly not so:'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:43 2003] Nakai listens intently to the lore of the past.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:47 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Zavo, a High Elven woman of exquisite beauty; Rals`Zezonis, strongly human; Sarethsin`Kaz, a typically snobbish Erudite;'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:51 2003] Loreilia is the Lore of the future.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:00:56 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'and rounding out this already peculiar group, a troll named Soreg`Sslisn.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:02 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Great reward and dangerous adventure they promised, fortune and glory to all who could hear, and not an ear in the land missed their call.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:14 2003] Aelf Tidings ponders whether some enchantment might have lain behind the irresistable call to arms.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:23 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'And what could possibly be the goal of such a motley group, forcing them to enlist the aid of total strangers?'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:32 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Like a knife, the next two words sliced through the cold night air, silencing all within hearing.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:41 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Lady Vox.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:45 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Lady Vox holds that which we seek.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:46 2003] Thontar says,in an unknown tongue, 'Eee!'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:46 2003] Guur cringes.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:52 2003] Aelf Tidings draws a quick breath as if he himself had been present.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:01:59 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Through Blackburrow did they venture, the gnolls rejoicing that they did not stay their journey.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:08 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Thence through Everfrost, which some say melted a little under the presence of such a horde.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:23 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'On to Permafrost, the lair of the Lady Vox.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:30 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'They paused, casters with their noses buried deep within their books, murmuring arcane phrases, warriors unsheathing their blades, donning helms, while some of the smaller folk faded in and out of view.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:32 2003] Taerin dances and sings gnomish tinkedelic tunes.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:33 2003] Taerin waves her arms in the air.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:33 2003] Taerin dances the electric gnomish slide.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:41 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'That's when they first heard.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:48 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Vile children of Scale, your efforts are wasted this day!  You were fools to think that you could stand against the fury of Mistmoore!'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:02:57 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'The sound echoed off the canyon walls.  Out of the shadows sprung the horror, three Tier`Dal soldiers, agents of the dreaded Vampire Lord.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:03 2003] Nakai cries out.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:06 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Lord Galendor, nightmare of Castle Mistmoore and chief enforcer of Mayong Mistmoore himself, led the charge, leveling a furious attack at the High Elven woman, Zavo, before any had time to react.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:18 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Khasra Vei`Ras was not far behind, and a Tier`Dal priestess lent support from the shadows . . . D`shar was her name.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:26 2003] Aelf Tidings slows, seeming to drift away to another time and place as he speaks.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:32 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Now, fighting a Tier`Dal agent of the Vampire Lord might not seem to be such a difficult task, until you turn to your comrade and see his very life draining away, dripping down his tunic and staining the ground.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:42 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'This unholy union of rage and wit, chaos and order . . . it sticks with you.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:50 2003] Aelf Tidings seems to be speaking as someone with more than a passing acquaintance with the issue.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:03:55 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Zavo and her companions defended themselves well, but they never could have lasted on their own.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:05 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Luckily, they had prepared themselves, enlisting the aid of some of the greatest that Norrath offered.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:12 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'The battle was bloody, and before they even had time to organize themselves into some semblence of order, forty had become twenty.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:15 2003] Squeaker says,in Gnomish, 'i bet its fgnomes'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:21 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'The tide finally began to turn for the heroes when one of the young half-elf warriors discovered the Tier`dal cleric D`shar hiding in a corner and quickly dispatched her.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:34 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Without a healing force, the Tier`dal had no hope for victory.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:35 2003] Thontar says,in an unknown tongue, 'Wow'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:40 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Galendor fell almost immediately, and Khasra, badly wounded, stumbled backwards and uttered a few cryptic words.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:42 2003] Maladominus listens.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:04:49 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'What followed sent a chill through the bones of all who were there to witness, and these were battle-hardened veterans of the worst that Norrath had to offer.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:02 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Ya see, the shadows crept out from the very stones beneath her feet, reaching up from the ground to envelop the Tier`dal woman, swallowing her into darkness.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:11 2003] Maladominus loves story telling.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:13 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Little did they know that while this was taking place, a dwarf rogue by the name of Kivgor Illbria had snuck into Vox`s lair and had purloined the Shard.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:18 2003] Squeaker shivers.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:24 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Loud and foul were the cries of anguish rumbling through the bowels of Permafrost when Vox discovered the Shard missing.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:25 2003] Thontar says,in an unknown tongue, 'Always the dwarves....'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:27 2003] Nakai listens intently, a story to rival even the best of dwarven tales.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:36 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Just as loud were the cries of glee from Kivgor, taunting Vox for letting down her guard.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:41 2003] Maladominus snickers at Thontar.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:45 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'His luck failed him, though.  As he was about to make good his escape through the gates of the cavern, Kivgor ran headlong into  Zavo`s group.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:52 2003] Squeaker gasps in astonishment.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:05:55 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Proud of his accomplishment, Kivgor waved the Shard before them, but his pride quickly turned to anguish when he discovered that this was the very Shard that they were hunting.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:09 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'He attempted to flee, but they caught him and challenged him for rightful ownership of the Shard.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:15 2003] Maladominus says, '*whispers* yes, we have a wonderful story teller right now'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:17 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Badly outnumbered, Kivgor stood nay chance at all, but he still fought for the Shard.  His dying words echoed through the chamber.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:26 2003] Nakai grins.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:27 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Fie on you, accursed Mistmoore!  I fall in your favor, but now you be without your precious trinket!'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:39 2003] Aelf Tidings looks puzzled.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:44 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Mistmoore, mentioned twice now?  What role could Mistmoore play in this drama?'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:53 2003] Thontar says,in an unknown tongue, 'Yes, what?'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:53 2003] Aelf Tidings knows that the party was soon to discover the answer to that question.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:06:59 2003] You say, 'Mistmoore is in the heart of most dramas...'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:00 2003] Taerin despises Mistmoore.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:02 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Ya see, Mayong Mistmoore was the bitter enemy of the Ring of Scale, and he wanted nothing more than to possess the Shard and thereby control access to the Plane of Sky.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:04 2003] Didi winks at Ellishae.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:13 2003] Maladominus snickers at the Didi.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:17 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'With all due haste, Zavo`s group journeyed to the Rathe Moutains, where the final partitioning of the Veil was to take place.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:24 2003] Ellishae says,in Elvish, '*raises an eyebrow*  This is a tale that my master did naut devulge in..'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:25 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Surrounded by their mortal supporters, Zavo and her friends shed their illusions and stepped forward to reveal their true dragon nature.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:28 2003] Nakai chuckles at Ellishae.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:35 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'However, before Zavo could reveal herself, the sky was suddenly filled wi` shadows, while faint laughter swirled through the rising wind.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:07:48 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'A harsh voice, filled wi` hatred and disgust, echoed through the mountainsides, `Children of Scale!  You shall not succeed this night, I shall make sure of it.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:00 2003] Aelf Tidings says, '`For centuries, you have evaded me.  Now this shall end.  Everything you possess . . . is but a waste.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:09 2003] Aelf Tidings says, '`Twas the very voice of Mayong Mistmoore, challenging them for possession of the Shard.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:21 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Quickly the mortals sprang to the defense of the Scale, but it was too late for the doomed party.  One by one, Mistmoore's cold touch enveloped them in misty vapor, draining their life and strengthening his.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:26 2003] Squeaker jumps at the lightning.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:30 2003] It begins to rain.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:33 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Fighting valiantly, the humans appeared to be on the verge of sure victory, when suddenly Mayong faded from view, eluding their attacks.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:36 2003] Maladominus thinks Iksars would love this story <br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:44 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'The shadows quickly retreated back to the corners and stones from which they had issued, their tendrils rising in the air and the sound of a thousand shrieks echoing across the Mountains of Rathe.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:53 2003] Thontar can't stand Iksars. Ugh.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:08:58 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'As the shadows slithered from view, a voice was heard, faintly hissing these words of defeat, `You have won this day, Children of Scale, but it shall not be the last battle that you will face.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:09:11 2003] Aelf Tidings says, '`Rend your veil and harness your power, it shall do nothing for you, as in the end, you all shall perish, dragon and mortal alike, your corpses shall rot at my feet.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:09:24 2003] Aelf Tidings says, '`For this I can assure you.  Until that night comes, I bid thee a good morrow, and sleep well.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:09:35 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'The voice trailed off into sadistic laughter that hung within the air for what seemed like an eternity before fading into the wind.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:09:46 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Alas, Zavo mourned the loss of her beloved companions, cursing the name of Mistmoore.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:09:51 2003] Bryannae likes enemies who wish a good night to people.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:09:56 2003] Aelf Tidings lowers his head to conceal the tears in his eyes.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:06 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Determined to complete the quest which she had started, she called for the human who had most distinguished himself in the battle to step forward.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:18 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'She asked him if he was ready for the final task, to die by the Shard, spilling his blood on the earth of Norrath so that the Veil would be sundered forever.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:30 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'He paused not a moment before nodding in agreement.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:39 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'After performing the sacrifice and resurrecting the hero, Zavo presented him wi` the Shard, which became known thereafter as the Crystalline Claw of Veeshan, a mighty and powerful weapon.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:52 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Forevermore in the realms of the Scale was his act of bravery sung.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:59 2003] Nakai listens more.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:10:59 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Thus did the Veil of Veeshan become torn, and the realms of mortals and Scale did mingle.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:11:10 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'The dragons of Norrath were once more restored in power and glory, a fitting position for the Ring of Scale.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:11:13 2003] Squeaker claps happily for Aelf Tidings - hurray!<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:11:21 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Of the outcome of the battle between Mistmoore and the Ring of Scale, we can only guess, for I am certain that the final pages of that Act have not yet been written.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:11:33 2003] Aelf Tidings bows before his audience.<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:11:42 2003] Aelf Tidings says, 'Thank you all for listening to my tale. Long is my journey that lies ahead, and soon I must take my leave, but first I ask that you partake of my humble refreshments.'<br>
[Sun Jul 13 12:11:52 2003] Aelf Tidings passes out goodies from his backpack. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fahrner>fahrner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/8/03 11:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aelf Tidings - the tearing of the Veil of Veeshan</span><hr size=1> I wonder if Aelf Tidings will show up at the next Tinkerfest....<br>
