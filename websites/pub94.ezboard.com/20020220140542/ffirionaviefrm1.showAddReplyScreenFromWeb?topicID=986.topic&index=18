That being said, if they're useable by other races, then on another server you would simply need to run the quest and get the result.  No need to interact with anyone other than the required NPC's.<br>
<br>
This is FV, however, so the rules change slightly.  You need to RP through it.  I'm not familiar with the quests, but if TLC is keeping you from completing it, then the answer is to ally yourself with Vah Shir of the appropriate level, and assist them as they assist you.  That way you can complete the quest.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget, Verant puts new quests into the game quite often.  This is not a static environment.  Therefore, on a TLC server, if you want to run a quest that is newly introduced and you're above the level where you can actually run it, you need to ally yourself with others.  This stops quests from being dominated by high level players as soon as they're introduced.  I'm not saying that this would happen on FV, but it does make sense to me.<br>
<br>
For my part, I'd be glad to help you out with these quests.  It gives me something to look forward to, and I kind of look at it the same way as when I help out someone lower than me... I get nothing for it, but you'll remember me as a good guy in the future.  Maybe you'll even buy some of my fish rolls.  Not holding my breath though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, again, my response is that FV breeds an intelligent player.  And because of this, we can work around TLC through interaction, which is why it was implemented.<br>

The starting guild note is not no-drop and the citizenship quest gives phenominal faction.  I went from indifferent to amiable in just one hand-in.<br>
<br>
BTW, I don't think TLC breeds intelligence -- shrewd cunning perhaps, but not intelligence.  It requires that you do three things: 1. wait until someone else has solved the quest and posted it on the web.  2. hunt the web for spoilers.  3. find a way around the TLC.  So, it seems to me that it breeds behavior that is somewhat lazy and exploitive rather than encouraging people to figure out and do quests for themselves.<br>
<br>
For most servers, 1&amp;2 are optional.  You can choose to be lazy and wait or you can choose to solve it yourself.  Here, you must wait.  That's the problem.  You can't even read about a quest and decide to go off and do it on your own time.  You have to research mob levels and trivial points, pick your level window, and recruit lowbies to kill for you.  You can't do your research in-game, the /con system will only tell you all the mobs are green, not where they're trivial.  This makes questing far harder here.  So much harder that unless the reward is substantial, most people won't bother.  Kinda takes the &quot;quest&quot; out of Everquest.<br>
<br>
If every single quest item was exempted from the TLC, then I'd have no problem with it.  I see that as essentially removing TLC from the server.  We don't need TLC because we don't have a farmer problem.  What we have is a population problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 4:01:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FYI</span><hr size=1> However, without TLC we would have a farming problem.  Not from anyone present, I don't think (although there are lots of folks on this server who don't post to or read this board) but rather from the hoards who would descend upon us.  I don't doubt for a moment that a large number of individuals would come over from other servers, powerlevel themselves up in a matter of a week or two, and then start farming Guk.  For starters.  The server would be awash in no time in ph@t l3wts and the entire purpose of putting the hardship package in place for this server would be defeated.<br>
<br>
Now, I have no hard and fast evidence that this would _definitely happen_ but then again, I have seen what happens to other servers.<br>
<br>
I don't think FV is going to be around very long in its present form.  The population is too low for it to be profitable, and I think we'll probably be merged with another server.  When and if that happens, you'll get your wish.  TLC will be gone, but so will everything else.  If this server can't support itself with a player base then that means that this experiment is a failure.<br>
<br>
We can offset this by, instead of complaining about the strictures imposed upon us, succeeding despite them.  I didn't have walkthroughs when I started my Vah Shir, but I managed to run my quests.  I didn't get TLC'd, although I came close.  I didn't (and still don't) know what I'm walking into as far as the Sonic Wolf Bane Weapon quest, but I figure I'll work it out when I get there.<br>
<br>
This server makes me level slow.  I don't mind that, because everyone else is levelling at about the same pace (with some exceptions).  Anyhoo, best of luck. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>

The Orc Impaler is the 2nd weapon for rangers after Short Sword of Morin. (it is not a great weapon, but it is one of their quests.) Part of the quest is to kill a shadow leader in Lesser Fay. The leader is okay to kill at that certain level, with a group. Of course, is usually a long spawn. (Took me 6 hours to camp him on my old server to get him to spawn for me.) <br>
<br>
The problem is the brownie outcasts who roam right by the camp site where for the leader will be able to easily kill any group who is camping the shadow leader, unfortunately. So your solution would be to take a higher level person to watch over you for the brownie outcasts? But how do you convince a higher level to waste 6 or so hours on a nothing camp for him? I would feel awkward asking any of my friends to do this for me, and actually on my old server, just did this camp myself.<br>

As a L26 shaman now I can, myself, attest to the fact I've barely gotten in under the wire on some of the items required for my Mystic Scale armor pieces.<br>

My (RL) monkly husband (also L26 now) has not been nearly so fortunate on his Shackles quests. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yeh, so it's really still too early for me know for certain if this is going to work out okay overall... <br>

I have read throught the various Anti-TLC posts.  Most of them simply bring up issues of the inconvience of it.  There are no real 'broken' quests because of the TLC.  The quest might be inconvient, but not Impossible.<br>
<br>
The only 'BAD' thing about the TLC is that it makes your choices more costly.  Consider that part of the rules of the game.   If you chose to level rather than focus on tradeskills, that is the price you pay.  You can nolonger simply plan 'I will come back here when there is no danger and loot'. <br>

<br>
Seems to me, the concept of performing a quest, or what have you, when there is no danger or challenge (ie All the combat mobs are Trival) is rather lazy and impatience.  The inability to wait is also rather lazy.<br>
<br>
On the same note, other servers has its fair share of players that do 1, 2, and 3.  Infact, there are even players that continually search for exploits.  The TLC did not 'create' spoiler sites, nor are they exclusive only to Pro-TLC players. So again, this is another inaccurate statement regarding the TLC.<br>

That is basically exactly an example of the new 'challenges' proposed by these rulesets.  Somethings are now going to be very difficult.  <br>
<br>
Others will become eaiser (with the removal of the NO DROP tag, players can now sell, give, trade everything - you might stumple upon your needed piece that used to be NO DROP on a merchant or from another player, which would eliminate your need to camp for it). <br>
<br>
If I may add to your senerio about the Brownie outcast.  What if the high level 'guard' player needed stacks of swirling mists (not sure if it is TLC affected).   The I am sure they would gladly exchange 6 hours of guard duty for a stack or two of swirling mists, which was TLC to him.  <br>
<br>
It may not always be so 'neat' a transaction, but it is just a simple example of lower players coorperating with higher players to a mutually rewarding relationship (rather than the Highlevel players dominating).<br>

If I got to work with more people like you my job would be alot easier.<br>
<br>
You and Chip both brought up the fact that some of these quests arent impossible to do. I cannot argue with that. But I think its reasonable to assume a certain level of difficulty (or range of difficulty) for players to encounter when doing quests and I honestly feel the TLC, in its current form, makes some quests unacceptably difficult.<br>
<br>
Now, I know this is subjective. But I think I can offer a fair judgement having completed an epic quest for my character and helped completed over 20 other epics for folks in and outside our guild. Those included the dreaded necro, cleric and mage epic quests to the incredibly easy shaman epic quest. After doing those and going through the motions and long camps I can honeslty say I feel that some of these quests affected by TLC aren't reasonable.<br>
<br>
I can't stress to you enough that its not my wish to have TLC removed. I just want it modified. Thats how I voted  btw, on that poll to keep TLC , remove it, or modify it. You know what I really want? I mean getting all this feedback and different point of views from you guys was great. But what I really want is some word from Verant that they are either &quot;yes&quot; working on an alternate form of TLC like Brad said they would, or &quot;no&quot; they arent.<br>
<br>
That way I could have something to look forward to or just finally shut up about all this TLC nonsense. I'm to old and tired to keep arguing about this. In the mean time, as a chanter I can mem blur mobs. So if anyone needs help with a trivial item I will be more than willing to help.<br>
<br>
Not bitter, really...just tired.<br>

Me and a friend completed it 4 times before I outleveled it by helping each other.<br>
He took Edden since I had no real way of killing him, and I got Slittra since I could kill her.<br>
We took the halflings &quot;together&quot; (I watched at least and hit some) and bought our paintings, then we travelled all the way to Katta and completed our swords. All done in a few hours of game play and tons of fun.<br>
<br>
TLC does not punish high levels, rather forces alliances that would not really be an effective option otherwise.<br>
I am sure that Baku could just as well offer someone of the appropriate level to come with him and a friend to kill the particular monster and also get some insight into that particular place instead of offering his stick for trade.<br>
<br>
Ethereal warhammer me and a shaman friend helped with for free but got payment anyways after by the ones that needed the help. Once again an alliance that would not be an option otherwise.<br>
TLC becomes more of an obstacle then a real hindrance if you take some time to counter it effectivly instead of just buying the items.<br>
I did sell a quest item for a outrageous sum of money once, so I could repay a debt. But it was not a demand from my side and we could surely have worked it out without the money as well, paying out of your arse is not really a effective way around it, just the easy one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 12:33:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Uh, if you're worried about ..</span><hr size=1> .. Guk farmers, TLC would not stop them.  I don't think any of the nice frogs are trivial at 60.  Hmm, I remember goofing off in guk with my monk at around 55 and getting xp.  The names are higher level, so you can reach them from at least there.  Most of the nice farmable &quot;ebay&quot; fodder is not effected by TLC.  The big thing scaring farmers off is likely not TLC, but that they only have 1 character per account -- that's pretty limited as far as bank space goes.  They can't farm with one set of chars and play on another.<br>
<br>
I agree that TLC does not punish high levels much.  That's my point -- it encourages people to level up quickly.  It punishes the mid-levels severely.  Those levels where you can't afford to either pay someone to help or can't do the quest because it's blocked.  Casters don't learn the research skill until level 16.  A couple levels after that, they can't do the concordance quest themselves, but must pay for a GLS.  Even 10p is a huge sum at that level.<br>
<br>
No, the only real impact is on quests.  Can't do quest discovery.  Can't do quests yourself that were designed to be completed yourself.  Epics, for instance, were all designed with *starting* at level 50+ in mind and with the idea that most of the pre-work -- the ugly long camping -- would be solo.  With TLC, the common thought of &quot;I'll worry about my epic at 50&quot; could cut you off from ever obtaining it.  And, yes, epics are absolutely required for the high level game.<br>
<br>
Don't y'all care about the newbie folk that play the game more or less pure?  What about solving a quest yourself without a spoiler?  Isn't there anyone that likes do that instead of waiting for someone else to do all the work solving it for you and post it up all nice and tidy with levels and how-to's on the web?  Being first on a quest is a ton of work, but it's also a lot of fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzarsissrazorscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarsiss Razorscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 12:52:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=986.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin quests...</span><hr size=1> So far, I've enjoyed this server because of the overall TLC affect and not in spite of it. I think it's good that bottom-feeders have a measure of resistance here. At only level 26 I have not attempted many dungeons, but the few I have been in were completely farmer free. There's not much to farm in Kurns, but I can guarantee those few things are farmed heavily on any other server. It's quite fun to crawl a dungeon, as opposed to exploring it from the zone line via an ooc camp check role call. Anyway, I am strongly opposed to any change that would cause FV to become just another blue server.<br>
<br>
TLC is not that long of a row to hoe. The example made in the opening post of a high level monk offering a trade to a low level quester is good. However, contrary to the posters intent, the example demonstrates how easily TLC works for all of us. I'm appalled that such an honorable, allbeit generous, solution is now insulted and twisted to fuel this lukewarm ember of something that is supposed to be a fire.<br>
<br>
I out leveled a few drops in the shackle quest. I guess that makes me effected by TLC. The quest is unaffected though. It still requires the same components as it always did, and they still drop at the same rate every time the mob dies. If I want to continue this quest, I will. I'll use any one of the solutions found in each and every one of these threads. Until you can prove that Quest X stops here and there is no way around it because of TLC, then you have no argument against TLC. Well, except for the argument that you can't do it all alone. But that sounds awfully petty, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
To me, a good challenge will have me asking a simple question. How bad do I want it? The best challenges will have me ask it a few times.<br>
