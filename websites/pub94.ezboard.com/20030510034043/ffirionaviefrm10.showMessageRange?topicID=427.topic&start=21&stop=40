<br>
Because all things are born capable of love, even if it is buried deep in a dark heart. <br>
<br>
They met in Paineel, the boy and the girl, and they fell in love, though, like many great love affairs, their families and their lives stood in the way of that love. <br>
<br>
She grew up to become a necromancer, though not a very good one, because her heart was not in it. And he grew up to become a shadowknight, which he had the talent for, but not the anger. <br>
<br>
And they both went into the world, and thought of each other. They met when they could, and they shared their love when they could. <br>
<br>
And then one day they discovered the beauty of Stonebrunt Mountains. <br>
<br>
They did not belong there, not in the least; though powerful they were truly cityfolk and not well suited for life in the mountains. But in the peace of Stonebrunt Mountains, they could love each other without reproach, without fear, without hesitation. <br>
<br>
But their kin had caused too much fear for too many. The catfolk of the mountain had long been at war with the lovers' people, and had a bounty on the heads of the heretics. <br>
<br>
And one morning, like so many great love stories, theirs met a tragic end. <br>
<br>
The boy, now a man, went to the river to gather water for cooking. His lover, the girl now a woman, was nearby, singing songs in a tongue that carried the sadness of a race split in half by difference. <br>
<br>
And suddenly, the man no longer heard the singing of his love. <br>
<br>
He found her body, separated from her beautiful face, on the ground at their camp. He cradled that broken body, rocking it, his tears mixing with her red blood, still warm. <br>
<br>
And not long after, the bounty hunters found him. He had just finished burying his lover's body. <br>
<br>
When he saw them, he began to sing, his lover's song, in the language his people spoke before the severing. <br>
<br>
And he fought not with the fear of his god, but with the recklessness of a broken heart. <br>
<br>
He died singing, and knowing that wherever the dead go when they leave this mortal sphere, he would be with his love, and they could love each other. <br>
<br>
Forever. Unconditionally. And without reproach. <br>
<br>
(for broken hearts)<br>

He was not as large as other cubes, but he still took pride in keeping his section of corridors free of litter and debris.<br>
<br>
Without warning, a scream reverberated off his outer membrane, alerting Cuburt to trouble nearby. It was generally the policy of gelatinous cubes not to become involved in the affairs of others, but being unnaturally curious for a protoplasmic being, he couldn’t help but investigate.<br>
<br>
Round a corner, Cuburt’s cilia sensed a girl in the clutches of a reanimated skeleton. All three of his olfactory organelles detected fear in the little girl’s pheromones, so he began to envelop the skeleton with several pseudopods. As the skeleton realized it was being digested, it released the girl and started struggling to free itself. The girl tottered precariously on a ledge for a few moments, but Cuburt’s flagellum was too slow to catch her. He did manage to snag her dress, but he could feel from the inferior weave of the material that it would not hold.<br>
<br>
Helpless to prevent otherwise, Cuburt listened to the girl plummet into a pool of ravenous piranhas. As his mitochondria sprang into life to process the skeleton’s remains into energy he could use, he thought it prudent to form a protective membrane around the little girl’s dress, which was still entangled in his flagellum. ‘Perhaps someone will want this to remember her by,’ he thought to himself. Cuburt was quite fond of keepsakes and deduced that other beings might share his sentimentality.<br>
<br>
No sooner had he enveloped the dress in its own special vacuole and returned to his assigned area, when he felt the vibrations of footsteps approaching. It was an adult human, male, and wearing size 12 leather boots, judging by the nature of the vibrations. He began pushing the girl’s dress to his surface in order that the human might easily reach it.<br>
<br>
“Aha! There’s the foul thing!” cried the human. A sword cruelly sliced his membrane and his cytoplasm began streaming out. Cuburt desperately tried to show he meant no harm by forming a crude face out of two fire beetle eyes and a pair of rat whiskers, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
As the second sword strike pierced Cuburt’s nucleus, he lamented that he would never be able to engage in mitosis. ‘Capricious fates, would that you’d given me large cute eyes and a furry hide to protect me!’ he mourned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=isharramoonsong>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 738<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/02 7:49:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cuburt's Demise</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Cuburt desperately tried to show he meant no harm by forming a crude face out of two fire beetle eyes and a pair of rat whiskers, but to no avail.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

His face was wizened with age, the skin around his one enormous eye puckered with folds of skin, from laughing, from crying, from squinting against the sun. <br>
<br>
Despite his age, despite the heaviness in his muscles and the aches in his bones, the cyclops traveled. This was still his world, he thought, and still his world to see.<br>
<br>
He remembered when elves ruled the shoreline, when the Desert of Ro was the Eldarr Forest. When he wandered, often he would stop and become entranced in those memories, illusions covering up the ugly reality that remained. <br>
<br>
Here, I fought the elf-knight Veridyl and won. Here a great dragon laid her eggs, only to find them destroyed by a rival. Here my son died. And here. And here. All my sons are dead, he thinks. But I still remain. <br>
<br>
In the cyclops' pocket, he carried a ring. He knew it was magical, but understood the concept only in the way laypeople understand magic. It holds power. This ring is special, and I don't know why. <br>
<br>
So he carried it. He found the ring on the ground in the Eldarr Forest centuries ago, and kept it because it was pretty. Cyclops are simple creatures and keep very little by way of possessions. <br>
<br>
And though his one enormous eye is still clear and bright, the cyclops is blind to one thing: the ring he carries makes him a hunted creature.<br>
<br>
And so the ancient cyclops wanders, stands hip-deep in the Ocean of Tears, listens to the gulls, and waits for the world to change again. He has seen it change many times. Through one great green eye he has watched history unfold. <br>
<br>
But tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow he will be hunted. And he will die for a chip of gold he pocketed from the floor of a forest that no longer exists. And with him will die the memories of a world since past. <br>

<br>
Welcome to Kimaya's world...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kimaya wasn't hungry.  She had just finished snacking on a juicy piece of fruit, its sweetness still playing about on her tongue.<br>
<br>
She wasn't hunting for food.<br>
<br>
Kimaya wasn't cold.  She was nestled cozily into the folds of the warm scouting cloak she had earned in Katta, her finger gently tracing the neatly embroidered &quot;KS&quot; they had stitched just inside the collar.<br>
<br>
She wasn't hunting for shelter.  Nor did she hunt to protect her own safety.  Once again, she was hunting for the safety of others, and each time she did it she wished it would fix everything so she'd never have to hurt anything ever again.<br>
<br>
She ducked her head as she peered around the corner of the tunnel leading deeper into the kobold warrens.  It wasn't that she was afraid of being ambushed, as most of the bearmen-barking-like-dogs had stopped daring to attack her ages before.  A part of her was hoping that, if they didn't know she was looking, she might catch them doing something natural.<br>
<br>
She didn't.<br>
<br>
Once again, that little stab in her heart deepened as she overheard gutteral growls celebrating a recent kill of a young &quot;tall-header&quot;, and plans to venture back out in the night to assault a newly trained &quot;meowl-walker&quot; scout as it tried to learn its new route.  She paused as she listened.  She wanted them to be good, she wanted them to learn.  More than anything else in the world right then, she wanted them to hunt for food, or for shelter, or even to thin out an overpopulated rank.<br>
<br>
But they didn't.<br>
<br>
They wanted to hunt simply to steal the lives of others, simply to be mean, and she couldn't let them do it.  She stepped from the concealing camouflage and asked them if they'd please do something else instead, but they only attacked in reply.  She kinda knew they would.  Her hammer swung smoothly, and the wounds were clean, the vines holding them still as they turned away to ensure their deaths were as quick as she could possibly make them.  <br>
<br>
Yet with each splintering of bone, something cracked in echo inside her.  With each bruise she crushed, her soul ached more deeply.  She felt their arrogant anger turn to selfish fear, and it made her want to yell at them, MAKE them behave, MAKE them stop hurting people so she didn't have to make them hurt.<br>
<br>
She didn't cry.  No matter how much she wanted to when she had to hunt, she never cried.  Instead she paused over the lifeless bodies, wishing them a safe journey into their next step, searching for any final gifts left behind to do the good they failed to perform in life.  And as she often wished since the day she first had to help squash a bug to keep it from killing Kenyon, she wished she'd never have to hurt anything ever again.  But wishing wasn't making anything true, so with a quick sigh she turned back to helping the world of the living.<br>
<br>
She retrieved a small empty bag, a worn bokken, and a few battered coins.  She gave the bag to a young man training his skills just inside the tunnels, and earmarked the coins to pay for frosting on her next batch of cookies.  The bokken she took with her out into the mountains.  There was a young scout she had to find as it tried to learn a new route, and it probably needed protection. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kimayasilverbark>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0> at: 12/17/02 3:18:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 536<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 7:43:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yer never know how yer life turns out, do yer.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nay.&quot;<br>
The others stayed silent.<br>
<br>
The campfire cracked slowly, showering tiny sparks onto the soggy ground of the plains.  It cast a flickering light on the few figures hunched around it, illuminating each detail of their face, while barely creeping around the edges of their assembled, battered animal skin huts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer know.&quot;  The tall one glanced around the group, the scars of the battleworn mounted upon his once youthful cheek as dreadful trophies.  &quot;Long afore yer use tae be out 'ere.  Long afore we were out 'ere, I used ter 'ave a keen interest in a young lass back home.  Back in Halas.  Real beauty, she was, just yer comfy height below yer, big, strong.  Honest.&quot;  The big man sighed, his shoulders consigned to carrying a dreadful weight.  He stared into the floor.  &quot;I miss 'er, yer know.  She prob'ly be marryin' some blader, yer know, warrior, big type, noble.  Rich.  I be hopin' she 'aves an 'appy life, but I can't 'elp but think what we could have 'ad together.&quot;<br>
<br>
A general rumble of consent came from the group.  The stoutest one, a dwarf with an unkempt beard, ragged from years of neglect and glass trimming, nodded solemly.  &quot;We be leavin a lot behind.  We should never have be botherin tryin ter survive out here.  Should havin died.  Better than livin like this.&quot;<br>

&quot;It's not that bad.  We are living the dream of many a nobleman, you know.  Life on the open road, no one to regulate us, no one to catch us.  We are a law unto ourselves.&quot;  A young elf.  She sounded reasonably upbeat, but her tone betrayed her true feelings.  A melanchony as black as pitch lay poised beneath her jovial speech.  Her fingers lay nervously upon her scimitar hilt, forever poised for inevitable, unending and final combat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer naive, lass.  Yer will learn..  Yer will learn, there ain't bein' no freedom 'bout bein a bandit.  Yer live, and yer die by yer sword.&quot;<br>
<br>
A human nodded, another untrimmed beard among the many.  He drew back the tattered rags along his arm to reveal a half foot long scar.  &quot;Last of those bastard rangers did this to me.  They think we bother their animals, or something.  If they weren't trying to kill us so often, those damned animals, we wouldn't fight them so often.  Shortsighted little ranger sh-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be quiet and drink yer ale,&quot; the dwarf said sharply.  He narrowed his eyes, the great lines of sleeplessness being a scar of their very own.  &quot;We'll be movin termorow.  Word's been gettin out they know where we be.&quot;  The dwarf picked himself off the ground.  &quot;Expectin yer all to be ready.&quot;<br>

The day had dawned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, not much here, is there.&quot;<br>
&quot;Nae, tae bandits, they nae look all that rich.&quot;<br>
<br>
A young human, clad from head to toe in banded mail, plodded slowly across the bloodstained earth, the Ghoulbane swung low to his side as he scanned the camp for survivors.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like that's all of them.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yep, sure looks that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
The human and his tall female companion fanned out across the camp, checking each body for useful trinkets, weapons, money, anything that might prove worthwhile.  A few knocked out golden teeth.  A fine steel or bronze weapon or two.<br>
<br>
A tall Halasman, his face sadly at ease lay prone, a crimson stain spreading from his belly.  It surrounded a small golden trinket, enveloping it in a blanket of colour.  The human absently picked it up and looked it over.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am findin these bandits, they have plenty of tae gold teeth!&quot;<br>
The paladin waved off the comment.  &quot;Just a second, I'll be right with you!&quot;<br>
<br>
It appeared to be a locket of some sort, tarnished by years of bad weather and abuse.  The chain was ornate though, seemingly having managed to survive the ages.  The main body of the locket was a simple circle, protected by little more than a clasp.  It flicked open with the most miniscule of effort, leaving him wondering why it had even survived at all.  Inside was a portrait.  A picture from what looked like a gnomish kamera, poor quality, almost watercolour.  The face within the picture, spoke volumes.<br>
<br>
The paladin looked over to his companion, still rummaging her way through the bodies.  &quot;Oh..&quot; he whispered.  He held the locket up, his eyes darting between the two women, one of them lost in the past, the other trapped in the present.  A great sadness washed over his heart, and he placed the locket within his backpack.  A silent prayer to the Lord Marr.<br>
<br>
All was done.<br>
<br>
___________________<br>
<br>
The heads of the bandits were to be taken to the Qeynos guards, normally.  They offered a substancial reward, but the paladin had refused to do so.  It would only go to the Temple.  Instead, he labouriously carried the heavy body of the dead Halasman to the bridge crossing into the southern plains.<br>
<br>
The corpse floated off down the river, the blood having long since stopped leaking from his body.  If any other than the paladin were watching, they would have seen his hand closed over his heart.<br>
<br>
The paladin sighed sadly, turning to his companion who sat fishing over the side of the bridge.  Saying nothing more, he merely tapped her on the shoulder, and the pair set off on adventures anew, a locket lighter in weight. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A> at: 12/16/02 8:10:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gatsuthewarrior>GatsuTheWarrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 9:09:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> Heres the only thought i have to that post. <br>

<br>
The jungle was sickly and long past its prime, its ancient trees kept alive only through the magics of the sentinels of Cazic Thule.  What few small structures dotted its landscape were crumbling and worn with the steps of creatures called evil that were yet as holy as any creation of the opposing alliance of Gods.  Everything is holy to someone...<br>
<br>
His had been the first plane to have been torn into, its rifts to the mortal world spelling doom for the Lord of Fear, not because He was somehow weaker than any other God, but because more creatures hated Him.  Since then, the footfalls of Mortal creatures seemed to never leave his tiny realm. Since then, he had taken up the sword that he had not wielded for thousands upon thousands of years.  Many had fallen to it--Elves of all colors, variants of the Marr children, the tiny Brell creations, and more had tried their hands at him.<br>
<br>
What broke his spirit was the others.  Trolls. Iksar.  His own children, creatures of power and, in their own ways, simple beauty.  Since the rift opened they had taken their blades to him alongside the ranks of others, without so much as regret.<br>
<br>
The footfalls came again--dozens this time.  Cazic Thule stood from his throne and clutched his sword in one massive arm.  Heading outside, he felt himself stumble, a painful reminder of his age and his lost power.  He could already see the mortals passing through his moat of fire, and readied his blade to meet them.<br>
<br>
They didn't even fear him anymore... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lest@firionavie>Lest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/17/02 11:10:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> &quot;Everything is holy to someone...&quot;<br>

She moved a hand to her tunic, tracing her fingers lightly over the printed sigil of Mistmoore that emblasoned it.  A smile crossed her lips that spoke of pride, and for the first time, she felt what it meant to belong.<br>
<br>
She had never dreamed that she would one day have the honor to bear the crest of the Vampire lord, to stand tall and mighty alongside the ranks of the most powerful mortal Norrath had ever seen.  Now that her trials and training were complete, she was determined to do just that--to bear His banner into the greatest battles of Norrath, to be a part of Him, a part of Norrath's very history. To be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">worth</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> something!  She remembered the sting of her mother's hands and the bruises she'd weathered from the fists of her father as they poisoned her mind, filling her with lies and spite.  They said she would never amount to more than a whore.  She laughed inside--Oh, what she would do if they could see her this day!<br>
<br>
A twig snapped below, and she remembered her duty, glancing down suspiciously.  A shadow flitted between two trees along the canyon wall.  Scouts of Kelethin!  Ha!  She would teach them to try to sneak into His nest!  When she brought their corpses to His throne, He would smile upon her.  And recognize her. And perhaps promote her, or invite her to dine with Him, and He would call her to him by night, and perhaps...  Her heart fluttered, and a flush crept into her blue skin.  Glancing down again, she watched one of the Elves step out cautiously into the open, and drew back a Shuriken.  Today, she knew, would be the day that her life became something far more than meaningful. Today, she would become great.  Today, she would become loved. Today, she--<br>
<br>
The initiate staggered back with a shriek as an arrow whistled through the dusk, ripping into her chest.  She lurched forward onto the edge of her cliff watch, gripping at the arrow's shaft  and feeling her own warm blood slide through her hands.  Though her heart was narrowly missed, she felt in her mind that it had shattered, and her spirit, her hope, and her pride seeped out of her with her blood, dropping with it onto the dirt, just another meaningless casualty of a war being fought for no reason.  Meaningless...<br>
<br>
The initiate looked up and could just see the form of the Ranger below, and saw her despair mirrored in the Wood Elf's eyes.  They were different and the same, enemies of one heart.  The initiate whispered a last haunting gasp of despair and fell, tumbling over the ledge with a tear still lingering in her dead eye.<br>
<br>
She was the first of many. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siava>Siava</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Siava/ball47.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Raven</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/02 6:34:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> This is to remind myself NOT to read new entries here before work. *sniffle* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grafireforgedawn>Grafire Forgedawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/02 7:04:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.inktank.com/images/eZgrafire.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> These are awesome.<br>

<br>
The sun shines high in the sky, not a cloud in sight.  A soft chill breeze in the air occasionally wafts past the protection of the mountain.  Grelch shivered as the breeze rattled the beads he work.  The sun was painful, but it was his duty to stand in protection of the caves from the elves, Iksar, and other creatures that lived near the lake.  The goblin beside him was his friend since childhood, Angroost.  He glanced over at his companion, easily his match in fighting skill, with a bored sigh.<br>
<br>
His shift was almost over.  Despite the boring manotony of the position, Grelch was quietly in anticipation.  Today, his sister would be coming of age.  There would be a great celebration as she was paraded about for all the potential mates.  As her brother, Grelch was expected to help her select her mate.  He had no idea who would be present, but his sister had been giving Angroost the eye quite a bit.  Perhaps he could get the two of them paired up.<br>
<br>
Just one more mark to go before their releif would arrive, and Grelch would be able to go to his sister's side.  Surely this mark would pass even slower than the last did.  Uneventful, painfully bright, boring.<br>
<br>
A chuckle of his companion brought him out of his thought.  Glancing around, he saw what was amusing.  A single frail little elf stood alone not far from the road.  Grelch was never sure with these creatures, but this one looked female to him.  She was busy studying some sort of book, occasionally glancing in the direction of the cave.  Her training could hardly be more then either of the sentrys posted at the mouth of the cave.  Either one of them, Grelch considered, would more than best her in combat.  Together she was no match.  Now his chuckle echoed his companion's.<br>
<br>
The elf was taking her time, occasionally glancing up towards them, or around the nearby hills.  Finally, she got up, closed the book, and stored it in one of her bags.  She casually made her way around the patrol path, until she was beside the mountain of the goblins.  She was getting a bit too close now.  Grelch was about to make a signal to Angroost to attack, when the elf made a motion, and a glowing emanated from her hands.  A similar glowing started to surround Grelch.  He made a motion to charge, but suddenly he felt a weight against his mind, distracting his attention despite his best efforts to fight the grip now holding him.<br>
<br>
That was all the signal Angroost needed.  He charged into battle, shouting a war cry, ready to smash the elf.  Again, a glow from the elf's hands, and a force of magic springs up from the ground, binding his feet in place.<br>
<br>
Grelch watched in horror as his partner was rendered helpless.  Desperately, he tried to fight the grip on his own mind, he could not bear to see his companion just murdered without being able to do anything about it.  The grip on his mind held fast.  Once again, the enchanter turned her attention to Grelch, completely ignoring the other companion.  Rage filled him, trying to lash out at this elf bent on destruction, but his body would not obey, making his rage even worse.<br>
<br>
Out of nowhere a sound.  A barking.  Not in his ears, but in his head.  A barking such as would set your spine a chill, like nothing this worldly.  Grelch's rage turned into panic as the barking got louder, poisoning his minds and breaking down his mental barriors to intrusion, helpless to do anything about it.<br>
<br>
In an effort of will, Grelch tried to fight the force holding his mind captive.  A battle raging inside his head.  A futile effort, yet he seems to be making progress.  His finger moved to his command.  Not much, but it is a start.  Focusing every fiber of his will, Grelch commanded his body to move.<br>
<br>
Then a voice entered his head.  One more powerful than his own will.  An elven voice.  &quot;You are my slave now.  Attack this goblin warrior.  Kill.&quot;  In that moment, all the ground Grelch had gained over his own body was lost.  His limbs betrayed him, his voice acknowledging, &quot;Attacking a goblin warrior, master.&quot;  Unbidden, he charged at his companion, swing after swing contacting the immobilized goblin.<br>
<br>
Desperately, Grelch wanted to call out, &quot;Save yourself.  Kill me if you must, think of my sister.&quot;  But his mouth would only utter battle cries.  Angroost looked shocked, but he is a trained fighter.  As if he heard, or at least understood, he turned the attack on Grelch.  Still, Grelch fought the control.  Tried to force his will back into his own mind.  He was not strong enough, and every time he was close to regaining some control, the barking in his mind loosed his control enough for him to lose it.  All he can do is watch in horror as blow after blow strikes one of the goblins he least wished to hurt.<br>
<br>
Blow after blow landed, both goblins tearing each other up, while the elf just stood in the distance and cackled with glee.  With an exertion of force from the torn up body, Grelch slammed his balled up fists into his friend's head.  Angroost crumbled to the ground lifeless with that blow.  Grelch wanted to scream out in agony, the torment of his companion and sister's possible mate dying at his own hand.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the elf left his mind.  A wave of pain sweeps over him, crumpling him onto the ground.  One of his arms is broken, blood pouring from all over his body, several ribs cracked.  In desperation he tries to crawl to the safety of the cave, and hope another sees his agony and comes to the rescue.  He calls out, &quot;Sister, I tried!  I tried...&quot; a tear welling up in his eye.  Hand over hand, ignore the pain, get help.  Forget everything else.<br>
<br>
A shock runs through his body, tormenting his mind and tearing the last bit of conscousness and life away from him.  Both goblins lay lifeless, crumpled on top of each other, victims of intrusion into their minds.<br>
<br>
Deep in the tunnel, Grelch's sister eagerly awaits her brother's return so she can finish the final preperation for the nights ceremony.  She could hardly contain her excitement, and anticipation.  She knew Angroost would be in the line of prospective mates, and she does not think she would be happy with anybody else.  With her excitement building by the moment, she waited for the mark to pass and her brother and Angroost to return from their shift. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siava>Siava</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Siava/ball47.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Raven</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/03 12:38:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Siava/conjure.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> Usha trembled with nervousness as her mother fastened the last tiny button on the dress. Her mother fretted over her, jittery herself, as she tried to calm her daughter's nerves.<br>
<br>
&quot;You look absolutely radiant, Usha.&quot;, she gushed as her daughter made a gown-flaring twirl. &quot;I know you've longed for this day, just as your father and I have. We couldn't be any happier.&quot;<br>
<br>
Usha hugged her mother tightly before sitting down at the mirror to make sure her hair was fixed perfectly. As her mother showered her with advice, Usha's mind drifted to the day she took a liking to her beloved.<br>
<br>
They were in school, which was the home of a village elder. Snath, the class bully, pulled her ponytail with a forceful yank just to see her cry. And cry she did. Hytok, the son of her father's hunting partner, had walked up silently behind Snath and chopped him right on the back of the neck! Snath slumped forward, drooled on his shoe, and started to snore. All of the children cheered and laughed.<br>
<br>
Usha and Hytok were merely playmates before, but that day, she saw him in a different light. They became the best of friends and fell deeper in love with every day that passed thereafter. And today, they were to be married. She couldn't wait to start a family and share a life with him like she had seen her mother do with her own family. What a happy day indeed.<br>
<br>
Usha's younger sister burst in the back door. &quot;Usha, mother, it's time!&quot; she squealed with excitement before zipping back out the door. The bride-to-be peeked out the window to see every villager standing in the street. Then she saw Hytok standing next to her father. He looked so handsome in his tailored suit, and was trembling just as badly as she was,<br>
but he was smiling. With a giggle, Usha announced to her mother that she was ready.<br>
<br>
Hytok's heart stopped for just a moment when he sighted his future wife. Never before had he seen her look so beautiful, so lovely, and he thanked the Gods for bringing her into the world. He had known he loved her from the very first time he met her, and was determined to be the best husband and friend to her one could ever possibly be. She was his life.<br>
<br>
His palms grew slick with sweat as she made that awful, traditional, slow wedding walk towards him. She gazed lovingly at him when she reached his side, her eyes as big and innocent as a doe's. Her lips quivered once, and he thought she was about to cry, but then her eyes rolled back into her head. He thought she was having a panic attack, or perhaps a seizure even, so he grasped her behind the back to lay her down, all the while listening to the gasps and outbursts of concern from the audience. He brought his<br>
hands to her cheeks to straighten her head and cried out with horror as bright red blood smeared her face.<br>
<br>
Hytok heard a faint whistling sound, then saw Usha's father grasp his chest. Screams from the crowd, as well as Hytok, were drowned out by the battle cries of young elves as their arrows rained down on the villagers from the sky. Young and old alike were struck down viciously; their flesh torn away for its rich chocolate taste.<br>
<br>
The elves were like bees as they swarmed the entire village. There was no chance for survival, and Hytok didn't want to survive. He buried his head into Usha's neck and wept bitterly as he held her close and rocked. He didn't want to live if it meant living without her. All the memories of her came crashing over him as he cried harder - the smell of her hair, the way her cheeks dimpled when she smiled, the enjoyment in her eyes when they would go drakeback flying through the forest, the taste of her kisses, the sound of her laughter, promises of the future they had made together. Hytok didn't even flinch when a sword pierced through his back.<br>

 <br>
Deep in the halls of a forgotten, befallen place are a horde of memories.<br>
 <br>
Of joy. Green places. The dance of fair elven people, of wine and feast and court.<br>
 <br>
Of a single,pure and god-borne fire that smothered it all from the world. And the bones that remained...still remembering.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Marnek.&quot;,they sing. &quot;Marnek has kept us.&quot;,in words only the dead may hear. <br>
<br>
&quot;For Marnek and the Burning Prince, we remain.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The voices fill the broken halls,a speechless chant that rouses only the broken soul. Burnt bones dance to it,adding the percussion of ancient femur and blackened skull. Corpses sway,in rapture to the eternal words. To the dead,it is peace.<br>
<br>
The living come. Some few can hear enough of the litany to remain,knowing the voice of the damned.<br>
 <br>
The rest do not.<br>
 <br>
Dwarves and living elves,Men and Halfling,Gnome or Iksar. All come to break the bones and scavenge what they might from the end of ages. And die. Or leave. They do not hear. They do not learn.<br>
 <br>
The song rolls on,and the dead resume their dances in the lightless places,the immortal words calling dust to shards. Shards to bones. Bones to body once more.<br>
<br>
&quot;For Marnek and the Burning Prince, we remain.&quot;<br>
