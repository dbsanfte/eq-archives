It was more than obvious that Thule willed these creatures, eventually, the same fate as the hairless apes.  Something so hideously ugly deserves death, by pity if not by principle.  And to think that this upstart whiff felt that his skills could be superior!  Kelisk was a proud member of the Legion, and the Chancellor of a caste no less.  There were no fighters across any lands who could hope to compete with an Iksar trooper.  It must be some delusion among non-Iksar that if one is big, slow, and dumb, they will come out the stronger fighter.  Well, Kelisk knew better.  His litheness and agility in combat would easily bring not a single blow from this furred brute to his hide.  Ha.  What a fool.  Kelisk made a note to kill him at some point. Not now, though...he had a drink to finish. <p><img src="http://members.hometown.aol.com/bseh14/images/kel.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaberianthebrave.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aberian the Brave</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/13/02 11:16:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: enter Aberian the Brave</span><hr size=1> *as he finishes up his dinner, he feels the eyes of the beast fixed on him. he dropped several platnuim pieces down beside the plate, picks up his tankard,  and walked over to the table.<br>
