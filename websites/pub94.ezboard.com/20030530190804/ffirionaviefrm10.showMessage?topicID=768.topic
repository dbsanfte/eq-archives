In all honesty, he couldn't remember if he'd murdered any of these mush-headed frog bastards, so he wasn't sure what kind of reception he was gonna receive.  But when the guards withdrew their crossed spears with a FRROOOAKK!, Keeg figured he was in the clear.<br>
<br>
Entering the stinking, lichen-covered caves, he followed a series of twisting and turning passages, as described by that idiot, Brother Qwinn.  Two days ago, and after much hoofing, he'd managed to find Qwinn sitting under a tree in the southern plains of Karana.  Qwinn was twirling some flower between his fingers and humming a moronic tune.  In the ever-annoying manner of the dress-wearing Ashen Hand, Qwinn had received Keeg as his &quot;Brother,&quot; and, with a flourish of his hand, had invited him to sit.<br>
<br>
Under that tree, Qwinn outlined the task at hand.  He was to seek out Brother Raster, who had sought inner peace and enlightenment with the Frogloks deep inside Guk.  There, Brother Raster would have a test for him.  If the test was passed, Brother Raster would give Keeg an Idol, which was to be used in the next part of this quest.  Pressed as to the nature of Brother Raster's test, Qwinn only chuckled.  &quot;You will discover its nature in Time, my Brother, in Time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course, Keeg thought Raster and Qwinn were both a couple of idiots...peace and enlightenment?  Why the hell would you learn to fight if all you're gonna do is spout off about peace?  And Keeg was perfectly happy being who he was.  He didn't need &quot;enlightened.&quot;  But there was a kickass pair of handwraps he'd heard about...Celustaful Fists or some such, and he was willing to suffer these peacenik idiots to get them.  First Qwinn, then Raster, then whoever else.<br>
<br>
So he now found himself deep within the bowels of Guk, and the damn place sure stunk like someone's bowels.  How the hell could these frogs live here?  But what the hell, he figured, they were just animals anyway.  Where the hell do you think they'd live?  On the surface?  This thought brought an involuntary chuckle from the Monk, and several frogloks looked at him inquisitively.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the frogs had left him alone.  But as he neared the end of the path described by &quot;Brother&quot; Qwinn, Keeg found  himself confronted by a pair of burly warrior-looking frogs and a third in beads carrying some sort of totem staff.<br>
<br>
As Keeg was considering his chances against three armed frogs, Bead-frog chattered something...unrecognizable....at him.  Figuring they weren't gonna attack him, Keeg only shrugged and said, &quot;Raster.&quot;<br>
<br>
The three frogs looked at each other, then back to the Monk, then back to each other.  Bead-frog nodded to the other two, and they nodded back.  It then made a sort of gulping motion, smacked what passed for its lips, and spoke the best Human it could muster.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rrrassturr...commme....Human....Rrrasssturr....frrriend.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well, now we're gettin' somewhere</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, thought the Monk.  The two warrior-frogs flopped sideways to allow passage, and bead-frog led Keeg deeper into the cave.  The slap-slap of its webbed feet grated on Keeg's nerves, and he had to suppress several urges to lash out suddenly and crush the bastard frog's skull.  They passed a few more twists and turns, with warrior-frogs posted at each intersection, and Keeg took mental notes in case he had to leave in a hurry.<br>
<br>
Finally, the cave widened and the ceiling withdrew out of sight.  They'd entered a larger cavern speckled with torches.  The cavern wasn't so wide as it was long, but the cramped passages had been left behind.  A flickering glow was visible at the far end of the cavern across a small, brackish pond.<br>
<br>
Approaching, Keeg saw the outline of a small hut.  This is where bead-frog stopped, and flapped an annoying backflip.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rrrasssturr....theerrrrre....Human....wwaiit!  Wwait for Rrrasssturs!!  If Human.....leaaaveee...Rrrassturr not come!  Unndersstand...Human?&quot;<br>
<br>
The urge to lash out almost overcame the Monk, and he clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.  But the rage ebbed, and through gritted teeth he answered.  &quot;Yeah.....yeah, I understand.  Wait for Raster.  If I leave, he don't show up, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;FROOAAKK!!&quot; and bead-frog did another backflip.  He turned and slap-slapped away while the Monk watched with a scowl.  Again, he felt the sudden urge to murder bead-frog and every damn frog in sight, but a pair of magical mitts was worth a bit of restraint.  So the frogs get to live....today.<br>
<br>
The Monk sighed.  &quot;Let's get this shit over with.&quot;  He turned and crossed the short distance to the small cave-hut.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Knock knock, ya bastard</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought, as he rapped on the door.  No answer.  He tried again.  Nothing.  Finally, he lifted the door handle and pushed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone home?&quot;<br>
<br>
The hut was, of course, empty.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh this is gonna be a shitload of fun,&quot; he said to noone in particular.<br>
