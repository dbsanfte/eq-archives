<br>
First, let me clear up one thing. <br>
<br>
I have no problem losing a duel to anyone. I'll duel anybody, any time. No matter what season they are. If they are blood red, I'll duel em and try to win. If they are green, I'll duel em and try to win. I dont care. A duels a duel and for Zaith, he wont ever stop fighting until he or the other person is dead. <br>
<br>
But over the course of my time here on FV, I have come to realize that a vast majority of people wont duel you unless they can win, and they know it. I have never fought a duel with anyone even conned to me, or yellow to me. They are always Green/DB/ or red. The duels I have fought are, mostly, IC duels. I've beat many red conned people in my day, and lost a few as well. <br>
<br>
While I can understand the mentality of not wanting to lose a fight, I ask people to start thinking like thier character when it comes to duels. Zaith is a Knight. He, thus, has honor, no matter what you Evil/darkies might say. He will fight anyone if they offend his honor, attack his family, guild or friends. Doesnt matter if they are green to him or blood red. He has killed many dark blue conned folks that messed with the younger member of Lust for Blood and he killed lots of red conned members of Lust and others as well. Since he left Lust for Blood, he hasnt dueled as much, but those he has fought have always been red since he left. Some he beat and some he lost. <br>
<br>
Ok. My point, right. Getting to it. <br>
<br>
The other night a group of people came into Neriak and started killing the guards, looking for some conflict RP. I got a /tell from one of my friends who just started an alt and she told me no one was there that was near old enough to fight back. So, Zaith still wishing to defend Neriak, and more so those who cant defend them selves, ran his skinny inky butt over there and stood up to em. They were all red to him at 45. Some had Barons in thier names. My guess is 55+. But he dueled the only person who would fight him, a enchanter. He lost but the enchanter was bragging how he had not lost a fight and has never tasted a blade in a duel. Zaith let him taste his, a few times. <br>
<br>
So they leave. A 55+ SK from Conclave of the Damned, who I've RPed with before, showed up, insulted Zaith and promptly killed him. So Z died twice to people he knew he couldnt beat but it was his duty. <br>
<br>
So whats the fucking deal people? Is everyone SO afraid of losing a duel that you wont fight unless you KNOW you will win? Its a death, thats it. You MIGHT lose some exp but who cares? Its just exp! I lost exp in my duel with the enchanter. <br>
<br>
Conflict, as Shin has so often said, is the core of role play. I agree whole heartedly. With out conflict, you have no real role play, just pansies sitting around singing Kumbeya or what ever.  <br>
<br>
Dont be scared of getting you butt whooped. And just because someone is dark blue or light blue to you doesnt mean you will win. I've proven that point a few times to people.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/warden4423/newzaith2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I duel pretty often, and will happily take on people that are used to never losing.  Always a good fight.<br>
<br>
So if dueling is your thing, at least know at level 65, you will see ALOT of even-con fights.<br>

Was there to watch the rp going on and it was alot of fun. I noticed that when Tut showed up that they scooted there pale butts out fast enough, and it was even commented on by someone in the crowd that when someone high enough showed up to make it a fair duel that they left fast enough.<br>

Much thanks for the two rezes to hasten my dead booty back to my corpse. <br>
<br>
Ya, Tut showed up right when they were leaving, then Kazanti, the 55something Sk that whooped me showed to. <br>
<br>
You know, I've taken Zaith and a few of this family to Neriak to get revenge on the guards and we didnt get any love. The youth just looted the bodies and went on.<br>
<br>

<br>
Another thing,<br>
<br>
I know at 65 I will see even conns, but I havent been 65 before and 45 is as high as I've ever been. Hell, saturday is my first dragon raid since I started 4ish years ago.<br>
<br>
But its not seasons that I care about. A majority of my duels have been against people higher than me, and they think cause they are higher, they can win. I proved em wrong more often than not. <br>
<br>
I had another point but I forgot..I do that alot.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daunnearlylight>Daunn Earlylight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/28/03 12:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3944.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Duels</span><hr size=1> What I hate is seeing &lt;so and so&gt; has challenged you to a duel to the death.

Having played Teir'dal into his 40's and now a High Elf into his 40's I often think about the differances between the Po(insert race)'s play styles. Especialy when it comes to dueling. Maybe there's some Type A, Type B personality stuff going on behind the toons.(And the peoples choices of races at creation.)<br>
<br>
As Venaden, a DE mage, I never fought an even con. The paleskins talked smack then zoned. Always fought yellow and reds. Won some, lost alot. But it was fun. ( And I may have fought you once Z, Lol and got my ass kicked.)<br>
<br>
As a High Elf Paladen. I have witnessed 1st hand in group chat what I can only call cowardice. Flat out refusals to accept duels to yellow cons ect. Getting to the point I may re-roll back to evil. Just for the action lol. I Havent gotten in a duel since I was 12 seasons now. FREAKIN BORING!<br>
<br>
In fairness tho I have been witness to ONE good Rp dueling session. Bakagnome vs. Antouli (sp?) just inside felwithe. That was quite fun to watch. Would have jumped in myself and issued a challenge to one of the DE group if it wasnt so damn intimadating watching a bunch of good rper's do their thing. Felt like I would mess it all up. (Not a very good rper, but i make an effort.)<br>
<br>
Closing, I think it boils down to the people behind the toons. Those that choose the dark races IMO are more agressive types OOC. Those that chose the lighter races *seem* more interested in the xp side of the game. ( wide sweeping generazation I know. applogies to the hard core Rping lighties.)<br>

I remember you. You were on a drogmor in Nektlos forest right near the PoK book. I killed you, a troll and some Sk. <br>
<br>
I've played both sides, mostly straight up goods. My main here, for along time, was a Fier'Dal rogue of Bristlebane. I was agressive as hell with him to. I wanted to duel all the time, but then I was promptly reminded that rogues suck at dueling if they arnt properly equiped. <br>
<br>
If you want, send Zaith a /tell and we can have a go at it some time. I LOVE dueling paladins. They are my favorite. Get to keel em twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
For example...one day i went to the arena and promptly sat down.  A group of some folks...halfling, gnomes, elf and a dorf i believe 5 in all...light blue and dark blue all began to engage with me.  I quickly dropped 1 or 2 before the others ran for the door.  We did this 2-3 times....had a lot of fun and then i got called away to a group...<br>
<br>
I didnt use all my spells....didnt want them to loose EXP...but I didnt need them either.<br>
<br>
At 65 i see no biggie in loosing EXP.  If I am up against another 65 i use it all.  If they bitch...i snicker.  I send them a tell first and let them know of course...but i am not going to chase a silly bard, druid or shaman around a ring when i can just snare them.<br>
<br>
Anyways....I will continue to have fun in the arena...i hope.<br>

<br>
a) A group awaits me OR we are killing something and would hurt the raid/group me skipping off midfight to duel<br>
<br>
b) We have dueled 2 or 3 times in a row and green or Red con and it's just becomming silly over fun.<br>
<br>
c) The individual isn't RP'ing and takeing a duel personaly.<br>
<br>
<br>
If they are Dark Blue or lower con and I win, Kaz kills them and takes no pride from the death, it was a nessasary thing that needed to be done.  You draw your blade and kill them.  If I lose Kaz is shamed and would be harsh on himself but show honor to a worthy foe.<br>
<br>
If they are Red con and I win, the death was worthy and honor served, still showing honor to a worthy foe as long as they recieve the victory with proper honor.  Nothing is more sad than a person Red coned to you bragging up the victory as they refuse to duel those above them, I see this happen in about 75% of teh city raids that happen.  I do admit I take quite a bit of pride in the occational victory of the Red con, but again a bragging dance idsn't IC for me.<br>

But I have never ran from a duel either. <br>
<br>
I recall once when I was in my mid 30s, the typical shouting match between the usual quick-tongued newbie Fier'dal and the often distant and more powerful Tier'dal was taking place. <br>
<br>
The Tier'dal SK, who I will not name due to the fact I can't remember the exact spelling and I know he is still around, was of course threatening the invasion and slaughter of all the innocent women and children of Kelethin blah blah blah. <br>
<br>
Here I was, bearing witness to the numerous newb Fier'dal children shouting back, showing no fear yet not going to meet and rid Greater Faydark of this evil knight, in typical fashion. Well, I did a /who all Dr*******, and saw he was 9 or 10 seasons my superior and without a hitch in my get-a-long, I shouted I would rid Greater Faydark of this tumor that was plaguing our lands. <br>
<br>
By now it was a zone-wide event lol. I ran to the spires where the SK awaited. He obviously immediately conned me and saw I was green to him, and let me I had just chosen my place of buriel. Well, I stood my ground and accepted his duel. As our swords began swinging, it was clear that my life would soon end, as my life was ending faster at a 10:1 ratio compared to his. <br>
<br>
But then, familair sounds began filling my ears. A blessing from the gods even. The Nexus Scion began her teleportaion spell. In a blink of an eye, he was gone, forgetting he had left his teleportation sphere upon him. At the same time, the entire zone boar witness that &quot;Dr****** has run like a cowardly dog!&quot; And the masses rejoiced.<br>
<br>
He was cool enough to OOC and congratulate me and I was quick to acknowledge the Scion did me a favor lol. He told me he would like his revenge someday, and he has yet to come claim it. I know I owe him that match, and here's hoping I can finish my quest for Endless Quiver and AM3 before that happens. Oh yeah, if by chance that certain SK should read this, Cheguevara Castro still lives. He just goes by another name.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=599712" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Jadin Greenstarr</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Veteran Outrider of Tunare</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub107.ezboard.com/bedgeofvalor" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Edge of Valor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Officer of Alliances</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caemus>Caemus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/28/03 2:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3944.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Duels</span><hr size=1> /hijack on<br>

Have they ever fixed the problem with loosing experience if you die due to DoTs in a duel?  I've always felt badly about using that playing a druid and, hence, only did so when the counter party indicated they didn't mind.  Otherwise, it seems unfair to tie the hands of those classes that rely on DoTs for a significant part of their damage ability.<br>

With Poyson I never duel someone without letting them know that this can happen.  As a necro my primary spell defense is DoTs so hardly fair to me if I don't use all that I have.  <br>
<br>
I also try and let them know that there is a good chance that even if they do kill me that my dots will still get them, so if possible I like a healer near by.  If possible I liftap at the end to prevent the xp lose but sometimes it just happens.<br>
<br>
Course Poyson doesn't duel just to duel but usually has a good rp reason to do so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylfarin>Sylfarin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sylfarin/images/zlg-001_a.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/28/03 4:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3944.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Duels</span><hr size=1> Well my two cents worth and I have had only one duel, a necro who conned red to me and his pet who also conned red to me.

Because very very few people know how to win gracefully. Most people that duel aren't doing it because they enjoy duelling; they do it because they enjoy beating other people. In my experience anyway. <br>

That has been my experience.  It annoys me when someone has their character insult my character and then refuses to duel.  If Firiona Vie were perfect and you had insulted my character, he would attack you, with or without your permission.  Of course, if Firiona Vie were made a PVP server, Role-Playing would become a lot less common.  You can't win. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=3944.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=3944.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=3944.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=3944.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3944.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=3944.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3944.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3944.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
