<br>
The gnarly-looking little man hurriedly entered the small yellow wooden building in North Qeynos, and quickly locked the door behind him as is his habit. He is, after all, a Gnome, reknowned creatures of habit. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here Master Mal, let me take your cloak. Seems that Qeynos has seen a lot of rain lately&quot; Mortimer his assistant greeted him, removing the wet cloak off his shoulders and setting it upon the coat rack to dry. <br>
<br>
Using his feet, the diminutive man, known to his associates as Maladominus Poxbringer, quickly rolled away a strip of carpet on the floor.... quickly revealing a secret door-passage underneath the wooden floor of his Qeynos apartment. With spritely eagerness, he descended down into the dungeon-like room below, his assistant Mortimer in tow behind him. <br>
<br>
** in the laboratory ** <br>
<br>
He quickly set his hands and eyes upon his latest project.... a gigantic rat laying prone about a rounded stone table, wrapped in fine linen and annointed with various extracts of chemicals and other sundry medicine. The enormous sized rodent had been dead and mummified for nearly a week. Almost the size of a fully grown wood elf man, this giant rat was an immense specimen. Every day, the same routine would pass as Maladominus would inspect and attend to his mummified project. <br>
<br>
&quot;I still don't understand what you are doing with that huge rat, Master, it reeks of that Norbutanol stuff&quot; commented Mortimer, as he is often prone to do. <br>
<br>
Ignoring the question of his adjutant, the elder Gnome simply quipped &quot;Make yourself useful Mort, read me the Qeynos Herald..... obituaries section. You know the routine.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mortimer grabbed the weekly periodical, written in the language of the Humans rather than the geometrical alpha-numeral letterings of Gnome Speech. This, after all, is one of the reasons of his employ. Mortimer is a young but bright Gnome servant who renders his services as a translator fluent in all the various Tallard languages. <br>
<br>
[ Tallard = the tall people, Gnomish slang ] <br>
<br>
Mortimer quickly glanced at the long list of deaths.... murmured some, but he knew to look only for the noteworthy listings that his employer may be interested in. Meanwhile, Maladominus returned his gaze at his long dead subject, poked it some, and sprinkled more Norbutanol upon its sordid carcass. <br>
<br>
&quot;Leiutenant Tormath of the Qeynos Constabulary. Cause, food poisoning...&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladominus retorted quickly &quot;That's what they want you to think. Tormath was a turncoat and Commander Kane does not tolerate turncoats. Tormath was a very good soldier, tho, highly respected. Oh well, he's dead now. That's one less constable that the Blood Sabres and myself have to worry about. Next one.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm Master this is odd.... listing on the Herald for some Inky named Shintou Shinai.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladominus craned his neck halfway to glance at his assistant in an empty boggle. Why in Jools Junkers would a Dark Elf's death be news all the way in Qeynos? Why would anyone in this part of Antonica even care about a dead Dark Elf? <br>
<br>
&quot;Shintou Shinai, reknowned Teir'Dal Knight. Cause, mysterious.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladominus paused for a second and pondered. He poked the rat once more, and then gave his response on the matter &quot;Never met the man, even in all my visits to Neriak Third Gate. I've heard of his exploits, that much I can say. Reknowned, he is apparently so. He clearly has admirers among his fellow Inkies.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mortimer then took his opportunity to voice, as he is prone to do &quot;Your Inky allies, they are quite a hateful bunch aren't they? Always looking for a fight. It surprises me how they can live so long.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Love breeds love. Hate breeds more hate&quot; remarked the senior Gnome, &quot;It does not matter that they live or die. All they care is the continuation of their struggle, they have their own End Cause.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And what is their End Cause, Master? Methinks they thrive on death and destruction as their only goal....&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Hrrmmmph. I'm not sure if that's all there is to it. Their End Cause may be more complex than I know of. But no matter, they still are not as enlightened as the Minions. Maybe one day they will learn from us. For us, death and decay is only the path.... never an end in itself.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mortimer his helper took a deep breath, and dared to ask &quot;And what kind of end do we have waiting for us Master? You never tell me enough about the Plague Bringer's promises to His Minions.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladominus then cracked a small smile and quickly sputtered a hushed incantation from his lips.... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> retnox inkibus, plexxtor ratnipulus. mordre dak vitamus!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Then suddenly Mortimer gasped as his eyes caught sight of a spectacle, he pointed towards the project. The once faded and mummified corpse of the giant rodent gradually pulsed an eerie luster, almost a faded glowing incandescence of green.... <br>
<br>
&quot;Mmmm...Master... the rat, the tail.... it moves!&quot; <br>
<br>
Maladominus the Necromancer solidly pointed towards the awakened dead, as if to make a point to his assistant. <br>
<br>
&quot;That, Mortimer. THAT is all you need to see..... our scribes in the Dark Reflection have written that the Green Plague will take all mortals, it will consume all the living in Norrath! By definition, all mortals must die eventually. None may survive forever but....&quot; <br>
<br>
He pauses. <br>
<br>
&quot;A chosen few, only a few, will arise beyond the consumed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mortimer was quiet, still speechless. Maladominus looked to his assistant and smirked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you want to live forever, Mortimer?&quot;<br>
