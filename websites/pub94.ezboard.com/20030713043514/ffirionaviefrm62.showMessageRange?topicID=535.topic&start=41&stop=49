me too. but on that note, assuming that in this context the word 'extremist' can be interchanged with the word 'terrorist', i recently read a small article on the interchangability of the word 'terrorist' and the term 'freedom fighter'. If you think about it they both mean the same thing, just one puts the person in question in a less admirable light that the other. just a thought.<br>

Yes i do. the Sharia is a very good set of laws by which to govern a country, in my opinion the best. People only see it as a bad set of laws because the more 'famous' countries that have implemented it (eg Afghanistan under the Taliban) tend to add their own laws such as 'Women must cover themselves completely and are not allowed to have jobs'. Under Islam, women are not required to wear veils, just to cover their bodies when outdoors, thus preventing the 'oversexing' of a comunity and subsequesntly helping to uphold other moraly correct, muslim laws such as 'no sex before marriage'. Enough about that.<br>
<br>
I am a Pakistani Muslim, born in Lahore, currently living in England. I understand that i have said some things that are not appropriate and i appologise for any insult they may have caused.It makes me very upset when people side against my people when the other side is at just as much blame (eg. you may know this, you may not. In 1982 Ariel Sharon, at that time Israeli defense minister ordered the carpet bombing of Beirut and the refugee camps set up there. 1500 people were killed and 5 times more women and children were killed than in the Sept 11th Twin Tower attacks. Later in the same year Sharon sent murder squads into Palestinian refugee camps and sent tanks to surround them so that noone could escape. The murder squads machine gunned down as many as 2500 refugees and then Sharon sent in bulldozers to hide the atrocity. Red Cross / Red Crescent workers found hundreds of elderly and children with their throats cut and it was later found that countless women and young girls in the camps had been raped by the death squads before being killed. Also, earlier on June 8th 1967, Israeli fighters and torpedo boats to launch an hour and one-half attack on the American Navy ship, USS Liberty, costing 34 American lives and 171 wounded. They then claimed it was a case of mistaken identity, thinking that it was a Egyptian ship even through the stiff breeze on the day kept the Liberty's huge American flag in the air the hull was clearly marked with enormous identification figures. American generals at the time knew it was the Israelis, knew that it wasnt mistaken identity but still didnt do anything. The Liberty’s commanding officer, Captain William McGonagle, was awarded America’s highest honor, the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his splendid courage during the Israeli attack. But, he was given the award in a quiet ceremony in the US Navy Yard, rather than the White House (as is customary), so as not to hurt the image of the<br>
very enemy who killed 34 of his comrades and wounded him and 174 more Americans on the Liberty! And, the U.S. government ordered the crew to silence on the Israeli attack.)<br>

Israel claimed it was a 'mistake,' the UN conceded otherwise and President Clinton called it only a 'tragedy'--as if it was a natural disaster. It was, said bin Laden, an act of 'international terrorism.' There must be justice, he said, and trials for the Israeli perpetrators. Clinton used almost exactly the same words about bin Laden and his supporters in August. But the deaf, as usual, were talking to the deaf.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

This makes me angry.<br>

Call me a terrorist, i believe that what Osama Bin Laden, Hamas, etc stand for is right. Their methods are dodgy but they cant fight an orthadox war, they dont have the means to do so.<br>
<br>
Alot of the information in this came from an article i read recently. I would link it onto these boards but it is not on the internet, it is on my PC and i dont know how to link it. I would gladly e-mail it to anyone who wants to read it, i'm sure you'd find it informative and interesting (no its not a bunch of Al-Quaida propoganda, it was written by an american who dislikes Bin Laden).<br>
<br>
hmm.......one final point......i have no problems with the average american, Israeli, Jew, etc. I know and am friends with a number of them. My dislikes lie with those who comit the attrocities against my people and those who allow these attrocities to go unseen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/4/03 12:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Isreal/Palastine</span><hr size=1> The only way peace can be accomplished in the Middle East (and other areas) is to abolish religion in it's entirety. Of course, this is not going to happen. <br>
Christians have their own extremists that bomb abortion clinics. While most Christians don't practice that sort of extremism, it is supported by taking scriptures out of the Bible. Most Christians would say it is justified to kill someone that is going to kill an innocent person. This is what is used as a basis for killing someone that aborts fetuses, because life begins at conception, therefore, you are protecting a &quot;person&quot;.<br>
I was married to a muslim man before. I read for myself parts of the Quoran that state what a glorious day it will be when Christians and Jews are annihlated. I read how it is acceptable for a man to beat his wife if she doesn't listen to him. Just as killing abortion doctors isn't something Christians would do as a whole, there are Muslims that wouldn't go out and purposely kill Christians and Jews. <br>
Personally, I don't consider Muslim extremists to be any better or worse than Christians extremists, even though I divorced that piece of shit that happened to be Muslim.<br>
<br>
And Aryskus, you're right in the sense that the media here is very slanted and tainted with loads of propaganda. But you need to realize that all the crap you hear from the Muslim end of things is very slanted and tainted with loads of propaganda too. Take a step back and understand that the truth lies somewhere in the middle of the two.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rrebhet@firionavie>Rrebhet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/4/03 1:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Isreal/Palastine</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes i do. the Sharia is a very good set of laws by which to govern a country, in my opinion the best. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
