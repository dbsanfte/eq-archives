I was so distraught that I immediately hit the &quot;Back&quot; button, which brought me to Vicaire's complaint about having to look at big behinds while in groups. I began to recover my senses upon having read that she finds Rogue behinds to be rather pleasing, which to me makes perfect sense and therefore does not shock my conscience.  I felt brave enough to return to Traelle's post, hoping that I had read incorrectly or at least expecting an edit (oh yeah, this is the Soap Box, whoopse!), but nothing had changed!  When I finally realized that I wasn't hallucinating and that the words I was reading were real...<br>
<br>
I began to wonder - what makes an attractive man?  To get a diversity of viewpoints and to cater to my male need to avoid reading &quot;Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus&quot; at all costs, I came up with a brief survey.<br>
<br>
1.  What PHYSICALLY turns you on?  Do you like them tall, dark, and handsome?  Blonde, Rough, and Rugged?  Tight, rogue-like behinds?  Indulge yourselves!<br>
<br>
2.  If you could dress your fantasy man (and we all know some men cannot be left to their own devices when picking out clothes in the morning), what would he wear?  Jeans and a T?  3-Piece Suit?  Cop Uniform?  Yellowing wife-beater and matching holy &quot;easy access scratchin'&quot; boxers?  YOU make the call!<br>
<br>
3.  Briefs or Boxers?  Or something else?  Dont' let it be HIS decision!<br>
<br>
4.  What personality traits leave you begging for more?  Does opening the door for you and going out of his way to be your welcome mat allow him to burrow his way into your heart?  Or when they misplace your number in the condom drawer and make you feel like the sex object you know you can be?<br>
<br>
5.  If you could create your EQ equivalent to your fantasy man, what race / face / eye / hair color would you pick?<br>
<br>
6.  Any nominations for an EQ male calendar?<br>
<br>
That is all!  Thank you in advance for your participation!<br>

Here I go:<br>
<br>
1.  I like guys who are athletic.  Skinny guys, corpulent guys, and guys that are way too buff typically don't do it for me.  Preferably he'd be between 5'8 and 5'11, and have a mediumish build.  Dark hair and blue or green eyes is a killer combination for me, but even brown eyes can be nice on the right guy.  He should be clean cut, yet artistic, and the only hair on his body should be on his head.  Hopefully he won't be too pale (which reminds me I have to start tanning soon...)<br>
<br>
2.  My fantasy man would wear black leather pants, and a black tank-top.  When he takes off his tank top, which inevitably he will do because we will be clubbing, you will be able to see...<br>
<br>
3. The straps of his Thong modelled off a jock-strap.  This too will be black.  Of course his pants will be low-rising to enchance this effect.<br>
<br>
4.  I like guys who are complete a-s-s-h-o-l-e-s.  What can I say, nothing turns me on more than an arrogant prick who is hot and knows it.  BUT, he has to secretly have a very loving and endearing side that comes out at home, and has to want only me.  I want him to jump on me when I walk in the room, because I have such an effect on him.<br>
<br>
5.  I would say that my character would be a perfect EQ representation, but he as a Dark-elf is a little short.  Maybe a dark-elf that is a few inches taller, because I like my elf's face.  Tani in the Rogue GUild has the same head if you wonder which head it is.  But I don't really like his hair.  But no guys in EQ have hair that looks quite like what I'm attracted to.<br>
<br>
6.  I'd vote for Kuladen for a Male calendar, just because he wants to be in one so much!  After that, I'd vote for myself, because I'm such a pleasure to look at!  I should be on the cover. <br>
<br>
And there we go!  I'm amused (and very bored in Con Law class...)<br>

<br>
From what I can tell, female perceptions of male attractiveness vary more widely than male perceptions of female attractiveness.  There are so many times when one girl will think a guy is hot or whatever and another one won't while men are often much quicker to reach consensus.  I can tell in 2 seconds whether a girl will be thought of as attractive by most men.  Perhaps it is because we have been fed images so often from the media about what the perfect woman should look like.<br>

Male: Tall.... Dark.... Dark hair and eyes.... *swoons* Real. Meaning, if he's GQ, he isn't for me. I would want someone that is &quot;touchable&quot;. Mysterious. Yes, mysterious.

<br>
<br>
1.  Physically!<br>
<br>
If we're just talking eye-candy, I love 'em fem.  Tall, lanky, built the way cats are, with those gorgeous muscles that just sort of ripple under the skin.  I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>really</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't like body-builders; over-muscled turns me off.  <br>
<br>
Long hair is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>good</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thing, be it just long-ish that brushes past the ears, or so long it has to be pulled back into a pony tail.  Silky hair: a guy I know has hair somewhat like Fabio's, and I wish I knew him better so I could have the excuse to play with his hair.  *grin*<br>
<br>
Hands are wonderful things; I love men who have &quot;piano hands&quot; - long fingers, elegant movements, all that.  Tan or pale, somewhere in between, doesn't matter to me in that aspect.  And men's shoulders, and their backs, and backsides...  mmm...  Men's bodies are beautiful.<br>
<br>
Clean-shaven (well-kept goatee at most) and no excess of hair. Having a veritible pelt of hair on the chest is not a turn-on...<br>
<br>
If we're talking about in bed, however, I've recently discovered that my tastes change.  Thin-and-lanky men (in my experience) tend to be ethereal, chill, something more than mortal.  While I love looking at men like this, I feel more ditached from men like this.  So...  average weight, maybe 5'11&quot; or 6' tall...  likely my ideal physical guy.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  Clothing!<br>
<br>
&quot;Techie pants&quot; (I don't know what they're really called; we theatre techie folk wear them.  Cloth as opposed to denim, black, a couple of sewn-on pockets like on cargo pants) and a T-shirt.  Or topless.  Mmm, topless.<br>
<br>
<br>
3.  Boxers or briefs?<br>
<br>
BOXERS.  Half-n-halfs make me think of my dad, and thinking about him when a guy is partially dressed is NOT something I particularly want to entertain.  Briefs...  ehh...  I just don't like them for some reason.  So, it's cotton boxers all the way for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
4.  Personality<br>
<br>
- Confident enough that he's not constantly asking me why I'm with him, that I can give him a compliment without it being brushed off with a &quot;no, it sucks&quot; or &quot;no, I look awful&quot; or whatever have you.  Confident enough that he doesn't have to overplay things, say he's a god in bed, walk with a &quot;I rule all&quot; swagger, those sort of things.<br>
- Knows himself well enough that he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>understands</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that he can be wrong, that he has things he can learn, and that this isn't a bad thing.  He doesn't need to be the &quot;leader of the pack&quot; for me to love him; he doesn't have to be dominant.  (Yes, I've been reading a lot of human psychology recently...)<br>
- Sense of humor is a must.  Taking himself lightly...  my uncles take <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seriously; if they're not right, it's like the world's about to end.  I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> being around my relatives because they're all like that.<br>
- Being a complete &quot;gentleman&quot; with opening doors and being my doormat isn't needed, but hey, being wooed is something that seems to have gone out of fashion, and I miss it.<br>
- Letting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>me</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> woo <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>him</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and having him not freak out about it...  I like to spoil people.  *shrug*  It's a fun pasttime.<br>
- Trust is an ultimate.  I'm not going to freak out if he looks at another woman and says, &quot;Wow, she's beautiful.&quot;  Because yes, she probably is.  Telling him not to look is like taking him to the Grand Canyon and not letting him watch the sunset.  On the flip side, I'm a huggy person. If I hug a guy friend, it's because I like hugging him, not because I'm sleeping with him.  If he sees that, he shouldn't freak out because I'm being &quot;unfaithful.&quot;  If he hugs a beautiful woman, that's wonderful in my books.  Jealousy is a petty, destructive thing.<br>
- Not taking me for granted.  That's something that really gets me sometimes...  I love being there for people, and like I said, I love spoiling folk.  I love seeing people be happy.  But <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>expecting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me to always do that makes the act cheapened.<br>

Mmm...  for the eye-candy I mentioned earlier, the High Elves and the Dark Elves.  For a relationship, probably Humans.  Any hair/eye color combination, though for humans, preferably clean-shaven.  At most, a goatee.  Sideburns....  ack.  No muttonchops.  o.o;;;<br>

<br>
1)Physically../ponder lots of different things. I will give celebrity examples, when I can. I like rough looking men(James Hetfield, of Metallica is a prime example of feral sexiness), but sometimes I also like androgynous prettyboys(Daniel Johns, lead singer of Silverchair, a good example of that).  I'm a sucker for a good mouth. And I love interesting eyes.I also think chest hair is a good good thing. Not complete hirsute, but some hair is good.*nod*  There's more, but that'll do. I just like men.<br>
<br>
2)I like scruffy guys, I can't help it*grin* Jeans are great, khakis are good.  Baggy is good, but not the fall off your ass baggy, that irks me.  Casual, yes.  And almost always, I prefer untucked(shirts, sickos). <br>
<br>
3) I think boxerbriefs are the greatest piece of clothing ever designed for a man. Ever.<br>
<br>
4)Personality traits...hmmm. Eye candy is nice, but if there is nothing else there, then eye candy is all it will ever be. I have *got* to be able to converse with a man. And truly intelligent men turn me on to no end.  I like a man to have his own thoughts and beliefs, AND be strong in them.  A man must understand the love of music(even if it's different music than I love), he must be able to laugh. <br>
<br>
5)I have no idea here. I think the dark elf men in Dulak are sexy. I think a lot of the halfelf men are alright.*shrug* High elf men in platemail...not bad. And I like the goatees, and the long hair.<br>
<br>
6)As far as character/race combo....Morgrist Vanadil is one of the sexiest characters.  Dominion reeks of sexiness, so does the mean ol' mage.  And an odd choice, but still applicable...Serion Au'Bach, if he even plays anymore, roleplayed a pretty sexy character. <p><center><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/traelle4.jpg"><br><i>Still keeping things sane(or not) at <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner" target="_new">Sar's Corner.</a><br>Yes, you can touch my <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=588147" target="_new">clothes.</a></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=traelle>Traelle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cpmission.com/graphics/icons/icon22.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#993366>Prettier than Kuladen<br>Used to be Sar</font></span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/18/03 2:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ladies (among others attracted to men): What turns YOU o</span><hr size=1> PS.<br>

<br>
I find I don't have any real strong preferences, but I do have some tendencies here and there.  Red hair can be an intense turn-on, but more than 90% of the guys I've seen with red hair are, well...  mutants.  It's that other 10% that trip my trigger.  Middle-Eastern men, too, which has been a recent development.  But, honestly, I don't have any &quot;type&quot;.  Blonds, brunets, black-hair, blue eyes, brown eyes, green eyes...  I like athletic men, but I'm not exclusive about that, either.  A beautiful face can make up for a less-than-perfect body.  I don't like overmuscled--the Arnold Schwartzenegger/Mr. Universe look.<br>
<br>
I've also long called myself a &quot;geek queen&quot;.  For some reason, the geekier the guy, the more intense the attraction is for me.  I like guys who know stuff, especially techie stuff.  This is actually, for me, the dominant attractor over physical looks.<br>
<br>
Boxerbriefs are a godsend for those of us who have a wookie somewhere in our family tree and live in humid climates.  I no longer live in a humid climate, but...  still very comfortable.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ men?  It's fairly well-known I've got a soft spot for Fier'Dal rangers.  A wood elf in glittering chainmail...  Mmmm.  Yeah, okay, so I like &quot;twinks&quot;, too.  Sue me.  Half-elves aren't bad, either.<br>
<br>
My vote for the calendar?  Well, if I don't vote for Lanowar, I think I'd be in deep trouble, so...  there you go. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/LASLAN.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->andersonrob@earthlink.net<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/index.html<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->EverQuest: Lasgalen Lothir, Firiona Vie server</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=irexes>Irexes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Live evil</span><br>  Posts: 756<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/18/03 2:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ladies (among others attracted to men): What turns YOU o</span><hr size=1> No-one seems to find male lizards in dresses attractive.<br>

I prefer tall, over 6ft is nice, but have dated men shorter than me who I thought were adorable.  Dark hair is my prefered, but sandy blode, light brown, can be incredibly sexy.  Long hair is -much- preferred, shoulder length or more, but I have also dated men with short hair and even one shaved bald that I thought was incredibly sexy.  As for phsyque... well... I prefer someone not really buff-dus but not really obesely fat (ironic because I am not anything close to skinny), though I will admit to being enthralled by a nice curve of the back into a shapely butt, almost a femine curve but on a male body is really really really appealing to me.  But, I agree with Sera, it is more in how someone carries himself that is appealing than the rest.  Keanu Reaves is pretty, but tack him up on a wall somewhere, I want a real man to put his boots under my bed... someone like Antonio Banderas would get that nod *impish grin*.<br>
<br>
2. Hmmm... black pants, black silk shirt or dark grey silk or jsut silk in general.  Relaxed but nice.  If the pants are black leather.. well.. umm... rar!  <br>
<br>
3. As for undies... I like silk boxers with nothing else, bikini-style for the rest.<br>
<br>
4. Sweet and wonderful is preferred, opening doors can be nice, but don't over do it.  If you have your hands full, let me open the door, I'm not an invalid.  Also letting me be somewhat independant and not wholey pampered while treating me as someone special is good.  Expecting me to make all decisions about where to go and what to do is very bad.  Expecting me to read your mind and figure out what you want to do while you force me to decide where to goand what to do with absolutely no imput is positively horrid.<br>
<br>
5. Umm... the barbarian male with dark hair and a beard braided.  I think that one is rather fetching.  The elven men (all 3 types) with long dark hair are also rather nice.  The halfling male with dark hair and green eyes is rather cute and cuddly.  Oh... and any bard *impish grin*<br>
<br>
6. Larraque, Kuladen, Uinin, Syllestrae.. oh... ummm she's female but a bard, Bippin, any of the bards, ummm... Fayd, Dalion, Dominion, Apep, any of the barbarian men... no shirt *impish grin*, oh and how about a couple bards at least *smirk* <p><center>
