How do you feel about joining forces with<br>
other evilly-aligned softskins (followers of<br>
Bertoxxulous, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek <br>
Ogres/Trolls, and your very own Cazic-Thule)?<br>
<br>
Would you ever group with a good/neutral<br>
now that the alignment restrictions are gone?<br>
<br>
Do you wish all softskins would die?<br>

<br>
Iksar are not evil-aligned. They are Iksar-aligned. They don't really care if you live or die so much, as long as you keep out of Kunark and keep your softskin politics to yourselves. They've even been known to tolerate softskin presence, as long as you acknowledge your appropriate position of servitude to them, Thule's chosen. (Cazic-Thule cons warmly to all Iksar; KOS to everyone else, even if you worship him.)<br>
<br>
If an Iksar were forced for whatever reason (use your imagination) to group with a non-Iksar, then I think he'd be more likely to work with a Vah Shir (they're pretty neutral and mind their own business; they like that), or even something like a high elf, in preference to having to deal with dark elves, whose entire society is based upon backstabbing and petty politics (pretty much an antithesis to the totalitarian rule of Cabilis). Ogres and Trolls (even if they worship CT) are pretty much considered smelly brutes. Erudites who worship Cazic-Thule would probably be the least distasteful, but then you still have all the, &quot;If you truly fear your god you will recognize me as your rightful superior,&quot; stuff.<br>
<br>
Iksar don't hate softskins. Hate is a tool of Innoruuk. They just want them all to go away, be that through death or being frightened off or forced into servitude or whatever.<br>
<br>
That's the basic view of the Skathris Ven'Sho, anyway. We like being on good OOC terms with others, regardless of alignment, but IC alliances are pretty much out of the question. Of course, Your Iksar Mileage May Vary.<br>

As Voskor said, Iksar are not &quot;evil&quot;. They are &quot;Iksar.&quot; These are Zildrax's views, although I also envision Iksar in general sharing many of these sentiments, individuals may vary.<br>
<br>
He loathes Innoruuk followers, finding their general deciet disgusting, their way of life and goals abhorable, and the god they worship pathetic. He also considers their indulgence of hatred a sign of spiritual weakness.<br>
<br>
Rallos Zek followers he has a little respect for, but he thinks a war for no other cause then to wage a war is an idiotic concept, and feels that is what followers of Rallos Zek desire. But at least they share a couple of his views. Ogres and Trolls would make good slaves because their physically strong, but their too stupid to be good for much else.<br>
<br>
Bertoxxlous followers he has met very few but he finds there general view of &quot;We're all going to die anyway so why not worship death?&quot; to be sort of ridiculous.<br>
<br>
And soft skin followers of Cazic-Thule he views as blasphemers who disgrace the name of his god. If they were true followers of Cazic-Thule, they would bow to the true children of Thule, the Iksar, as their masters and the fact they do not proves they are not true followers of Thule.  Not to mention the methods of worship soft skins use, and their general selfish tendencies, all further lend to their worship of Thule being a mockery.<br>
<br>
Alignment has little to do with who my character would decide to group with. &quot;Goods&quot; and &quot;Neutrals&quot; have always had a higher chance of impressing Zildrax, just because he'd prefer to be around those who are naive and honorble then those who are intelligent and treacherous if forced to choose. The Vah Shir are his most liked non Iksar race, because they do not worship a false god, do not use any forbidden magics (Enchantry, Wizardry,Magery) are very honorble from what he has seen, and are the only race non hostile to Iksar. And their the only race not invading Kunark.<br>
<br>
Overall though yes he wishes all soft skins would die. He thinks that would make Norrath a far better world. Hatred is not somthing Iksar feel often, but they do wish their enemies would go away. <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/bseh42/images/zilsig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 6/18/02 1:04:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=grumgor>Grumgor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/18/02 9:13:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2160.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: For Zildrax and other Sebilisans</span><hr size=1> Da elves invadin' at Firona Vee, an da dark elves invadin' at da over der.

We did not invite any of you creatures to Kunark, we did not invite you to explore it and to rob our crypts, and we do not want you there.

<br>
But to answer the question, it depends entirely on the circumstances. If I died due to an LD or some other stupid OOC reason, I'll happily accept a rez from anyone who offers, but I'll consider it basically an OOC favor. So RP considerations don't really apply there for me.<br>
<br>
Assuming we're roleplaying, however. I would never ASK you for a rez ICly. If you offered politely, I would probably accept because hey, if you want to waste your magical energy and your god is foolish enough to ressurect an enemy in his/her name, well, that's your problem, not mine. I might thank you curtly (I try to treat everyone with a certain level of respect, even if you are my enemy - codes of honor are a convenient excuse not to be a complete dick), but I will probably not consider myself ICly indebted to you in any way. If you offered it in the context of, &quot;Oh look, a dead lizard, admit that Innoruuk is the one true god and I'll give you a ressurection in his name,&quot; then no, I wouldn't take it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 474<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/19/02 1:29:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2160.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric question for Iksar</span><hr size=1> I pretty much agree entirely with Voskor in every way.

I don't summon stuff for in-character enemies, except for a pet to bloody their kneecaps. But, I do summon stuff OOC for other players when non-Norrathian reasons intrude.<br>

In other words, if you need stuff for a corpse run because the lag beast ate you or this month's featured patch bug poofed all your food and water, just ask. If you need stuff for a corpse run because Watchman Prynn skewered you for being naughty to gnomes, don't bother. I suspect most clerics and necros (and everyone else) have similar guidelines.<br>
