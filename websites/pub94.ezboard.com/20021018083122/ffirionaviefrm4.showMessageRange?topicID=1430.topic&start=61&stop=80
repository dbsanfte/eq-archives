Thank you for pointing that out.<br>
<br>
I swear, people think us cattle-ranchers and dairy-cow handlers are all a bunch of inbred cruel unfeeling bastards.  <br>
<br>
I'll tell you, there were nights in the winter when we brought our calves IN THE HOUSE because it was too cold for them.  We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars building heated sheds to keep those animals all toasty warm when it's -70 degrees outside with the windchill.  <br>
<br>
When I was growing up on the ranch (yes, we had a large herd of about 5000 cattle) we treated those animals with the utmost care.  And cows are not sentient, unless you count &quot;hey guys, lets go jump in the river since we can't swim&quot; a sentient thought.  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I love my animals.  I loved my cows when I had them.  I gave them cute names like Cutlet and T-bone, cuz I didn't want to get too attached, but hell who can't get attached to a lovable animal that would slobber all over you when they got excited?  Really, I loved them.<br>
<br>
But growing up on a ranch, I knew those animals were for one thing.  Food, and producing more food.  That's the way it is.<br>
You come to know that no matter how much you loved them, that animal was gonna die in one way or another.  Leave 'em in the wild, they die.  Raise 'em on a ranch, they die.  It's incredibly inhumane to not milk a Jersey.  That bag full of milk F'ing HURTS.  Suffering?  You bet your arse they are.  Roll up your sleeves and milk that cow, dammit!<br>
<br>
These animals have been bred for one purpose, sad but true.  They are INCAPABLE of caring for themselves because of that.  So we care for them, and in the end, we kill them quickly and quietly.  <br>
<br>
I've seen the video-clips of slaughterhouse practices gone wrong.  I know what you've all seen when you refer to &quot;the sanctioned murder of innocent animals&quot;.  Here's a news flash though.  What you've seen is a RARE OCCURANCE.  It's propaganda, hyped and exploded to increase the shock value.  Check things out yourself if you don't believe me.  <br>
<br>
Truly, I could care less what you eat, and I'm probably going to turn a deaf ear when you tell me what to eat.  I enjoy my steak and my cauliflower.  I like my roast with potatoes and carrots.  I'll eat a green salad with my burger, thank you.<br>
<br>
As is the case with all walks of life, you have your extremists and your &quot;Hey man, I just wanna do my thing&quot; type of people.  Food, well why should it be different?  <br>
<br>
Vegans, kudos to you for your well-thought out and informed life choice.  Bite into that head of lettuce and feel great doing it.<br>
<br>
Omnivores, you munch away on that chunk o'meat and snarf down those veggies.  Enjoy yourselves.<br>
<br>

<br>
Humans are NOT the top of the food chain.  In our “natural” environment, the great cats and larger canids are a bit higher up on the pyramid than we are.  It so happens that we have been largely able to take ourselves out of that particular Darwinian contest, but don’t mistake that achievement as a justification to label yourself a carnivore – you’re not.<br>
<br>
And of course, the whole “food chain” image is just a convenience anyway.  Being at the top or bottom of it is not something to be sought or avoided – it simply occurs.<br>
<br>
Next, the taste thing: humans taste bad to sharks because we are not the sharks’ natural prey, not because of some evolved “bad taste”.  We certainly taste just fine to lions, and have for millions of years.  We also taste pretty good to a wide range of other animals, from mosquitoes to vultures to wolves to – so it is said – other humans.<br>

Natural environment is that we are intelligent and possess tools to defend us from the big cats. The big cats don't have that, so we win. Now, when a mountain lion happens upon an unprepared camp site... yeah, the lion prolly wins. But humans are smarter than the lion, and so they don't allow that to happen often.<br>

<br>
   You can usually identify taste preference by animals that are willing to spend more energy capturing and eating something than they get out of the meal.  I watched a whole pod of killer whales on Discovery channel chase a blue whale and her calf for several hours until the baby wore out, then they drowned it, just so they could eat it's jaw.   That's a hella lot of energy spent for a whale jaw, so it's pretty safe to assume that it's the killer whale equivalent of Pocky.<br>
<br>
   Wolves don't generally attack humans (there've been 0 recorded deaths to non-rabid / non-captive wolves in North America in the last 2 decades or so), so I don't think we're terribly delicious to them.  They scavenge dead humans because a free meal is a free meal, even if it tastes bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Normal, healthy animals do not hunt and eat humans.<br>
<br>
Almost all cases of maneaters are animals that became habitualized to it, it is not a normal behavior.<br>
<br>
Saying I am the top of the food chain is not making a case for being a carnivore you dolt. I am an omnivore. I can and will eat almost anything, that puts me at the top of the food chain. It is not saying I am at the top of the food chain that allows me to eat almost anything. The cart before the horse reversal of my argument is absurd.<br>
<br>
There are very few true omnivores on this planet. Humans bears and pigs are the only ones that leap to mind. Bears are hunters, pigs scavengers, and humans somewhere in between.<br>
<br>
But the same is true for carnivores and herbivores, there are few who subsist on diets entirely of one or the other. Herbivores injest insects as they graze. These insects are animals, they get digested all the same. Likewise most carnivores manage to ingest vegetable manner. For a carnivore, not much of this is digested, but some is.<br>
<br>
Most animals are omnivores to some extent. Very few are designed as omnivores.<br>
<br>
Ok, I share the top of the food chain with bears and pigs, that doesn't make me at all uncomfortable.<br>

<br>
I’ll accept Wikkin’s objection that our current environment is not “unnatural” – I actually agree with that assessment, which is why I put “natural” in quotes.  Let me clarify my stance by changing “natural environment” to “environment in which we evolved” to differentiate it from the one we find ourselves in now.<br>
<br>
Except in very isolated areas, only sick or ailing top predators (wolves, great cats, etc.) attack humans today.  However, that was not always true, nor was it true as recently as a century ago.  <br>
<br>
Though the attacks by the two lions illustrated by “Ghost in the Darkness” were astoundingly atypical, villagers and workers in some areas of Africa would regularly build stockades to protect themselves from night-time lion attacks.  <br>
<br>
Tigers still regularly attack, kill and eat the fishermen who venture in to the Sunderbans… no matter how fervently those folks believe they are at the top of their personal food chains.  The trick of wearing a mask on the back of one’s head is apparently no longer working as well as it used to.<br>
<br>
Most large carnivores (the ones that have historically hunted humans for food) have “learned” hunting behaviors.  That is, their hunting styles and prey is not hard-wired into their behavior, but learned though experience or taught by their pride/pack/pod/whatever.  Almost all of the large predators are flexible enough to prey on whatever applicable creature is most abundant, easiest to bring down, or easiest to stalk.<br>
<br>
Because of that, saying that man-eating behavior is “habituated” and thus unnatural is a bit of a cop-out.  Lions in the Serengeti are “habituated” into bringing down zebra or wildebeest in the same manner that the Sunderbans tigers are “habituated” into attacking humans.<br>
<br>
Finally, traditional depictions of “the” food chain (which is a conceit) have “pure” carnivores at the top, occupying a place in which no other creature actively preys on them for food.  I will grant that an omnivore or even a herbivore can occupy this top spot in a given food chain (elephants are very rarely preyed upon), but up until a few hundred years ago, humans did not enjoy this position.<br>

Most animals have learned to avoid humans, because it usually leads to bad things happening to them (dodo, passenger pigeon) If a species doesn't react well to changes in it's enviroment, They will perish. <br>
Tigers will and do regularly prey on humans, because individually, we aren't very strong, which is why we probably developed social skills in the first place. What places us at the top of the food chain is our ability to reason and plan, and predict the results of our actions.<br>
Pretty amazing when you think of it, that we have evolved so much that our enviroment no longer plays a role in our species development, because we force our enviroment to change to suit us. <br>
Being omnivorous gives us more food choices, we are not a niche species. We are the Bard of this planet. If Vegans feel the need to restrict their diet to only part of the available food scource, that's a choice they were designed by nature to make. I don't personally agree with it, but I'll defend, to the death, their right to make a choice.<br>

Vegans are extremests. The choice they made has to be justified, so they go about claiming patently untrue tripe in the hopes of proving they are right.<br>
<br>
Eat all the vegetables and fruit you want and dont eat meat, I dont care. But dont tell me that I cant eat meat cause it is BAD. We are Omnivores, that is a fact, it isnt some arguement made up to justify anything. It is what we are.<br>
<br>
We have the power and the ability to control other life forms, that is a fact. We have a responsibility to handle our power with reason, but we dont need to be afraid to use power.<br>
<br>
Do Cows and pigs suffer when they are killed for food? I dont care. As long as they arent being tortured before the process is done, it doesnt matter to me. And even if someone tortures animals, it isnt going to stop me from eating meat. Efforts are made to end the life of our meat source in a quick and as painless method as is profitable and reasonable.<br>
<br>
The moronic claim of the extemest about dairy cows is a good one. A dairy cow will DIE horribly and painfully if someone DOESNT milk it. But milk is bad? It is a little late to try and save a milk cow from its fate, it was breed to do exactly what it does, provide milk.<br>

And milk must be good anyway, since it is made form vegetable matter anyway, right? So all diary products made from milk are vegetarian arent they?

It has been that way since the beginning of time my man. &quot;<br>
<br>
Reread that.  It's patently absurd.  Cows existed before they were domesticated.  To this day cows go feral and survive.<br>
<br>
Regarding the argument that humans are at the top of the food chain.<br>
<br>
The food chain is a logical construct that can be stuctured in any way one likes.  Bacteria, which eat human flesh, could be placed at the top.  Plants could be placed at the top instead of the bottom.  We just like to say we are at the top because we think the top superior and we made the damn chart.<br>
<br>
Regarding the argument that humans are omnivoires, always have been and that's just the way it is.  <br>
<br>
I'm assuming you live in a tree since homids are tree-dwellers, always have been and that's just the way it is.  How do you get internet access up there?<br>
<br>
Now, as to vegetarians as less cruel.<br>
<br>
Realise that vegetarianism is made possible largely by mass-agriculture.  It is also aided by chemical supplements.  In the developing world people usually survive on a diet consisting largely of vegetables withe meat substitutes.  Pure vegetarianism, and certainly vegainism is a product of western style agriculture.  Western style agriculture burns over nine caloeis of energy to produce one calorie of food.  This is only possible through the burning of fossil fuels in the agriculture process.  Which is less cruel?  Eating some animals or poisoning the entire biosphere?  What's better in the big picture?<br>
<br>
For myself, I'm still trying to figure out how to stem the horrible outbreak of humanity this planet is dying from. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 546<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/24/02 3:35:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok, I have to weigh in on the food chain</span><hr size=1> I'm pretty sure that it's been said before, but I don't really want to read through this entire thread. Why can't you just eat what you want to, and let other people do the same (provided that they aren't eating humans)? If they try to tell you that you that your eating ways are sinful and disgusting or whatnot, just roll your eyes in their general direction. But that goes both ways, too -- if veggies are their food of choice, so be it. It's no big deal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umithlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/24/02 7:53:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ok, I have to weigh in on the food chain</span><hr size=1> I have no problem with what people choose to eat.  I generally won't tease people about it either.  (Well, aside from ferverant vegans that are oppertunists and will eat meat if they need to, and playing the song quoted earlier in this thread to them in jest once)<br>
<br>
I am not a dietician.  I do not know what humans can and can't survive on.  I do know we are omnivores.  I also know we are animals.<br>
<br>
Now, I won't anthropromorphasize.  That is, I won't project human emotion onto animals.  But that doesn't mean I don't think they reason or feel.  And I can understand people trying to explain it in term of human emotions.  But I have watched animals long enough to notice they are each individuals.  But that doesn't really change anything.<br>
<br>
Suffering.  Yeah, they may suffer.  But for the most part humans are relatively nice in that regard.  Did you know a cheetah does not have very large teeth like other cats, and has to resort to biting it's preys throat and suffocating it to death?  Did you know an animal with a broken leg will be abandoned by it's mother despite plantive crys for help?  Did you know that many predators will start eating before their prey is completely dead?<br>
<br>
Cannibalism.  It makes sense.  What has all the nutrients you need?  Something like you does.  But while that may be, it has high risk.  Much more likely any disease could be passed on.  That is why it is not a bad idea.  Well, that and any number of social and otherwise non nutritional reasons.<br>
<br>
PETA, good idea taken too far.  I would even go so far as to classify them as nuts.  Any orginization that deals with animals has to worry about PETA.  This includes the zoos that have the best kept animals and veterinarian clinics.<br>
<br>
So I say eat meat, eat vegetables.  I've started cutting back on meat myself partly in respect of a partially vegetarian roommate, partly for dietary concerns.  Oh and the reason she is partly vegetarian is because her body needed nutrients from meat.  Not everyone is built the same.  Some can do vegetarian and be fine, some can do carnivore and be fine.  (Literally carnivore)  Some can use the Atkins diet (Being malnourished is a surefire way to lose weight) some would make themselves sick on it.  I will try to be respectful and not shove my meat eating in other peoples faces.  Hey, I enjoy a good salad as much as the next guy.  But I still enjoy going out for a good rare steak some times.  There is actually a Simpsons episode about vegetarians and living together where Lisa goes on a vegetarian rampage.  She then talks to Apoo and finds out he's vegan, won't even eat cheese, but he explains he doesn't hate her for it.  It's about acceptance.<br>
<br>
And regarding pets and vegetarians.  For some pets it works, for others it doesn't.  Often it is very difficult.  Dogs you can work a vegetarian diet but it is extremely difficult and it won't be the healthiest dog in the world.  Cats are actually obligate carnivores - they must have meat, end of story.<br>
<br>
And finally I leave you with one final thought.  Vegetarians eat vegetables.  What do humanitarians eat? <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
Cattle are not oxen.  They may have been at one time, but centuries of breeding have turned them into quite another animal.  An animal dependant upon humans to keep it from dying off.  <br>
<br>
Trust me, if we let our entire herd of angus go free, they'd have died in short order.  They were completely dependant on us to feed them hay and keep them watered.  (That was winter.)  In the summer, they could and did graze on the range, but even then, if there was a drought they couldn't find the food they needed to survive.  We had to feed them.<br>
<br>
Feral cows, my ass.  <br>
<br>
Now, oxen, yaks, etc...they may go feral.  But they haven't been bred down to the extent of cows.  Totally different.<br>
