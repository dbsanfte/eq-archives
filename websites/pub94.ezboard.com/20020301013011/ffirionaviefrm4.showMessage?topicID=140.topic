I have been watching and seeing some of the evil roleplaying guilds that well just do not roleplay.  The people out there that do this know who they are they were informed by other people about it.  Alas the other night I found some of my own guild camping a spawn with a neutral and when I asked about it they had a rp reason to do it.  Maybe call it favoritism to my own guild but I do not mind grouping with an neutral, although Zsuzsana is too arrogant to do so, but they shall never join the Roses.  I post about 1/100, or less, of what I hear and have confirmed just because it's not my place but I feel that it was a concern of a lot of people that I have spoken with.  If I did post everything I heard oh geez this flame room would constantly have me in it.<br>
<br>
My leaving quote (from myself even  guess I am arrogant)-<br>
I do not presume to judge how a person roleplays because when I do such I enforce my own opinion upon them and at that moment they stop roleplaying and start playing according to my mechanics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=morgrist>Morgrist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/01 7:16:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=140.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Roleplay vs. social behavior.</span><hr size=1> I can understand this as well,playing as I do in an evil and RP guild.<br>

One player found a bug that allowed him to group in the same group as a good PC was,and the result was my massive displeasure at the thought of a Teir'dal willingly fighting alongside a dirt-grubbing worshipper of Brell.<br>
 <br>
The guild dealt with it rapidly,but I understand the player wanted exp over roleplaying. Evil isn't always the most social bunch in Norrath(duh!) so some people are simply try anything they can to advance rather than do it the &quot;hard way&quot;-ie by acting in an RP manner. I wonder why these people play here,but I know some folk did come here for reasons other than RPing a character.<br>
 <br>
As I've already lost at least one friend on this server from RP frustration,I don't want to see another drop by the wayside.<br>
 <br>
(Which means if you're around the low 20's and you see me on-find a way to get to near Freeport and you WILL find someone wicked enough to terrorize places with you,naturally. :P)<br>
 <br>
As to reasons to ally with a neutral when you're evil? Some people simply aren't picky-others simply want a particular class in their group so badly that it doesn't matter.<br>

I have no issue having a little ooc talk with guildies, but that is done in tells, and on rare occasions /g.  Any time we /say anyting, its incharacter.  If some one asks me for &quot;plat plz&quot; or says &quot;wts lammy,50plat&quot; I role play with them.  Most people who came to this server, came to roleplay, and got distracted by the game. often times all it takes to get them back into the mood , is to start them up by role playing your self!  If all else fails , don't group with them, don't interact with them, they'll figure it out and either role play with you, or leave you alone.<br>
<br>
Sorry that's alittle long, but that's how I feel.  Stay with us, roleplay with others on the server, many times you'll be suprised at how they react!  If you're looking for a group to role play with, and see a member of the Indigo Void in the zone, send us a tell.<br>

I am not blind to think that you can stay in character all the time.  As a guild leader there is no way I can stay completely in character as I have about 10-20 people talking to me at once while I am getting ready to head out to group when I find someone needs some jewelry and I have to go back.  It is very hard to stay in character what bothers me is when people go ooc for no good reason.  I am currently in the middle of the Illusion: Iksar quest and was told to bring a ranger with me or a druid.  As my character does not really accept those I felt that even though it might take me having to stay in Swamp of No Hope for a good 2-5 days trying to get a ton warrior totem.

I actually got a tell from a friend guild telling me that my guild was guilding with a neutral from of all places a 1FoL.  They asked if we allowed grouping with pales.  I said I left it up to the people in the guild to roleplay it and when I asked the people they talked about having a rp reason which is where the quote came from.  It is easy to slip into ooc for a second to get an added bonus.  When I sell my jewelry I am open to anyone but if my character does not like you or you are a goodie I usually charge 2-5x the normal price.  I guess I try to imitate the faction/cha that normal vendors use. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/3/01 10:27:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=140.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roleplay vs. social behavior.</span><hr size=1> Hmm..<br>
Roleplay by alignment is kinda hard to do In general if I'm going to get into a pick up group I check that all the questionable races can be hit with spells, and I don't group with racial enemies. That still leaves allot of ground to be covered. Roleplay is preferred, here and I prefer to do it ,but if I'm oom or going divine and the place is tense . I'd get you killed before I got the information out. I'll use the standard shortened version.<br>
<br>
The way I see it is I'm not the roleplay &quot;police&quot; I'm just on this server because I like to roleplay. If someone wants to be a d0Od then they can be I won't get worked up about it, I'll ignore them and they usually leave. Sometimes game information over writes my want to roleplay. But we are on this server to have fun. Lets do that if you want to be the police and see X person doesn't roleplay. Blah, Blah, Blah they just got the mention and acknowledgement they wanted.<br>

Shintou is an extremeist in every since of the word. Black and White, no room for Grey. Either you are with us, or you are not. Neutrality is for weak pahtetic cowards that have no will or desire to fight, one of the sources of weakness.

<br>
   Someone else might be playing an unkempt druid, who hates mankind and civilization and wants a return to the natural order where only animals exist.<br>
<br>
   The druid might think himself neutral, others might see the druid as evil.  <br>
<br>
   A paladin might consider himself noble and just, and clearly a good person.  Other people might see him as arrogant and snobbish, and clearly wrapped up in his own self image, and serving the forces of evil more than he served those of good.<br>
<br>
   And while you'd be hard pressed to find a good character who pretends to be evil by murdering, killing, etc, is it hard to imagine an evil character who pretends to be good, only to further advance their goals?<br>
   Perhaps a dark elf rogue, who convinces a group of dwarves that he's a reformed man, and clearly does not associate himself with his evil brethren... all done in an effort to relieve the dwarves of some of their gems, and do a bit of spying for the dark empire to boot.<br>
<br>
   Would a paladin of Quellious be roleplaying better if he wrote all followers of Rallos Zek off as fiendish devils who needed to be destroyed, or offered to journey with them in an attempt to show them the happiness that a life of peace can bring a person?<br>
<br>
   My bard (neutral evil, rather selfish) will group with most anyone she doesn't find terribly displeasing.  She enjoys getting a rise out of the paladins, and thinks she's accomplished something when she can get them to behave in a hostile aggressive manner, and is always more than happy to respond to every glare and sharp word with a laugh and a smile, all with the perverse pleasure it brings her in ticking them off.<br>
   She arms her companions as much as she can.  To some people, this would be an act of selflessness.  To her, she knows that if a person has a nice sword, he's more likely to swing it.  If a person has some nice armor, they're more likely to wade into combat.  So if her friends can't equip themselves, she does her part to gear them up, all to help ensure the will and the might of Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
   Her companions (all good and neutral) have heard whispered rumors that she (my bard) has been setting a bounty on the blood of the wood elves of Erollisi Marr, and the flesh of noble paladins who try to hold back the trollish hordes.  She (my bard) is quick to lay the blame on a dark elf who's been playing imposter in an effort to ruin her image (the guise of deception helps a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>

<br>
Syllestrae is neutral evil.<br>
Starspun (her guild) is entirely neutral / good (except for her).<br>
<br>
To Starspun, she probably seems a bit overly-enthusiatic in the combat department, but has a good heart.  She's always willing to jump in to defend her guildmates, and goes out of her way to help protect them from the evils of the world whether by wading in and cutting off something's head, or providing them with the items they need to defend themselves.  To some in the guild (especially the Quellious worshippers), she's very distrusted.  They consider her a bad influence, but their teachings instruct them to give people the benefit of the doubt.  They won't waste their spells on her, but aren't opposed to journeying with her in the hopes their good behavior will rub off on her.<br>
<br>
To Syllestrae, Starspun is a guild of talented adventurers, who's skill on the battlefield would be lost if she wasn't there egging them on to cleave stuff in two.  They'd be content fishing and having picnics if someone wasn't whispering dark nothings to them.  She's had good times.  One of her favorite evenings was the night she worked Taygar, the noble scout of Tunare, into such a kobold blood frenzy that he started screaming to all who could hear him that he hated TREES.  Why would this elf hate trees?  Because the kobolds were so scared as we tore them limb from limb and showered the stonebrunt with their entrails that they kept fleeing up the trees and making it more difficult for us to hack them to pieces.<br>
<br>
What evil would it do for Syllestrae to join a band of Ogres?  They're ALREADY bloodthirsty.  She could help them wreck a few halfling houses, but really, they can do that on their own.<br>
<br>

<br>
Simplestic White and Black? Yes, why not. I acually think its sort of an Uniqueness to it in a way, if you stick with it. Why?<br>
<br>
I don't know, but I hardly ever meet anyone like Shintou, most of the time they have that Druid, hiding behind the trees or in the closet or somewhere..<br>
<br>
Shintou's purpose is simple, Fight to become strong, become strong to fight. Somehow, he has to bring forth some war of Chaos, but for the most part, strenghten his hate through battle and killing the lightbringers.<br>
<br>
If he was a Ninja, it would be different. But he;s not. He's a Shadow Knight.<br>
Knights/Samurai are usually devoted to their tasks, to their callings in life.<br>
That Paladin, devoted to bringing light and destroying darkness. Spreading Valor and so forth.<br>
And that Shadow Knight. Devoted to killing, death, suffering, and the bringing of darkness.<br>
<br>
No matter how inviting the light may seem. No matter how honorable or great of a fighter your foe is. No matter how tired and weak you feel inside. No matter how cute the Ranger is. /wink Sareha /jk<br>
A Knight keeps his way, his path set in stone, espically Shintou.<br>
For he is a Darkelf. His Choice is only the choice of the Father Innoruuk, given to him by the unbearable hate he feels in his heart. That feeling that drives his sword.<br>
<br>
Love is for the weak, why? Someone like Shintou can never understand love.<br>
<br>
He doesn't need to turn to the darkside..<br>
Because he IS the darkside.<br>
<br>
...I like that one.<br>

&lt;chuckle&gt; A question I am commonly asked as well, and the same answer -- it is up to the individual <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Unless you are in a Good[evil][neutral] only guild, then grouping with (at least) a Neutral should not be a problem.  In fact, there are times in much fantasy literature where Good/Evil grouped together, to achieve a common short-term objective.  Mind you, the personal goals of both sides are different, but the short-term goal must be accomplished.  With that being the case, I can even see it happening in Norrath (again, for specific cases).  Such a grouping could provide much good RP oppurtunities, in the short term (specific mission) and the long, as the Good and Evil meet again and again, trying to exploit/convert the other, kill the other, etc. <br>
<br>
My guild is based on the foundations of Tunare AND Justice --- and as such accepts any non-evil alignment, so long as they follow the tenets of one or the other (preferrably both <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt; I know different people have different ideas on what is good/bad RP, but I would be interested in hearing your opinions (flames, whatever &lt;wink&gt;)<br>
