You don't see things in absolutes? Hmm.<br>
Am I trying to fix certain things in my life? Of course I am...but I happen to enjoy my one smoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Obviously your views are totally biased. There are people who have quit, if you don't realize that, well....back to the cave, I guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Read it all together, not dissected. Your bias is seeing people die...and not seeing people quit. You see smoking = not able to quit = death. That simply isn't the case. It's not an absolute truth. Don't get all sensitive. Obviously you do know people can quit. Therfore your not a caveman....are you?<br>
But....<br>
Sure, I have a smoke once a week...for the same reason you prolly have that occassional donut or hamburger.<br>
<br>
Yes yes yes, I am drawing conclusions...conclusions set up by your posts. And I sure do wish I had a killer Irish accent. Guess I should have spent more time with Grammy... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And yes, the tattoo thing is really that simple. Don't assume I just woke up one morning and said I think I'll get a random tattoo on a random part of my body from some random person. What I'm saying is that that one particular design doesn't mean anything. It's just a nice design, a design I was proud of. I'm proud of my body, proud of my art. There's no secret to my feelings on my body, no hidden mystery of the universe in it, or why I get tats. The others, yes they have meaning. <br>
<br>
You said people are not blank slates. Not blank slates = having a preconcieved notion, an achetype of an individuals personality. If you go into something with a preconcieved notion of what that person must be like...ok. I.E. You meet me. You say wow, why did you get your tat. I say, because I liked the design. You obviously don't beleive me...there must be some hidden agenda to WHY I got this particular tat. That's what I meant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything about a person makes them who they are. To ignore any part of it is to ignore some part of that person. Would you want someone to ignore you? Even the smallest part of you? &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, actually. If I was ugly. If I was fat. The fact that I'm white. I really don't care too much about a person exterior. I concern myself more with the interior. What's on the outside can be icing on the cake, or I ignore it in favor of their other more endearing qualities. Like my friend who thinks she's fat when she's not. Or my other friend who has an annoying laugh. I'll ignore the bad...the annoying laugh...and say cool...she's laughing. Or my dog barking at strangers. <br>
<br>
So that's that. Maybe I did read into your statements...maybe not. Whatever, I didn't think we were fighting. Your opinion on smokers is just fine with me. I happen to have similar views....although I tend to have more compassion for people with substance abuse problems.<br>
<br>
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. <p><Font color="#FF0033" link="#FF0033" vlink="#FF0033" alink="#000066">

I have a permanent thing I did which I tell very few, and I have actually even been condemned for it in one case, because that person didn't take the time to learn I stewed over the decision actively for over a decade and in total for nearly 2 decades.  One friend, who was not condeming, thought my decision was a bit abrupt for the procrastinator I am, until I told him how long I had actually been trying to decide to go thorugh with it *laugh*.<br>
<br>
It is those who answer well I got drunk one weekend and... that tell me they aren't really as thoughtful as I would like... unless that incident was in the past (long past) &amp; they know how foolish such a life decision was without fully thinking it through.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I am coherent or just rambling... but take it all with a grain of salt.  What I want to say is people should be judged for themselves, not clothes, not wieght, not hair, not tats, not piercings, but for what is inside.<br>

He had a large number of tattoos and looked pretty rough. He saw me looking at one of his tatts and said, &quot;What are you looking at?&quot; in a challenging tone. I replied, &quot;Checking out your artwork.&quot; He seemed a bit surprised, and we started talking, and got to know each other a bit.<br>
<br>
As it turns out, we knew a few of the same people, and in talking to one of them they'd asked how we met. After relating the incident, they laughed and said, &quot;Oh, that was you.&quot; Apparently I was the only person who ever answered that question honestly. Everyone else had either muttered &quot;I'm not lookin at anything.&quot; or had taken up the provocation to start something. (and it was intended as a provocation, after knowing him for a while, I'd seen him use it as a kind of intimidation/challenge)<br>
<br>
He's heavily tattoed, and does like to show off his artwork, but he recognizes it sets him apart, and revels in that difference.<br>
<br>
(Funny story, as it turns out, he was not only tatooed, but was a tattoo artist. Someone once came into his studio with &quot;Long Bech&quot; done in big gothic letters across his back, when asked if it could be fixed, Tom replied, &quot;You have a better chance of the city changing it's name.&quot;)<br>

Well, my definition of &quot;themselves&quot; is everything about them. Is a person's spirituality a part of them? Or is it some adornment they can leave in a closet? What about their sense of humor? What about their eye color? <br>
<br>
I look at a person, and I see the whole picture. I don't judge a person based only on their bad parts, or only on their good parts, but on the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> whole</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> picture of the person. <br>
<br>
If a tatoo is to be ignored, why get one? I would think a tatoo would be something you would specifically want people to see, and thus you want people to notice it. To notice that it is a part of you. That your choice to get a tatoo is a part of what makes you, you. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for ignoring what's on the &quot;outside&quot; in favor or the &quot;inside&quot; - your body is the one thing that you must take with you everywhere. It is with you 24/7, wether you like it or not. It's your temple. It's your center. It is the place where all of your important things reside. Your heart, your mind, your spirit - they have to have some place to gather. Your body is your temple. <br>
<br>
As such, I try and respect mine. I don't exclude it because &quot;only what's on the inside counts&quot;. No, the container is just as important. If you don't take care of it, you won't be around to do anything with the rest of yourself. Your heart won't be around to love. Your mind won't be around to think. And your spirit won't be around to connect with everyone else. <br>
<br>
As for Tatoos - they don't do permanent damage, they aren't harmful to your health, and they don't damage your body. They are just an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> interesting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> choice in art. Personally, they intrigue me. <br>
