Opening up BoT to non-keyed people isn't really the cause of this. All that did was to accelerate the inevitable. What it comes down to is this:<br>
<br>
1. When the number of people wanting a resource exceeds the availability of said resource then you will get competition and ultimately, conflict. Sometimes this can be resolved peacefully, sometimes not.<br>
<br>
2. An arse is still an arse whether they be in an uberguild, a roleplay guild or no guild, whether they are keyed or non-keyed.<br>
<br>
3. When given the chance most people will take the path of least resistance (ie. the easiest one) to achieving their aims. Needless to say this directly impacts points 1 and 2.<br>
<br>
Enough with the elitest nonsense. <br>
<br>
The mistake a few seem to make is in thinking that a skilled player cannot also be an inconsiderate jerk. This is clearly Incorrect.<br>
<br>
Regarding the incident itself, yeah it's a pretty lame thing to do...<br>

This is sooo true. This is one of the things that ticks me off about that argument everyone had before all the zones were opened based on levels.<br>
<br>
Just because we don't get flagged, doesn't mean we're not nice and considerate -- it just probably means we aren't capable of getting that flag for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
I've seen some folks who are high-end folk who are extremely rude and inconsiderate, not to mention immature. Level + experience playing the game, does not == mature, responsible and courteous player.<br>

Reiterating my earlier post, the fact that I am bot keyed does not make me any more or less likely to be an ass or to engage in uncivil behavior.  It is just a product of demand exceeding supply for those items.<br>
<br>
Given that, removing the key requirements would increase the number of these incidents because there are more folks who can now access BoT and there is more potential for these types of events.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I had forgotten about CT actually. They're more or less dead now.

<br>
I can't believe I'm going to do this, but I want to make mention of what Clan Twisted <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>once was</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> back when met them in summer of last year through the autumn months.<br>
<br>
I agree they became what you describe when you knew them, only I want to emphasize before they were on the radar screen to other raiding guilds, before they recruited without care / thought, and before I realized I didn't want to be a member anymore, Clan Twisted was a small family oriented guild.  <br>
<br>
Though their leaders had plans and sights on higher things which belied the picture they had originally painted for their members.<br>
<br>
I spent more months with them, then I did with most guilds I have been a member of, and like every guild I join, I had many hopes and dreams for the guild, and while I was a member I did my best to promote good feelings and actions within and to others outside the guild.<br>
<br>
Ironically, I was one of the worst spokemen for them after I left, but they fed me the fuel for my angst. <br>
<br>
After helping mold the guild to be the best guild we wanted it to be, when you realize the guildleaders don't care about anyone but themselves and racing to the high end game.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They ended up tagging lots of nasty folk 'cuz of that policy. Most have quit the game, tried to go elsewhere (and were rejected), or gone elsewhere. My bet is that most of those that successfully moved to a new guild are decent folk.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'd say it's not because they let the &quot;pricks&quot; in, it's because minis are still the only viable source of runes for most people, and the amount of people needing their spells is growing faster than the amount of runes coming into the game. -IumunoRN<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Iumuno hit the hammer on the head.  I'm willing to bet that's also why they were so generous to give up the mold.<br>

<br>
You shouldn't have mentioned this, like the fact that they offered the dropped item, redeems them of the wrong action of stealing a camped mob.<br>
<br>
If they wanted the mob bad enough to steal it, there must have been something that it dropped that they wanted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Due to your groups tank going LD the others in my group <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">probably</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> figured you werent going to engage <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">due to a wipe..</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> or perhaps not the right strength of group... for whatever reason <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">it was a mistake i guess</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->... if you cant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>forgive someone for making a mistake even if on purpose or the person is just an a$$... just go about the game... i have been KSed during epic stuff so i know its not fun.. but i still play...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Kahlya, damn.  If that isn't an admission of guilt I don't know what is. <br>
<br>
I underlined some parts that emphasize your group had not communicated with their group before engaging the mob.<br>
<br>
To do so would have avoided this entire issue, presuming your group wouldnt have engaged after knowing full well the other group had been there for a long time killing placeholders.<br>
<br>
Your wording also makes it apparrent that your group was aware of the other group sitting there before your group pulled.<br>
<br>
The section I put in bold for a few reasons:<br>
First you are trying to throw the focus on them for not being able to appologize for something that was an &quot;accident even if on purpose&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Accidents are accidents because they do not happen on purpose.  <br>
<br>
I know you wish it had been an accident, you wish they hadn't been there to begin with, but they were, and your group (like said above) took the path of least resistance.  <br>
<br>
No communication; strike!  Strike now, while they are not ready!<br>
<br>
You know and your words admit that it was done on purpose, even if the person(s) who did it were an a$$.  <br>
<br>
Who was the a$$, the puller or the entire group?<br>
<br>
Then you say as much as &quot;get over it, shit happens&quot;.<br>
<br>
Lastly, you admit people have done this shit to you, (and since you basically just got done admitting your group did this, <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>even if it was an accident on purpose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->...um <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>what are you trying to say?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'm going to post this now, before going back and rereading all you wrote, but I am wondering, did you appologize to them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lindonmaedhros>Lindon Maedhros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/03 7:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3850.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: feeling opinionated</span><hr size=1> It would be very easy to solve this problem.  Make the mobs in the lower floors of BoT see invis, requiring groups to fight in.  <br>
<br>
99% of the problem comes from groups with a tracker spotting a named then running around with invis to find it and kill it.  I've been in groups camping the West Wing and seen entire groups come rushing in to a spot we have been clearing for hours because of the appearance of a named spawn on track, without so much as a &quot;camp check?&quot; in shout.  Highly highly annoying.<br>
<br>
This would no doubt add some time to the trip for groups going to the upper level, but I'd be willing to deal with it in order to end the general goofiness going on in the zone now.<br>

anyway i can be blamed or whatever if thats what needs to be done but i had just entered the group and then a wolf is in front of me<br>

i was also told by group that they sent tells to someone in the camping group to engage it so whether that was truth or not i dont know<br>
<br>
anyway i really dont want to be known as the KSer of FV <br>
<br>
I spose the smart thing to do would to have gated or left as i saw it pulled but really didnt know what was going on and didnt learn about the upset till afterwards ... kinda figured during the fight that it was taken but stayed anyway... i messed up and i am sorry and will try my damndest not to let it happen again<br>
<br>
alot of my first post was taken the wrong way from my words... guess i was trying to make excuse for what my group did<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I talked with Mure afterwards and things seemed to be cleared up between us... i appologized for what happened and ask forgiveness on what happened even though i dont feel i was at fault since i didnt pull or do much of anything to the beast cause wanted to know what was going on... i guess he posted that before i cleared things up with him so was added to the list of evildoers<br>

<br>
I think the small problems that people have in BoT are more then made up by the increase in drop rate on these names now.<br>
<br>
I dont think it right to KS, but it does happen and you should try to work it out in game at the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teapray>Teapray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/14/03 11:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3850.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~abenlen/yawn.JPG height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: More random stealing of named pops</span><hr size=1> Larraque  Said:<br>
<br>
 anyone can ruin anyone else's reputation. But all we have here is word of mouth. So I'm sorry, but I can't judge people by one person's word of mouth. Otherwise, anyone could kill anyone else's reputation just by posting their name. <br>
<br>
Then I Said:<br>
<br>
Hmmm.... I dunno that this is true. I would like to think that if someone came here and posted a rant about me, my reputation would shield me, at least to point that I could post my version of events.  I would hope that even damning logs would be taken with a grain of salt.... Logs can be so easily edited.  I don't even bother with them.  If I find myself in a dispute, I just expand my chat window and take a screen shot.  I know know can be modifed as well, but at least it is somewhat harder. <p>-- <br>

We had also been pulling PH'ers just for the xp and didn't receive any tella about it from anyone.  <br>
<br>
Then the name spawns and no one engaged it for a while so we pulled it.  How were we supposed to know their warrior was LD, or if they were even still there?  Right after that happend some druid ran over to us and started sending my cleric tells.  I tried to respond to him at first but I was playing the warrior and cleric in the group and we were in the fight with the named, so I wasn't able to reply to all his tells. . I never told him to piss off, guess I just wasn't responding fast enough for him.  <br>
After we had killed it I sent tells to their group offering them the loot. .<br>
<br>
Honestly, this post pisses me off. . . I dont know who the hell Muerzor is, he wasn't in their group. . So if you're gonna try and trash someones name at least give your own.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rikkonfv>RikkonFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Laelu's suger daddy; <br>Nakath's Hero </span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/14/03 5:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3850.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: More random stealing of named pops</span><hr size=1> just to clarify things, casue I am like that, Murezor was on his alt Jehanum.

<br>
Now to be honest like i said before I wasnt nor am I too worked up over the named, you offered me the drops etc 30 minutes or so later, just clarifying things. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
