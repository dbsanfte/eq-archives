Entirely remove all lore, magic,and no drop items everywhere, and while you're at it remove all spell casting, thereby contributing to the most realistic world ever yet available.  What happens when you attack a dragon?  You die.  Everyone dies.  That's because dragons are big and we aren't.<br><br>2.  Go directly to a consent based combat system similar to Mu*s.  If you think you deserve to kill a monster, you command it secretly to die and it does.  This would make for great role-playing opportunities, and allow for acts of heroism unheard of on other worlds.<br><br>3. Recycle the coding that allowed people to play monsters, then make that all they could play.  Harvest the character information from every account with a character in Firiona Vie and send them out to kill the monsters.  That would....  Hmm.  It would prevent farming for sure!<br><br>4.  Sell the world code for EQ and let every geek and addict in the world with far too much time host Norrath on their own servers.  Everyone could have exactly the world they wanted.  Well, everyone with a T3 line at least.<br><br>5.  Alter Ankles' character profile permenently so it never again looks like she's wearing pants.  That would contribute immensely to RP.<br><br>6.  Add a creature to the game that is small and blue and has an annoyed high-pitched voice that shows up and mocks any character that kills the same monster too often.  It would also follow around anyone selling farmed items, and would be summoned automatically to the location of any dood who is abusing his numberpad priviledges.  This coding could be modeled after the paperclip guy from Mircosoft Word.<br><br>7. Turn complete control of Verant over to Rudolph Giuliani.  We know he's out of work, and we know he can deal with anything no matter how fucked it is.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>Val<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A> at: 12/28/01 6:24:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzarsissrazorscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarsiss Razorscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/28/01 9:21:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets try something different</span><hr size=1> That was pretty good.

Indirectly, we also accepted whatever consequence that TLC might bring forward to our characters once we are in the game because the rules of TLC were laid out before us (simple, no exp no magical/lore items).<br><br>Now....to be constantly preaching about removal of TLC and/or changes to some of its basic components after several months since server went live, well...what can I say?  You KNEW you were getting into this before you started.<br><br>I believe TLC is one of the key elements that makes FV unique from other servers.  Sure, FV is lowly populated, Sure, grouping is hard as hell to find, Sure, TLC is making some of my quest next to impossible to do (gotta say bye bye to my warden of Tunare quest *sob*),  But these things I am willing to give up for the sake of keeping FV as it is now.<br><br>So the only suggestion i have for TLC is KEEP IT!  Please do not make any changes to it just because it would make our lives easier.

Although no one can control what gets posted on public boards I guess.<br><br>There were threads that openly and constructively discussed issues regarding class balance that were very helpful to everyone reading the thread. It made people think about alot of issues in ways they might not have thought of even if they didnt agree with it. The paladin class comes to mind (mainly because it was the most recent.) Thats what I would like to see here.<br><br>Bottomline is this. No matter what you think of TLC, good or bad, I think that everyone can agree that it inadvertantly affects many people in ways that Verant could not foresee. So whats the alternative? <br><br>I would really like to see some ideas from the other players out there. There were many that got posted on the test boards when this came up many months ago. Some were pretty good actually.<br><br>Personally, what I would like to see is this. To prevent &quot;farming&quot; Verant should use the code they have developed in SoL that increase the level of the rare everytime it pops until it remains alive for &quot;x&quot; amount of time. Perhaps they can even increase the spawn time as well. So that if a rare is killed once, it would respawn at its normal spawn rate, but if it is killed again another 20 minutes would be added and so on, then they could out right remove TLC.<br><br>If thats too much work, I would suggest Verant ask its content team to review all the quests above level 35 that require obtaining items from lower level NPC's. Once they have a list compiled of the drops on lower level mobs needed to complete these quests they can simply put these items on the loot tables of higher level mobs. That way they aren't penalizing the players that are higher level when new expansions come out.<br><br>Perhaps they can do something similar with the components needed for trade skills. If human blood is needed for cultural armors I am sure they can add that item to a high level mob somewhere. How about FP guards? Those are light blue up till level 56.<br><br>As an aside, its easy to just sit back and do nothing. Its easy to just say, &quot;Thats the way it is, so deal with it&quot;. If everyone in the world did that what a poorer people we would be. Change doesn't happen by itself. It starts with someone or some group saying, &quot;I have an idea&quot; or &quot;This could be better&quot;. In fact, as I recall, thats how EQ came to be in the first place isn't it?<br><br>Lee Iacocca (fogive me is I mispelled this name) was one of the first to recongnize the power behind thinking differently and soliciting feedback from all levels of his organization. He recongnized that change doesn't have to be a bad thing. I'll leave you with one of his quotes, that is a personal favourite of mine.<br><br>&quot;Lead, follow or get out of the way&quot;.<br><br>Can't wait to hear your ideas.<br><br><br><br><br>  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uquillionthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quillion the Gnome</A> at: 12/28/01 1:12:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Woodfella</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/28/01 3:11:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets try something different</span><hr size=1> You know, you can replace the paperclip guy with some idiot dog or a mini-Einstein.

There was every reason to believe that to be true because of a couple of things: 1) the main TLC proponent was Brad and he was 'the man' and worked there, and 2) the TLC at least existed in some form on other servers, meaning that TLC-related problems would affect a far larger population and would thus merit spending the nan hours to actually fix such problems.<br><br>Now, since that time, Brad, the driving force behind the TLC, is gone. And the TLC has been removed from all zones on all other servers, so there is now virtually no incentive to fix any prolems that arise, nor is their an in-house champion for the cause. There certainly is virtually no reason for them to spend the time to research potential TLC problems in designing future zones and quests.<br><br>Those are fairly large changes. It's like you go to the store and buy WIndows XP and the very next day Microsoft releases a completely different OS and says that XP is no longer supported and any bugs or problems with it will never be fixed. If your video card doesn't work, well, that's tough, figure out a way to 'work around it'. If your hard drive loses data, well, bummer, no longer supported.<br><br>What we have - a buggy unsupported TLC with a myriad of problems - is far different than what we should have expected. Sure, I expected problems with it, such a drastic change to all zones and quests, most of which predate the idea behind the TLC. And that was fine, because I had some rerason to believe that problems would actually be addressed, changes made as needed where there were obvious problems. But...that is no longer the case.<br><br>They call that 'bait and switch' where I come from: offer you an item to lure you into the store, then tell you they are out of that item but instead they are more than happy to sell you this other item (generally inferior, and certainly so in this case).

I try not to gauge it against other servers or compare what I can do on Luclin to what I can on FV.  The challenge with TLC is here, some quests will be harder but they should be. Items will be much rarer and thats good. Makes an achievement stand out more amongst the crowd. Everyone has to have Testament of Venear? There will be common items and then the rarer unique (on FV) things. It will be a bit still before Dragon Killing is a scheduled occurence and not a fly by the seat of your pants risk. I think that lends the charm to FV and places more value on the RP. One character per server, well then one retires and the next starts a career. Or delevel and start over and roleplay that you were cursed or something.

Frankly I hate logging on to Tunare just to hear folks in shout and ooc whining and fighting over spawns, insulting each other or general d00dspeak. <br><br>I find TLC + the fact that very few things are no drop will actually give guilds meaning here. As opposed to the regular servers, and even Test, a character that is level 17 can and does have a use to guild other than leeching items/begging for powerlevelling,etc. We can go out and get items for high end players that they cannot get themselves in exchange for a bit o' coin or perhaps some armor or weapons.<br><br>Nahide and Mystikat have already forged a relationship with fellow Vah Shir, a rogue, Dominii, who has connections with a mage who is possibly in need of our assistance with collecting items from areas that are below him to bother with.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Seems like it has potential as a real opportunity for roleplay and interaction to me. I'm looking forward to seeing how things shake out in the end.<br><br>Only thing is, to keep a good balance, we need to have all levels of characters present on the server. If it becomes top heavy with 50+ and few 1-30, then things will go askew and the server will have no where to go. <br><br>Maybe they should allow more than one char per acct, but only once one character hits 50. We will have to keep ALL level ranges around and interacting for the &quot;vision&quot; to work I think. Granted I have yet to get to a high level with these rules, so my view may change over time.<br><br>But all in all, I'm enjoying my new life as a warrior. I've played a necro to 53 on Test, a shaman to 50 on Tunare, a druid to 34, a cleric to 20, and various others to the teens. <br><br>Maybe its because the content is new (Luclin) and the rules are different (I LOVE the language issue! Am trying to work up Human now..) but I'm having a blast, not trying to rush to 50, just enjoying the content on Luclin as we encounter it. <br><br>--<br>Nahide, Khala Dun of the 17th rank<br><br>--<br> <p><b>Nahide, Khala Dun of the 12th rank - Firiona Vie Server<br>Dorina Darkdancer, 53 Heretic,Forsaken of Tunare,Test Server<br>Saraei VengieCrusher, 50 Shaman, Crusaders of Divine Chaos, Tunare Server<br>Hannahe Thunderfoot, 34 Druid, Tunare Server<br>Nysta, 18 Enchanter, Forsaken of Tunare, Test Server<br>Gruella, 9 Shaman, Test Server<br>Breda, 2 Cleric of Brell, Test Server<br></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umheddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mheddik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/28/01 9:15:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> That is correct, Ichi</span><hr size=1> No TLC in Luclin, nor Warrens, nor Stonebrunt, except here. So TLC exists for a fraction of 1 percent of the overall population. Effectively, the TLC horse is dead, the stables have closed, and we're sitting on the corpse wondering why it begins to smell more and more as time goes on.<br><br>I actually like the *idea* of the TLC, but if they aren't going to support it, then I'd rather not have it at all. Of all the various parts of the ruleset it is the one part that has seen no fixes whatsoever. Languages had problems; they fixed those. Alignments had problems; they fixed those. TLC has problems; they ignore those. I understand why: there is no simple code fix for TLC problems in most cases. They must be addressed on a case-by-case basis, which gobbles up man hours (read: costs money), and it isn't cost effective to fix those particular kinds of problems for one small server.<br><br>The most obvious bug is the one that makes an item that is nodrop (but not magic or lore) on other servers TLC'd here. There is no rational reason why a nodrop flag in 'alternate realities' should affect in any way its status in our world. This is obviously an unintended effect. But by and large, most of the problems stem from simple lack of foresight when designing quests, not taking into account the possibility of the TLC (see dead horse above). It is these problems that most need to be addressed. But the nodrop problem IS a coding thing which should therefore be easy to fix (and that would fix MANY things), and I find the lack of fixing THAT fairly inexcuseable.<br><br>No, the TLC doesn't affect me. That's really irrelevant to me. I dislike it on principle: we 'signed up' for a server with a set of rules, but there is an implied agreement there that those rules would actually be supported, that problems would be addressed (preferably before one's children age 20 years and have children of their own). But if they aren't going to commit the resources to doing it right, then they have violated the spirit of their agreement with us when we came here. No, there is nothing that says they must fix bugs, or limit downtime, or anything at all really. Legally, they are certainly secure. But right is right, and wrong is wrong, and legal or not, enticing people to a server knowing that they will experience problems that will never be fixed, well, that's just wrong in my book.<br><br>If the only man-hour-effective way to fix all the problems is to remove the TLC, that's fine. If they want to keep it and address the problems, that's even better, however doubtful. If removing it means making nodrop items nodrop again, that's fine too, and since that is the codebase of the bulk of the servers, then there are not apt to be any unforeseen problems that would go unrectified. I'm really pretty flexible. But the one thing I DON'T want is a rule in the ruleset - any rule - that doesn't receive reasonable support when problems arise. I think that's imminently reasonable.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uquillionthegnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quillion the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/28/01 10:49:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is correct, Ichi</span><hr size=1> Lets try and keep this thread a lil more focused.

After presenting Verant with all of our arguements pointing out the bad points of the TLC outwerighed the good points, Verant decided to poll the players.

Guess what verant dosn't care, they say it's your own fault if you level past a quest, find someone to help you with it.  Also Verant is of the opinion that we as players are not ENTITLED to every item and quest.  There are so many things in this game to aquire that verant won't change a rule just so you can get one harder to get item.  If an item IS proven to be imposible for anyone to get submit that to verant and im certain they'd do something about making that one item possible to get.<br><br>So here is my chalenge to allllllllll of you hating TLC, find a solid strong enuff reason that could stand in a court of law to justifie verants removal or changing of the TLC.

Any non trivial items are droppable as they are now.<br><br>This means - <br>Farming trivial stuff is impossible, as you can not sell it or give it away.<br>If you miss out on a quest item, or a useful newb item, you can still get it and use it yourself.<br><br>This way combines the benefits of both systems. The main problem is probably in the coding. I doubt we will see this happen as it is not the simple programming change that TLC is (ie somehow items would have to &quot;remember if they are NO DROP or not) <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/jimturner99/gyrhawk"></center> <b><center>Gyrhawk - Tunare's Falconer</center></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/29/01 10:09:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=968.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lets try something different</span><hr size=1> LOL<br><br>SO, the very REAL fact that Vah Shir and Iksar can NOT do their CLASS quests because they level out of range while TRYING to do them isnt good enough.  The VERY real problem of the Vah Shir unable to DELEVEL to 5th lvl or lower (because you CANT) to finish quests designed FOR their class arent good enough reasons?<br><br>Just admit that you wouldnt find ANY reason good enough. Unless it happens to affect you personally that is.<br><br>Exactly how many times should someone make and delete a Vah Shir to accomplish a quest DESIGNED for them? A quest that levels you to 5 and thus prevents you from getting the item because of TLC. <br><br>As for focus.... I have seen a couple good suggestion.<br><br>One is to request that an Item marked ONLY &quot;NO DROP&quot;  , not magic nor lore, NOT be affected by TLC. <br><br>Another being the suggestion to place class quest items that are on very low level mobs on some marginally higher mobs ALSO so that no change would be needed to the &quot;precious&quot; TLC.<br><br>A third would be to increase the drop rate on the class specific quest items , especially those that appear on VERY rare mobs, or require MANY attempts to complete.<br><br>The first suggestion would possibly allow &quot;farming&quot; to occur, but the other two would directly address the class specific, race specific quests that are the problem.<br><br>With regards to CLASS and RACE specific quests, for those NOT aware.... NONE of the items are UBER. Doing the quests are a way to say LOOK  I managed to follow MY class/race path and gain all these items as required by my Guild.
