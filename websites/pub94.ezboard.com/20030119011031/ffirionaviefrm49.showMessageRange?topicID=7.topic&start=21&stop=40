<br>
The first time I ever met Fuvi was on Vazaelle, where he was playing a high elf cleric.<br>
<br>
My guild was raiding Mistmoore, and all our clerics managed to go linkdead.  Total Wipeout.  Fuvi (Cure at the time) was in the neighborhood, and took about an hour out of his day to resurrect my entire guild.<br>
<br>
Here on FV, was raiding Mistmoore here with the guild I was in (Starspun).  We made it to the castle and got our asses trained back out.  By the time we made it back to the castle again, too many people had to leave for us to have a raiding party.  Fuvi was nearby, and had Mistmoore faction, so he waltzed into the Castle and pulled out werewolves, gypsies, and all other kinds of fun stuff out to the courtyard for us to kill.  We ended up w/ talon's for Mixxi &amp; someone else's crafted Breastplate, lutes for Mine and someone else's lambent BP, blood spirits for our rogues burning rapiers, and some other goodies.  It turned a day that might have ended on a sour note into a great one.<br>
<br>
Rather than roll up an alt to do quests that went TLC, he involved lower level members of the community to do the quests for him for payment, mercenary style.  Call it lazy if ya want, but it involved a lot of people within the community and gave them access to some neat treasures they might not have otherwise had the time or experience to gain.<br>
<br>
I'm sure some individual people might have had their problems with him (Kurley, Krit/Restoria, etc), and he might even have instigated those problems, but I'm seein a lot of people trying to demonize him as some kind of psycopath.  I've had a little interaction with him on Vazaelle, and a ton here, and it's all been positive.  That's not to say he's always a great guy, I don't stalk him to see what he does when I'm around, but I think there's a lot of bringing up what amounts to personal disputes between him &amp; certain individuals as a means of trying to distract from other issues being discussed (Sleepers or whatever).<br>
<br>
   You locked him outta your boards, and then you complain when he comes here to air his grievances.  Sucks to be you.  This is the second time this exact same thing has happened (you banned someone from FnF boards so they came here to bitch).  Your fault for not learning better from the first time around.<br>
<br>
   I don't even care about Kerafym, but I think there's a lot of trashing him going on as a means of distracting from what you might see as a potential black eye to the guild.  And you call him manipulative...<br>

<br>
I was sitting on my front porch in the co-op townhouses and watched as my dog wandered over to Kurley's yard and sh!t on it, his fiancee witnessed it.<br>
<br>
Although I should have called the dog back or atleast cleaned up after the dog, I didn't.  Kurley get's over the sh!t on his yard but dedicates himself to proving what an @sshole I am, something he fails to realize I will freely admit to anyone who asks.<br>
<br>
He spends months and months going door to door in the community talking to anyone who will listen about the incident and even finds some other incidents involving me.  None of these incidents are anything spectacular but he finds by making vague ominous references some people are properly shocked by them.<br>
<br>
He takes up the incident with the steering commitee of the co-op at every opportunity, bringing it up at the slightest or no provocation.<br>
<br>
He counts every victory of someone who agrees with him that I'm so evil to let my dog sh!t on his yard but fails to realize that it does him no good.  Because the substance of his argument is a meaningless pile of sh!t that even Kurley admits never actually caused a problem.<br>
<br>
Eventually his campaign of villification wears him out, regardless of the number of people who don't like me because I let my dog sh!t on his yard no one but Kurley and a few of his closest most narrow minded friends can fathom ejecting me from the co-op over me absently sitting back drinking a beer while my dog emptied his bowels.<br>
<br>
Kurley leaves the co-op in disgust, claiming I drove him out and bronzes the pile of sh!t and uses it as a paperweight.  He blames the incident which occupied a grand total of 5 minutes of his life, failing to realize what really spoiled all his fun while living in the community was his own decision to focus on proving my evil rather than enjoying the resources and entertainment the co-op provided.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the instigation of those 5 minutes, it was Kurley's and Kurley's decision alone to dedicate easily 100 hours of his life to explaining to people who by and large didn't care about my inherent evil.  This is what ruined his happiness, all he had to do was forget about a little piece of sh!t and he could have been happy.<br>
<br>
Kurley gets word that I have been ejected from the co-op and rushes back thinking it will be a day of celebration and vindication for him, but instead he finds only a hollow feeling.  All those months he sacrificed his own happiness in a quest to get people to dislike me amounted to nothing.  Even though I have been ejected from the co-op he doesn't get back the months of his life he was needlessly unhappy because he wasted it focusing on demonizing me.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story, only worry about your own happiness and of course the happiness of others dear to you.  If you find yourself doing something that makes you unhappy step back and ask yourself is this really worth it?<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
Some facts that led to my stance on shooting the Pope, I mean sending 4 lines of text to Kurley's email address.<br>
<br>
I knew the email didn't cause a problem before Kurley lied in his reply to me and made an issue of it.  You see he forgot about his fiancee, if the email would lead her to attack someone so near and dear to her it would be worth clicking on the reply button instead of the delete.<br>
<br>
There was my failsafe, you see if she considers the anonymous email meaningless, there is nothing to apologize for, if she is willing to attack Kurley about it it's also worth replying to, something she didn't do.<br>
<br>
Anything worth doing is worth doing well.  If I was going to send an email to try to disrupt his realtionship it would look something like this.<br>
<br>
Subject : I can't take it anymore<br>
<br>
Text : Maybe you don't consider grabbing my bottom or massaging my shoulders as anything but a casual gesture but it really bothers me.<br>
<br>
Even more aggravating is your &quot;hints&quot; when you talk about how lonely it is going back to an empty house and how no one would know if you got home at 6pm or 10pm.<br>
<br>
I'm not playing these games with you and I'm willing to drop it if it stops NOW.  But if you continue in your behavior I will be required to take action.<br>
<br>
The email I did send didn't have ANY genuine chance at disruption, either I didn't want it to be disruptive or I'm just not clever enough to figure out how to send a potentially disruptive email.  I think I ruled out option B.<br>
<br>
But most importantly, that email should have been dead and buried a very long time ago.  Your decision to focus so much energy on it was a primary reason you were so unhappy, as you admitted yourself the email itself didn't cause any problems, as I'll let you know now, you created a lot of aggravation for yourself.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has concerns try /t Fuvi or email at bryanmck@sympatico.ca, things can be easily resolved, lets use Kiyann for example.<br>
<br>
Someone took the time to tell her I didn't think she should have gotten all the awards that she had and specifically I thought Illistrumn should have gotten a couple of them.  She could have let it fester and think why doesn't he like me and how dare he think I didn't earn all I have.<br>
<br>
Instead she sent a tell and I explained the basics of high end raid loot, it's not what you earn because drops are too random it's what you earn relative to others and simply I couldn't see any reason for the 6-0 imbalance between her and Illistrumn, she agreed.<br>
<br>
Maybe she should have gone on a tell spree, ranting about how Fuvi didn't think she deserved what she had gotten, gathered support for herself and vilified me for claiming otherwise.  Of course she would only invest energy in something that couldn't possibly be fun for her and would result in her enjoying a game that much less, so she did what I consider the right thing.<br>
<br>
I've never stopped having fun Kurley, in fact this post is a lot of fun, pointing out the self-destructive behavior of someone who made so much effort to pull me down brings a smile to my face, because indeed I am an @sshole and a happy one at that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Feisty Dwarf!</span><br>  Posts: 564<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/26/02 6:10:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Mod edit: Personal attacks like this are not acceptable here.<br>

<br>
In fact, I did not inform anyone of the email until your behavior in-guild was escalating to the point that the officers were forced to talk about you.  Repudiate that comment all you want.  Regardless, that relevant morsel of information was discussed with a few people in the officer circle, as were other, unrelated instances of your behavior that some guild members and some guild officers didn't really dig.  Likewise, two RL friends who play EQ were informed of this (do the math), however I can't say that it really changed their opinion of you anyways.<br>
<br>
That was months ago and I haven't played EQ, haven't had any involvement in FnF politics, nor really posted on these boards, except for the occassional picture or other nonesense.<br>
<br>
Thus, while perhaps you'd like to find some satisfaction in the thought of me spending all of this past time, developing some Machiavellian plan to &quot;take you down&quot;, again you're sadly mistaken.  I was pretty clear in my goodbye to the guild how I wanted to leave, without being overly specific in the details - and no Fuvi, you were not the only reason I lost my love for the game.  You'll also recall I didn't sling a pile of mud at you or anyone else.  Did I come to the public boards and post &quot;truthful&quot; information about someone I didn't really care for?  Did I use an excuse that I was looking out for the best interests of others on the server?  Negative to both...but check your own recent motives &quot;truthfully&quot;.<br>
<br>
Flash forward to recently, where the instance of said email was used by someone to prove a point in a moment of emotionalism.  Was I happy that Kzan brought it up?  No, as it was a dated issue, he had no right to bring it up publicly, and he could have used any number of other examples to try to prove his point.  In fact, Kzan can attest to how displeased I was to have my name brought into this whole, stupid drama.<br>
<br>
However, after reading your post on this, I full and well had the right to respond.  You've patted yourself on the back as enjoying the cause and effect of psychology and manipulation and branded yourself &quot;good at it for specific reasons&quot;.  <br>
<br>
The way you presented that email and Bako's Sleeper post, were of course accurate in their elements (those are indeed the quotes and words used in those instances), however not truthful, except from your point of view, for your purpose.  Well there are different points of view of any set of facts, and the truth of a situation is merely a given perspective of the facts, which always risks exposure to manipulation.  Feel free to repudiate your affinity for manipulation and social psychology.<br>
<br>
So you didn't like what I posted?  Obviously it bothered you enough to repost after I simply stated the truth and in fact said a number of non-infammatory things that you should read more carefully.  However if what I posted, which you'<br>
re welcome to challenge as untruthful, bothered you enough to attempt to spin it into something less valid (the tale of the co-op and the doggy poo), then maybe make a Darwinian leap in your ability to empathize, and come to the realization that being an asshole is going to garner you a few enemies.<br>
<br>
And that, not the email that we're discussing, is what lead to your deguilding.  If you believe that I revived a recent campaign to evict Fuvi and his discontinent dog from the coop, then you need to look elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Now onto some of your content above:<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew the email didn't cause a problem before Kurley lied in his reply to me and made an issue of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right...and where did I lie about the effect that email had on my opinion of you.  At the very least, it was an example of a poor sense of humor (read, that was like the 2nd email you sent me), and at the very worst it was an example of something that a creep would do.  However that particular email was by no means the linchpin in my overall opinion of you.  It was just a reaffirming piece of the picture, that was your consistent pattern of comments and actions towards others, which you should well know I have plenty of examples of.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was my failsafe, you see if she considers the anonymous email meaningless, there is nothing to apologize for, if she is willing to attack Kurley about it it's also worth replying to, something she didn't do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here is an equally absurd interpretation.  If I mess with the brakelines of your car, and you don't run into a situation where you're required to slam on your breaks, then it was harmless and I have nothing to apologize for.  Your assumption that something worth attacking someone for is something worth replying to is also just that, an assumption and holds no validity except in your mind - scour psychology texts all you want, there is no Litmus test for what you've accepted as a true failsafe.<br>
<br>
&quot;The email I did send didn't have ANY genuine chance at disruption, either I didn't want it to be disruptive or I'm just not clever enough to figure out how to send a potentially disruptive email.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clearly, your example of a true attempt at a disruptive email (as presented above in your post) would have a better chance at achieving it's goal.  Also, it would be much harder to play damage control on an email like that as well, wouldn't it?  I don't think I've ever questioned your intelligence and knack for subtlety.<br>
<br>
At this point, it's pretty much just you and me reading all of this tripe I would think.  So why don't I answer the flat question of whether or not I thought you meant harm with that email.<br>
<br>
As stated before, I thought it was an odd thing to do, which is a pretty reasonable reaction.  That can be countered by questioning my sense of humor, however anyone who has spent any time around me in EQ, knows different.<br>
<br>
It's only after observing aspects - I'm not painting you entirely with this brush - of your interaction with the guild we belonged to and certain members, clear instances of practiced manipulation (again, feel free to refute), and the venemous disdain you practiced against specific members of our guild, did I reconsider your original intention.<br>
<br>
You constantly acknowledge that you can be an asshole - I'm qualifying by saying can be, rather than are, as I know different.  You also acknowledge that you enjoy psychology, stimulation and outcome.  You know you have used manipulation to prove your points - the &quot;withholding loot&quot; issue is well known to those involved.  You know that I am not the only one to have had a negative reaction to the way you conduct yourself at times.  Feel free to repudiate any of the above.<br>
<br>
If you take all of those knowns together, it would not be inconsistent behavior, as observed.  But in truth, I'll never know the &quot;truth&quot;, nor do I really care other than to discuss semantics.  I had considered the email, and the encompassing issue &quot;dead and burried&quot; until all of this was dragged out - neither by you or me - and I exercised my right to convey my version of the &quot;truth&quot; since, in a far off way, it involved me - in EQ at any rate.<br>
<br>
&quot;in fact this post is a lot of fun, pointing out the self-destructive behavior of someone who made so much effort to pull me down brings a smile to my face, because indeed I am an @sshole and a happy one at that.&quot;<br>
<br>
It IS a fun diversion in a way.  But you need to stop fooling yourself about the self-destruction and singular effort to &quot;pull you down&quot; that brings the smile to your face.  Again, I didn't bring this whole topic to light, and I did not have any involvement in your recent ejection from FnF - other than the fact that I was involved in events that transpired months ago.  You freely admit that you can piss people off, that you're an @sshole and/or a prick when you want to be, so why focus on the fact that I came to regard you as one when it's a foregone accepted that some others have come to that conclusion as well. <br>
<br>
By attempting to pin your &quot;villification&quot; and deguilding from FnF on me, or thinking that I had to &quot;prove what an @sshole you are&quot; to others, when that conclusion was drawn by the respective persons independently of me, you aren't facing the truth, and I thought truth &gt; all.  Really, it's just a political maneuver akin to blaming the prior administration.<br>
<br>
I suggest you reread my previous posts in this thread to actually see the tone at which I'm writing this and what I was actually saying.<br>
<br>
You say &quot;I have no problem accepting consequences for my actions.&quot; but your post above just serves to hobble that statement.  When you act nice to certain people, they will like you, when you act like an @ss to certain people, the recipients of that behavior and those observing it may or may not like you.<br>
<br>
At any rate, enjoy playing EQ and enjoy being an @sshole as you acquiese that it makes you happy, but just learn to accept that it may not float everyone's boat.  As for the email, I'm stating for the 2nd time in this thread that it's a dead fricking horse, and we're just batting around perceived intentions and interpretations for arguement's sake.<br>
<br>
And believe me when I say that it's perfectly okay and possible to disagree, even conflict, and live at peace. <br>

<br>
I don't believe you.<br>
<br>
I doubt I'm the only one.<br>
<br>
All your explanations mean nothing.<br>
<br>
All your claims mean nothing.<br>
<br>
Of course other people could be lying instead of you, but having to choose their word or yours I have to go with you are lying to me.<br>
<br>
Anyone who believes you because you're more friendly or simply trusts you from the past you don't have to convince of anything, anyone who doesn't trust you you can't convince of anything.<br>
<br>

<br>
The facts and statements used in my explanations/claims are primarily based on statements and admissions made by no one but you.<br>
<br>
Thus either you were misrepresenting a) when you made them, or b) in your honesty of being able to deal with the consequences.<br>
<br>
The problem facing you is that of the Chinese finger-cuffs - the more you struggle the more you get stuck.  You can't provide any substance to refute what I said, so you basically take the 5th, stick your head in the sand and say &quot;I don't believe you.&quot;, rather than incriminate yourself further.<br>
<br>
All you can resort to are personal attacks and vague, sweeping counter-claims.<br>
<br>
And oh...it should be very apparent how much I value a personal opinion from you.  Laid out end to end, your profile is definitely something to be cherished.<br>
<br>
This is just getting funny.<br>
