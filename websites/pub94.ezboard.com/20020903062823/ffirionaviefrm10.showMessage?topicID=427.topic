In a real-world situation, the prey of our characters wouldn't reproduce fast enough to prevent extinction, I bet... if anyone cares to add other critters' perspectives to this piece, please do!))<br>
<br>
The gnoll pup listened to the dying cry of Fippy and slunk off into the darkness outside Qeynos. <br>
<br>
They were everywhere – the adventurers, the spellcasters, the deathdealers. The gnoll pup was the last of his brood, the only living child of a litter of eight. The rest had been cut down long before by the swords of men. <br>
<br>
The pup was undernourished; scouts were sent out for food but few ever returned. And since the humans had begun invading Blackburrow, since they’d cut off the stout trade and essentially gutted any economy the gnolls ever had, starvation had become rampant. <br>
<br>
A human spellcaster stood before him, suddenly, emerging from the dark. The gnoll pup and the mage stared at each other for just a second. Then the caster’s hand began to glow. The gnoll pup, his mother’s last child, bared his teeth and charged, one last desperate action before the darkness came… <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
King Crush sat on his throne, his head in his massive, scarred hands. <br>
<br>
Outside, he heard his soldiers dying. He heard the screaming, his men calling out his name, dying in his honor, dying for this pitiful little grove. Nothing more than a stream and a small stone tower, some slave pits that yielded little more than poor quality silver now and then… <br>
<br>
Outside his window, he heard the cry that spelled his doom. <br>
<br>
&quot;The throne room is camped!&quot; A harsh elven voice cried. By the gods, they were fighting over which of them would kill him. <br>
<br>
The dark elf put a cold hand on Crush’s shoulder. He held his blade at the ready. <br>
<br>
&quot;We’ll take a few of them with us. By the gods, we’ll take a few of the bastards with us,&quot; he said, then sighed. &quot;I didn’t want to die here.&quot; <br>
<br>
*** <br>
<br>
All about him, mad halflings, massive humans, soldiers of all kinds ran about. Goblin heads rolled like pebbles in the sea on the floor of Runnyeye. <br>
<br>
One lone knight held off the pass, his trusted bastard sword held at the ready. He could see the green blood of his kin on the blades of the adventurers as they confronted him. <br>
<br>
And he saw, in their eyes, not hatred but greed: they were eyeing his sword. And they would kill him for it gladly. <br>
<br>
The goblin knight saluted them, outnumbered, outskilled, and out of time. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
In the darkness of Toxxulia Forest she found her brother, his tiny kobold corpse still smoldering from some wizard’s bolt. <br>
<br>
She rolled him over, touched his muzzle, brushed closed his eyes. <br>
<br>
The kobold runt was half-blind, the result of poison in the water supply put there by cruel men. Rumor had it they came from all over the world to invade the Warrens, came by the hundreds to hunt her people, a people already sick and deranged and dying from the face of the planet. <br>
<br>
A shield smashed against her back, stunning her; she rolled slowly to look up at the eyes of her killer, a man of dark skin and steely eyes. She barely felt the blade plunge into her chest, but with her last breath she reached for him, for vengeance… <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The froglok soldier. looked at the spear pinning him to the ground, watched his life’s blood drizzle into the mud. <br>
<br>
It was a good life, he thought fuzzily. Never got to leave this forsaken swamp, but it was a good life nonetheless. <br>
<br>
I could have seen the world, he thought. If only the world didn’t see my homeland as a hunting ground. <br>
<br>
He felt himself fading away just as the dark shape reappeared over him, not big enough to be a troll, but just as fierce, just as cruel <br>
(human)<br>
as any barsher or shadowknight. <br>
<br>
The figure drew a skinning knife, and suddenly the froglok soldier knew, understood, that death would not arrive fast enough for him. <br>

He focused solely on the opponent before him, an unatural zombie animated from beyond the grave, a blight to all that was decent and good. His picks drove home time and time again ripping the undead automaton apart, bit by bit.<br>
<br>
Suddenly throughout the Estate of Unrest a great call was heard...<br>
<br>
&quot;TRAIN!&quot;<br>
<br>
Damn gnomes, always bragging about their newfangled contraptions of clockwork and steam. He would not let the shout distract him from his purpose, this blight of smelly undeadness would fall before him, looking at the gnomish machine could come later.<br>
<br>
Victory was almost his, the undead was nearly torn to bits, just a few more true strikes with his trusty picks would rid NOrrath of yet another abomination.<br>
<br>
Suddenly he was surrounded by the death screams of elves and gnomes and a human or two. Not even allowing this to distract him his only concern was the destruction of his foe.<br>
<br>
Pain lanced through him as something struck him from behind. Daring a look he let out a horrifed gasp. A small army had ammassed behind him. Hags, massive skeletons, an angry dwarven ghost, mummies, ghouls and of all things a large hand?<br>
<br>
Where the hell was that gnomish train now when he needed it? A swift moving engine would really come in handy to get him outta this one. Eyeing the dead gnomes on the ground he decided the undead horde had probaly ambushed the train and claimed it for themselves. Damn his luck.<br>
<br>
Before he could blink they were upon him. An instant later he was standing naked outside of Kaladim, saved by the grace of Brell though not understanding why Brell's penance for his aid always involved him running across the world naked as the day he was born.<br>
<br>
After running across the drafty area known as Dagnor's Cauldron (holding a branch over his parts for modesties sake) he finally made it back into Unrest....<br>
<br>
to be greeted by a ghoul, a bony bartender, 3 undead monks and a werebat to boot.<br>
<br>
the attack from the ghoul left him paralyzed, unable to move.<br>
<br>
&quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!&quot; sounded across the estate<br>
<br>
Well good fer them he thought, sounds like the gnomes had recaptured their clockwork engine and were hightailing it out of there with it before the undead hijacked them again...<br>
<br>
He then remembered his predicament and looked back to the werebat and company. Something in the werebat's eye told him he was in for more than a leg humpin.<br>
<br>
Soon the sound of Brell's voice filled his mind as the Duke of Below spoke the words to transport him bare-buttedly to safety, a curious chant it was...<br>
<br>
&quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
Aye, sometimes the tables are turned an' the hunter becomes that hunted.<br>

They chose him because he was the fastest young orc in Crushbone. He had always run; as a boy he wished he'd been born something less stout, less clumsy, less ugly. <br>
<br>
But he could run like the wind. <br>
<br>
The messenger made it through Faydark unharmed, dodging the elves and their various traps. But he could smell them in Butcherblock, sense their quiet shadows as soon as he ran through the pass. <br>
<br>
There was more than one bounty on his head. <br>
<br>
But he could run. <br>
<br>
The first arrow struck him in the calf. The boy kept running, the pain flaring up into his skull. <br>
<br>
Then the second arrow struck, between his shoulderblades. Suddenly breathing became agony. <br>
<br>
And the arguing began. <br>
<br>
Rangers appeared from all over, bows in hand; they were confronting a pack of  elvish knights. <br>
<br>
&quot;The pack belongs to the paladins, dirtwalker,&quot; said one of the knights. <br>
<br>
&quot;That is a Faydark's Champions arrow in his back, good sir. The kill is mine.&quot; <br>
<br>
The boy fell to his knees, but kept crawling, dragging himself along the path... <br>
<br>
And looked up at the waiting axe of a dwarven soldier. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bounty er no bounty, orc, you've run through the wrong kingdom this night...&quot;<br>

Aviaks long ago lost the ability to fly; they still talked of the ability in children's tales, and mythology said that a great king would one day arise again, one who could fly, and bring the aviaks back to their former glory. <br>
<br>
But for now all they had was their small town, a harmless place far away from the featherless ones. Buried in the plains of Karana, doing no one no harm... yet still they come. They come to hunt. <br>
<br>
The young mother tucked her children into their beds for the night. Aviaks no longer fly but they still take to the heights, still roost high above the ground. They still hide their children in the sky. <br>
<br>
She felt rather than saw the wizard's bolt as it struck the platform beneath her. Then she smelled the smoke. <br>
<br>
The young mother stepped from her small hut to see all escape cut off by flames, all hope gone... <br>
<br>
She looked at her children. She looked at the ground far below. And she could hear in her mind the sounds of their cries as they burned. She refused to let that happen. <br>
<br>
She quickly roused them from their beds and led them outside, away from burning walkways. <br>
<br>
&quot;We're going to fly, children,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Like in the old stories. Tonight we'll all be able to fly.&quot;<br>
<br>
And to escape the pain, they flew. As best they could. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Once upon a time Quillmane knew other Pegasi. They flew like squadrons of demi-gods. <br>
<br>
But their time was drawing to a close, hunted by griffons for food and men for other things. Still Quillmane remained, a tribute to her race. <br>
<br>
But man still needed those other things, and as the Pegasi dwindled, the hunters came looking for Quillmane. <br>
<br>
She spent her days dodging magi, who longed for her death like no others. But these silly robed fools could not track her, and had to rely on the luck of fools to catch her. <br>
<br>
Quillmane was too smart for that. <br>
<br>
But then came the others, the trackers, the mercenaries. The people who would care nothing for Quillmane's life or death, if only her wings were not so valuable... <br>
<br>
The last Pegasi on Antonica lay bleeding, full of arrows, her red, red blood staining her white, white plummage. She whinnied softly as the hunter backed away. <br>
<br>
Then the magi knelt down beside her, a knife in his hand. He looked suddenly heartbroken. <br>
<br>
&quot;The beauty I destroy in this damnable quest for power,&quot; he whispered, unaware that it was the last earthly sounds Quillmane would hear.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/21/02 1:15:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Don't mind me..</span><hr size=1> Nagafen sighed deeply, his cavernous mouth spraying a burst of flame into the air.  He heard the last of his loyal giants fall, plunging to the floor with a spray of dirt and fire.  'They come for me now,' he thought.<br>
<br>
He watched with a look of dread the group of fighters filter through into his personal prison, his lair.  <br>
<br>
Many had come before, and when they were foolish enough to announce their intent and strike out at him in their lust for opportunity and greed, he had been able to slay them.  <br>
<br>
He knew now, though, that the force stood before him was more than sufficient to kill him.  &quot;Lord Nagafen!  We are here to see an end to your reign of terror!&quot;  'What reign of terror?' he thought angrily.  'I'm imprisoned here, those are the words of someone trying to justify his own bloodlust and greed.  There is little I can do to prevent my demise.  All I can hope is that I send a few of them to hell with me.'<br>
<br>
The fire dragon reered up, making his bulky, bruised and battered form, weary from the constant combat he had undergone since his discovery by those little beings as frightening as possible.  His opponents were unintimidated, confirming the futility of his situation.<br>
<br>
He sighed a final time, uttering to himself, &quot;My dear Lady, I fear I shall never be with you again.  I hope that you live long enough to escape your icy prison and return to our dragonkin in good faith.  I hope that the story of my final struggle lives on in the lore of our race, assuming it is heard at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
He cast his eyes towards the waiting group of fighters.  &quot;My son..&quot;  The dragon drew in a deep breath.  He roared.  &quot;AVENGE ME!&quot;  He charged into the waiting blades and was consumed by magic almost instantly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 439<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/21/02 1:31:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> Kimaya stopped twirling her shiny marble for a moment, bringing tiny little pouts and sighs from her winged audience who had been ooh-ing and giggling at the pretty, sparkly patterns she was making for them.  She hushed them, looking up toward two faerie guards who had fluttered into the garden, supporting a singed and broken pixie.<br>
<br>
Kimaya's face crumpled again with concern, reaching out to collect her poor little friend.  &quot;Titterpuff got blammo'd again&quot;, one of the guards said grimly, gripping her small spear in barely contained fury.  She added between delicately sharp teeth, &quot;They took her wings.&quot;<br>
<br>
The small pixie's eyes were still closed, her shock and the pain so great she was spared the conscious awareness of it.  Quietly, Kimaya asked &quot;Was it a ranger?&quot;  The guard scowled, &quot;I told you they'd never listen to you, the truth is less important to them than an excuse to vent their jealousies and greed on our sisters.  I wouldn't be surprised if they spread the arson story to include faeries, to justify collecting our wings as well to sell to researchers, or worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard's companion added with quiet venom, &quot;We should curse them now, the guild of them, and let them reap harvest from the seeds they have sown in our woods.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kimaya hushed them and shook her head.  &quot;No, goodness no, no curses, no poisons, no hexes on their prosperity and connectivity to the world around them...  They already damaged their own flow in their mistakes, it's for nature to work out their path.&quot;<br>
<br>
With steely anger still glinting in her eyes, the guard reminded her, &quot;We ARE nature.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kimaya sighed in sad resignation, her eyes looking down again at the poor Titterpuff nestled in her hands.  She pulled her magic forward to encircle her small friend, beginning the pixie's healing process.  She spoke quietly without looking up, &quot;Not all the rangers, then, or all of anyone... vex only those who have harmed the natural world.  Remember, not all rangers hunt us.  There are those who hunt the woods, not with greed or anger, but with a heart and conscience.&quot;<br>
<br>
Though her small audience had remained hushed and somber, a tiny voice piped up, &quot;Like pitiful ol' Lonelysighs?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kimaya smiled softly, a fond sparkle in her eyes.  &quot;Yes, like Lonelysighs... the Philosopher of Pity.&quot;  Suddenly blinking, she looked around.  &quot;Now then, let's find some cookies to brighten things up, there's been far too many scowls and not enough frosting!&quot;<br>
<br>
A small flutter of fae leapt into the air to scramble for the treats, with only two pairs of wings beating slowly away.  The guards had work to do to enforce the natural laws.  But for pity's sake, they would spare the blameless. <p><p align="center">

Couple of lines in those stories were heartbreaking -- Nagafan's plea to his love, &quot;they took her wings,&quot; and others -- really something. Meanwhile I can't stop imagining these scenarios...)<br>
<br>
At night on Kerra Isle, the silence is a warm blanket. The creatures here move without sound when they want to, which they rarely do. When they do make noise it’s playful growls, and the sound of kittens wrestling in the sand. <br>
<br>
But their fur makes for good hunting. Their friends, the tigers and gorillas, make for good poaching. And the Kerrans are so far removed from the world at large, when foreigners come to their lands, it goes largely unnoticed. <br>
<br>
(I was there one night, a ranger with foolishly little use for violence thinks. I was there and saw my own people slaughtering these poor creatures, and I could do nothing to stop them.) <br>
<br>
But they come often, the foreigners. Roary has survived enough attacks to know that. He knows the poor Catfisher has a price on his tail. He knows the rest of the world sees his people as simpletons at best, savages at worst. <br>
<br>
Tonight he can here them making their way across the water. He can smell the leather of their armor and the stink of their battlefear. <br>
<br>
The silence at night is like a blanket, but the cries of the dying in the daylight is like the cacophony of Hell. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The half-elven bandit felt the blood of his victim spurt over his hand, his dagger plunged into the man’s back. He went quickly through the man’s pockets and looked back at his fellows. <br>
<br>
&quot;Anything worthwhile?&quot; asked a charlatan, an aging and hungry-looking halfling. <br>
<br>
The half-elf threw something to her. A Recondite ring. <br>
<br>
&quot;One of ours,&quot; she whispered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Irik’s. He’s the one who killed Irik,&quot; the half-elf muttered, sitting down at the water’s edge. &quot;Have you ever seen daylight, charlatan?&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at him curiously. <br>
<br>
&quot;Daylight. Have you ever left this place? Have you ever seen the sun?&quot;<br>
<br>
She shook her head. <br>
<br>
&quot;I’ve been here my whole life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So have I.&quot; <br>
<br>
A gruff voice yelled out from the darkness. More warriors from Shadow Haven. More trouble. <br>
<br>
&quot;I’d like to see the sun someday,&quot; the half-elf said. He went to wipe the blood from his hands, but realized it would always be there. There would always be blood on his hands. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The thoughts of a wisp are hard to understand. They’re not really here, you know. Not the way you or I are. <br>
<br>
That happy place people go between lives? That light at the end of the tunnel? <br>
<br>
We’ll all be will o’ the wisps someday, friends. If only for a little while. <br>
<br>
The longer you stay a wisp, they say, the more fulfilling your next life will be. Those who pass quickly between lives often meet with tragedy or boredom, and some folks believe there’s no difference in between the two. <br>
<br>
No, they’re not undead, lad. They’re just passing through. Somewhere, in a place no mortals can go, there are more lightstones than anyone can imagine. And one by one these lightstones begin to glow as a soul – maybe an elf’s, maybe a rat’s – picks up its temporary home. And off they go, to bring light to the darkest nights. If only for a little while. <br>
<br>
How unfortunate, really, that someone has put a price on soulcatchers these days… <br>

She was glad she had come to the peace and quiet of the Kedge. Here the air breathers could not fire arrows in amusement while she was sunning on a rock. The sailfins and sharks would keep her safe here under the graces of Lord Phinigel.<br>
<br>
Turning a corner, a small seahorse slammed into her, sending them both into the walls. The young thing was clearly aggitated and fearful... looking at her with pleading eyes for help. It was then that she noticed the cuts and and the coppery taste of blood in the water. The mermaid carefully picked up the injured and frightened seahorse and craddled it in her arms. She would take it the keep's healers. But how did the little thing get these cuts?<br>
<br>
Suddenly, she could sense a disturbence in the water from the direction the seahorse came.<br>
<br>
Air breathers!<br>
<br>
&quot;There's one!,&quot; shouted an invader as he clumsily tried to swim down the cooridor towards her.<br>
<br>
There was more than one and they seemed to be pushing on each other to get down the watery hallway towards her. Their swords and spears were covered with blood and the water around them shimmered with a reddish tint.<br>
<br>
She turned to swim quickly away, but there was a sudden sharp pain in her tail. &quot;Ahhhh... this one won't be going anywhere now.&quot; Holding the small seahorse close in an attempt to protect it, she struggled to move down the hallway, but it was no use. They were already upon her.<br>
<br>
It wasn't as bad an end as she thought it would be. Hopefully in their frenzy, they would miss the small seahorse. It gave her some small comfort as the world started to fade to darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Her hair... give me her hair!&quot;<br>
<br>
She would have gladly given them a lock of her hair if they had simply asked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/22/02 7:00:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (quick aside... the Kerra Isle snapshot reminded me of another... <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessage?topicID=297.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...=297.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ~ May Shiden now enjoy a happier place, with peace, quiet, and plenty of frosting )</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uenedlithien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enedlithien</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shadow-striders.com/images/wolfIcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/23/02 1:14:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cpinternet.com/~theduke/MythStuff/ez-tres.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...prey thoughts</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A harsh elven voice cried<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Elven voices are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> harsh!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
