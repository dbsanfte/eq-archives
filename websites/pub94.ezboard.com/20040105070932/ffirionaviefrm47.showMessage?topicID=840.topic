I think that it would be wrong to sit here and tell you that we are the only guild with a certain outlook because by and large, there is no way that statement would be true. However, what I can say is that the basis for the creation of this guild is the way that the founders tend to feel about the game and thus try to reflect the said feelings in a guild based on our beliefs and values about the world of Norrath and of course the world of Everquest.<br>
<br>
We do not profess to know everything about the game, in fact, we know very little as it is a huge and ever changing world. However, in our many months of trails and tribulations one thing that we have learned is that families are needed, friends must be made and comrades in arms are the most important piece of any individual character’s success and advancement. Therefore, the best way to create trust, friendship and brotherhood is through a guild, where a select number of individuals grow, learn, help and advance from one another and with one another, in other words as a whole.<br>
<br>
Although far from being the case with every guild, what we have noticed with many is an overriding confusion between the game and, for lack of a better word, politics. Many people, specifically within guilds are far too concerned about their own personal status and thus resort to playing what has become known as, politics. For us, Ablayze is based on the fact that we will try to eliminate this phenomenon by treating all, no matter what level or no matter how long they have been playing the game as equals.<br>
<br>
I myself recently was new to this world and found that when I had a question, very few people would stop and answer. I found a basic lack of respect towards individuals to be wide spread. Sure, perhaps to an experienced player being asked where one can find a certain item is annoying but if someone is asking, then the person in question does not know the answer or he would not ask. Each person deserves to be treated with respect no matter what he knows or doesn’t know. No one will ever be looked down upon or spoken to rudely simply because he or she does not know the answer to a question some might think trivial.<br>
<br>
If we all find ourselves playing Everquest it is probably because we enjoy doing so. I myself see the game as a hobby and something I really enjoy doing and refuse to be associated with anyone or anything that takes that away from me. When I look for a group I look for a group that can and will increase the enjoyment of my game play and that is exactly what Ablayze will try to do. We simply will not be associated with anyone or anything that has alternative motives. This game is meant to be played for fun and when the fine line between fun and taking things a little too serious is crossed then the overall enjoyment decreases.<br>
<br>
When I come on line and play the game, I do not wish to play as Mike Mackay but rather as the character Death Watch. Therefore, with this being said the basic premise and root of Ablayze is as a role playing guild. However, this means different things to different people. Everyone role plays to their own extent and no one should tell them what they are doing is right or wrong. Whether someone role plays all the time or whether someone role plays very little does not matter. What does matter is that for those who do enjoy role playing we promise and will have many role playing events and raids based on scenarios either established or created within the world of Everquest.<br>
<br>
To be honest, every guild starts with good intentions and most probably say the same thing, we will not play politics, we promise to be fair and just in our actions and attitudes. While most do have good intensions and do create good environments I can only promise that in our case, should our philosophy ever change and should we find ourselves going against our own values and beliefs then there would be no purpose for this guild to exist but for now, we only can promise to try and make the game we all love playing, a little more enjoyable to all our members and friends.<br>
<br>
We have also recently started a three guild alliance that raids different locations once a week, every Wednesday night, we also have several group or guild hunts on the weekends for those that cannot attend the raids for whatever reason. Most recently we have raided the Plane of Hate and Keal Drakkel, (on two occasions). Although we have over 80 active members, we are in dire need or Clerics, Rouges, Wizards and Mages.
