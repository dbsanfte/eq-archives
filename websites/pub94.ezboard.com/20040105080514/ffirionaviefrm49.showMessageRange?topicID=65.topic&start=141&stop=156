Also you ask question to which you allready know the answer.<br>
<br>
You finally got what you wanted, you where removed by force. You did your best to insult people, flame them, and mutch more, so finally someone removed you. As you promised your soulmate you wouldn't leave our guild out of free will, and didn't break your promise now.<br>
<br>
The reason that person removed you, was due the fact that once again you where flaming him and insulting that person. For him it was the &quot;drop&quot; and he gave you a choise, or you would stop your flames and insults, or you would be removed from the guild. After five minutes, first time in weeks, you wrote a huge flame in guildchat, about everyone being evil etc... Then you where removed. For the record, Eldratu had been warned a few times allready about her insulting flames to other members, first one nearly a year ago.<br>
<br>
You where banned from the boards for like 10 minutes; course, instead of waiting a few hours (there could have been problems with them, as there have been on our old boards) or logging on and asking people for an explaination, you came to the soapbox and started this rant with half the truths revealed. And offcourse due to your choise to filter out guildchat, you never noticed the new password when it was reset.<br>
<br>
I also recall, a conversation we had, when Mier asked me to come to meet you both and try to talk it all out as mature people. I also remember, that you refused to form a group at that time to talk about it, so everything had to be said out in the open, i didn't mind as we don't have anything to hide. You can be proud of yourself for one thing, for the first time in my life i was offended by the abusive and insulting attitude of yours. Last thing i remember of that conversation was you calling me a few names, then running off and camping out.<br>
<br>
Please Eldratu drop the act of not grouping with evil, as in PoD you suggested a DARK ELF chanter to join your group cause she was a good friend of yours.<br>
<br>

My world is a rich place, full of friends and good times.  Your world, well, I think its pretty obvious what your world is like from the stream of crap from your mouth.  You insult me, my friends, my family and guild, and any who disagree with you.  I tried to take the high road with you, let you vent, have your baby tantrum, whatever.  But thats it.  I will not be so moderate if we continue to have dealings in the future, that includes shouting about me or at me in PoK as you have started to do.<br>

Mhordel, you're very sweet and friendly and I like you, but you know, just stop paying attention to her. /report her for harassment, and petition her especially if she's making your experience tramatic in the game.<br>

Eldratu, please, stop. There's no point to this. FIND ANOTHER GUILD. One where you'll be happy. You've told me one or two times you were unhappy in your guild. So find a new one that you are comfortable with.<br>

Hello, my name is Spiritwind Taleweaver, Masterbard to The Tranquil, and I'm an EBIL TROLL!<br>
It's out, now. I feel so much better. Up until now I've been neutral, as Quellious demands, for the history of Norath can be written from no one side. But I was blinded by Mhordel, the evil troll, and now I have been deceived into becomming a troll. All that I once was is lost.  If only I had listened to Eldratu....She was the only one who saw the truth. There was a great conspiracy to hide the truth that she fought so hard to bring us. Out of all our members, and the entire face of Norath, only she had the right answer. How wrong we all were... It took all of our officers to tie her down and keep her quiet while they ushered in this new era of hate and destruction.<br>
How I wish I had listened. Now I'm... I'm an EVIL TROLL !!!!<br>

Except for all the successfull hunting, raiding, epics, LDoN adventures, constant addition of phenominal new members, and the fact we just smacked down Trakanon with only 12 members....

This subject is the most silliest thing i have heard of its just a freaking game ladies and gentlemen.I can understand people wanting to RP i commended them for that but come on now some of the RP take it to the extreme here.CANT EVERYBODY JUST GET ALONG!!!! GAME=FUN bottom line here.Good Evil cats and dogs living together mass hysteria.Point is game is to get away from reality and just enjoy making friends and having a good time.Thats it NUFF said.Thank you and have a nice day.<br>
