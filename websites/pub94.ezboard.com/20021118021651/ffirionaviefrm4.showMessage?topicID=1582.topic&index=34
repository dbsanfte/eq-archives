Who needs to work, anyway?<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends&quot; is the #1 rated show in the U.S.  I don't ask Jennifer Aniston her views on renewing China's Most-favored Trade status.<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming either... don't get me wrong. I've just found that FOX news (mainly papers, mind you...) has routinely glossed over important facts, critical analysis, and balanced reporting for quick jabs at pols (hate that term - I think it's a NY thing), heated rhetoric, and openly sniping at any Time-Warner holding while advancing the Murdoch agenda.<br>
<br>
Which is fine, in its own way, so long as it is in the open.<br>
<br>
What's funny about the liberal-conservative argument is that they both rally around the Constitution while insisting the other doesn't.  *shrug* The Constitution is not outdated... like horoscopes, it is written in a vague enough manner so that the same precepts can be used to argue widely differing viewpoints - a Good Thing - and has a built in mechanism for self-correction should parts ever become outdated.  Never a question as to the document's worth.<br>
<br>
Now the &quot;well ordered militia&quot; that is supposed to have the right to bear arms?  That's up for discussion.  As is how &quot;well ordered milita&quot; became &quot;the general populace,&quot; how militia groups became criminalized, and how &quot;bear arms&quot; can be taken as &quot;carrying concealed handguns with Black Rhino bullets.&quot;  But, that's an argument for another thread.<br>
<br>
In the interest of full disclosure, I vote Socialist, and I have no qualms whatsoever about leaning to the left or to the right.   Politics is a balancing act.... gotta have weight on both sides to make it work.  I believe in diplomacy over the bomb, and in the power of an informed electorate.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I meant to say this in the original post.  Bush isn't a terrorist, and I'm not willing to say he's a crappy president YET.  I will say, however, that he is one of the worst statesmen I have ever seen in my life.<br>

His comparison of the stock market plunge to a &quot;24-hour drinking binge&quot; lifted the eyebrows right off of my face.  I'd wager that his earmike linked to Daddy Bush's conference room was on the fritz for that one.

<br>
Simply put when they see something wrong it's pointed out.  Hannity and Colmes is a great show.  Both sides give their opinion and tell basically how the Democratic and Republican viewpoints are.<br>
<br>
Bill O'Reilly - love him hate him he is not a Democrat nor a hardcore Republican (his views might be the same but he is not blind)  Actually watch his show some time and see who he criticizes ... more often its the Republicans although he has a special dislike for hippiesque people who are living in the 60's.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the posters who are speaking about the problems with invading North Korea (I personally think they don't want any part of it and thats why they admitted it).  No it wouldn't just be airstrikes.  But the technology of the US Armed Services is far beyond what our closest allies have.  Britain and other nations were amazed at what we did in Afghanistan (technically not that we did it) and the enourmous leap in technology from the Gulf War til now.  Don't fool yourself into thinking that a war would be so difficult.  <br>
<br>
(In all reality this is a horrible thing as General Lee once said It is a (grand I think) thing that war is so horrible else we grow fond of it)  Not a direct quote but the general idea is there.<br>

When something is wrong with what a Democrat is proposing, with public schools, with environmental protection efforts, with social issues, Fox News will go after it like a pit bull.<br>
<br>
When something is wrong with a big business executive robbing his shareholders blind, a major religious institution embroiled in a sex abuse scandal, or the vice president refusing to turn over documents regarding how much influence businesses like Exxon had in setting US energy policy, they give it the soft touch.<br>
<br>
I would prefer to watch CNN when I get home from work, but unfortunately, all CNN has on when I do so is Larry King Live, so I end up watching either Fox or MSNBC.  Frankly, neither of these are exactly bastions of journalistic integrity.  The editorial bias of the network is clear, even in the “hard” news reporting.  Having two guys debate opposite political viewpoints is nice, but it cannot make up for the editorial slant in the day to day news coverage.<br>
<br>
I watched Fox News the night after the Israelis dropped a bomb on an apartment building in the West Bank in order to kill the leader of a Palestinian militant group.  Of course in the process they killed half a dozen innocent people, including children.  The news coverage showed the wreckage, showed the Israeli Prime Minister expressing remorse for the loss of life, then showed Palestinian protestors burning American flags.  The viewer at home was left with the impression it was an unfortunate accident that occurred as Israel went after a terrorist, and that all Palestinians are terrorists who hate Americans for no reason.<br>
<br>
What the newscast didn’t mention was why those teenagers might blame America for what happened, namely the “made in the USA” logo on the bomb, and on the plane that dropped it.  Or why Palestenians are pissed off enough to strap high explosives to themselves and blow themselves up in a shopping mall, namely being driven into refugee camps as a result two foreign powers decided to re-appropriate their land in 1949 for the creation of a new country, without their consent.  <br>
<br>
Most certainly the terrorist acts were not justified, and the news coverage should never imply that they were.  But they should at least try and explain the “why” behind the events, from both sides point of view.   And that’s where Fox, and pretty much every other major broadcast media outlet, fails, either by accident or intent.  <br>
<br>
When you ask “why” you start to raise questions that make us uncomfortable, and these days our news media is much more interested in selling advertising than in challenging Americans to learn more about their nation and the world in which we live.<br>

<br>
I may argue that the creation of the nation state of Israel was wrong ... but the people who did it worked with the Palestinians and other Muslims who were similarly remorseful for what happened to Jews during WWII.  <br>
<br>
You know thats not put in the news over there ... their leaders actually took part in it.  It wasn't a we are taking your land like you portray it.<br>
<br>
And Fox has had more about business corruption than any other network <br>

At the time Palestine was a colony of Great Britain, and had little say in the matter.  Like all properties of the British Crown at the time, there was no democratic process for the people being ruled.  Britain, suffering from enormous economic problems following World War II, was beginning to divest itself of colonies around the world, particularly troublesome ones (militants supporting the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine had run a fairly low-intensity guerilla conflict against the Brits for years).<br>
<br>
The decision to re-appropriate some of the land within the borders of Palestine for the creation of Israel was made largely by the United States and Britain, but covered under the auspices of the newly-formed United Nations.  The average Palestinian had about as much say in the process as the average Native American had in the settlement of the American West.  <br>
<br>
Since that time Israel has expanded it's borders through military acquisition and occupation of Gaza and the West Bank (though Israel was certainly within its rights to defend its citizens from foreign aggression, which is what it was doing when it acquired them).  Unfortunately hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced from their homes during these conflicts, and Israel has never allowed them to return.  Worse (at least from the view of the Palestinians), Israel now has a settlement program that aims to create new communities on this same land.<br>
<br>
The BBC has an excellent web site on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  It is well worth checking out for anyone trying to figure out the mess in the Middle East:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/world/2001/israel_and_palestinians/timeline/">news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english.../timeline/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
There is no &quot;right&quot; side on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.  Things have gotten so bad I'm not sure it can ever be solved.  But Americans (and others) who are watching it from afar should be informed that their are two sides to the story, and both have fairly compelling reasons for what they are doing.  It is not as simple as labeling one a &quot;terrorist&quot; or the other an &quot;aggressor&quot;.  And we should also understand the role that we have played, and continue to play, in fueling the conflict, and all the assorted nastiness that spins off from it around the world.<br>
