<br>
&quot;In the beginning.  The elders promised my people that they would have a sheltered home in the world.  That nature itself would protect them.  As long as the wind blows, the grass grows and the sky is blue.&quot;<br>
<br>
...a cold dry gust of wind blows more tattered trash up the alley from the empty market nearby....<br>
<br>
&quot;I was found abandoned as an infant.  In another trash heap far off from this one.  Found stuffed down into an ash filled dumpster behind the Great Library in the plane of knowledge.  Screaming and covered in blood with my cord tangled around my angry kicking arms and legs.   I suppose that by that time my people's home had already lost the wind of vitality and that the iron shod boots of orcs and the like had trampled most green growing things...for certain one never can see the blue sky any longer in the Faedark...that gift was stolen long ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So I was another abandoned orphan, plucked out of that place by a pair of rough blue skinned hands and arms that wore heavy bracers of steel instead of jewelry.  Adopted by a mother that spent most of her time silent and alone surrounded  by friends that turned into enemies.  Enemies she tried to meet with singing steel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was thirteen when my mother's friend brought me news of her death.  Poison the weapon of choice by the coward unwilling to meet her blade...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so i've watched and i've learned, survived and grown just a little bit older in this cold breathless world of cobblestone and coal blackened rooftops where the sky is never blue. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I bring into it no great thing, no great vision or philosophy.  I have no faith that gods or fate will save me.  Life is brief, cruel, brutal and cold.  Without a home of my own in this world, still screaming and angry and often covered in blood. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll steal the wind and keep it in a bag.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll rob the green from the world and set it into a gem in the pommel of my blade.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll raze the blue out of the sky and I'll poison my blade with it.&quot;  <br>
<br>

<br>
I balanced carefully along the peak of the Academy hall in the western slums.  Rain washed over wide curved roof tiles and spilled in grey and white torrents out of the mouths of stone gargoyles and other ornamentations spaced around the edge of the odd floating structures rooftop.<br>
<br>
My adoptive mother's henchman &quot;Needle&quot; straddled the steep peak of the roof top behind me.  A stout length of rope running from the pair of metal hooks that he now called his hands to where it was fastened around my narrow waist.<br>
<br>
Mother had tasked Needle with teaching me something useful about the way things worked in the world and &quot;teaching me things to help me survive&quot;.    Needle himself was a survivor.  He'd lost both his hands to the axe and block of the Knights of Truth when a burglary he'd been engaged in against an enchantress had gone wrong.  Mother used to tell me that he used to be one of the best thievies anyone could hope to meet before a love affair had, in her words, made him go soft.  I guessed that the twisted coils of sharpened metal he used for hands were a reminder not to make the same mistake twice.  He certainly was never soft to me.<br>
<br>
I was half way across the rooftop when I felt a strong tug on the rope which nearly unseated my balance from the dizzy height.  I looked over my shoulder to where Needle sat straddling the peak of the roof and wrapped in his usual unwashed burlap cloak.  We both had the general appearance of a couple of half drowned beggers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oi....so what if things go wrong fer ya Riddle me girl...here yer half way to home on this...dangerous job and something changes to make things difficult..maybe impossible...maybe on of yer mates turns on ya..&quot;<br>
<br>
Another tug on the rope, this time it was hard enough to almost pull me off my feet completely.  I weight maybe what..ninety pounds soaking wet...which I was...Needle had me be three times the years, muscle mass and weight.  A third tug of the rope while I was still regaining my balance made me hit the heavy slate shingle hard with my hip.  I dug my small fingers into a nitch in the roofwork and braced.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer gonna learn..or yer gonna fall off and break that pretty little neck of yers girlie girl.&quot;<br>
<br>
I glanced over at Needle and he let out a hoot loud enough for the watch to hear if anyone was paying attention.  Was he really trying to kill me?  Was he trying to get us both killed?<br>
<br>
Needle snarled and put some back into this next tug.  I had to strain every muscle and grip the hold on the sharp tiles until they cut my fingers and made them bleed.  The soot filled water washed over them making the blood vanish off the rooftop.  I didn't know if I could hang on through another series of hard pulls like that.<br>
<br>
Needle ducked the boot dagger I hurled at his face risking one hand loose to try and give him something to think about..or maybe to hurt him.  I wanted to hurt him then.  While he ducked my belt dagger came out and sliced through the wet rope like it was nothing.  It was a magic blade with a dull blue metal that my mother had given me to wear when i was seven.  Something she'd brought back from one of her long absences.<br>
<br>
I gripped the tiles and crouched blade ready but Needle was already coiling up the rope and chuckling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lesson learned then girlie girl.  Now see if ya can get yer way across to that other side of this peak without a rope to hold ye safe and get down on yer own as well...I'll be at me usual tavern having a drink..mind yer quick now the watch will be lookin out after all that noise ye made.&quot;<br>
<br>
And just that quickly he was over the side of the building and gone.  I was eleven and alone in a high wind and rain on the top of the Academy of Arcane Sciences, bleeding fingers, dagger in hand and looking like a drowned rat.  I crouched and stopped for a moment, just a moment to catch my breathe and realize that Needle had actually gifted me with something.  I was happy for the first time that I could remember. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varadox>Varadox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/02 10:45:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> OOC</span><hr size=1> Good story!<br>

Settled into the most squallid corner of the Freeport slums it's barely more than an aged canvas tent covering supported by a dozen or so thick wooden beams.<br>
<br>
A dozen heavy wooden tables and perhaps four times that number of chairs are arrayed before a mud spattered bar with an open air grill off to one side.<br>
<br>
Settled at the entrance to the market area of the slums the Flea is a favored haunt for a collection of changing faces, wandering bards, the usual table of surly dark elves passing around drinks while their collection of undead servants insures that the flea never suffers a shortage of fat, bloated, creeping, buzzing flys.<br>
<br>
Fox was in her usual seat at the bar before opening, taking advantage of the first food to hit the grill, avoiding the inevitable collection of late risers that filled the slum markets when the sun was more fully awake.<br>
<br>
Murgen, a barbarian born with a twisted leg and an even more broken and twisted arm served as the Flea's seeming owner and operator.  He shuffled over with a tin plate of steaming roasted vegetables and...a meat something that still had bits of...fur..attached.  Fox flicked the meat to the side of her plate and worked at the more edible bits.  She pushed a small collection of loot over to Murgen who served both as chef and as fence for the local slums. She waved off the flys from her food.<br>
<br>
While Murgen pawed through her latest finds and slowly set a growing pile of silver and a few gold onto the counter of the bar, Fox watched the market go through its usual yawning, stretching, getting ready for a new day routing.  Of course this signaled the end of Fox's day and she contemplated the warm if somewhat moldly smelling corner she'd staked out to curl up into later.  Well away from people and creatures.  A lost corner of the slums that even the rats had forgotten about.<br>
<br>
She spent days now, occasionally weeks at a stretch without speaking a word.  She had no illusion of friendships.  Night passed after night.  She staggered the evenings she worked to make it more difficult for the watch to pin her down.  She changed her targets and her routine so the Captain couldn't pin her activities on just one person and encourage him to press for a more aggressive hunt.<br>
<br>
Of course she could plot a more lucrative job.  Maybe go after one of the homes in the wealthy districts of the city but that would cause a stir.  While it meant more profits and a better life to be sure it also meant leaving the city and moving to another area at least for a good long while.  Muggings and petty larsons, muddy back alley murders and the like didn't turn much when it came to real loot.  But it was something she knew.  It was a life she understood.<br>
<br>
She flexed her small fingers and traced little circles in the water gathered on the surface of the bar in front of herself pondering the world and her place in it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Needle was dead.<br>
<br>
His corpse sat across the muddy alleyway from her with his legs sprawled out before him and his body twisted in the death grip of rigormortis that betrayed that he'd been dead longer than several hours but less than a few days.<br>
<br>
Enormous black flys from the slum's market crawled in and out of his gaping mouth, fixed in a scream.  His blood had boiled out of his eyes, ears and nose in a great gout before he'd finally died.  Drying thick and sticky over his frigid corpse.<br>
<br>
Magic had killed him.<br>
<br>
Fox knew the type.  Tears ran down out of her eyes vanishing in the rain and her shoulders shook a little but she didn't make any sound beyond that.  <br>
<br>
Needle's death marked a milestone in her own limited existence.  The little wood elf shifted over next to Needle and avoided his stare which seemed to glare at her as she carefully rifled his belongings.<br>
<br>
Needle's hooked hands were missing.  The replacements taken.  But his belt pouch, the coin he'd been carrying and a tarnished old engagement ring he wore on a string around his neck were still with him.<br>
<br>
Fox chewed a length of her dark red hair in thought as she pocketed those items.  Not a robbery then.  Someone had come for Needle specifically.  Someone who had taken Needle's hooks as a trophy.  A reminder of their victory.  That was something to file away in her memory for later.<br>
<br>
Fox sat back on her haunches for a moment longer pondering what to do next.  Needle was simply too heavy for her to move easily alone.  If she was found dragging his corpse out of the muddy alleyway the watch would just as quickly blame her for the deed than look for another.<br>
<br>
Fox flipped out her dagger and snicked off a length of Needle's gray'd hair.  Then she stood and looked down at her dead teacher and mentor in the rain.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are worse things than dying Needle. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goodbye.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned on her heel and her small body was quickly lost in the mazelike alleyways of the slums. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=foxmane@firionavie>Foxmane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/02 7:20:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A new teacher...</span><hr size=1> Fox slipped through the market stalls of the Freeport slum balancing from one wooden slat to another.  Walking wood slat to wooden slat was just about the only reliable way to keep from stepping into grey soggy clay up to your hip in the slums.<br>
<br>
Her adopted mother was coming to visit today.  It was likely at any rate.  Her absent guardian parent, if that was indeed what she could be called, never seemed to forget Fox's birthday.  The one day each year that marked the day that Fox had been lifted bloody and screaming as an abandoned infant out of a rubbish pile.<br>
<br>
Fox stopped on a narrow wooden four by four slat and stared at the bar of the Flea.  In her usual chair sat a Tier Dal acquintance of her mothers.  A hard looking thief himself that went under the name of Cinnistyr.  The master thief was a part of a circle of friends that mother rarely spoke of.  Some dark business she was engaged in in the world beyond Fox.  Beyond what she called home and family.  Cinnistyr stood almost immediately.  It was clear that he'd been waiting there for Fox.  Her mind raced for a moment.  Should she run?  Mother's friends had a habit of turning up dead or turning up looking for blood one or the other.<br>
<br>
Something about the way the fellow carried himself told Fox that running would not do her much good.  She closed her hand over a rusty thrusting blade carried under her cloak.  She would not run.  She would close the distance and see what he had to say and if something bad happened she'd have one chance to bury that rusty dagger into his throat.<br>
<br>
Fox balanced over to where Cinnistyr waited for her.  Stood at his feet looking up at him through her usual tangle of thick curly red hair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your really not much to look at.&quot; <br>
<br>
Cinnistyr's way of saying an introduction.<br>
<br>
Fox shrugged.  She didn't pretend to be pretty.  Not here, not in the slums where it was a liability more than a gift.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mother is dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox stared through Cinnistyr.  His further words lost in a distant muffle pushed down and away by the weight of grief, terrible grief that dropped through Fox's belly like a heavy stone.  She imagined she saw her own heart and soul drop out of her body and down into the rotten grey soaked clay beneath her feet.<br>
<br>
She was vaguely aware of more words and an odd pat on the shoulders from the Tier Dal.  Being led out of the muck and the rain and throught the streets of the slums up into the more cobbled stone walks of the western city.   Pushed into a dry bed by rough cold hands and a presence that watched her while she stared at the ceiling.<br>
<br>
The world moved on without regard for the grief of a nobody over the death of one of a thousand shadows.  The room grew dark and lighter and darker again.  It wasn't until some undisclosed time had passed that Fox gathered back to herself.  Her sightless eyes could see and sounds returned to her ears.<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr sat in a high backed wooden chair before a fire that cast shadows throughout the room.  She watched him and saw that he mused with a noble and furrowed brow.  He became aware of her.  Of her return to the painful world of loss.  The world of Freeport at night.  Her world.<br>
<br>
&quot;She asked me to give you some things.  She asked me to watch out for you as she had.  I've never understood your mother fully.  But.  It was her last request.  So I will see what I can do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr gestured at a shadow'd pile heaped near the fireplace.  There in the glow of the flickering flames gleamed her mother's armor.  Also her mother's sword which was named Gal'drasil and which had a reputation for howling and calling for blood in the presence of Gnolls and Orcs and things.  They were her mother's only true belongings.  It was a clear sign that she was indeed gone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/20/02 1:55:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A new teacher...</span><hr size=1> OOC: I like this character.

There were at least a dozen holes in the tarp and the general atmosphere of rotten, cold, soaking, miserable weather was comfortable enough for the Tier Dal to help keep his mood improved.<br>
<br>
The tavern hostler named Murgen limped around behind the bar and worked to get set up for the coming day's business.  Cinnistyr enjoyed the entertainment of watching a crippled barbarian slide around in the mud doing menial chores for a moment before he felt a familiar poke at his shoulder.<br>
<br>
Fox had just slipped onto the stool next to his.  She was very small.  A white streak ran through her red hair and her sparkling black eyes and small build made the name of Foxmane very fitting for her.   Fox pulled back the hood of her waterproof lizard scale cloak and gestured at a pair of bags at Cinnistyr's feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't it a little early to be handing out Yule gifts to the children of the slums Cinnistyr?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr grunted.  He lifted one of the heavy bags and sat it onto the counter with the jangle of metal coins.  Fox's eyes grew a notch bigger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go ahead and open it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox carefully checked the bag for traps.  She wasn't stupid after all.  Then slowly lifted the opening and peered at the jumbled pile of copper and silver, gold and even some platnum inside.<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr dropped the other bag onto the bar counter and dumped it's contents out with a thud.  An enormous red bearded head rolled on the counter for a moment before coming to rest.  It was very large.  Too large to be the head of an ogre or troll.<br>
<br>
&quot;The loot came off of one of these Hill Giants.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr turned the head so Fox could get a better look at it.<br>
<br>
&quot;They seem to be congregated around a particular stone tower in the mountains of rathe far from here.  It seems they travel to that one hill from great distances carrying with them enough coin to suggest that they are either there to make some sort of an offering, or to purchase supplys or some other important activity.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox drummed her fingertips on the bar counter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aren't giants rather dangerous?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr nodded.  &quot;Xas.  Indeed.  It takes an entire group of mercenarys to pull one or two down.  And a nice haul it is too...except.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Except if they are bringing treasure to the hill to buy something then whoever they are buying from has a much much bigger collection of their wealth than any single giant.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr and Foxmane looked at each other for a long time as Murgen skulked and the rain showered down on the empty streets of the slums. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can be ready in an hour to leave.&quot;  Fox got up and pulled up the hood of her cloak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright..make it thirty minutes and I'll meet you at the west gate of the city.&quot;<br>
<br>
Life had a funny way of changing course suddenly Fox thought as she hopped from one wooden slat to the other through the market and up the rickety wooden steps to her hidden nook.<br>
<br>
Just when you think things are settled down something else happens to change...well..everything.  Fox wondered what sort of change this would be.  For the better or for the worse.  She rifled through her few belongings picking the important ones to bring with.  Hiding the remainder behind a few loose bricks in the wall of the ruined tenement flat.<br>
<br>
The young girl looked around the lonely broken down room that had been her home for six years of her life once from the hole in the wall that served as entrance and ran off into the rain to meet Cinnistyr.<br>
<br>

<br>
Instead of walking now and eating road dust Fox was swinging her legs back and forth off the back of one of a half dozen wagons.  The merchant was Tier Dal like Cinnistyr but the guards were all hired muscle out of the Freeport Militia.  The sidelong looks she'd earned being the only female in the party, and small had not gone unnoticed by her.  She would have to be cautious.<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr was snoring in the back of the wagon sleeping soundly on some expensive rugs tossed over sacks of spices and herbs or some such exotic commodity.  The wagon was one of the large enclosed types that required a team of four animals to pull.  Cinnistyr seemed to hold with the well known preference for sleeping days and being active nights of his race.<br>
<br>
Suddenly there was a cracking sound from one of the wagons ahead in the caravan and everyone slowed to a stop.  Fox could hear the curses of a teamster and several of the militia men came forward to lend a hand.  Fox craned her neck around the side of the wagon to see what had happened.<br>
<br>
The cart in front of her own had broken a piece of it's wooden wheel.  It would need replacing.  A tedious job that would require a lot of muscle and labor from the teamsters.  Fox hopped off the back of the wagon and walked around in the tall grass along the side of the rutted path they were traveling.<br>
<br>
The sun was slowly traveling down the sky towards the west and the shadows from the tall trees in this dim part of the forest seemed to stretch on a bit longer.  Cinnistyr's snores continued to rise and fall from the back of her own wagon.<br>
<br>
One of the militia road up next to her and gestured with an armored hand towards the surrounding forests.<br>
<br>
&quot;Best hope they get that their wheel fixed quick miss...this part o the road is the old part a Kithicor Forest....and I've heard plenty a stories that it's no good place ta be after the sun leaves the sky.&quot;<br>
<br>
He spat a foul black tar into the tall weeds along the road.  Some substance many of the militia seemed to chew on non stop.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats wrong?  Bandits?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, worse than that.&quot;  He leaned in closer and glanced around to make sure nobody else was listening.  &quot;It's they...undead...&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox raised a thin red eyebrow.  She'd seen undead before of course in the city.  In the slums following around the Tier Dal to be specific.  Freeport had laws against the use of necromancy but only in certain quarters of the town and the slums had no such restrictions.  Of course she'd never before encountered any roaming undead.  Nothing that was not under the strict control of sorcery.<br>
<br>
Fox drummed her fingertips on her rapier.  She went and retrieved her bow off of the wagon and climbed a nearby tree.  One without limbs close to the ground.  She watched as the teamsters and some of the militia grunted and groaned unloading the goods from the broken wagon so that it might be fixed.  If they meant to have the wagon repaired, reloaded and everyone underway before late in the afternoon it was going to be a close thing.<br>

She's the finest apprentice I have ever had, and learns her lessons quickly. <br>
<br>
She is deadly accurate with her dagger, and if she gets behind you, be prepared for a world of pain. <br>

I am very pleased with her training. <br>

Four hours up in a tree had given her aches and pains in her legs and arms, shoulder and neck.<br>
<br>
The wagons had been moving again for about two hours.  The forest showed no real signs of ending although their slow progress upwards, ever upwards had brought with it a colder cut in the chill of the air and a roaring noise of wind moving through the tops of the trees that heralded mountains and mountain passages not many miles ahead.<br>
<br>
&quot;Won't be long now.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Tier Dal merchant spoke to her for the first time since she had joined the caravan with Cinnistyr three days previously.  He kicked his horse, a beautiful black steed, so that it strode next to Fox, nearly on top of her.  He sneered down his slender nose at her as if merely looking at her face gave him the sudden impulse to retch himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wear this.  I've seen to it that your master has one as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was a simple black medallion on a silver chain.<br>
<br>
Sorcery.<br>
<br>
The image of Needle's gaping screaming frozen visage from the alleyways seered through Fox's mind in warning.  Still the Tier Dal was only offering this because he thought she was a slave of Cinnistyrs.  It was slightly less likely that it was meant to kill either of them outright.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wear it and live or throw it away and die.  Your choice slave...but decide quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Tier Dal merchant kicked his horse forward and road past the front of the column and up the road.  Scouting ahead?  Fox drummed small fingers on the pommel of her rapier again.<br>
<br>
Six large wagons, their teams, teamsters and ferriers and a dozen human guards creaked and jangled up the cart path, winding ever higher as dusk settled firmly over the Kithicor Forest.  Both men and beasts showed signs of worry.  Snorting and shying away from the forest and pressing themselves towards the center of the cartpath as much as possible.<br>
<br>
As darkness crept over the land it seemed to Fox that the Kithicor Forest slowly devoured itself through a slow rising grey mist that soon clutched every piece of the woodland in a cold murky grasp.<br>
<br>
The caravan rumbled onward until a cry was raised from the front of the column and the milita guardsmen rallied together at the front of the wagons.  One of the guardsmen had seen something staggering in the fog in the path of the wagons.  Fox climbed onto the top of the front wagon and stood on tiptoes peering over the gathering of soldiers on horse but saw nothing.<br>
<br>
It was possible the guardsmen were simply scaring themselves witless from the ghost stories they had been trading back and forth ever since setting foot into the forest.<br>

The sound had a dry husk quality, parched and cracked like a groan forced out over vocal chords that had not tasted the sweet relief of water for an age.<br>
<br>
Things.  Began to move.<br>
<br>
Fox's tall pointed ears twitched as they caught the sound in the grasses and over twigs.  Here there, all around the caravan.<br>
<br>
Swords were drawn and the sergeant leading the militia bellowed.  &quot;Ready!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox tried to focus on the noises closest to her.  Paused for a second and then slipped the black medallion the absent merchant had handed to her over her neck.  She hoped CInnistyr had his on as well and that he wouldn't sleep through a combat.<br>
<br>
Her small tan hand reached back over her shoulder an snatched the feathers and nock of an arrow pulling it back on the heavy silk of her bow.  The bow string creaked as she drew the arrow back and focused on the evident stumbling sounds coming out of the forest towards her..<br>
<br>
It was human once.  Grey or ash white skin and a black mouth filled with broken and cracked teeth.  A maw that gaped impossibly wide as the thing snarled at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fil'in'inthwi!&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox sang the rune marked on her mother's bow.  White blue flame shot along the shaft of the arrow and flared the brighter when the shaft was loose.  It was as if a star had been born in the darkness of that wooded hollow and burned white hot and brilliant as it struck home into the open mouth of the ghoul.<br>
<br>
Everywhere the creatures appeared.  Everywhere the party of the caravan was engaged.  Undead were broken assunder with axe and sword and staff and spear, their limbs hewn and their head removed to lay twitching on the black stained grass.<br>
<br>
But the number and power of the undead waxed with the deepening of the night with every passing moment and the valiant and then desperate militia and caravan workers were drawn down under a sea of fangs and claws and ancient corruption.<br>
<br>
Cinnistyr burst forth out of his wagon two blades gleaming in the darkness to match the glow of his Tier Dal eyes.  He forced his way through a crowd of undead trying to gorge themselves on two militia hacking and thrusting like an angry god.<br>
<br>
Somehow.  The fury of his constant assault brought him to where Fox stood at the edge of the caravan gripping her last arrow to her mother's bow.  A sea of undead slowly shuffled around them.  Yet they did not attack in force.  Cinnistyr cut the hands and heads off of those that were enthusiastic enough to try and snatch at them.<br>
<br>
&quot;ENOUGH!  BACK!&quot;<br>
<br>
The command was in Tier Dal.  A language that Fox knew well.  The undead snarled but obeyed.  Fox and Cinnistyr craned their necks to find the captain of these monsters seated on his black steed somewhat transformed in the darkness of the forest.<br>
<br>
The Tier Dal merchant, a merchant no longer it seemed except in the trade of death and decay.  His own flesh shrivled off of his body and bare bones evident in the joints of his too thinly filled clothing.  A white skull glared out from his well adorned cap and two red burnings eyes floated in it's sockets. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=645.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=645.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=645.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=645.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=645.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=645.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
