This is if i'm understanding what its supposed to do correctly. <br>
<br>
   Of course the agony of having to wait for 2 zoning times might be too much for those people to take and would still bug you cause they'd only have to zone once that way. They might take a while to realize that going directly to a city itself might be faster than running from the spires/ring but i won't say anything if you don't &lt;winks&gt;<br>

<br>
Not knowing that the person you ask cannot sow you is excusable in some cases, especially on FV where most people are /role, if somewhat stupid. <br>
<br>
Being rude about it is inexcusable - even if they are a SoWing class.<br>
<br>
I found this nice spell the other day called &quot;Scale of the Wolf&quot;. I don't have it yet so I have had no chance to test this but the description is that it works like a SoW but - like invis - it drops if you begin combat or casting. If someone wanted to be rude about demanding a SoW I think this would be a very nice substitute, especially if they were going off to pull <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaillougna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 653<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 10:56:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1584.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Absolutely</span><hr size=1> I can give wolfie fast feets but -hate- being begged for it.  If I am in the Nexus or at the spires or any other -waiting- type thing, if I am not doing AFKish things, I will often SoW anyone who looks like they might be able to use it, i.e. those in dresses or dual wielding non-wood elves or someone with a dagger in the primary hand, except waiting to go down to Velious, when I know I will need my mana on landing.  Sometimes I will get buffs in return, but I don't expect them.  If I just happen to be near someone who is shouting for a SoW, and I am not in a mana conservation mode and in a good mood, I will also cast it.  BUT if someone is rude or obnoxious in their asking (err demanding) or is of an evil race, class, or guild (though on occassion I have been known to bend the race/class/guild thing... shhhh), then I am not going to use my mana.  If someone demands I use the last of my mana to give them anything... well... they ain't getting squat.<br>
<br>
This is not me being selfish, this is me being me and knowing I have other things to be aware of other than random_rude_stranger0.  <br>
<br>
For those who -demand- ports... they are the rude ones, not the druid/wizzie who chooses not to provide them with the service.<br>
<br>
Even before PoP, it is easy to get around... it just takes time.  Heck, even without Luclin, a friend of mine traveled from Felwithe to Warrens and all over... it jsut took time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 447<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 11:06:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1584.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Absolutely</span><hr size=1> I've been asked for SoW and Clarity.

Yeah. And Clerics shouldn't heal people unless they cast KEI on them first. Does that make sense?

Having played the two most debated classes as to &quot;giving&quot; to others cleric and druid to the high end, I can easily say that druids are given more crap than clerics about &quot;doing&quot; things for people. Simply put, porting is a pain in the ass, UNLESS your doing it for a reason such as plat (never did myself), KEI (wasn't around when I played my druid), or helping someone with a CR (quite often). I never decided to play a druid so I could port others, and if you've ever seen me play, the likely hood of me quadding anything but moss snakes is pretty low, I played a druid because 1-the books said they were easy to play, and I was a noob 2-I liked porting MYSELF. I hate running places. If you want to be ported, play a porter. End of story. No class should ever feel obligated to do something for someone else. A player should feel some obligation to help a brother/sister out, with say maybe a SoW or such, and if your really just hanging out, maybe a quick port in a CR or such. But a port just cause someone wants to get to East Commons and isn't willing to run (as I have many times) from NK spires, and spends 20 minutes looking for a port when they could have already run there is ludicrous. I too believe in helping those who help themselves first. Maybe this is one reason why I like Iksar players so much, no porters, only shaman can SoW, they HAVE to do on their own...esp when the old alingment rules were enforced. Just my own biased opinion however.<br>
<br>
2-I was mistaken for a bard so many times at the NK Spires I started carrying a fishing pole around as disguise. This now made them think I was a chanter for some reason........<br>
Now however I get asked for ports all the time. With my Crystal chitin shield and hammer in my hands and the Purple &quot;I'm a CLERIC&quot; Pants on. not sure if they think I'm a druid or a wizard. However I can in no way compare to Xethux, my guilds 53rd level Iksar monk.........<br>
<br>
3-Who has found a very chic green robe to wear, and while walking around with his Staff of Shielding gets asked for ports about thrice a day. He has to tell these poor souls that he is a Swiftail and can only gate himself to Thurgadin, or back to Cabilis. (nice potions those). He has also been haranged by people who basicly tell him that if he doesn't want to port them just say so. If someone can find a Iksar who can port, please tell us so that we may direct all these E-Bayers to them. Just send a tell to Xethux or Jhary, or type /who all prop (easiest way to access our guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) and let one of the other 50 monks in the guild know who this mighty Iksar is.<br>
