Not sure what they meant but it did get me to thinking...<br>
<br>
I think it would have been cool for the designers to put level barriers in place on the road to 60 (50 pre-Kunark). The way it is now, people can just grind their way merrily along to whatever level they feel is good without taking the time to actually interact with the game world.<br>
<br>
I think it would have been fun to have planned it so that when you reach level 10, you gain no more experience until you fufill a certain quest. For low levels this could be pretty easy like killing your first Leatherfoot and turning in his cap for DEF's or killing your first Sarnak for Iksars etc. Fufilling this quest would get you a low level item plus allow you to gain experience to 20 or some other higher level. They could put these quests every 10 levels or something and make them progressively harder but upon completing, you would get better, class specific items and be allowed to progress into the next level bracket.<br>
<br>
I think a lot could have been done with this idea. VI has been looking at ways to slow XP gain and &quot;grinding&quot; and this would be a good way to do it (EQ2) plus would require that people interact more with the world and do more questing. There would be problems of course - making the quest items so that everyone could find them and no bottlenecks like Ragefire, making it so that you wouldn't require an uberguild to get your high levels (maybe a group encounter would be required, but nothing on the scale of needing 50 60+ people to get items) etc. I know this is just daydreaming and hindsight is alwys 20/20 but I think it is a cool idea that I haven't heard proposed before.<br>

<br>
Er, what I mean is, I like how EQ allows you the choice of playing however you want. Wanna get 60? Then grind your way up. Wanna just use it as a big interactive chatroom? Then don't fight monsters. Wanna concentrate on trade skills? Knock yourself out. (And get a sponsor...)<br>
<br>
If they put a limit on leveling like that, it would just take away from the sense of being able to do anything and go anywhere in the world. Besides, what RP sense does that make? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umylodifv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MylodiFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/10/02 12:42:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2882.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In reply</span><hr size=1> Having to complete a quest in order to gain the next level would be really cool. <br>

Imagine having to go all the way back to your newbie location and talk to so and so, who gives you an item to take to so and so halfway across the world. When you talk to him, he summons a dragon which you and your group have to kill. Get the dragonscale off the dragon and give it to your guild leader and *poof* Level 61 is yours. <br>

Say, for instance that you were trying to master 1hs - instead of just getting 5 points every level until you maxed the skill, you would stay at apprentice level until you completed a quest. Once that quest was finished, you would move to journeyman and be allowed to train up to 100 etc..<br>
<br>
For RP, how's this:<br>
(You had been practicing archery for days - sighting down the range, finding the calm within, zeroing in on the red bullseye of the target then releasing in one smooth motion. When you began, many times the arrows would fly wide of the target into the hay, making soft swishes as they penetrated the bales. Lately though, you had gotten better..much better. Now you could almost always place the arrow in or near to the red center of each target. With pride you approached the arcery master of your city, Kharstin and said, &quot;I'm ready for my testing, teacher&quot;. Peering at you with a squinted eye and pretending to weigh your abilities with a grin Kharstin spoke, &quot;Aye, I think you are ready. But there is a big difference between hitting a bullseye and hitting a living target. You must go out into the world and train. When you feel you are good enough, you must enter the nearby Gnoll stronghold of Blackburrow. Inside you will encounter many creatures, but the one you are looking for will be a Gnoll Archer. Use all of your skills and cunning to track and kill one of these creatures and bring us his bow. Then you can consider yourself an archer.&quot;<br>
Go kill Gnoll and bring back Bow<br>
&quot;Kharstin looks upon the Gnoll bow with pride. &quot;You've done well. Now you are a Journeyman Archer. There is nothing more I can teach you, you must search out the Master of Archery in the nearby city of Quenos. Give him this medalion and he will continue your training.&quot;<br>
You have gained skill: Archery (51)<br>
You have gained an item: Journeyman Archer's Medalion<br>
You gain Experience!)<br>
<br>
This has a basis in the guild and apprentice system of old Germany. It would work just as well with trade skills - making significant works to advance in levels. Perhaps for higher level weapons abilities you would need to know a little blacksmithing to forge a weapon etc.<br>
<br>
This will make high level skills more of a prize like Grandmaster Trophies. Right now, if you went around saying with pride &quot;Hey, I have maxed my 1hs&quot;, hundreds of people would say &quot;So what, so have I&quot;. This would give these abilities a chance to mean something other than little numbers after a skill.<br>
<br>
One of the many problems with EQ right now is it's so easy to obtain levels and skills, a dedicated player can spend a month going from 1-50, another going from 50-60 then the high end game is filled with mostly hack and slash encounters with just a little strategy thrown in. All you have to do is execute properly and the loot pours in. At that point, who cares what skills your character has built. I tend to call those skills part of the character's personality and I think it would be nice if more weight was given to them in the EQ world.<br>

<br>
Most of the people you see grinding to get up in levels fast are veterans that have been there and done that.<br>
<br>
I know my first character took over a year to get to 50 pre kunark.  Actually I was only 36 when kunark came out... Made 50 right when velious came out.  I spent alot of time learning the world with that character, he was a druid so I had plenty of freedom of movement.  I did alot of quests and spent alot of time going back to rivervale to help the young halflings there with my strong buffs.<br>
<br>
I came to firiona vie as a seasoned adventurer.  The only real quest I have done was the newbie armor quest.  I felt the reward was nice, not the stats but the look.  Being level 10 in full plate is something you could only dream about in the old days.<br>
<br>
But it is a big waste of time.  I spent a week at lvl 10 getting all my armor pieces, I could have been level 20-25 in the time it took to do that quest for negligable equipment.  By that time I would have easily picked up enough coin to be in bronze or fine plate.<br>
<br>
Most people on their first character are still going to level slowly.  They don't know the best zones to hunt, how to get places, sometimes it takes hours to find food and water in unfamiliar zones.<br>
<br>
But later on you would not want to waste time on these simple quests, on your later characters its more about getting to the endgame with a different set of skills and goals.  There will be plenty of raids where you can sit around and not get any xp or loot, to make up for all the time you dont waste redoing tedious quests.  <br>
