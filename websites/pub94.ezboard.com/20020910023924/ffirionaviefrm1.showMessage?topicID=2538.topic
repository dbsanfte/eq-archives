<br>
I like my ranger. I've invested a lot in Lest. But I don't play all that much or aggressively, so I don't have the time to dig into another character. Doesn't stop me from coming up with a lot of ideas I wish I had the time to use: <br>
<br>
The Erudite Paladin, who was once an up and coming wizard. He strove for too much too fast, and destroyed his ability to work with magic. Priests of Quellious talked him from suicidal leanings afterwards, and he picked up the sword to become a paladin. <br>
<br>
The Enchanter-thief. Race unknown. Wanted by the law in virtually every town in Norrath, this treasurer hunter never wears his real face, and dresses in &quot;leather&quot; to disguise the fact that he's a caster. <br>
<br>
The wandering Vah Shir shaman. As soon as the portals were reopened between the moon and Norrath, he began a journey to learn as much about this strange new world, and his peoples' place in it, that he could. <br>
<br>
Just a couple of my favorites that I wish I had the time to play. <br>
<br>
Anybody else harboring some Neverborns? Just curious... <br>

My problem is that when I DO get a new character concept, I reroll.  My highest level character has been 23, I rarely keep characters over 3 days time (not /played), and I've been playing here since October.<br>
<br>
Among my favorites:<br>
<br>
The Teir'dal that is disillusioned with Innoruuk and doubts his Shadowknight power, but is proud of his race and wishes to defend them above all else.<br>
<br>
The Fier'dal druid that grew up on Sister Isle, who wanted to become a warrior but instead dedicated his life to Tunare in order that he may help all individuals live happier lives.<br>
<br>
The Ogre Shadowknight, free from the curse before the curse was lifted (Luclin), who wandered the land by order of his step-father Kizrak the Tyrant in order to 'preach the word' of Rallos Zek ('The Word' being his pet name for his axe)<br>
<br>
The Half-Elf Warrior, whose father was a criminal and murdered along with his mother by the Qeynos Guards.  He was rescued by a beggar of the Unseen Circle and brought up to serve Bertoxxulous, scarred and twisted, he had no sense of compassion.<br>
<br>
The Gnome Necromancer, whose love was torn apart by water wheel in Ak'anon such that a rez could not be performed, he sought out the followers of Bertox so that he could return his love's soul from the halls of the dead and transfer it into a clockwork body.<br>
<br>
The Iksar Beastlord, a bandit outcast by birth, who fell into his training after his monk master was murdered and a cruel beastlord traitor to the group enslaved him.  The patriarchs rebirthed him as a tailor, earning him the surname Spidersilk, but an argument with his owner resulted in the owners death and his escape into the wilds.  Fighting a scorpion off a scaled wolf defending her pups, that wolf became his warder and he trained himself in the path of the beastlord.<br>
<br>
Ahh...there are SO many more...very few of my characters don't have at least a spark of life to them.  Sad really, that none of their stories will ever be finished. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucpete2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>c pete2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 357<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/14/02 1:40:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2538.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: remembered another</span><hr size=1> Dear People who spoke out against multiple characters, I hate you.<br>

Well I had a was-born, and then I deleted her, for some reason, but now I think I might revive her.  Human female monk, grew up in Innothule Swamp with no recollection of any other life than just attacking frogloks and mushroom men and running from troll guards.  When introduced to &quot;polite&quot; society ( not that Freeport is any sort of a civilized city!, ) she makes a mess at the monk guild by killing one of the other students, unfamiliar with her own strength.  She is sent out into the world to learn to harness and control her power.  She was fun to play, too, she would bite and scratch and gouge at the eyes, spit tobacco juice, and talk in a deep Southern drawl.  But I always needed her to be dressed in overalls, and VI didn't code those for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaillougna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/15/02 1:27:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2538.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: remembered another</span><hr size=1> I have a partial born...

<br>
The halfborn:<br>
Half-elf bard, born in Qeynos but trained in Freeport.  Born of loving parents who are tradespeople, still living, still loving their daughter and encouraging her to seek her own paths.  A voice lovely and loving music and her goddess, Erollosi (I can't ever spell it) Marr.  Her auntie is a bard who lives in Freeport and gave her a place to stay while she trained and also encourages her in her craft, but doesn't lead her or push her, jsut lets her find her own way.<br>

I wanted to have an outlet to play with music and even do some in character busking (not begging, actual busking, singing songs in public places with a hat on the ground for donations).  I also wanted a mostly uncomplicated light-hearted character, but... well... <br>
