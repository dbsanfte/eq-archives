<br>
Yep 47th Blade and I still solo for fun once in a while.<br>
<br>
Depends on your definition of &quot;can't solo&quot; You do have more down time with soloing. I am very patient so this doesn't bother me. On the other hand you don't share XP so each kill moves the blue.<br>
<br>
I don't recomnd soloing but heck I don't recomend XP grinding either, both are kinda silly to me.<br>
<br>
Three things:<br>
1) mob<br>
2) equipment<br>
3) location<br>
<br>
1) Know your mob's, you can figt certain ones a lot easier than others. Casters are a pain so unless you want to carry around a lot of extra resist stuff stay away from the powerfull ones. Fight the blue ones that you can beat with lots of down time for healing. Fight teal ones as fast as you can bind wound up to 50% and tear into the next one. Try not to fight more than one, even greens will slap you around because it is much harder to dodge several at once(Don't know the game mechanics of this just experience).<br>
<br>
2) Get the best you can, your equipment is half of all you can do as a melee. Quest, save and trade, always upgrade. Weapons: Ratio thats it, do not depend on BS, you will only get the one maybe at the begining that matters and proc's are to unreliable. For solo armor AC, AC, AC and Agi, Sta as second concerns. I carry a seperate set for group fighting Dex and Str with Sta over 100. I use a bow to pull from far away and then move them to where I won't get adds. Carry Wolf-ina-Bottle or Jboots. If you saw me you would think I was a twink. I'm not Siffo is my first and only toon, I am just very focused and patient so I get whatever it is I set out to get.<br>
<br>
3) You need to know your area. Try to have a getaway route. Try to stay out of traffic and rovers. Use F9 to always watch around you. Intimidation only rarely works and will kick in at the very worst time but I still like it in some places.<br>
<br>
There Rogue Soloing Siffo Style<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Now for my real recomendation.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Find a group around your level that plays around the same time as you and make a habit of adventuring together. Go exploring and adventuring. Try to do quests even if the reward is crap. If you focus on XP grinding to get up in levels you will just end up frustraited at a high level instead of frustraited at a middle level. So much more can be done in this game in groups I often pity those that solo and XP grind, they are just missing a major part of EQ.<br>
<br>
This is all just my opinion so take it for what ever you want. I do play about every day for several hours and burnout hasn't raised its ugly head once. I can't wait to wake up in EQ. <p>Siffo Corpsestalker<BR>

I hunted the mammoths hard at level 30-31.  Had some long down time but the EXP and Loot was well worth it.  I am a level 34 and still get EXP from about 1/2 of them.  I also hunted in Marus Seru on Luclin (Rock Hoppers and Stone Grabbers).  Echo Caverns is also good (Mutants, Boglings, and needlites).  I solo'd in all the areas mentioned and still soloing.<br>
<br>
Get yourself a parter that can fear (Necro for me) and head on over to the Great Divide and hunt Tizmaks (camped the upper entrance).  If you are determined to keep your bind point in Shadow Haven, it wouldnt be too bad of a corpse run (except for the port to velious wait.  You can bind in Thurgadin also making it a very safe CR and only about a minute away!  <br>
<br>
Only caution to about Velious is the port area is a high giant and dire wolf traffic area, so make sure you hit hide as soon as you load into zone in attempt to avoid wandering MoB aggro.  Spirit of the Wolf helps too if you have to run to Thrgadin to save your hide from a giant or Dire that aggro'd you.<br>
<br>
Once you have bound to Thurgadim it is a very safe and rewarding camp (alot of EXP and Velium weapons to sell)<br>

3rd floor is easier than 2nd floor.  5th floor is easier than 4th floor.  Etc.<br>
<br>
On the first floor, those drovalg things on the first floor are under-cons, I'd stick to soloing the skeletons (all the rooms to the left of the entrance have skels in the, as does the pit in the center).<br>
<br>
2nd floor is all casters.  Really hard to solo, but once you get the spawn broken up with a group it's really easy.  They have crap for HP and if ya don't let them buff up you can knock 'em over like dominos.<br>

Syll, that makes sense.. and I've actually tried that. Until that sob ran right past his buddies and started a dozen or so train, including the spectres, which caused me to zone. Of course, that promptly put in the path a wandering dervishes and they proceeded to knock the holy hell outta me. Which required a LONG run from the Bazaar ( I know, I asked for it ) and mucho patience and sneakiness. Which the convinced me it was a group only place until 4 or 5 more seasons.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

On the 2nd floor, monsters path towards the entrance mirror until they're lined up with a bookcase row, then towards the center of the room, and then back towards the 3rd floor mirror (careful when they get there, because they'll occasionally pull 3rd floor mobs if just left there screaming for aggro).<br>

<br>
If you have EB gear, kedge.<br>
<br>
The entrance mobs seem to hit very poorly, die fast, and there's never runners, and they're easy to pull solo.  Plus you have a zone line to run to.  JBoots are the key to all rogue soloing, and you can zip outside to refresh.  And the exp bonus is the highest in the game.  Not much for grouping though.<br>
<br>
For soloing, you want a large outdoor zone with limited numbers of social mobs.  Instill Doubt works just fine if you do it right... remember it autofails when the backstab key is down.<br>
<br>
Personally, at 54, I still solo sometimes, and I can rake in the exp.  Of course, I have a clicky heal BP.  But I can trash a velious giant with a bubble or less of damage by fearkiting... but that's the epic at work.  Once fear kicks in once the fight is over.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you were to solo at your level... I did it in Cazic Thule.  But you're at a great level for soloing, having just gotten reposte.  Getting a group member helps a ton though if you lack healing.  Bards make the best rogue friends, as they have more variety than necros.  Duoing will always be better exp for you... well mostly anyway.  Drag a bard to Iceclad and play with cougars if you want fast exp, and if a full group shows you can hit the tower.<br>
