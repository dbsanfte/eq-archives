<br>
I trust Tanare's stay with you thus far has been pleasant?  I'm sure you'd know if it hasn't.  She can get in such a fret over her fingernails.<br>
<br>
Anywho, I just write to check up on the young Ranger.  A solution to this problem of ours might be at hand.  I just hope you keep the Ranger in good shape before she returns to us, as I'd hate to have to deal with the mob of Hair Dressers and other beauticians we'd have to tolerate in the guildhall for a few days if not.<br>
<br>
Take good care of her, and I've had this bard bring with him a Fruit Pie for her.  You're welcome to a slice yourself if you want.<br>
<br>
Smirkingly Yours,<br>
Zippus Maximor<br>
Arcanist of the Greatfool<br>

P.S. ~ Sergian sends his regards, and his love to Tanare.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Smirkingly ever slightly at the last line of his letter, he folds it and dribbles a bit of wax on the fold-line.  Pressing his Gear Shaped Emblem into the Wax, he seals it and hands it, along with a Fruit Pie (which, he notes, smells delicious) to the Bard at the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is going to get interesting...&quot; He mumbles, before going off to seek the 2nd Pie he aquired...for himself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/5/03 9:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> D'RonKarr sat at the bar in the tavern located across from the necromancer's guild grounds.  <br>
 He had completed his guard duty quite a few hours ago and then gone hunting to fill his packs with a few more spiderling silks and animal hides to replace the ones he had given to Tanare.   <br>
While the repeated mowing down of such animals was good exercise to keep him in shape for possable future battles, that knowledge did not aid him with what he was thinking.   <br>
His muscle aches and pains were par for the course,  the growing pain in his heart was not.<br>
<br>
He picked up his mug of imported Dark Haven ale and drank it all down,  then asked for another.   <br>
The bartender took his mug away and refilled it, handing it back to him, and  he took it with a thanks.    <br>
He stared into the refreshed mug  moodily, realizing that this was starting to become a habit.   <br>
Perhaps an after effect of trying to get Tanare to develope a taste for drinking.      <br>
It was a useless thing to do, all that effort at corrupting her.   <br>
While it did indeed seem to be working nicely, what was the point?   <br>
<br>
Then a fellow from the Necropolisis just  had to ask &quot;D'Ron, Is the elf ranger dead yet?&quot;<br>
He promptly downed the whole mug.<br>
She was growing on him he realized.<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  He mumbled as he found his head nodding and trying to meet the counter.<br>
&quot;Pretty little  bubblie sweet thing gets to be dead at Moondark.&quot;  He thought he said but the others around him just shrugged not understanding the reply.   <br>
Bleary eyed he did not ask for another drink but simply watched and listened to the skeletal band as they played their music.<br>
<br>
Several hours later the Acolyte found him.   &quot;D'RonKarr, you are ordered to report to High Priestess Littany immediately.   She has been waiting all afternoon and evening to talk to you, and grows impatient.  He gave a sigh and stood up.  The hour was late, whatever it was must indeed be important that it couldn't wait until morning or as he arrived for guard duty .   He followed behind the Acolyte as they made their way back to the Temple. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhaxalygen>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/5/03 12:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> (Ooh, this story is HILARIOUS!

D'Ron Karr had not yet obeyed her instructions and revealled himself.  There was the seed of doubt in her mind about the shadow Knight. <br>
<br>
&quot;He will serve the God one way or another&quot; she concluded, and turned to the letter from Zippus. <br>
<br>
In the meanwhile she decided, she would go and observe Tanare for a while herself. The hints from the wizard, Zippus, were ....interesting.<br>
<br>
She also wondered at the stupid trolls, had they not yet replace the mirror. It was time to see to things more closely.<br>

<br>
<br>
 Littany tells temple:3, '*enters the room, seeing Dronkarr waiting, she does not offer wine, or refreshments, but just stands, her eye boring into him'<br>
 <br>
DRonKarr looks at the High Priestess groggly and says 'Yes Mistress, er High Priestess Littany?'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'so Dronkarr (( voice smooth as ice')),&quot;'what have you been doing as of late?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'A lot of hunting Priestess.'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'xas? is this all?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'Many orcs and well, spiderlings and cats and bears have fallen to my blades'<br>
<br>
 Littany's voice purrs a little, with a slightly unpleasent edge', &quot; 'DronKarr, you swore to serve the temple Xas?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says 'Ummm, I have displeased you somehow?'......Yes, and I have performed my turns at guard duty as you have wished.'<br>
<br>
 Littany says,  'have you seen our captive Knight?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says 'Captive knight?  No, I cannot say I have.'<br>
<br>
Littany says 'and does her fear grow?..... 'and do you help her Know the God?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'I have not not visited the dungeons'    'Oh, you are talking about the ranger?'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'do not play the fool Dronkarr, I will not be served by fools.  Do you wish to confess to me your sins?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron lifts an eye brow.   'I have many....'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, '*hisses* xas, you do at that, and you will do penance, do you not think that Cazic sees all in his temple.  How you coddle the woodelf, how you pamper her?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'Ah, well, you said you wanted her unassuming.   And that you were going to inspire fear in her.'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'and you shall now help in this *smiles*.  You will tell her who you are Knight, what you are.  And do so in a manner to help her know of Fear'<br>
<br>
D'Ron remains silent for a minute.<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'or, could it be you are weak, 'that you cannot stomach the service of Our Lord?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron scowls.  'You think me weak for not terrorizing a sacrificial lamb ahead of time?'<br>
<br>
 Littany says , 'are you capable of such? words mean little to me Knight'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'What do you have in mind, or do you wish to leave that entirely to me?'<br>
<br>
Littany says, 'I leave it to your creativity, but know this'<br>
 Littany tells temple:3, 'I will naut have you coddling her again'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'Getting her drunk is coddeling?'   'I would have liked to get her to like it....but ...'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'you know what I mean *snaps*'<br>
<br>
D'Ron remains silent.<br>
<br>
Littany comands, 'now GO.   <br>
Do naut disappoint me again'<br>
Or the moondark will see more than one serve Thule'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'Yes, Priestess....In what condition must she be left in...intact before the sacrifice...'<br>
<br>
 Littany frowns* Do not seek to quench your lust with my prey '<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'No beatings either I take it.'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'Fear is not served by the torment of the flesh .. but of the mind'.  Do you naut learn anything from this?<br>
The body does not need breaking, the mind is the key'<br>
'I leave to the crude Iksar, and the Trolls to serve Fear by such crude means, we, you and I , we serve the God with more refinement'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says, 'I, am used to breaking the mind by breaking the body....I will have to learn more, and yes, your will, will be done'<br>
<br>
 Littany says, 'now go *a gesture of dismissal*  I have much to do'<br>
Do not Fail me Knight'<br>
Do not fail Our Lord'<br>
<br>
D'Ron Karr bows and turns around to leave.   'Yes Priestess.'<br>
<br>
 '&lt;Exits&gt;'<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
D'RonKarr walks out into the courtyard and takes a deep lungfull of rain freshened air, then peers up into the sky, looking at nothing in particular.&gt;'<br>
His desire for much need sleep temporarily twarted<br>
 'He then sits down on the rim of one of the many fountains and places his head in his hands.<br>
<br>
He thinks to himself,  '*I knew I was going to have to show myself as what i actually am to her, why should it bother me so much now?*'<br>
 '*I will indeed have to think on this<br>
&lt;Stands back up and makes his way back to his quarters&gt;'<br>
 '&lt;Where he lays down on his bed and stares up at the ceiling.&gt;'<br>
 '*Well I guess I was really becoming somwhat attached to her.  Maybe I am weak.   I will have to be carefull.*'<br>

&quot;good&quot; meaning &quot;serving Tunare most faithfully and <br>
having the proper desire to see anyone thoroughly<br>
dead who dared spoil the beautiful lands of Norrath.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now, however, in her 12th season of tracking and<br>
hunting, Aurwena was not &quot;good&quot; anymore, nor<br>
did she consider herself so. She had turned to<br>
a mixed triad of deities--Rallos Zek, Veeshan, and<br>
Zeboxurok, the Forsaken, instead of Tunare. She<br>
did not hate the Mother of All; rather, Aurwena<br>
simply believed that the gods of War, Wyrmkind,<br>
and Wanderers better suited her personality.<br>
<br>
Her apostasy, as the Clerics of Tunare liked to call it,<br>
started when Aurwena realized she had no desire<br>
to exterminate the Orcs of Crushbone. In the time<br>
before her exile, her first year, the young Ranger<br>
thought that this lack of zeal to kill the Orcs was<br>
due to her belief that any kind of genocide was stupid.<br>
However, she soon realized that Rallos Zek was <br>
calling her to himself, even as a Kelethin Ranger.<br>
Killing Orcs was killing the children of Zek, and<br>
with her growing affinity for Rallos, Aurwena dared not.<br>
<br>
Thus, the first deity that she worshipped with all<br>
devotion was Rallos Zek, the Warlord, for ever <br>
since her banishment from Kelethin, she had <br>
spent her life growing strong and ferocious<br>
in battle, invigorated by the thrill of the hunt. <br>
<br>
She soon learned to follow Zeboxurok as well, the<br>
Despised, also the patron of exiles. As for Veeshan--<br>
Aurwena never had wanted to kill the gentle forest<br>
drakelings and drakes that came her way. Strange--<br>
she was called to her gods by the creatures that <br>
she DIDN'T want to hunt down! Such was her fate<br>
following the Mixed Triad, fighting for her own life...<br>
<br>
...and then, in Qeynos, Aurwena instinctively felt the <br>
call of one of her fellow Rangers, far away, whose life<br>
was in grave danger. She didn't know it yet, but this<br>
young Wood Elf, whose name was--Tanare, yes?--<br>
was destined to die on the altar of her Mother's enemy, <br>
Cazic-Thule, if someone didn't do something fast!<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall try and rescue you,&quot; Aurwena whispered to the<br>
wind, &quot;even though I'm only 12 and lack the proper <br>
experience to defeat your captors in battle head-on!&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus she strode to Paineel, where Aurwena had fought<br>
before, against the flea-ridden, growling Kobolds in the<br>
Warrens. However, once the young Ranger had snuck<br>
past the scowling skeletal guards and Noclin Saah, <br>
the scowling necromancer standing watch over the<br>
Paineel yard, and gotten to the entrance of the <br>
Warrens, Aurwena realized, out of breath, that<br>
she was out of luck. If she tried to rescue Tanare,<br>
she would be slaughtered faster than a rabid kobold!<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Zek, now what am I to do?&quot; she grumbled, chiding<br>
herself for her foolhardy plans. &quot;I don't even have Camouflage yet, so how in the world am I going to<br>
rescue this poor girl? This is the stupidest thing I've<br>
ever done, besides telling the Kelethin Guards that I<br>
now follow the Mixed Triad and getting exiled!&quot;  <br>
<br>
She sighed, taking a drink of water from the pool<br>
outside the Warrens, and waited for any bright ideas<br>
to come to her from her gods. None came, however,<br>
and soon Aurwena was forced to send out an instinctive message to see if Tanare, the prisoner, would respond. <br>
<br>
&quot;Tanare,&quot; she whispered, &quot;if you can hear me, sense<br>
me, or have any inkling at all that I'm here, I want to<br>
tell you that I'm a Wood Elf, and a fellow Ranger. I've<br>
come to rescue you, by the gods, even if it means I<br>
get slaughtered like a kobold! My name is Aurwena,<br>
and I want to know if you're still alive,&quot; she prayed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanare>Tanare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/6/03 9:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1>  Tanare sat at the table, a confused look on her face as she stared at the mirror this morning. Yesterday's mirror which she knew had to come from the gypsy camp was gone and another was in its place.<br>
<br>
   In its reflection she saw herself sitting down dejectedly, a sad look on her face as if she had been crushed down by the wieght of the world. A look of hopelessness in her eyes asher reflection sat, clad in the crudest of garments as if waiting for another to tell her what she should do and not moving until she had gained such instructions. A haunted beaten look stared back from the image's eyes at the young ranger who sat before it.<br>
<br>
   Tanare's brow wrinkled in an unusual furrow of deep thought as she attempted to figure out what this could mean. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Does this mean the dress i'm going to get is like..ugly or something and i'm like sad cause i waited all this time for nothing? And like my eyes get all baggy from trying to stay awake and see when they'll be ready for my fitting? Maybe Dronky might know even though he was just here yesterday with the gypsy mirror. This one's no fun.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
  She concentrated again at the mirror's image before and finally came to her conclusion. &quot;I don't get it.&quot; Despairing at being able to comb her hair today she looked to the door hopeful that an army of tailors would come and get her dress prepared. Suddenly remembering something else she picked up some of the pelts still lying on the floor and again attempted to figure out how she would combine this spider silk in her pack to the bear pelt in her hands. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wait til i mkae like an even cuter dress than the bigforeheady peoples do, that'll show them not to be so slow and stuff.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided as she concentrated on her work. Faintly she heard a dim echo but the only two words she could pick out were &quot;ranger&quot; and &quot;rescue&quot;<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Awww some poor person is like in trouble and stuff. Well since there's already a mighty and tough ranger there to save them i can keep sewing.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she concluded as she ruined the bear pelt before with her sewing needles. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> It was nice of all these cute wolfies and kitties and teddy bears to like give me their pelts to do my sewing on cause they knew i like needed practice and stuff, i hope it all will grow back before it like gets cold and stuff.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   The tip of her tongue again poking out the side of her mouth unnoticed as she turned back to her task at hand Tanare sewed on, still oblivious as to what was going on.<br>

His 'pet' follows him noisly proclaiming:<br>
<br>
 Jabann says 'Following you, Master.'<br>
 Jabann says 'Guarding with my life..oh splendid one.'<br>
Jabann says 'Following you, Master.'<br>
Tanare says, 'you bought a new outfit Dronky?'<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'Good morning'<br>
 Tanare waves at Jabann.and says, 'you saved another skele guy too?'<br>
 Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'No, I did not buy it.'<br>
<br>
Tanare doesn't think black looks good on Dronkarr.<br>
Tanare says, 'ooh careful with the shield thingy it has like spikes and stuff and you might hurt yourself'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'That is the way the shield is supposed to look, yes.<br>
Tanare says, 'silly the other one was smooth and shiny and stuff'<br>
Dronkarr says,  'This is my normal armor'<br>
 <br>
Tanare wonders what's wrong with Dronkarr today he seems odd. &quot;No, your NORMAL armor is like silvery and stuff'<br>
 Tanare wonders if Dronkarr got hit in the read recently.<br>
Jabann says 'Following you, Master.'<br>
 Jabann says 'Guarding with my life..oh splendid one.'<br>
 Dronkarr says,  'This is the armor that was earned by me with my quests for my guild'<br>
Tanare sas, 'oh, i never saw black pally guy armors before though'.  Quests are fun though , especially if you get new clothes out of them &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'And Jabann is not a worker, he is my servent.'<br>
Tanare says, 'oh you hired him? &lt;applauds Dronkarr's good deed&gt;'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr reaches his hand over and lifts up Tanare's chin so he looks right into her eyes.<br>
Tanare crosses her eyes at Dronkarr.<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'No My dear.   I summoned him.'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'I am a knight of the shadows not of the light.'<br>
Tanare says, 'well of course you did silly you said &quot;Hey Jabann come here!&quot; and he came over cause that's why you hired him for '<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'It is what we do.'<br>
Tanare says, 'oh...you mean you're a pally guy that works at night now? &lt;seems confused&gt;'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'Watch.   I shall send Jabann back to the void he came from./<br>
 Jabann says 'As you wish, oh great one.'<br>
Tanare says, 'awwww he fell apart, maybe he was stressed or something'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'And now I shall summon up another dead spirit '<br>
Tanare says, 'is that like the wolfie spirits?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'No.'<br>
<br>
 Tanare jumps back a step.  'He's sneaky!'<br>
Tanare wonders how she can make her eyes glow like Zobtik's.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr sighs.<br>
 Dronkarr says,  'Do you not see the symbol that is on my shield?'<br>
 Tanare peers closely at the shield- thinks its an icky looking one.<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'It is the symbol for Innoruuk.   The god of hate.'<br>
Tanare says, 'yeah you took it from the bad guy you killed and stuff cuase he didn;t need it aymore cause he's dead now?'<br>
Dronkarr says,  'NOT of the light.'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'so he must be mad at you now cause you have it then '<br>
Dronkarr says, 'No.  I aquired it INSIDE of NERIAK'<br>
Tanare nods wisely,  'Oh you attacked the city!  And took it from the guards you kiled?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'The home of my Teir'Dal, er Dark Elven father.'<br>
  'I killed no guards, I walked in.  <br>
 'It is the home of my father'<br>
 'I am a Shadowknight'<br>
Tanare peers closely at Dronkarr's face- trying to see some sign of the bad skin complexions the teri-dal all have.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'I kill those of the league of Honor.'<br>
Tanare says, 'oh... but Dronky's a pally guy'<br>
And pally guys don't lie'<br>
'But why do you want to kill the Honory peoples? they're like nice and stuff. they let me live with them even'<br>
<br>
((Dronkarr says, in Elvish, '((IF the graphics allowed it ...yes he would have some darker coloring))<br>
((You told Dronkarr, '((yeah i wish they could do that too))'<br>
.<br>
 Dronkarr says, , 'I am not a paladin. <br>
 I am a shadow knight.  <br>
 And I brought you here to be killed.'<br>
Tanare tries to remember what a shadowknight is if it wasn't a pally guy who works at night.<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'This is the temple of the God of Fear'<br>
 'Known as Cazic Thule'<br>
<br>
A dim bulb goes off in Tanare's head at this last statement.<br>
Dronkarr says, 'The same one the lizards worship'<br>
'The dressmaker is really the HIgh Priestess of Thule'<br>
'Littany D'Thule.'<br>
Tanare says, 'oooooh...i get it, since you're a shadowknight then you can't be Dronky cause he';s a pally guy...but you look like him so... you must be Dronky's evil twin brother!'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'Humm.'<br>
Tanare says,  'she makes priesty dresses? &lt;is confused&gt;'<br>
'and why do they want to kill me?<br>
 I'm like too cute to die and stuff &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'You need to eat something ....you mind is still..too...bubblie'<br>
 'I am D'RonKarr, not some ...duplicate.'<br>
 'Here, I will prove it to you'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'so the god of feary guy- is he related to Lord Thule? <br>
Is that way these tapestries are so like ugly- cause they're like scared to make any more cause they're so bad?'<br>
Tanare is hopelessly confused now.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr sits down, and opens his pack up.<br>
Tanare says 'or were they scared to make them good? am I still going to get my new dress?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'The last time I was here we had muffens, and I<br>
gave you a chockletie thingie.'<br>
Tanare says, 'and the party does that mean i won't have the party? <br>
Or is she just trying to make me afraid that there is't going to be a party &lt;clutches her forehead in pain as her brain begins to grow overloaded&gt;'<br>
Oh yes Dronky must have told you about that time- when did he write to you?'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'And... &lt;hands her a bottle of ..Eternal Night Black Wine'<br>
 Dronkarr has offered you a Eternal Night Black Wine.<br>
Tanare says, 'he really likes me you know we like danced and stuff..I think'<br>
Tanare says, 'ooh dronky used to get me those'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  You take a swig of Eternal Night Black Wine.<br>
 Ahhh. That was refreshing.<br>
 You have become better at Alcohol Tolerance! (16)<br>
 Tanare giggles.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says,  'And why would you think I am not D'RonKarr'<br>
Tanare says, 'silly Dronky is a pally guy and your a shadowyknighty thing person you can't be the same person &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
Dronkarr says,  'If he is a palladin and then why would he tell me all about you then?'<br>
<br>
Tanare says,  'he freed all the skele guys and you like keep them for yourselves'<br>
 'cuase you're brothers and he like tries to make you not bad and stuff cause that's what pally guys do and stuff'<br>
 'so he figured if you found out how cute i am and stuff that you'll like become good and stuff like him'<br>
((You told Dronkarr, '&lt;watches everything sail WAY over tanare's head&gt;))'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'So, you think we are brothers now?   Im sorry , but there is only one of me, D'ron.   '<br>
 'And there is only one LIttany'<br>
<br>
Tanare says  'well of course there's only one  littany she has like two brains so she doesn;t need another body'<br>
Dronkarr says,  'And you are in the Temple of Thule, and you are chained to the wall to keep you from escaping'<br>
Tanare says 'yes one of you and one of your twiun brother &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
 'because the service here is like real slow and they's lose customers if they didn't'<br>
'like i'd leave without my dress anyways after all this time'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'And I might add, D'Ron, the same one that brought you here, put those shackles on you.'<br>
Tanare says, 'well he knew i might get bored and stuff and he knew the dresses here were real good so he didn;t want me to lose my place in line'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'You are to be sacrificed at the New Moon ceramony.'<br>
Tanare says, 'is that good?'<br>
'do i get to have my party before that?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'SACRIFICED means KILLED!   '<br>
 'NO'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'will my dress be done...oh... but being killed is like bad- Dronky will be mad at you if he finds out'<br>
 Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'The ritual of the sacrifice IS the 'party''<br>
'I AM  D'Ron'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'oh...will anyone i know be there?'<br>
 'no silly your brother the pally guy'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'And you will get your dress, it will be your ceramonial robes'<br>
 'I have no brothers'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'how did your mother keepyou apart if you both keep calling yourselves the same name?'<br>
 Dronkarr says, , 'And I am not a palladin''<br>
Tanare is glad she'll have her new dress at least.<br>
'no silly you're the shadowy guy, Dromky's the pally guy'<br>
 'you know Dronky seems much smarter than you'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr eyes Tanare.  All desire for her haveing left with the obvious cluelessness.<br>
Dronkarr looks at Tanare with a scowl.<br>
<br>
 Tanare looks confused again.<br>
 Tanare wonders if her hair is messed up that Dronky's brother is looking at her like that.<br>
Tanare wounders if Zobtik did something wrong.<br>
<br>
(( Dronkarr tells you, in Elvish, 'LOl, my BBq erudite meat dissapeared that i was going to hand her))'<br>
((You told Dronkarr, '((lol))'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr hands Tanare a platefull of what appears to be barbaqued meat.<br>
Tanare sniffs the meat delicately, thinks its been burnt.<br>
Tanare takes a bite-thinks it tastes like chicken.  <br>
While Tanare is eating, Dronkarr takes a moment to discretely changes back into his silvered armor and then returns back to Tanare.<br>
<br>
 Tanare gasps in shock! Dronkarr's evil brother stole his outfit!<br>
 'HEY you stole dronky's outfit! he's gonna be REAL mad at you now!'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'And if there was another D'Ron Karr he would be dead now that I have his armor, would he not?'<br>
Tanare says, 'you better hope Dronky doesn't find you wearing his armor'<br>
'well unless you stole it while he was sleeping'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'And why would you assume that?'<br>
Tanare says 'well Dronky is a tough pally guy so he should be able to beat up a shadowy guy even if it IS his brother'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says,  'And think! Tanare, Think...Dron summoned the skeleton in the warrens right infornt of you'<br>
Tanare says, 'I bet that's why you turned like bad and stuff cause Dronky beat you at everything all the time'<br>
 'NO, he FREED the skele guy- i just didn't see him before'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'I am D'Ron, it is as simple as that'<br>
Tanare is confused again.<br>
Dronkarr says,  'Shining armor or black armor, I am D'Ron Karr'<br>
<br>
Tanare thinks Dronkarr's evil twin HAS been hit in the head and thinks he's Dronky now.<br>
 Tanare remembers mother always told her to be careful of crazy people like that.<br>
Dronkarr waits for a reply'<br>
Tanare decides to play along until the real Dronky can rescue her.  Tanare says 'oh...ok... you can be Dronky then'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says,  'D'Ron had guard duty ...HERE ...did he not?'<br>
Tanare says, 'oh he was guarding lots of place i'm sure'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'This is the Temple of Thule.'<br>
 'No, just this place'<br>
Tanare says,  'ok &lt;continues to play along&gt; this is the temply place'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'Right outside the doors.   And he told you he was guarding this place'<br>
Tanare says, 'so no one would cut in line'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says,  'Either you belive I am D'Ron or not, it does not matter now.'<br>
Tanare says,  'ok evil...er i mean dronky &lt;hopes he didn't notice the near slip of the tongue&gt;'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'This will be the last visit that I make in here Unless lIttany so desires I see you ...<br>
you will not see me again until the day of your sacrifice....<br>
the day you die.'<br>
'NO muffons, no chockletie disserts....<br>
no flowers'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'oh no i'm much too cute to die &lt;nods&gt; Thuley will like see me and say &quot;oh this one's too cute you can't kill her.&quot; then all the temply peoples will let me go and not even make me pay ofr my dress &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'You WILL be killed and your death used to sanctify the temple.'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'besides all the honroies people will be coming to the party like Littany said so they won't want me to die either &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
 Tanare wonders what &quot;sanctify&quot; means.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'Then they will die also'<br>
Tanare says,  'which ones?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'Your Honorary people.'<br>
 'Any that come will die'<br>
'Like this little elf'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'oh no they have even mightier and tougher rangers than me there that will like beat you all up, and of course Sergy will be mad and meledy singy person cause then she'll have to tell mother that i got like dead and stuff and mother will get mad so she won;t let that happen '<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dronkarr pulls out a Sand Elf Head, and tosses it on the floor infront of Tanare.<br>
Tanare says, 'Eeeeeewwww!'<br>
 'what a HORRIBLE hairstyle!'<br>
 'Did she like cut her head off cause it was so bad?'<br>
<br>
((Dronkarr tells you, Lol, couldn't drop it))<br>
(( You told Dronkarr, '((lol they're no drop right?))'<br>
((Dronkarr tells you, Lol, did you get it?))<br>
<br>
&lt;the head bounces into Tanares lap...&gt;'<br>
 Tanare kicks it across the room.<br>
Tanare says, 'No bad hair germs!'<br>
 Tanare checks her own hair for signs of contamination.<br>
<br>
((You told Dronkarr, 'nope' pet snag it?))'<br>
((Dronkarr tells you, in Elvish, 'Must have))'<br>
((You told Dronkarr, 'I lost jboots that way once &lt;G&gt;))'<br>
<br>
<br>
Zobtik picks up the sand elf head and inspects it curiously, and begins to wounder if it would make a good football.<br>
Tanare notices Zobtik has two heads- thinks he must have been a big foreheady person once.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr sits down with another sigh.<br>
<br>
 Tanare comforts dronkarr.<br>
Tanare says, 'don't worry you'll feel better soon'<br>
 It begins to rain.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'And the barbaqued Erudite meat from theKobolds didn't help your  intelligence did it?'<br>
Tanare says, 'is THAT what it was? or was it the bad doggie meat?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'Yes, Erudite flesh...cooked by the kobold chef'.<br>
 Tanare says 'so...you mean if i eat big foreheady person meat i'll get like smarter and stuff?'<br>
Dronkarr says, 'The way they did it, yes'.<br>
Tanare says, 'wouldn't the big foreheady person get mad though?'<br>
'Oh'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'He, or she is dead'<br>
anare says, 'so that's why it was burnt, the stupid doggie doesn't know how to cook'<br>
Tanare nods at her amazing deductive skills.<br>
 'awww poor big foreheady person, did i know them?'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'Think...If I say I am DRon and I will not be coming back...then I either am D'Ron or I have killed him....as he will not be coming back.'<br>
 'The D'Ron you thought you knew, is me.l'<br>
 'You will be killed to decicate this temple to Thule'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'well then if you killed Dronky then i'll have to like beat you up and stuff after i get my dresss cause you're not supposed to kill your brother or nothin- mother told me that- of course i don't have any brothers- i do have a sister though but she's like real little and stuff so she won't be leaving the treehouse for a long time yet'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr says, 'It is as simple as that'<br>
Tanare says, 'but he already has a temple &lt;begins to be confused once again&gt;'<br>
 'Can't you just like write a letter or something?&gt; i'm good at letters.'<br>
<br>
Dronkarr now wishes that Littany had given him permission to abuse Tanare...just a little.<br>
Zobtik says 'I beg forgiveness, Master.  That is not a legal target.'<br>
<br>
Tanare says,  'Then that way no one gets hurt or nothing &lt;nods at her very practical solution&gt;'<br>
Dronkarr nodds, his fustration apparent.<br>
Tanare says, 'oh good! i'll start writing one then'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr turns and suddenly slams his mace into the mirror, breaking it.<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'um...when will the bardy person be by to mail it...AAAAAH my mirror!'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'YOU WILL BE KILLED!'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'Oh wait...it's that littany person's mirror- does this mean you have to like buy her a new one or something?'<br>
'but he didn't get my letter yet.... &lt;wonders why evil Dronkarr seems so upset&gt;'<br>
 'OH i know why you're mad- you just broke a mirror- that's seven years bad luck &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
 'and don't be trying to blame me for it- they won't let me have any weapons or nothin here so it was all your that broke it!'<br>
<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr mumbles something to himself about ending up in the dungeons alongside the Erucite acolyte.<br>
<br>
 Tanare wonders why SHE'S getting yelled at when it was clearly evil Dronky's fault.<br>
 Tanare hopes he finds a healy person soon to get his head fixed again- evil dronky seems much grumpier than the real one.<br>
Tanare waves at Zobtik.<br>
Tanare wonders who's going to clean up the broken glass.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr goes and climbs up on the table and sits down upon it, head in his hands, just looking at Tanare.<br>
<br>
Tanare thinks evil Dronky is crying cause he knows he's going to get in trouble for breaking that mirror.<br>
Tanare says, 'Don't worry, I won't tell who broke it, i'll say it was the big foreheady guy so like you don't get in trouble &lt;noids helpfully&gt;'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr sighs at Tanare.<br>
Tanare thinks the sigh is a hopeful sign.<br>
Dronkarr continues to just sit and look at Tanare, attempting to think of some other way to get through to her.<br>
<br>
Tanare unleashes the power of her dimples at Dronkarr.<br>
Tanare smiles winningly at Dronkarr to blind it with her bright white teeth too.<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'Why are you trying to flurt with me, you know I can't touch you...'<br>
<br>
You lacked the skills to fashion the items together.<br>
 You have become better at Tailoring! (11)<br>
Tanare says, 'what's flirt?'<br>
You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br>
 Tanare claps excited as her latest sewing project finally succeeds.<br>
Tanare says, 'you just like need a new outfit to like relax and stuff, look what I made for you!'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr stands up on the table feeling helpless.<br>
Tanare says, 'careful, you don't want to like break the table too'<br>
Dronkarr mumbles to himself '&lt;Defeated by the ignorance of the other&gt;'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'ooh wait do you wants some pants to match?'<br>
You have fashioned the items together to create something new!<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr says, 'No, no thank you'<br>
<br>
 Tanare cheers.<br>
Tanare says, 'awww but they're you're size'<br>
 Tanare pouts.<br>
 Dronkarr lowers his head and starts to walk off for the door.<br>
((You told Dronkarr, '((who said evil shal always triumph over good because good is dumb ;P))'<br>
<br>
Tanare says, 'Aww you're leaving? but you'll be buy for the party right? then you can meet all my honory firends and all'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr thinks *I have  failed, and my blood will probably be mingled with the others as I will be considered &quot;weak'<br>
<br>
Tanare waves goodbye to Dronkarr.<br>
Dronkarr turns to salute.<br>
Dronkarr snaps to attention and salutes Tanare crisply.<br>
Tanare says, 'don't forget to come to the party!'<br>
<br>
 Zobtik says 'As you wish, oh great one.'<br>
 Tanare does a salutey thing too.<br>
Dronkarr says, 'Dont worry...I probably will be there....'<br>

As he stepped out of the temple corridor, having ungracefully vented his lungs, D'Ron Karr relieved one of the guards standing just outside the doors.   It was his turn at guard duty, and the lengthy, and fruitless attempt to converse and inspire fear in the wood elven ranger had almost made him late.  He turned down one of the skeletal guard's invitation to join them in a game of dice and just stood, attempting to relax by listening to the thunder and breathing in the ozone laden air.   It seemed more stimulating than relaxing.  He felt he needed to go and vent himself on some koblods.  <br>
<br>
As he continued to stand there, he began to think of the sand elf head bouncing around.  Then he thought of Tanare  with purple, pink, or green hair.  He grinned.  Naw, she probably would just rationalize it away.  Shaved all off maybe.  No, better yet, a load of quick setting clayish dirt loaded into it, and no way to wash it out for months....Broken fingernails,  horse manure....swamp water...anything 'Icky!'<br>
<br>
He glanced over at the skeletons playing with their dice and cards, then settled himself somemore, still standing at semi-attention.  It was going to be a long day.<br>

the Warrens, waiting for any instinctive vibes or echoes<br>
from the prisoner, Tanare, and trying to figure out what<br>
to do about sneaking into Paineel. As she was only 13,<br>
the young Wood Elf could not cast the Camouflage spell yet, but there was no way, by Zek, that she would let Tanare die so that she herself could gain experience!<br>
<br>
At last, she heard an instinctive echo coming from <br>
Tanare, and it was not a good one. Tanare, it seemed,<br>
believed that SHE, Aurwena, was in trouble, and not<br>
herself! Aurwena sent a vibe back, limiting it to <br>
as few words as possible, in case the mountain air<br>
in Paineel was too tainted by evil for detailed echoes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're in danger! I will help soon!&quot; That was the vibe. <br>
<br>
After sending out this echo through the Paineel yard and down into the city, Aurwena sighed and meditated a bit, regaining her mana for some potentially huge battles, when another Ranger, a Human, and a Cleric entered<br>
the outside foyer of the Warrens. Aurwena asked:<br>
<br>
&quot;Could one of you please cast a spell of invisibility over<br>
me so I could try to enter Paineel without being seen?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which spell do you want?&quot; asked the Cleric, a tall Human male dressed in pale green armour, the livery<br>
of Rodcet Nife. &quot;Invisibility versus Undead, or my <br>
Ranger friend's Camouflage spell?&quot; The Ranger was<br>
also a Human, a female, wearing a dark green leather suit of Pine Scout armor found in Surefall Glade. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll take Camouflage,&quot; Aurwena answered. &quot;I know you can't have Invisibility versus Undead and Camouflage<br>
cast over you at the same time and have them both hold, so I'll see if I can sneak by the Erudites in Paineel while trying to avoid their undead servant guards.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; said the Ranger, who exhibited a red aura before Aurwena's eyes, &quot;but if I were you, I would<br>
gain more seasons of experience killing Kobolds and then see if I could enter Paineel safely.&quot; She smiled. <br>
&quot;Killing Kobolds raises faction with the Heretics there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know,&quot; said Aurwena humbly, &quot;but this is an emergency--a dire one! One of my fellow Wood Elves<br>
is in mortal danger. Could you, perhaps--help me rescue her?&quot; This was a shot in the dark, for the Ranger and the Cleric were strangers, but it might be her only chance...<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said the Ranger with a shrug. &quot;We're headed for the Warrens to slaughter some Kobolds ourselves, so we can't help you. I can give you Camo, though,&quot; said<br>
the Human Scout as she cast the spell over Aurwena.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the Wood Elf, &quot;and good hunting!&quot; She watched the two disappear through the tunnel into the Kobolds' lair, and then Aurwena climbed the stairs<br>
that led back through the yard. &quot;Here goes,&quot; she said.<br>
Aurwena ran right through the center of the gate, for<br>
the skeleton guards' aggression radius was quite low,<br>
and then she paused. Now was the point of no return.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tanare, good Ranger, I'll rescue you, or die trying!&quot; <br>
Aurwena took a deep breath, summoning all the courage<br>
that the Mixed Triad could give her, and then entered the damp, dark lair of a meditating Cleric or Necromancer.<br>

I have taken your advice, and against all instincts I have held my hand. You are right, I am not good at waiting, yet you have reassured me that Tanare has as yet come to no harm.<br>
<br>
But I watch the moon wanning through my window, Zippus and I worry.  Please, it is not that I do not trust you, I know you are far more intelligent than I am. But it never hurts to have a backup plan. <br>
<br>
I will be calling on friends in our League, the Fellowship, and across the good cities. I can wait no longer than the day before the ceremony. Then we must try desperate measures. The Moondark is the 22nd Zippus, there is not much time left.<br>

<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Um that don't make any sense- why do i need to be resuced and stuff? Or maybe this ranger knows a shortcut so i won't have to wait as long for my dress.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Tanare thought to herself- the death threats and sacrifices that &quot;evil&quot; Dronkarr had spoken of already falling from her thoughts replaced by an obvious discomfort over the far too lenghty delay in getting her new dress. <br>
<br>
  Realizing the ranger was probably waiting for a reply, Tanare frowned briefly as she saw her bow on the other side of the room out of reach. Her first plan to fire an arrow out with a message attached and hope it landed somewhere near the ranger had to be discarded. Looking around to make sure no one was near, she took a deep breathe and shouted &quot;OOOH YOU KNOW ANOTHER DRESS MAKING PLACE? wHEN DO THEY OPEN?&quot;<br>
<br>
   Oblvious to the sudden influx of cursing and swearing from the Erudite casters nearby all of whom's spells fizzled mid cast as the unexpected shouting wood elfess shocked them out of their concentration needed for the spells to work properly, Tanare wondered if this new shop would have her size. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=littanydthule>LittanyDThule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/13/03 12:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> She was slammed back against the wall with the force of the rangers voice, and inadvertantly almost bit her tongue.<br>
<br>
Wincing a little she straightened, and took one last look at the prisoner before she silently made her way out of the observation room.  If looks could cause pain, the ranger would have writhed in agony.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can anyone really be this....dense?&quot; She wondered.  There was no fear in the child, none.  &quot;Tanare is too stupid to feel fear, I have heard of such, but never experienced it.&quot; She ground her teeth a little looking at the chaos as she swept by the acolytes chambers.  &quot;She is not suitable, not at all&quot;.  Lord Thule demanded fear in his sacrifices. <br>
<br>
Littany thought back a moment to her meeting the previous evening in the neutralic bazaar with the Meledi and Finarfrin, and her chance encounter with the gnome wizard, Zippus.  Meledi had offered much for the return of the ranger, it was almost tempting.  An offer that could not be trusted to the writing, lest it fall in the wrong hands of either dark or light. And Zippus, she smiled, remembering the foul smell from the wound on his hand and how he tried to conceal it. She laughed as she remembered how the druid offered healing. She had asked later of the Shadows, and confirmed her thoughts, the pox inside that wound would only spread if such was attempted. There was much to consider. She was very tempted also by the subtle irony Zippus suggested.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lord Thule&quot; she at last sank to her knees in front of the altar to pray. &quot;Let me know your will in this, show me a sign&quot;<br>

<br>
Dear D'Ron Karr,<br>
<br>
We met once, I am not sure if you remember.  At that time you seemed a paladin.. Perhaps one who could so convincingly play this part has a little of such in truth hidden inside him.<br>
<br>
I know it is a longshot writing to you, but I have nothing to lose. Last night I met with Littany, and her demands are more than can be met. But in the conversation, I learned that it was by your hand that Tanare was delivered to Paineel.<br>
<br>
I know you serve the Temple D'Ron, and I will not insult you by suggesting that you do anything which would harm your mistress or betray your guild and faith.  I just would beg one favour, that I might meet with Tanare once more before the moondark, and bid my ward fare well. I know one such as you would be insulted by the offer of gold or gems for such a boon. I would offer instead my word, that you would have a geas on me. That you could call upon me in the future for a like favour, and if it was in my power I would grant it. <br>
<br>
Yours in hope<br>

Using the back of his spell book as an impromptu table, he began to write.<br>
<br>
Dear Tanare,<br>
<br>
Since it is your wish that I write letters, I will do so, this one is for you.<br>
<br>
First of all, I must say that I really did enjoy hunting with you and it was a pleasure seeing how you so adeptly dispatched the multitudes of Trogs and then later the Kobolds. <br>
 Such enthusiam.  Such courageousness, such  lack of fear.   It is too bad you were not born a dark elf. <br>
I even began to enjoy your conversations.  I never knew one could make so very much of so very little.  <br>
And your nievity about your situation, enertaining at first, but, it is to your own detriment &lt;scratched out&gt;, bad luck, danger to you.<br>
   <br>
I write because I still hold hope for you to come to an understanding of the situation that you are in.<br>
Perhaps with this written down, it will be easier for you to understand.  <br>
I will try and present the facts that, if you pay attention and reason them out, are obvious.  And should be so even for you.  <br>
<br>
First of all, saying you do not believe something will not make that something go away, nor change it.  If you step out into a street infront of an oncoming carrage....and say 'I do not believe it is there'   will you not still end up just as flattened as if you did believe it was there?  <br>
If you are warned that there is a trap in the path ahead, a pit covered over with branches and dirt, will you still walk on top of it and fall in to your death?<br>
<br>
I will list some facts for you.<br>
<br>
1.   Paladins do not summon, call or free skeletons,  except to  'smite' them to send their spirits on their way.<br>
<br>
2.  Paladins do not lead others into the temples of the gods called: <br>
Innoruuk,<br>
Cazic Thule<br>
Bertoxxulous<br>
except to wage war upon those who follow these gods.<br>
<br>
3.  The city of Paineel is known as the city of Heratics, the god honored here is Cazic Thule, and is home to the shadowknights and necromancers of the Erudian race.  That is undoubtedly why your 'Sergy' never showed you this city.<br>
<br>
4.  You are in the temple of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
5.  The Lady that greeted you here is Littany D'Thule,  a High Priestess of Cazic Thule.    She told you this.<br>
<br>
6.  D'RonKarr placed shackles on your wrists, the kind that cannot be removed unless unlocked, and the chain from them is attached to the wall of the temple, keeping you from leaving.  Attached there by the High Priestess.<br>
<br>
7.  The High Priestess Littany  also called your league the false league.<br>
<br>
8.  High Priestess LIttany D'Thule told you that you would be staying with us until the Moondark, at which time there would be a party and you would have a new dress to wear.   She also told you that you were the guest of Lord Thule.  <br>
<br>
9.  Lord Cazic Thule is known as the God of Fear.<br>
<br>
10.  The sacrifice of a young person is needed for the dedication of a new Temple to Cazic Thule to replace the one that Meledi had burned down along with the city of Necropolis.  <br>
<br>
11.  You are to be that sacrifice. <br>
Sacrifice means a ritual in which one is killed.<br>
<br>
12.  The sacrificual ritual is the 'party' of which High Priestess Littany was refering to .<br>
<br>
13.  The dress she is making for you is to  be the robe you will wear at this ceramony.<br>
<br>
14.  You are the 'guest of honor' at this ceramony, meaning that you are the main subject to be killed.<br>
<br>
These are the facts, these are the truths.  Not facing up to them by fantisizing &lt;scratched out&gt;, pretending to yourself that there are two D'Ron Karrs will not change these facts.<br>
<br>
I am D'Ron Karr, the shadowknight that pretended to be a paladin in order to lead you to Littany D'Thule and your death  in dedicating the new temple.  <br>
<br>
Know this, even though my god is Innoruuk, I have taken a blood oath to serve Littany and protect and serve her temple, and I will not abandoned that oath.  So if it is any satisfaction to you, you may as well know that I will probably be at your side for the ceramonies of this ritual, as I have failed at the task assigned to me.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if you understand your situation you will even come to see your part in this as a great  honor.   <br>
After all, only a few ever get chosen for the purpose of dedicating new temples.<br>
And it seems to me as if you are actually trying to volunteer for this.<br>
But to truely volunteer for this honor, <br>
you need to be aware of your surroundings, where you are.  And that, is in the Temple of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I will be able to visit you again before Moondark, we shall see.<br>
<br>
Your paladin/shadowknight.  D'RonKarr<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
D'Ron waited for the ink to dry then rolled up the parchment and sealed it.  He placed it into his pack and stood up.   Guard duty finished, he decided he would take a long walk into Steamfont, and would catch the local bard later, after he returned.<br>

through the blessings of the Mixed Triad--Zek, Zeboxurok,<br>
and Veeshan--heard Tanare's shout as clearly as if the<br>
young prisoner had been standing right next to her. <br>
Aurwena herself knew she was still only 14, and, thus,<br>
she could not reach Tanare unless someone offered <br>
her another Camouflage spell very soon. She sighed.<br>
<br>
Luckily, the meditating Cleric, who seemed to go by<br>
the name of Azzar, didn't notice the sudden exhaling<br>
of breath, for it wasn't very loud. Also, when you're<br>
deep in meditation, you hardly notice anything. <br>
<br>
Sensing great fright within herself, Aurwena prayed, &quot;Zek,<br>
I am afraid! Fear is not something you relish in your own<br>
servants, I know, but true courage is doing something <br>
DESPITE one's fear, not in total ABSENCE of one's fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, Azzar the Cleric did not hear, standing silent and still.<br>
<br>
Considering the message Tanare had given her, Aurwena<br>
was drawing a shocking conclusion: &quot;She thinks she's in<br>
the Bazaar, or one of the good/neutral towns that sells her<br>
pretty dresses! She doesn't realize she's in danger, and<br>
even though I tried to convince her, apparently she doesn't<br>
believe it! I shall have to come up with another way to  persuade her to try and escape Paineel. Ah!  I know!&quot; <br>
<br>
Sending out another instinctive message through the <br>
channel of her soul, Aurwena said, &quot;I know a shop where<br>
I live that sells lots of pretty dresses, and they're MUCH<br>
cheaper than the ones they sell here! Leave this place,<br>
if you can, and come with me to where I live! Be strong!&quot; <br>
<br>
Aurwena backed into the corner from where she had slunk,<br>
but just then, she sensed that the Camouflage protecting<br>
her was wearing off. Heeding the magical warning, the<br>
young Ranger moved away from where Azzar stood and<br>
snuck back into the tunnel leading to Toxxulia Forest. <br>
When her Camouflage wore off, Aurwena hoped that<br>
Tanare had heard her message and would try to escape. <br>
<br>
Fear coursed through her. What, by Zek, would she do now? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/14/03 3:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A letter</span><hr size=1> (/ooc Eeep!

<br>
Lopo says,   'Dos.... had better naut have fallen in love with an elf.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'Aye.....became too close to what I was guarding....and found myself protecting her for other reasons.'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,    '..........'<br>
Lopo says,    'Guarding -- und this was the task dos also failed Lady Littany at?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,   'Hence, the long walk in the fresh air.<br>
No, she (Tanare) has, and will be, guarded well.  <br>
I have failed in the task of inspiring fear in her.<br>
<br>
Lopo says,   'By succumbing to her charms.<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,   'She is as brainless and as innocent as a new born baby.<br>
<br>
Lopo says,   'Her frailty art a weakness abil.   Naut something to  inspire Dosst feelings of lust.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'Not even that....succumbing to her.....bublie brainless shatter....I am weak.<br>
I am both weak ....and failed at a task.<br>
/si U wander and think of alternatives.'<br>
<br>
Lopo chuckles.  'Alternatives to what?  Dos seem to need to prove doss self to innoruuk und dosst self again.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,   'The only thing i can think of...is the one thing she fears, and I cannot physically touch her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Dos art bound naut to slay her?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'Yes, that is for Littany... She must not be touched physically in any way.    And the  only way to install fear in her, I believe.....is to ...dump the dirtiest....yukiest....load of muck you could possably come up with....in her hair....'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Dos must be joking?  Physical threats do naut scare her?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  &quot; ...and not give her anything to wash it out with.   But that...is physical too.'<br>
'No'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Ustan do naut think Littany would object to that...it's not physical harm.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'If it were possable....She would even make a good Shadow knight.....you should have seen her glee at slaying all the Kobolds.'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Bah, the pale rot hate the kobolds that way, not just her.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  &quot;I tossed a sand elf head towards her and she was only worried about being contaminated.   She is clueless.'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Odd....dos should have taken her to slay elves.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'Perhaps that would be possable if she was not slated to be sacrificed.'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Take her before that.    When is this to happen?'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'I have already had success with getting her to think she must drink to make herself stronger.   Bit it is not up to me to unchain her, she is Liggany's charge now.   <br>
I only guard her, and I have been told not to 'coddle' her, so I will be keeping my distance now.   <br>
It is better that way, least my weakness grows instead of diminishing.   <br>
But she is soo...so...STUPID!'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'She is wise to have removed dos from the situation.  <br>
At least she will be put to death.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'And better the light elf gene pool.    <br>
Bahh!  Wrong sacrifice if you want fear, right plus some, if yoou want innocence.'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  'Ustan must depart again.   Innoruuk will show dos the path of hate dos must follow.'<br>
<br>
D'Ron says,  'I am sure he will.   I have followed it well enough in the past.  <br>
Take care Lopo.'<br>
<br>
Lopo says,  &quot;Rest well abit.' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/16/03 10:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> After spending more time just watching over the ocean and the activities of the crew of the ship beneath him, D'Ron Karr stood up and began to head back to the Warrens and Paineel.  He gathered shadows around himself so as to not be bothered with the neuscence animals that wandered the hills and forrests and was shortly back to the Warrens, where he proceeded to once again slaughter any of the kobolds that happened to be in his way. <br>
<br>
Making his way back out of the warrens and towards the city he passed a young elven female with the gear of a ranger.  She looked even younger than Tanare, and as he made his way further up , he reaized that she  did not apparently have any one else accompanying her.   He made a mentel note to see if she was still there after he sent the letter off.<br>
<br>
Back in the city D'Ron approached the merchant next to the bank that also kept the local news.  Here he handed him the scroll, along with an appropriate fee, not explaining as to why he was not delivering it himself.    The erudite raised an eyebrow at him, but then looking at the seal he said, <br>
'Oh, you are the one I have a letter for also.  Now I do not have to hunt for you at the temple, her you are...&quot;   And he handed D'Ron the letter from Meledi.  Puzzled, as to why he would be receiving a letter from Meledi and not Littany, he walked over to a nearby table and proceeded to read it.  <br>
<br>
Deep in thought he sat silently for a few minutes afterwards, then rolled the letter back up.   He stood up and walked over to a torch to light the end of it, then stopped.<br>
*No, I will let the High Priestess read this...perhaps she will find it useful, I will see what she desires on this manner.*  he thought to himself, and pulled the scroll away, to hold it firmly in his hand.<br>
He then headed back over to the temple to give it to her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=61&stop=76>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1193.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1193.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
