<br>
Tonight, something very bad happened to a gnome necromancer named Maladominus.  I think me and him are both inexperienced players, at least I am.  Our goal was to teach him the language of humans.  I was camping Nillipuss in Rivervale, so he agreed to come meet me there.  That was a bad idea.<br>
<br>
He had his soul bound near the inn by the Rivervale soulbinder.  Just after that, the innkeeper and the deputies noticed him.  He is kill on sight to them apparently.  He got trapped in a cycle of death-rebirth-death because he would reappear right next to the innkeeper or deputy who had just killed him.  He would never live long enough for us to exchange a single tell.  I tried pulling the deputies away to give him a chance, but that only got me killed too...  There's a dozen corpses belonging to him in Rivervale right now.<br>
<br>
I tried petitioning the game masters.<br>
I asked for help around in Rivervale.  Druids told me his best bet would be to have someone wait for him near the inn to inviso him as soon as he logs back on.<br>
I'm hoping this gnome (This was the first time I met him) will check this board for help and that some experienced players will be willing to offer help and suggestions.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry this happened to you Maladominus.<br>
Thank you for any help and suggestion anyone can provide.<br>
<br>

It wasn't your fault.... read further below.... I will post the mess below in just a bit. <br>
<br>
I got a preliminary email from Verant CS, said he will look into it and email me back. I'm not sure how long that will take for a server GM to actually respond. If anyone can actually get the attention of an ingame GM for me, I'd appreciate it. All I really need is for the GM just to reset my bind point. <br>
<br>
ok Maladominus' adventure in Norrath: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I fought the law....and the law won </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I unwisely binded by the Soulbinder inside Rivervale. At first it seemed ok, since the Deputies were at a distance where they could not notice me. And I was also using invisibility when moving about in the city, so I didn't really think of a problem. So I moved to a corner far away from the deputies so that I can re-memorize some spells while just casually chatting with Soyin as she was in the area and offered to teach me language lessons....in fact I sat in that tunnel entrance near the Kithicor zone, which is a looong distance from the nearest guard's eye..... and then I made a big mistake --  let my invisibility down for a bit. And then crap happened. Some human trained the guards on me. I didn't get his name. Just a tall robed human running past me with 4 Halfling deputies behind him.... <br>
<br>
The guards killed me instantly! <br>
<br>
I respawned on the Soulbinder. <br>
<br>
The guards were already running amok in the city, so they were ROAMING..... thus they easily see me again on the Soulbinder just as I respawn. <br>
<br>
Guards killed me again instantly. <br>
<br>
Another respawn and I was hoping the guards moved back to their posts and not see me.... but nope, they were still nearby. <br>
<br>
Guards killed me again instantly. <br>
<br>
I respawned again and tried to type petition to a GM.... I was killed even before I can send one coherent message to a GM.<br>
<br>
After about 6 or so deaths.... I tried to unplug my PC....actually my cable modem, I thought that was the fastest way to get a linkdeath. <br>
<br>
I let my guard down, and that was a dumb mistake on my part. Trying to figure out how to get out of the situation was hard when there are 4 hostile guards chasing me about 2 seconds after I respawn naked. And the LOADING PLEASE WAIT message arrives very quickly. It doesn't even give me one second to think about what just happened. <br>
<br>
Customer Service already emailed me back and said he would look into the situation and get back to me. With the multiple deaths, I lost a little over 1 orange bub of experience  the last time I checked right before I pulled the plug..... I thought it would be much worse <br>

Hopefully, you had your eqlog.txt file turned &quot;on&quot;.  If so, you might scroll through and look who trained them on you (if possible).  Add that person to the GM query about training.  If someone really did train you, they should be given at least a warning as this is beyond the scope of roleplaying and is simply mean.<br>

Corpse recovery is item number two.  It should be safe to loot your corpses at the zone line to Kithicor, if you can get someone to drag the corpses there.  I can drag your corpses for you, if you want.  That's all I could do for you, though, I'm afraid.<br>

Send Brunhild a /tell in-game if you need someone to drag your corpse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/26/02 6:35:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1194.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hobbits versus the Gnecromancer</span><hr size=1> Was the first time that Im playing a gnome necromancer and entered Rivervale.... my stupidity since I conned Halflings outside RV before and they conned dubious to me. And every other city I go to I'm dubious (except Dwarfs who I know will kill on sight). Even in Felwithe the Paladins may not like me, but I can run around the entire city unharmed and I have been able to Soulbind in Felwithe right next to the Paladin guild without problems. Ummm....maybe this had something to do with me grouping with a Teir'Dal group a couple nights ago killing a few Halflings inside Nektulos zone. <br>
<br>
Anyways thanks for the offer. All I'm waiting for is a GM to help change my bind point. Once I can do that, I can invis myself to get my corpse. <br>
<br>
I was expecting a GM to email me back by now since they first said they will look into it. And then someone tells me all the GMs are gone for the weekend cause of the Fan Faire. Go figure.... I'm prolly stuck til Monday. <br>
<br>
as for the lost experience....its not a big deal. I may have lost a little over 1 orange bub at level 11. I can get that back in one hour of soloing in West Commonlands<br>

<br>
1) EQ Chat Rooms are useless -- whatever GMs they staff those rooms are more useless than banded armor to a twink. They really cannot help you with anything. All they can do is to give you sympathy, and then they tell you that they have no power to help you. <br>
<br>
2) Mailing EQLive can be effective.... but it takes a looong time to get a response. <br>
<br>
3) Kudos to ingame GMs for helping me out. I was told to log on an alternate character on ANOTHER server and petition a GM there. <br>
<br>
So I did exactly that with my alt on Sulllon Zek. I waited about 20-25 minutes and GM Xekaris then asked me to explain. I told him everything. I also told him that my character that needed help was not on his own Sullon Zek server but rather on FV.  He said &quot;Ouch that's a tough one, let me see what I can do....&quot; <br>
<br>
He comes back to me 10 minutes later and he got hold of another on duty GM that was willing to log into Firiona Vie.  That second GM then asks me to send him a tell as soon as I log into FV and respawn. I do exactly that. <br>
<br>
The instant that I send GM Xzott a tell, I am instantenously Summoned by the Gods.... just outside in Kitihicor, he rebinds me just outside in Kithicor (fortunately it was in daytime) and Im back in one piece in Freeport. They resolved my problem, thanks to both GMs. <br>
<br>
My thanks go especially to GM Xekaris of Sullon Zek, because even tho my problem did not belong on HIS server, he was willing to listen to me and take a few minutes to grab another GM to help me out right here on Firiona Vie. <br>
