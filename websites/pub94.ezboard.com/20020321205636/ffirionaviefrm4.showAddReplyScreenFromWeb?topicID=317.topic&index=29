philosophical on human dynamics.<br>
<br>
I put ‘great’ in quotations because I did not want people to think that just because someone managed to unite a community and do something epic, it made them a person worthy of respect.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I did not do such a good job.  <br>
<br>
Naketh, I composed a couple responses to your post, but I couldn’t manage to get my point across without sounding too inflammatory.  I’d have loved to debate you on some of your points, but since ‘Henk’ is my character’s name, I’m a bit leery of tackling some of them.  I can just see phrasing something poorly and being tossed out of groups in Iceclad.  <br>
<br>
“Aren’t you the guy that said that MLK was the same as Hitler?”<br>
<br>
“No, no, that wasn’t my point, all I was saying was that…”<br>
<br>
“We don’t need your kind in our group, racist scum!”<br>
<br>
“Wait a minute, I…”<br>
<br>
You have been disbanded from the group.<br>

1) we are PGeers, we're here, get used to it.<br>
2) I do not have to defend my existence here to anyone and if asked will give the enquirer what they deserve ... rank hostility. If this bothers you I suggest one of 2 things: Stay the hell away from the soapbox, OR don't post pointless bleating and drivel in the first place.<br>
3) Robin to your infinite surprise I do not find your posts enthralling, informative, or possessing of a point, EVER. I also find your comparison in this case an insult to gay people's struggle, and to the gamers here insulting at best. Leap to his defence if you disagree, you'll find I don't care.<br>
4) It is highly amusing that the likes of Shintou feared the server would becoming a squabbling mess, when Viola! look what is happening. Not over spawns, in this case, but nonetheless that's what you prima-donnas got. Truth is I respected your right and attempts to roleplay from day one, and participated myself. Now I am laughing at the fact that a select few are doing their best to turn the very server they bleated to defend into their own ... worst ... nightmare.  <br>
5) regarding the above, it is not too late for this server. Learn when it is appropriate to STFU and open your eyes, and to drop your jesus complex. <br>
6) No offence to the RPer's out there who are just playing and managing not to bleat like baby lambs. You liven up the game and make this server unique. I salute you.<br>
7) Re-read if there is ANY confusion. I have been pretty blunt and to the point, something which is rare on this board. It is in fact a more appropriate and effective way to communicate. Try it you might like it. Avoid it if in fact you have nothing to say but feel the urge to post anyway. <br>
<br>
Conclusion: Up until lately I have been extremely good natured about this nonsense. My hunting partners and friends in the upper echelons are continuing to be good natured about it. For me, that time has passed. Barring further provocation, I am done with this topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=milosh>Milosh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/4/02 7:07:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Godwin's Law</span><hr size=1> &quot;As an internet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&quot; Score one for Godwin's Law!<br>

As a gay man myself, who's been long involved in queer politics, I have to ask what authority you believe gives you the right to make this claim on behalf of &quot;gay people's [sic] struggle&quot;?<br>

As for the rest, well, it's just an ad hominem attack that, from me, is going to get the treatment it deserves.<br>

[Edit: &quot;Milosh: I didn't notice the 'nazi' reference in Sliver123's post ending the 1-20 section of this thread.  Good call.  Seems we're invoking Godwin's a lot lately on this message board, and usually on the same people.&quot;]<br>

Certainly you may have a more comprehensive perspective than others who are not as close to the topic, but it's poor logic to attempt to invalidate others simply because you don't think they are in your &quot;group&quot; and therefore they shouldn't have the ability to have an opinion, let alone disagree with you.  In my experience, there is a lot to be learned in disagreement, and from people not as directly affected.<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Rexfelix that I found the original post to be a little bit offensive.  When I think of safe space, I think of an area where people are free to be whatever they are .. not some exclusive club where one or both sides looks at the other with a condescending &quot;how quaint&quot; attitude.  I'd like to see a culture built on this server where people are free to RP to whatever extent they wish, without people judging them, either because they aren't roleplaying, or roleplaying &quot;good&quot; enough, or because they are roleplaying.  In other words, a culture of *inclusion* and not *exclusion*.  I know that us vs them is the psychologically easiest way to build a community, but I've never been for taking the easy route <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Going back to the whole PG vs RP thing, I have seen very little either in game or here of the so-called &quot;PGs&quot; making criticisms of roleplay.  I have seen a lot of people criticizing people's style of RP or perceived lack thereof.  So let's make sure that as we worry about creating a &quot;safe space&quot; it's safe for everyone.  Personally, I'm a little tired of being hesitant to interact with other people on the server just because I might not be RPing the way they think I should. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unimiane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimiane</A> at: 2/5/02 10:30:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 12:14:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Keep using my thread titles for posts that don't match them!</span><hr size=1> Am I the only one who saw this thread as asking how we can make sure that the server remains a place people can still comfortably RP a year from now, rather than making it a place people can't play if they don't RP?<br>

I didn't read the original post the same way you did, Kimaya.  Maybe what you mentioned was the intent of the post, but the example that was given certainly muddied the water;  of heterosexuals invading the &quot;safe space&quot; of the homosexuals so they could &quot;gawk at the natives&quot; so to speak.  The author seemed to have distaste for anyone being present who was not meant to be there, unlike you who pointed out that the problem would only be with some people and not the entire community at large.  <br>
<br>
I saw the author trying to draw parallels to the whole RP/PG debate.  I couldn't help but think given that spirit of exclusion that the original post seemed to embrace, that we were talking about how do we keep RP &quot;safe&quot; on this server from the PGs who would ruin it, creating a culture that only accepts RP and excludes those who do are not like &quot;us&quot;.<br>

I am from Shintou's old server, yes, Uberuuk. In my playing there, I did not see RP'ers persecuted--yes the vast majority did not RP--far from it, when you have druids and rangers tracking mobs in PoG for guilds, but they did not persecute either. <br>
<br>
Persecution and need for a safe place to me are terms to me which imply in their connotation a much greater degree of antagonism that anything I have perceived in the game. I am not sure of examples, especially on this server, that can constitute a need for a safe place or any discussion of persecution. Perhaps you can enlighten me on the times you have been persecuted, especially if it has been here. <p>Pakua Chuan <BR>

<br>
We i have read this post from beginning to end. and there is one thing i want to point out. It Is Just A GAME. I have only been on this server for a few weeks. And i think the community is great alot closer then the other servers. I love the fact that you can get a reputation because it is such a small server. But it is just a game. You cant compare it to anything Because it is just a game. You dont like the way someone plays dont play with them. It is thats simple to compare it to RL is impossable because you cant log out of RL<br>
<br>
just my Opinion. I am a RP'er by the way<br>

But I will admit that when I read something in text, I try to read it in the most fair/generous light I feel can be applied to it.  I do this because I've noticed over the years that, particularly via the internet, I've seen a much bigger tendency to read things in the worst possible light.<br>
<br>
I've been seriously burned by the latter tendency on both sides of the fence.  In effort to learn from the past, I've tried to actively resist a filter of negativity.  Do I overcompensate?  There's no way I can tell.  <br>
<br>
But what I can tell is that when I do misjudge someone's intent, it's been far easier to resolve when I presume someone's intentions were above-board and they prove to be otherwise, rather than vice versa.<br>

I've been there too, and you are totally right that the vast majority of us out there read things in a negative light first.  That's the bad thing about virtual communication, it seems to be 25% the words on the page and 75% in the mind of the person reading it - their perception of you from past interaction, the mood that they are in, the emotional response they get to words that you use, their perception of your tone, right or wrong.  Your writing skill can change those percentages one way or the other .. but overall it's still an imprecise science at best.  I just try to avoid flat out personal insults, add a bunch of caveats about how my reading of the message could be wrong, edit the hell out of my posts afterwards to make my thoughts more clear, and hope everything works out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 3:29:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The way I read</span><hr size=1> Kimaya:<br>

You read the post as it was intended to be read.  Others have been foisting an opinion onto me that I do not hold, nor did I hold in that original post.  If they go back and read it again, minus the defensiveness, they'd see that.<br>
<br>

<br>
I understand that, but Sliver was the one making claims on behalf of the gay community (&quot;it's offensive to gays...&quot;).  As a member of that community myself, who is the one being accused of being offensive to the community I belong to, I want to know how he arrived at that conclusion.<br>

'overrun'.<br>
<br>
This is confrontational and exclusionary language, IMO.<br>
<br>
What several others posted were diatribes (sorry, but that's what i feel they were) about being uncompromising.<br>
<br>
So... I would strongly suggest that we:<br>
<br>
Drop this stupid line of debate.<br>
<br>
Bury it.<br>
<br>
Never dig it up or mourn it.<br>

<br>
I would understand that some people find any comparison between the struggle of role-players on this server and the struggle of any minority (gays, african americans or disabled persons, it does not matter) as non constructive and potentially offensive.  <br>
<br>
In the particular case of the struggle of the gay community,<br>
Here's a link:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.sws.soton.ac.uk/gay-youth-suicide/04-gay-bisexual-suicide-studies.htm">www.sws.soton.ac.uk/gay-y...tudies.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
You will find many studies there showing self-described gay or bisexual teens are on average ten times more likely to commit suicide than heterosexual teens.  I have yet to find a single study comparing the suicide rates among role-players and powergamers of Everquest...<br>
<br>
Someone said it right earlier.  You can't stop being gay, or disabled, or switch your ethnic background or religion when you need a break from it.  You can turn your computer off and stop playing EQ anytime if you get tired of being a role-player.<br>
<br>
Maybe Everquest is just a game.<br>

In the past I have seen you do detailed analysis of people's choice of words to show how your impression of what they said was correct and was not due to an emotional response on your end.  Yet many of us misunderstand your intent and it is due to all of our &quot;defensiveness&quot;?<br>
<br>
I can't speak for everyone else on this thread, but I was not defensive when I added my thoughts.  If I misunderstood your original post due to the limits of virtual communication, I am more than happy to be politely corrected and told what the intent was.  Honestly. That's what debate and discussion is all about, isn't it?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the offensive to the gay community thing, I can understand your thoughts and feelings there, but does it really matter what grounds he stakes his opinion on?  If he said, yep, I'm gay and I think your comments are offensive to the gay community, would that change your reaction to what he said?  You yourself said in your original post that the idea of &quot;safe space&quot; is deemed as seperatist even within the communities, and I am sure that many people find the idea offensive.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying he couldn't have been a bit more polite in his post (but this is a soapbox) I have just been looking at the issue in a more philosophical manner.  Which of course, as other people have pointed out, is somewhat silly since it is hard to make a direct comparison to real life intolerance and perceived intolerance on a game.<br>

<br>
I was making a point about creating a 'safe' space for roleplaying.  That's all.  I was drawing a comparison to the gay, feminist, and minority communities' experiences with 'safe' space because that's what I have experience with.<br>
<br>
I was *NOT* drawing a one-for-one parallel between being gay and being a roleplayer.  Of course the experience of being queer is different than the experience of being a roleplayer.  Believe me, I was a queer teen, and I deal with LGBT teens on a daily basis.  I'm aware of the studies, and I'm aware of the issues and problems that arise.<br>
<br>
Further, I never said I held to the opinion that straight people don't belong in gay bars.  In fact, if you parse my statement there accurately, I said there are gay people who think that, but I did not say I was one of those people.  Likewise, I have never said that &quot;powergamers&quot; (etc) don't belong on our server.<br>
<br>
Nor did I even say a word about &quot;powergamers&quot;.  Not one.  <br>
<br>
My question was how do we keep this server a viable space for roleplaying?  At what point does our server just turn into simply a 'special rules' server, where the community itself is more or less identical to the communities on the blue servers?<br>
