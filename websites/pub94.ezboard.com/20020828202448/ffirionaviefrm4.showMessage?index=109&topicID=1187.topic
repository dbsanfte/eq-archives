LOG OFF THE BOARDS AND GO PLAY /boggle.<br>
<br>
Support buying and selling players? Its their money, let them live their lives. Does who is playing Eldraed (the player in question) make any difference to you? If an AS person wasnt playing it, someone else would. Do i support playerauctions? Not really, but if i saw some primal fistwraps for 5 bucks, I'd get them.<br>
<br>
We need to stop playa-hating roleplayers? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS IS THE MOST ASS-CRAZY THING I HAVE READ (hi you guys didnt say playa-hating but you get the idea). Breath. Not once..ONCE..crap how do i make it bold...Have we flamed roleplayers for roleplaying. We have never looked down our noses, and as a human monk, i have a damn big nose to look down. *HOWEVER* Do roleplayers flame us for not roleplaying any chance they get? ...<br>
<br>
DO BEARS SHIT IN THE WOODS?<br>
<br>
honestly. <br>
<br>
Bloodwhatever, if your honestly trying to claim camp spots etc in velks, you have to be kidding me. Yes, you shouldnt camp right next to the ledge group (and i doubt they were sitting RIGHT next to you, but you didnt feel the need to add that fact?). I've been camping the left room in velks and had people come in and steal any of the two static spawns in there .. Been camping the right icelog and had people steal those two static spawns .. Been camping the ledge and had people steal the whole topside, Been camping safehall and had people steal the three spawns outside .. i could go on and on.<br>
<br>
Velks is as much a free for all zone as any i've ever been in. Thats just the way it is, if you want to change velks, feel free to go play DAOC, i dont think they have a velks there (i could be wrong).<br>
<br>
Dalnin, who says logs are easily doctored...I can doctor a screenshot just as easily. If you believe that taiil took the time to edit his logs, you truely are ignorant. Not that I think someone wouldnt do it, but honestly, do you folks just sit here and look for reasons to h8?<br>
<br>
Bloodperson again (im reading the thread backwards) -<br>
We had to cancel our kael raid because of yours. We only had one monk there who knew the vindi pull well, and with your raid in the way, there was no way to split him from the statue. So, show some intelligence..the server isnt out to get you. (btw to all you player haters ... YES I KNOW SPLITTING VINDI IS POSSBILE, HOWEVER WE DIDNT HAVE ANOTHER MONK WHO KNEW HOW ON THE RAID)<br>
<br>
Zarsiss - jesus, just shit up if your here to do NOTHING but flame people. was valancer a part of this? no. stfu, honestly. <br>
<br>
(you can tell my patience is growing short as i read more of the thread).<br>
<br>
Blayze - oh jesus, grow up. Honey i sorta liked you, but if you walk around with a chip on your shoulder for the rest of your eq-life, it will turn you into an annoying bitch.<br>
<br>
Jhary - please, PLEASE edit your posts quickly to keep everyone from knowing how ignorant you are. People dont play peoples charecters? <br>
<br>
Ollias - its responses like that that make me think roleplayers should step off their high and mighty horses. Your just proving yourself ignorant (not like i havent seen enough of that in this thread).<br>
<br>
Borm - the ebayed charecter you are referring too is a long time real life and other-server friend of the entire leadership of the guild. Of course you didnt know that, and i'll resist the urge to flame you because your name sounds like a dwarfs name. And i like dwarfs. <br>
<br>
BUT on that topic ..<br>
The account in question is one Stabbington Quikblade, 60 rogue, and an officer of AS. The person who plays Stabbington is named bobben, and he comes from Torv (where lacus came from as well). The account ORIGINALLY belonged to an awakened souls member, who for some reason had to sell it (this was before my time as a member). Another member bought it from him, and gave it to bobben to come play this server. This was not an ebayed account. If you guys dont think many guild players leave their accounts in control of the guild when they quit, your silly. (this is just the history of stabbington as i know it, although im pretty sure im right).<br>
<br>
Tzaroth - Please tell me you didnt just flame my guild for their player names. You've got to be kidding me. <br>
A) in game they dont have last names, but you've never met them, you dont know that. <br>
B) Reso had a kid named Ogah forlife, i dont see you flaming them. <br>
<br>
Ok now my general responses (god i wish my group could med faster)..<br>
<br>
The big thing that really makes me laugh, is that everyone here is flaming awakened souls, and in the guilds talking about how evil we are , etc etc. Yet when im dual-comping a cleric (dont even try to flame me for this, rollen just said he does it), i still get 4-5 tells an hour asking for rez's from people who i have heard flame AS. Do i rez them? Well the ones i see i do (i dont pay attention to my clerics tells very often). If you see me and my cleric friend in velks, drag the corpse for a rez. IM NOT SAYING I'll rez you right away, but when i have the time and the mana, you can count on it (soloing with a monk is hard on a clerics mana .. my monk anyway).<br>
<br>
Sorta on that subject, I bet if league of honor wiped in ToV and we were there, they would expect us to drag them and rez them, or it would be a massive chance to flame us. Yet if we did the same, we can F-off.<br>
<br>
thoughts ramble ..<br>
<br>
uliamarath - i like you so i'll make this short. what are you doing being the arbiter of hysar's problems anyway?.<br>
<br>
And finally Hysar ..<br>
Im not great at judging human nature when people do things like this. Perhaps this post was your attempt to get 15 minutes in the spotlight? Well congratulations, 6 pages of responses later, your famous .. famous as a whiny bitch. Taiil posted very clear logs, doctoroed or not, they are a HELL of a lot better attempt then you made to prove your point..<br>
<br>
He called you a fag? Show me the money.<br>
He wanted you to lose exp? Show me the money.<br>
He was rude to you in any way? I wish he was ruder then he was after what you said to him.<br>
<br>
Here comes the general society rant *prepare*<br>
You guys noticed that the soapbox is probably the most posted in forum? (not by sheer numbers, just follow along nodding with me). And you dont think this is a problem? <br>
Hysar, this post should not have been made. This should have been an email to AS guild leaders. WHAT did you hope to accomplish by posting here? Your exp was already gone (4% or 10% or whatever). This post didnt get it back. This post didnt get taiil kicked out. <br>
Anyone who isnt stupid knows that posting on public boards isnt something you do to solve problems. You need something done? Talk to someoen personally. Posting here is only asking other people to flame. I believe hysar knew this, therefor i have no respect for him (its like walking into a mental health hospital (you guys) and trying to start a riot (hysar)).<br>
<br>
99.90 .. fek that. 100% of these flames/problems/etc would be avoided if you guys would just adhere to one simple rule ..<br>
<br>
MIND YOUR OWN. LIVE AND LET LIVE. BE YOURSELF, LET OTHER PEOPLE BE WHO THEY ARE.<br>
<br>
I dont walk around telling you guys how to roleplay. Dont lie, i've seen you grouped with a dark elf Mr. Paladin. <br>
<br>
&quot;oh but i couldnt find a group&quot;<br>
<br>
/blow me./ You either roleplay or you dont, dont make exceptions, then use your status as a roleplayer to flame us. Am i a roleplayer? In a sense. I roleplay someone who likes to kill things, people, plants, animals.. your dog. I roleplay someone who likes to have fun. <br>
<br>
What saddens me is that even after taiil tried his hardest to post evidence supporthing himself, to show what really happened, you guys are too thick headed to listen. Its all anti-AS. <br>
<br>
Ignorant people make me sick.<br>
<br>
Feel free to flame me here, in the game, in the market, in tells, in groupchat, in says, when im around, when im not around .. with your parents at dinner, etc.<br>
<br>
I love knowing how much you think of me.<br>
<br>
See you in your dreams,<br>
