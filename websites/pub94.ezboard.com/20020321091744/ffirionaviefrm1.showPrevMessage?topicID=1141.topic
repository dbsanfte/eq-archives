<br>
Went there last week and thumped guardians and sentries....<br>
<br>
For one they are underconned.  For two they drop squat for how tough a fight it is and how much work you have to put in to split them.  <br>
<br>
The whole reason we were there is to get some resist gear for eventual raids etc.  <br>
<br>
Anyone know the drop rate here.  Do you have to kill a couple hundred of these guys to get some armor drops?  We spent a lot of time there just killing around 10 or 12 of them.....decided that the end did not meet the means eheh.<br>
<br>
Any advice is helpful.  <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance. <br>
<br>

It's horrid.<br>
We would camp either the dining room area or the hall near the pantry.  I am more familiar than I'd ever wanted to be with this.<br>
Stuff does drop there, Ichi...I promise.  My husband's dwarven paladin and his dark elven shadow knight both sport basically full suits of guardian.<br>
It simply takes a LONG...LONG time.  All told...to outfit his paladin and SK in guardian, and locate key pieces of sentry for his ranger and bard....we were there probably a month, a month and a half.  Thankfully my magician was also able to walk away with both a sentry and a guardian robe, so at least it wasn't too awful.<br>
We were there from levels 45-48, and again 49-51.  Just to give you an idea on that. (although by 51 things green out which is not a good thing on this server...)<br>
Anything else?  Just ask.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
One thing you should know:<br>
<br>
1.) the two sentry at the entrace to wakeninglands, have been buffed up HP wise, and they can heal...dont bother to kill them.<br>
<br>
2.) the drop rate was lowered on guardian/sentry in certain area's of skyshrine.<br>
The deeper you go the better the drop rate, all the locations in the posts above are in the 'lowered' drop areas, because they are easy!<br>
Heck i can split the couple of mobs in the suggest room and fear kite in the corriors, with two shadowknights you dont get hit much, its just mana regen.. drop is terrible here.<br>
<br>
3.) the pool room, the room with the idol that you use the key to port to cobolt scar  has ALWAYS been good to me, with the most concentrated drops of guardian and sentry, mainly because the room before it is rather 'hardcore' to pull due to the amount of adds.<br>
The pool room is hard depending on agro, if you are high enough to pull guardians without the drakes agro on you then its easyer, but thats not an option, wich means you have to take down those damned drakes at the entrance to the pool.<br>
One is an enchanter and a royal pain, only option is to nuke down fast, its hitpoints are not that great.<br>
<br>
Up the stairs, where all the guardians are in the single rooms, i get a pitifull drop rate here, despite the amount of guardians there, they are reasonable to pull depending on some things, these are probably the first ones you can pull fast without to much hastle.<br>
<br>
4.) Bjond is right about the maze part... if i am thinking of the right part that is, though that is quit deep and personaly i hate FD that area because of agro through walls/floor and some other really doddgy things. (like haveing rooms below you agro and warp 4, 5 things on you, especially while goind down ramps)<br>
<br>
Basic rule is:<br>
If its on the 'right' of the entrance, then drop rate is poor.<br>
If its past the pool room drop rate is nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukallee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kallee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dances with Skeletons</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 8:33:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1127.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skyshrine....</span><hr size=1> Yep...that is true about drop rate.<br>
Usually it was just my character and my husband so we tended to stay in the &quot;safe&quot; areas.<br>
But once in a while we could get a group to go in deeper and the drop rates were better.<br>

<br>
going right there is only one mob with a decent drop rate: Sentry Emil. Other than that, the dining room area stinks for drops.<br>
<br>
Going left (into the main part of skyshrine), that's where it gets good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Don't even bother camping for armor before the pool gateway room/bank hall entrance... the drop rates are just too low and honestly... camping even that is kinda slow.<br>
<br>
The first real camp in Skyshrine starts at the see invis golems (from the far side gate to the pool room until you hit the next gate (Sentry Rotiart room). This is good xp into the mid 50s, good gem drops (sapphires, rubies, fire emeralds, star rubies), decent plat, and (in my experience) decent armor drops (like 2-3 pieces/hr). This is also the last real spot for the guardian/sentry armor drops.<br>
<br>
The next camp is Cubes. From Sentry Rotiart, you go up the steps to just before the first Wyvern area. You can do this with 1 group of 51-55s if you don't pull the 59+ cubes (Talon Velic (for example) can flurry and hits for upper 300s). These drop brightwood spears, square helms, ethereal earrings, etc (the first mid range drops in SS), also they CAN drop the sentry/guardian weapons (gotten a guardian sword off of a cube before). The big named cubes drop very good loot (like 1 item every kill or 2) and can be taken down by a smart group of upper 50s or 2 groups of 51-55 (a few good damage dealers and/or a warrior with /disc defensive make this cake).<br>
<br>
The next 2 camps are wyvern camps (one before teleporter, one after). This is where things like haste boots, xialn mask and lath drinor drop (as well as the later wyvern camps). There are also a few wurms that either a pre-porter SS group can pull or the cube group can pull, as well as a giant statue with decent drops.<br>
<br>

I'd really like to get my hands on a Focused Ethereal Greatsword that apparently drops in Skyshrine, which I was told was pretty underpowered for the level you have to be when you're there.  Anyways, I'm not high enough for Skyshrine, but I'd really like that sword.<br>
<br>
Do you think that if you ran across one of these you could hold onto it for me?  I'll try and raise enough money to meet the price you set for it...I really wouldn't know what it's worth, so I'll let you set a price based on how much trouble you had in getting it to me.<br>
<br>
I'd really appreciate it.  It's a nice 2hs for a low level like myself.<br>

If I go back and rake that place over the coals it will be more to the time when things are light blue.  I am finding that I must level in level areas with the wife, as we typically hunt as a duo unless we find a friend or two, and we obtain items a bit behind our level in areas that turn light blue to us.  There our two classes, Shaman and SK, tend to work VERY efficiently to clear rooms and hold camps.<br>
<br>
So to answer your post, it will be a while...around 7 levels before I hit this zone with ferver and at that time I imagine that you will either have one or neither of us will want one.  Kinda like the 3 BABS the wife and I accumulated in Runnyeye over the last couple of days.<br>

It's the no-drop 2hs (on normal servers), right?  I think over the course of about a week of xp'ing up near the maze, we got maybe 2 of those.  It's underpowered for the level you have to be to get one, but it's a great twink item.  I seem to recall guild twinks trying to make a suicide run up to get one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 1:13:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1127.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That sword doesn't ..</span><hr size=1> Eh?

Actually I'm more interested in the Sarnak Ceremonial Sword, because while it isn't that great, it looks great, and I'm a sucker for looking pretty. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 7:21:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1127.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I don't much ..</span><hr size=1> .. understand the negative attitude towards twinking.  I suppose if you came from a server where people regularly put twinks into a random against primaries that would give twinking a really bad name.  Or, if you had twinks strutting about yelling about their &quot;uberness&quot; because of their gear.  Neither was the case on my old server, though.<br>
<br>
Eventually, you get to a point where when an item drops, no one wants it even for trade because the only items you want for your primary are no-drop or not traded or just plain too insanely high priced to bother trading for.  That's a long ways off for FV, but it will come.  When it does, twinking and comparing twinks is a fun way to keep the game alive.  It's like puting &quot;my kindergartener made the honor roll&quot; bumperstickers on your car.<br>
<br>
BTW, I agree about the char-limit.  I had 6 characters with back-stories; levels 60, 52, 49, 38, 9, &amp; 2 and an army of mules with random quest items.  I'm pretty sure I can get by with just 3 characters on FV -- I more or less abandonded effort on 4 of those 6, so 3 should be enough.  I hope. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugenththetiger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Genth the Tiger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 11:06:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1127.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't much ..</span><hr size=1> I'm not too sure on the drop rate...only can share my experiences from lives in other worlds....<br>
<br>
 - If you want plate go to the courtyard area - even though both guardians and sentries drop both sentry and guardian armor.<br>
<br>
 - If you want chain go to the cook hall.<br>
<br>
 - As far as the actual drop rates....from my experiences it comes in waves.  I hunted there for nearly a week on end in another world and from experience you would go say...3-4 hours with nada then all a sudden ...bam bam bam.. plate arms, legs, bp, chain boots, collar. robe etc.<br>
<br>
 - my only advice would be to just stick it out <br>
