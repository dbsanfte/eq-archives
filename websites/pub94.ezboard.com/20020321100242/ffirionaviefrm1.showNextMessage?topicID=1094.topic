<br>
After some experimenting with various classes on other servers, I decided to stick with an Erudite Magician who believes he can attain inner peace only through seeking knowledge. So inner peace for Anrathal (my character) is not a goal he can reach once and then be done with it---but it's rather &quot;sustained&quot; through learning. <br>
<br>
In any case, I was surprised to see others in Erudin as I thought most zones would be pretty much empty on FV. Made a few friends even as I was there, explored (and died alot) in Toxullia Forest a little...till some person I'll ever be grateful to advised me to go to Qeynos. Sure enough, a little put off by the whole &quot;get slaughtered by almost anything in the forest&quot; routine, I went to the docks--where I met an enchanter. We roleplayed at the docks, on the ship (even waved goodbye to Erudin, twas his first time away from home as well) In all, had a blast...<br>
<br>
So for the past two days, I've been around Qeynos---not getting lost in the city without a map, which in and of itself is an achievement <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Perhaps the most interesting thing that happened to me was falling into a pool within Qeynos and then as I was trying to get out, saw an opening and went through it---into the Qeynos Undergrounds! Met two adventurers down there, who invited me to their group...it was so random and so much fun. <br>
<br>
Last night, I've spent a good deal of time exploring Qeynos Hills and Blackburrows with a great group. Contrary to what I've read on these boards, I didn't have any problem getting into groups yet (/knocks on wood) and the majority of the people I've met have been roleplayers, some of them -great- roleplayers. After only seven seasons, my friends' list already have more than a dozen people--and I'm looking forward to meeting more of you soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Well, let me tell you mine :P<br>
<br>
I created a human SK. I started out in Freeport or Qeynos. I can't remember which, because for some reason none of the textures would SHOW UP AT ALL. All I would see was white. White white white. The walls were white. The skins of the players were white. The armor was white. Every last thing. Anyway, I think I went for the server with the lowest population, which just happened to be a PvP one. I spent a few hours looking for my guild hall and giving out unanswered OOCs, until one helpful fellow showed me the way to there, which I instantly forgot because all the landmarks were white and looked like everything else. Anyway, I handed in my stuff and kept hearing shouts like, &quot;THE DARK ELF RAN INTO THE SEWERS!&quot; Wow, I thought. A good, old-fashioned lynching! I said sardonically to myself. I think I turned in my PVP book, which turned my name red and had newbies asking me why my name was red. The hell if I knew! I'm in some crazy world where everything is white and has some queer name above it. What the hell is a Priest of Discord? Or a Guard Isfhnouiawbh? One person sent me a /tell, asking me if I was a Dark Elf Enchanter and using an illusion. I didn't reply. About an hour afterwards, I recieved a /duel from some random guy. Conned him, and he was red. I politely declined. It was at that point the guy yelled out that I was a Dark Elf, which annoyed me, along with the white textures. I think I dropped the game for a while, because I was about to vomit from all the white. Then I finally got everything fixed, but still thought more than 96% of the fan base were fan boys, assholes, or super-advanced turtles that could type with their noses. <p>Vall Shadowstrife <BR>

Sometime later, borrowed 200 bucks from a friend, agreed to pay for his EQ account for a year in return, and we hopped into Freeport together.  Killed a bunch of rats.

Much, much later, was playing Half-life, heard people talking about their twinked out characters in EQ, decided to give it a whirl.  Reinstalled, came to server selection screen.  Firiona Vie (Roleplaying Preferred).  Wiped tear from eye, entered Freeport, dueled a new half-elf friend, fought with a paladin and a warrior, nearly formed a guild with Macel of Council of Silver Griffons.

<br>
My first character, at EQ release, was a dwarf paladin and boy was she a cutey. I spent the first couple days/nights (I don't recall logging off much) running around Butcherblock lost. The game was so much different than anything else I had played...<br>
<br>
I remember making a wrong turn and after running for five minutes straight suddenly realizing I should have been at where I was going by now. I slowly turned around, seeing absolutely nothing I recognized, and a lot of mean monsters... I died out there, took a long time to find my corpse, all the time sweating it would rot with my few hard earned pieces of silver and pieces of cloth armor. :-)<br>
<br>
I remember a week into release. I didn't watch the boards back then, had no idea what was coming. Suddenly the computer speakers BOOM out. I nearly fell out of my chair in surprise. What was it? Verant had implemented rain. :-)<br>
<br>
Then it never STOPPED raining. They had a few things to adjust back in those days.<br>
<br>
I remember my first trip to the mainland, to Befallen. I never realized the more experienced dwarf I was following through the commonlands (which to this day I have never hunted in for experience) was actually following a ZONE WALL... I thought all that desert to my left was more part of the zone and was somewhat worried how I'd find my way back when I died.<br>
<br>
And boy do I ever remember Unrest. I think it was Unrest back in those days that solidified EQ's place in my heart.... we poo poo Unrest a bit now but back then in April '99 it was THE place for everyone in the east to start meeting each other, learning to group, the fun of fighting named monsters for the first time, the fun of high powered casting monsters, charming monsters (necros had charm back then, so so did the festering hags), and yes, I was the very first dwarf on my server to be in bronze armor. I was so proud. :-) I went to the crossroads in Butcherblock and, as a friend would later call it, 'hammed' it up. :-) All the other dwarves running around in scarab armor and I was in this neat orangish armor!<br>
<br>
I remember my first trip across the continent. I was L18 or so. Faydwer residents had for the most part not ventured past the commonlands yet (it seems incomprehensible to us now but back at release people stayed pretty close to their homeland for a long long time). Kithicor was no problem, sure I got lost but it wasn't dangerous. :-) Someone had told me Highkeep was insanely dangerous to try to get through so I went by way of Rivervale, seeing the halfling homeland for the first time. Runnyeye was no problem, Borxx wasn't near the entrance. :-) Then it was into the Gorge, and wouldn't you know it, I got my directions mixed up and followed the RIGHT wall not the left... and I was sweating in my boots the whole way. Finally the karanas! Sweeping plains as far as the eye could see. I was almost to my destination - I was doing the Criomil's remains quest - and finally got to South Karana... only to find out the hard way there was a LOT of skeletons in those ruins. I did survive the running fight to the bridge, and evven zoned back in to get Cromil's remains. After that I thought I'd explore a bit, went up to Blackburrow, and promptly died. :-)<br>
<br>
Ah yes... can never go back to those days. But EQ release was the most fun I'd ever had with a computer game before.<br>

That is where I first started really meeting folks after I had made that long journey from the commonlands (or that is what it seemed a the time.)  That was some of the most fun I had.  We even learned to make hot keys for trains due to unrest and mistmoor back then.<br>

I cannot believe how much you have explored in your first few days. I am the cautious sort so needless to say my traveling was, and still is to an extent, limited. I truly enjoyed conversing with you.<br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing you again sometime. It was a pleasure to meet you friend.<br>

Ooc As I am new to roleplaying, I am assuming you aren't because you did it so well, very impressive. I really thought you were a long time player just starting a new character.<br>

On one of my trips a high elf enchanter got off the boat and changed into a human.  I changed classes.  My human enchanter in Qeynos, however, didn't get a pet until level 2 and I couldn't figure out where the hell one would buy Tiny Daggers.  I was also blind so I started a Dark Elf Enchanter.  But after running around Neriak for 2 hours and still having absolutely no idea where I was...I moved to Felwith and started a high elf enchanter...which is what I now call my first character...cuz he was the first to make it past level 3 *grin* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxharian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xharian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/13/02 4:03:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1089.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my first...</span><hr size=1> Thanks alot for the warm welcome everyone and it's great to read other &quot;first day&quot; stories...<br>

Narie--I really enjoyed roleplaying with you, hope to see you at the guard tower again soon =) I wouldn't have explored this much if it wasn't for a chain of random events really...I didn't even know where the Plains of Karana were--but someone I grouped with proposed to make armor for another group member and she needed cat pelts. So they decided to go there and I followed. Well it's been two days now but I've found the area really interesting and intend to stay for awhile. Still have a bag I must deliver to Highpass Hold though, so one of these days I'll follow the &quot;To Highpass Hold&quot; sign and see what lies there =)<br>
