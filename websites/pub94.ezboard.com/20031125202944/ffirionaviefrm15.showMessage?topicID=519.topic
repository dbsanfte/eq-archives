<br>
 I think this question comes up a lot just in general. <br>
When in a group if you get a pick up especially.<br>
I have no clue WHY, but it seems I get hit on by 40% more FEMALE toons than the male.<br>
The males that have grouped with me and know me, usually get it. <br>
I don't giggle, laugh, blush and run around talking about my breasts or whistling at naked barbs, and shirtless human monks.<br>
Of course I play a paladin and that just wouldn't be very..<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>paladinish</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
If I were a rogue barb maybe. Or a dark race. Not sure.<br>
I tried playing a shadowknight DE and went to aide the first paladin that shouted for help.<br>
I suxed at being evil for a day.<br>
That and well...ehh, not knowing dwarves would hate me...*sobs* not the dwarves! Couldn't have that.<br>
<br>
Actually, ever since the day an ogre chased me through the desert of Ro to take me home as his pet and I jumped into the ocean and drown (knowing he wouldn't dare enter the ocean as it would be like taking a bath), can't say it has been <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">too</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> bad.<br>
(I think my killing myself to avoid him was a BIG clue.)<br>
<br>
A few hail me and ask if I am still sticking to that whole non-drinking, celibate thing and tell me how they could change my mind. Normal guy thang.<br>
But the female toons..WOW aggressive. Flirty, huggy, purry!<br>
I hate to outright hurt anyone's feelings.<br>
I do not FLIRT with them!<br>
I usually ASSUME they must be MEN. <br>
I cannot imagine with rl statistics that FV is somehow overrun by this many lesbian women. To just be inviting them into group or having met them one or two times to send me tells how they.<br>
ehhhh...*etc* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(this is not anything against lifestyle choices, I have no problem with your RL gig.<br>
I actually think the males playing women chasing the other female toons makes it more difficult/causes more prejudice. That's a diff poll all together though ehh?)<br>
<br>
I think YES, FV has more crossover as it is a RP server. Women are curious to see if they can play a man or don't want to get hit on by men, or want to be the leader without people saying, &quot;Have a seat little lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have noticed the female TOONS DO get buffed more often, forgiven for screw ups, offers to aide them, free gear etc. than the male toons. <br>
I have known males who make their female toons for that SOLE purpose.<br>
<br>
Ask if you're curious. I doubt they will tell you the truth one way or the other unless it goes to that..cross-over where RL might get involved or...ehh making ....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
getting married etc.<br>
I think the only concrete way to know would be to talk to them on the phone/over computer...<br>
I wouldn't feel comfortable with giving my phone number out to anyone. <br>
Someone with 3 brain cells could figure out ALL your personal information-- from where you lived, to your car license, SSN from just your phone number.<br>
*shivers at the thought*<br>
That is asking for trouble in my opinion.<br>
<br>

Yes. Both of my characters are. I have, on occasion, played a friend's male character.. but I prefer playing my own gender.<br>
Have you ever played a toon that wasn't your gender? Not on my own account, no.<br>
Was it your main? No.<br>
Did you get past 55 with it? No.<br>
If so was it:<br>
Female playing male? Yes.<br>
Did you have in game relationships with opposite gender toons? No. I tend to play my male friend's character OOC. <br>
<br>
As to the whole harrassment issue, I haven't really had it happen to me via a male character. However, there is a certain female character that won't leave me alone. I suspect she's played by a male.. though she says otherwise. *sighs* <br>
<br>
In the RP environment, I really don't care what RL gender someone is. Like Didi, I interact with what/whoever they appear to be. However, neither of my characters are lesbians, nor even have tendencies, so when girl characters flirt with her, it doesn't do anything but annoy her. *shrugs* <br>
<br>
I have found that I get along best with female characters who end up being played by real females, though the reverse hasn't necessarily been true. One of my favorite male characters is played by a girl and I love him to death. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have two accounts of opposite genders and play both about equally. - Not presently but I did for a few months<br>
No way I only play my own gender that would be lying and WRONG! - false<br>

I have two accounts of opposite genders and play both about equally. no<br>
Have you ever played a toon that wasn't your gender? Yes<br>
Was it your main? Yes, on that server<br>
Did you get past 55 with it? nope all of level 5<br>
If so was it:Barb Warrior<br>
A male playing female? no<br>
Female playing male? yes<br>
Did you have in game relationships with opposite gender toons? Yes girl on girl but other &quot;girl&quot; was a guy and it was in public /say for shits n giggles.... highly amusing at the time<br>
<br>
on the barb warrior however i do see why guys play girls too my god lumbering around as a square box with swords is graphically boring... however dark elf males &quot;though petit&quot; are a bit better...  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://myimgs.com/data/siobahn/Kahyla3.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
