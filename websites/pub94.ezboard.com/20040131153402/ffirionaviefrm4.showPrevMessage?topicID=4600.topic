I realize that I am just an amateur at this, but come on people!<br>
<br>
Clerics - you get spell haste buffs.  So when my shaman asks for it, please don't shout at me various forms of &quot;You newb, clerics don't have haste!&quot;  I have independently verified this with a nice 65 cleric, so I know I'm not on crack.  You might even want to cast in on (gasp) all the casters in your group!<br>
<br>
Clerics - you can get aggro from your heals.  So maybe, when working in an adventure, you could either time your complete heals between fights or just not sit down right after you cast it.  Either of these would be preferable to yelling at tank01.  <br>
<br>
Rangers - you get a lovely spell called snare.  And for reference, the tornados in LDoN do run.  So snare them please.  If you're out of mana, stop nuking.  Snare is your job, learn it, love it, live it. Yes, I know its hard to get them snared sometimes.  No one is perfect.  <br>
<br>
Anyone not the main tank - New concept here!  Don't get riposted when the back of the mob is available!  Don't taunt for no reason!   <br>
<br>
Everyone - The time period between accepting an adventure is for finding the entrance, buffing, medding, getting roles straight.  Not for running to PoK to beg for KEI, Virtue, etc.  Not for training the rally point with Equestrielle or the pained unicorn.  Not for suddenly mentioning that you can't group with %%WORD196% or %%WORD197%.  <br>
<br>
%%WORD198% - It is not necessary to have a foolish message broadcast to say, group, raid, guild, tell, and shout every time you cast every spell.  Yes, announcing heals is a great idea.  Announcing debuffs is good too!  But do we have to hear &quot;Take that you puny %t eat hot flaming death&quot; every time you cast?  <br>
<br>
And last but not least - No, the shamans and clerics in your group cannot port you.  Well, we can, but we don't want to.  We're snobbish and don't like to port others.  So when you ignore my offer to cast Spirit of Wolf on everyone outside the dungeon before I self-port, don't whine and start running.  <br>
<br>
Ok, I lied.  My real last point is DON&quot;T PANIC.  The normal difficulty adventures aren't really that hard.  So if someone dies, goes linkdead, kei fails, we pull 3, or any other minor hiccup happens.... relax.   It will be ok.  I'll protect you.  <br>

On one note, I used to group with a wizard a long time ago who would announce &quot;nuking %t with GREAT BALL OF FIRE for 1200 dmg&quot; and I would just say, what a jerk off!<br>
<br>
But, he later explained that if two people nuke at the same time when the mob is below 10% health, its sometimes a waist as you double (ie 1 nuke takes it to 2% and the other nuke is pretty much a waste of mana).<br>
<br>
So sometimes announcing things is a good idea, even if its not a debuff or a heal.<br>
<br>

<br>
I was stunned over this past weekend.  It has been established that I'm officially a group snob.<br>
<br>
I was told three times in the past several days *NOT* to mez (by different people).  The tank in one group seemed to think that he could handle all two or three mobs without a problem.  Let me explain something for all you idiots that think we (enchanters) shouldn't mez.<br>
<br>
When you have multiple mobs and the tank doesn't have AoE taunt, the mobs are going to chase after the healer as soon as s/he tries to heal your sorry ass.  Not only do you run the risk of wiping the group by knocking out the healer, but even if the healer manages to live, you've now run the healer officially oom. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So we're running low on time in one particular dungeon group and the tank decides to start &quot;chain pulling&quot; mobs.  Okay, fine.  So he drags two or three back with him (remember, I've been told that I'm not supposed to mez) and as the healer starts to run lom, he says that he'll heal in between pulls.  I asked him how he was going to heal during &quot;downtime&quot; when he's supposed to be chain pulling.  He didn't respond. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Then he offers the incredible suggestion of using LoH if things get nasty with these multiple pulls.  Great, wonder boy.  What are you going to do for the next 90 minutes after you use LoH?<br>
<br>
I just don't understand what it is with some of these people that I've been grouping with.  Do anyone you know what an enchanter does?  <br>
<br>
I'm the person that can keep 4-5 mobs permanently mezzed while the cleric meds to heal your sorry ass.  I can pacify mobs so that you can pull singles.  I can save mana for the group healer by slowing.  I can increase your dps by casting haste.  I can make your mana regen faster.  I can nuke.  I can DoT.  I'm a very diverse class and can help tremendously in groups if you'll just shut up and let me do what I need to do.<br>
<br>
Also, what the deal is with shamans not slowing?  Guys, you have the *BEST* slows in the game.  I was told by one shaman that it &quot;takes too much mana.&quot;  If you're killing stuff so quickly that slow isn't really beneficial, great!  But in most of the groups I've been in, slow has been a huge benefit.  If the shaman is the main healer in a group, I have NO problem slowing.  But if you're not the main healer, learn what the strengths of your classes are.  (Note:  This isn't directed to the shaman above.  I don't think I've ever grouped with you.)<br>
<br>
Also, what the hell is it with the paladins and shadowknights not being able to keep aggro?  I'm sorry, but USE YOUR SPELLS!  I can understand a warrior having a difficult time keeping aggro unless they have weapons that proc, but I've seen paladins and shadowknights taunt mobs off a warrior anyday.  WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS DO THE SAME?!?!<br>
<br>
If I group with one more paladin or shadowknight that stops pulling because they need a &quot;med break&quot;, I think I'm going to completely lose it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
By the way, it drives me completely nuts when every single person in the group starts announcing that their buffs are fading.  I know how long my buffs last.  I have a nifty little timer that I use that tells me when your haste is about to fade.  If for some reason I forget to set it, I don't need every single one of you to tell me that you lost it at the same time.<br>
<br>
When people buff, they usually buff in group order.  When the buff fades on yourself, you refresh it and move on down the list.  When my little clarity buff icon starts blinking, I know yours is about to start blinking.  I'm already flipping through my spellbook or casting on you by the time you announce it.<br>
<br>
For heaven's sake people, learn to assist.  If you're the MT and you switch targets, CALL IT.  If mez breaks once, okay.  It was an accident.  Don't do it again.  If it breaks twice, I start to get a little annoyed.  If it breaks three or more times, I open up my spell book, replace my mez spells with my highest nuke and my gate spell.  Then I start playing wizzie. <br>
<br>
I don't usually tell people how to play their class.  But I swear, I've gotten so frustrated with some people the past few days.  I just don't understand how people can make it to their 40s or 50s without having some fundamental knowledge on how to play their class or what other classes do.<br>
<br>

<br>
Don't spam.  Just pay attention.  Interrupt your spells (/duck) to save mana.  The only announcements I don't mind are the pulling messages, healing, mezzes, slows (usually important at higher levels so the cleric/druid/shaman knows when to begin a cheal) and evac messages.  All the other ones are useless spam.  <br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  This is only for grouping.  In raids, I want more messages so that all debuffs are done in order.  Nothing like someone dispelling slow because they didn't announce it.<br>
<br>
But anyway, I don't care how much you nuke for.  I don't care that you're backstabbing.  I don't need to hear about how you're assisting this person (everyone should know who the MT is at the start of the group - you don't need to keep reminding us).  I don't want to hear about how you're casting a DoT and how much damage it will do over how long.<br>
<br>
Just learn to do your job and I'll do mine.<br>

Rogues who take agro LOL well it is easy to do esp with poisons/twinked weapons.. and yes it sucks evade fails sometimes LOL but there are ways to work around that. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You forgot to whine about the Shamans who do not malo<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I want to correct a possible misinterpretation. I have a 62 shaman whose mana pool is considerably less than that of my 65 mage. When I'm playing the shaman I hardly ever cast malo. 3 malo casts pretty much eat up what she can get back from canni5. I'll use it on LDoN bosses, and raid targets, but seldom in exp groups. When there's a higher level mage in the group (almost often, actually, since I duo a lot) the mage takes care of normal daily malosinia needs.<br>
<br>
In regular LDoN fights the shaman will happily cast malosini on every mob, of course, since it not only takes less mana but also casts much faster.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the person I quoted meant to generalize to malosini/a. I use &quot;sini&quot; or &quot;sinia&quot; for shorthand to avoid confusion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=waii>waii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 271<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/03 5:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4594.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Correct me if I'm wrong but...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>didn't you hear me?

This is called a contradiction, k?<br>
<br>
If we use our spells, our mana will slowly drain away, an easy deduction.  This inevitably results in being &quot;Out of Mana&quot;.<br>

I'm all for using my spells, in fact I think I can hold aggro pretty well on Ashrie, but to say I shouldn't have to med is just a lil ludicrous.  I don't always have KEI...<br>

What is the point of being a hybrid if you cannot cast?<br>
<br>
I will add some agro spell, Aura of hate, Zeferr and throw a spear or two on a fight - and thats all my mana can hold.. hybrids have to ration there mana or save it for burst's.. so yeah any good hybrid (excluding bards mana reasons) should squeeze any extra med time they can when they can.. you cant ever have enough mana.<br>

What is going through your mind please tell me.<br>
<br>
Do you think that warrior who has to be in melee range is going to taunt it off you as you repeatedly snatch the mob out of their effective taunt range? Think that mob hits you any less while you're running laps around a dungeon? Maybe you're trying to run outta range of your healer so you DO die and really have something to bitch about right?<br>
<br>
Best slowers/nukers I've met normally know they will pull agro when they cast and move closer to the mob so that when it does turn on them, the MT doesnt have to run around getting massive OORange messages.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, SK/Paladins who cant get agro are just lazy or have the worst casters ever in their groups. Period end of discussion.<br>
<br>
Ohhhhhh almost forgot! Mezzing mobs!! After you mezz one, and the first mob dies and everyone moves to the next. The tank normally taunts (unless they SUCK!). While they are doing this, please stop mem-mother-fucking-bluring the damn mob. You effectively wipe out every damned taunt they do. Memblur BEFORE they start taunting, not WHILE they are.<br>

Why is it we never see a thread about people who don't?<br>
<br>
A well-played bard or enchanter can reliable feed single-pulls at a perfect pace.  These classes, more than any other, can make or break an adventure.<br>
<br>
The shaman/ ranger who, in addition to their slowing/ dps duties, does such good crowd control or pulling with just their root spell, you hardly notice that you forgot to bring a mezzer.<br>
<br>
Tanks who manage aggro well -- even when you have adds, and no mezzer.<br>
<br>
Monks/ Rogues/ Wizards who do so much damage, you don't notice them until they LD, and it suddenly takes an extra 30 seconds/ mob.<br>
<br>
Druids/ shamans who, when forced into a healer role, do just fine and never require a med break.<br>
<br>
Etc, etc.  What amazes me about LDoN is not the idiots.  Sure, there are some of them, and they make for funny posts.  But most of the folks I have met are at least competent, and some are just outstanding.  Heck, there are some names that, when you see them in the group you just joined, instantly make you think &quot;Ok, we win.&quot;<br>
<br>
For me, hunting with those folks is the good part of LDoN. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aglaranniaspellweaver>Aglarannia Spellweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/03 6:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4594.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Correct me if I'm wrong but...</span><hr size=1> It's not really a contradiction.<br>
<br>
I understand that if you're continuously casting, you'll eventually have to med.  But there is such a thing as mana management.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm speaking from an enchanters point of view.  If I'm grouped with a paladin or a shadowknight, I cast clarity on them as well.  So they always have SOME FORM of mana regen on them.<br>
<br>
My gripe is about those hybrid tanks that will stop a group and sit there and insist that they med to full mana AFTER EACH PULL.  I'm serious.  I've had it happen.  It was a shadowknight in particular that I was grouped with that time.  I've never experienced anything like this before and I think my jaw dropped each time he insisted he needed a &quot;med break&quot;.<br>
<br>
Imasu, I think the running away is a normal case of panic.  Casters get hit, freak out because their hitpoints can't handle it and lack any sort of faith in their healer to save them.  Instead, maybe if they run around, they'll be able to escape. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I really think that more casters should focus on hitpoint gear AND mana gear, and not just mana gear.  <br>
<br>
It is a lot easier for a tank to peel a mob off a caster when you're not moving around though.  I know that I get a little bit nervous when the healer isn't quick on the heal button and I have a mob beating on me.  To my knowledge though, I don't make it a habit to run around in circles unless I'm intentionally kiting a mob. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If people in my group did that. I would warn them once.. Hey if you run out of (cleric) healing range you will die stand still .. <br>
<br>
If you run the mob around (warrior) then I can not taunt or hit the damn thing.<br>
<br>
If they keep doing it I stand still and dont hit/heal or whatever then when they die the mob goes back to where it should be.<br>
<br>
Trust me people learn fast that way. LOL<br>
<br>
<br>
Also the malo thing was a generalization I realize that mages also can cast a similar spell .. I am speaking for when people complain cause the mobs run due to no snare yet they wont help snare land by debuffing mob. <br>
<br>
<br>
I will say I have not played all the classes, but the few I have played and lvled I do know and know well , but even I can still learn a new trick or two.  I am also always willing to accept constructive criticism.  I am also more than willing to hand some out as well hehe.<br>
