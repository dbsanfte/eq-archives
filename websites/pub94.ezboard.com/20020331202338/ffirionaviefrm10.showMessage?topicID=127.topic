Qeynos, was an unusual disciple of the Hall of<br>
Sorcery.  She was not skilled in the art of the<br>
Magician, nor was she a Wizard or Enchantress.<br>
<br>
Solusek Ro had blessed her with Fire's healing<br>
power, and she had become a Shaman of the <br>
Burning Prince.  Such a healer was extremely rare.<br>
<br>
Usually, Shamans worshipped the Tribunal, or <br>
if they were evil, they turned themselves over to<br>
Rallos Zek, Innoruuk, or the feared Cazic-Thule. <br>
The Vah Shir on Luclin were rumored to be Agnostic.<br>
<br>
However, in Chrysothemis' case, her circumstances<br>
were much more odd.  She had once been a Bard <br>
who worshipped Solusek Ro in awe of his force and<br>
power.  Seeing her devotion, the Lord of Flame gave<br>
her Shamanic powers, and soon her healing ways were<br>
as strong and beautiful as her voice.  Ro was proud.<br>
<br>
She strolled into Fish's Ale in South Qeynos one hot<br>
summer evening, and she looked about at the patrons<br>
all bloated with ale.  One in particular stood out.  He<br>
was sober and tranquil, dressed in a silver plate suit.<br>
Only he did not join Klieb Torne, Micc Koter, and the<br>
bumbling dwarf Trumpy Irontoe in their drinking binge.<br>
<br>
Who was this man?  Chrysothemis stepped closer<br>
and sat on a stool next to him.  He sipped his drink,<br>
gazing at the Half Elf witch lass of Ro with a kind but <br>
measuring glance.  What god did he follow?  Surely<br>
not Brell Serilis, who inhaled ale like air.  And surely<br>
not Innoruuk, for hate could never have any part of<br>
his face.  She hoped the knight would speak to her.<br>

I was tired, after the long journey from Freeport to Qeynos. There were still whispers and rumors that had passed in the night. The rain beat down heavily as he traveled, and he longed for a place to rest within the night.<br>
<br>
He passed Crow's by the city gates, but knew his reputations all too well and continued on. He found his way to the Fishes Ale and entered within. All fell to a silence upon the cloaked figures entrance. Banegrivm drew off his cloak, and the sheen of brilliant golden plate glinted in the dull tavern.<br>
<br>
He walked towards a table, setting his damp cloak upon a peg. He sat down, noting Trumpy Irontoe and keeping his blade at his side at all times. He turned to to the bartender and called for a bottle of milk.<br>
<br>
The bartender slid the mug towards me as he always had, and I smiled up at him sliding a platinum crown towards him. I felt bad knowing such an honest man had such patrons that made deals with the devils themselves, and always made sure to tip him well.<br>
<br>
As I sat, and felt the warmth return to me and sipped from my drink I noticed a slender feminine form slide up to the seat beside me. I leaned to one side, to turn my glance toward her while my free hand slid to the pomel of my blade. It wouldn't be unlike S'raag to send one of his minions after me, or Yean or some other villain with whom I had aquired the debt of a grudge with.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello milady&quot;, I said nodding to her solemnly as I continued to sip from the mug of warm milk. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaxalygen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/19/02 8:50:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Solusek Ro...is that you?!</span><hr size=1> I humbly requested a beveled-glass flask of Elven Wine from Fish Ranamer, the bartender.  I kept one eye<br>
on him, and one eye on the gleaming and fiery god <br>
that I saw sitting next to me on a wooden barstool.<br>
<br>
He was surely the avatar of my Master, the brash and powerful Solusek Ro!  Who else would have one hand <br>
on his gleaming sword, and the other poised on a mere mug of milk with so much power and strength?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Pax!&quot; I gasped, out of breath.  &quot;I come in peace,<br>
Burning Prince!  Solusek Ro, may your great flames <br>
consume all that is vile...all that is hateful and seeks<br>
to fill Norrath with fear!  Snuff out Disease, save for<br>
when I channel it in your great Name!  Hear your <br>
servant, Milord!&quot;  I prostrated myself on the ground.<br>
<br>
Fish Ranamer, confused by this sight, lay my small<br>
flask of Elven Wine next to my hand.  I picked it up,<br>
drank some, and then began a rise in bodily heat<br>
that only the most favored of the Lord of Flame can <br>
withstand.  Slowly, as if I were a log on the hearth, <br>
I smoldered and  burst into flame.  I then warbled:<br>
<br>
&quot;Exalted Ro, from Plane of Sun to Norrath came,<br>
 Your crown as molten gold, your eyes as flame!<br>
  So fearlessly and forcefully you incite Change!<br>
  Most highly favored Prince!<br>
  Sol-u-sek!&quot;  (I turned this into a bold 7-syllable word,<br>
  prolonging the 'Sol' part into 5 distinct notes.)<br>
<br>
I let the flames of my body die down, stood up,<br>
still steaming heavily, and wondered why everyone<br>
inside Fish's Ale was laughing at us!  How rude!<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not Solusek Ro, my young Chrysothemis!<br>
That's some fool Paladin who doesn't follow the <br>
Brell!&quot; howled Trumpy Irontoe.  &quot;HAAAA ha ha ha!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I couldn't decide whether he was laughing more at the<br>
golden knight or at me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 11:26:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solusek Ro...is that you?!</span><hr size=1> I looked over at Trumpy Irontoe, only to stare daggers as he knew that I had come to know the truth of him and of his dark master that lay within the sewers below. The dwarfs smile swiftly faded as one hand moves away from the mug on the bar, and the other now more obviously moved to grasp the hilt of my sword.<br>
<br>
I looked over at the half elf that was before me, and back over to the bar, now relaxing my group upon my blade. &quot;I am a simply knight milady. My name is Banegrivm, I am a paladin of Mithaniel Marr, the Lord of Valor.&quot; What tis thy name? <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaxalygen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 4:40:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My escape from Freeport  (P.S.  I'm a Bard now.)</span><hr size=1> I smiled at Banegrivm, a rosy blush tinting my <br>
cheeks.  &quot;I am Chrysothemis of Ro.  Solusek<br>
Ro is my deity, and I see that Mithaniel and He<br>
have a friendly rivalry together.&quot;  My face grew<br>
pleasantly hot.  This one certainly wasn't like any <br>
of the brash Dwarven Paladins I had seen traveling<br>
through Freeport.  For one thing, he drank no ale!<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you abstain from the liquorly pleasures,&quot;<br>
I grinned.  &quot;Aye, 'tis good.  Spirits cloud your<br>
judgment, and though I drink wine, 'tis only to<br>
start cleansing fire to course through my veins.&quot;<br>
<br>
Banegrivm nodded.  He seemed to smile at me,<br>
although in a cautious and meditative manner.  I<br>
could tell this was a man that did not let his inner<br>
heart boil over his surface, as mine sometimes did.<br>
<br>
I lowered my head and my eyes halfway, intending<br>
to tell him a secret.  &quot;I had to escape from Freeport.<br>
The dung-filled streets and menacing Militia were <br>
beginning to make me uneasy, and I also had <br>
trouble with Pietro Zarn.&quot;  Pietro Zarn, fear the <br>
name, was the leader of the Church of the <br>
Dismal Rage, a Human enclave of Innoruuk <br>
followers.  He was a powerful Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pietro Zarn saw me as I strolled through the city<br>
on holiday.  Many had said the City Founded on<br>
Sweat and Steel was the greatest of all cities, but<br>
I found it filled with dark rogues and the most fetid of<br>
dung heaps.  To me, Freeport was trash.  Pietro<br>
lusted after my blazing red armor--and blazing-red<br>
lips.  He asked me if I were a half-courtesan.&quot;<br>
<br>
Half-courtesans, of the Bards, were not the singers<br>
who sold their love easily.  One man would pay a<br>
top price for a girl, and she would become his<br>
mistress for life unless the suitor gave her some<br>
beige silk slippers, which meant &quot;go and good-bye.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I told Zarn that I was indeed a half-courtesan.<br>
<br>
He said he would gather up every coin--copper,<br>
silver, gold, platinum--that the Church of the Dismal<br>
Rage had.  He said that the work of Innoruuk <br>
could wait a thousand years, but that the half-<br>
courtesan Bard girl of Solusek only came along<br>
once in an Age.  Pietro vowed to pay the highest<br>
price possible for me at the Bards' bidding table.<br>
<br>
That night,&quot; I finished, gazing at Banegrivm<br>
intensely, &quot;I fled Freeport entirely, yearning for<br>
my home back here.  I cannot stand Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wondered if Banegrivm would reject me now,<br>
because I was not only a Bard, but a fiery semi-tart.<br>
<br>

My hand rested from my sword hilt and returned to my cup before me, and my attentions now turned to this maiden before me.<br>
<br>
The more she spoke, the more I was at ease. A pleasant distraction from the toils of the world about me, yet also did I feel sad for her troublesome past.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry milady that such wickedness would befall thee in fair Freeport.&quot;, I said as I looked upon her. &quot;The city of valor is not as it once was. It was once a bright and beautiful place until Sir Lucan fell from grace and brought his evil hold upon it. Now it is a place many fight to seek to restore in the name of our father&quot;, I said as I sipped from my mug looking almost distant for but a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pietro Zarn and his allies of the Church of the Firstborn are my immortal enemies. I would gladly die upon a field of battle then lower myself to their subjections and influences&quot;, my lips turned to a half scowel and my body tightened its posture. I watched out of the corner of my eyes, knowing Trumpy Irontoe had overheard of me. I shifted my eyes in his direction and my jaw stiffened. I watched as he shakenly set down his mug and made haste out into the streets of fair Qeynos.<br>
<br>
I reverted my gaze and looked down into the mugs contents, still somewhat tense, but then over to the maiden before and smiled. I could still see her gaze looking towards the floor. I raised my armor clad hand to her, and raised her chin to look her in the eyes. &quot;Fear not the works of Pietro Zarn milady, for the dread lord fears the light. Thee has naught to fear as long as thee dwells amidst the places of the light&quot;, I smiled at her and drank from my cup. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaxalygen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 1:39:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A plot from the followers of Ro...</span><hr size=1> I gazed into Banegrivm's kind eyes.  He was<br>
certainly not the judgmental soul that some of<br>
my fellow Bards had told me that the Paladins<br>
of Mithaniel Marr were.  The touch of his golden-<br>
plated hand brought warmth and healing to my<br>
heart.  I knew I would fear Innoruuk's minions<br>
no more.  Pietro Zarn would burn under the sword<br>
of this Banegrivm Shadowblight, and I knew it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Milord,&quot; I said, looking up, &quot;there is a plot <br>
contrived by my fellow followers of Solusek Ro<br>
back in Freeport that I think you should know <br>
about.  It concerns you in great detail.&quot;<br>
<br>
I took a sharp, deep breath that did not nourish<br>
me.  This would be hard to tell him, but I went on. <br>
<br>
&quot;I not only fled Freeport to stave off the advances of<br>
Pietro Zarn, but some of the Wizards of the Academy<br>
of Arcane Science are incensed by the arrogant and<br>
self-righteous attitude of the North Freeport Knights<br>
in that city.  They told me they were sending me to<br>
find a Paladin who worshipped Mithaniel Marr and<br>
to humble his pride...through winning a duel with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
My eyes were troubled.  &quot;I am sent by the Wizards,<br>
Magicians, and Enchanters of Ro to duel you and<br>
win, and as a token of my victory, to take your<br>
Insignia of Mithaniel Marr that you wear with such<br>
honor and pride.&quot;  Such insignia were given to <br>
victors of duels as a sign of humility and submission<br>
by the conquered competitor.  I was to retrieve it<br>
from Banegrivm Shadowblight, Mithaniel's Knight.<br>
<br>
I took out my fiery dagger imbued with three fire<br>
opals molten into the silvery handle.  Without malice,<br>
but with humility in my voice, I said, &quot;I challenge thee<br>
to a duel, milord, by the will of the Flame Devotees<br>
of my lord Solusek Ro.&quot;  I bowed my head, saddened<br>
by this thing that I had been sent to my home to do.<br>
<br>
As for Pietro...that came after my mission had been<br>
told to me, and I truly wished I were back with him,<br>
dueling HIM and his Hatred.

Solusek, after all, tended to ally Himself with the <br>
Gods of the Light, and if Mithaniel Marr were defeated,<br>
it would surely tend to upset my dear Burning Prince.<br>
<br>
After all, Ro meant Mithaniel no harm.  Solusek<br>
simply intended to be like Bristlebane and have a<br>

&quot;Sir, your words have graced me.  I simply cannot<br>

of course, but you might have slashed me to shreds!&quot;<br>

honesty, the Bidding Days are a bit wild and rowdy,<br>
and while all of my potential buyers are kind, none <br>
of them love me yet.  They only hear that a servant<br>
of Solusek Ro is up for the bid, and all of them would<br>
rip their lungs out (a true horror for Bards) to have<br>
a Fiery girl as their mistress!&quot;  I winked a violet eye.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Lieutenant Arathur, high commander of<br>
the Qeynos Guard, stepped into Fish's Ale with a <br>
purposeful stride.  As soon as he saw me, he glared.<br>
<br>
&quot;Chrysothemis of Ro, you shall pay for your pride,&quot;<br>
he said sternly.  &quot;Certain members of the Academy<br>
of Arcane Science in Freeport have sealed a pact<br>
with you.  You are to find a Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<br>
and duel him.  Such a paladin, you have heard, bears<br>
an Insignia of Mithaniel that you are to have if you win.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is true,&quot; I gasped, out of breath.  &quot;Banegrivm<br>
Shadowblight here has that very same badge, and I<br>
have decided not to brandish my dagger against him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well,&quot; growled Arathur, &quot;but even so, he is not<br>
the one you were destined to duel.  It is I you will <br>
fight, and I'll prove it.  What metal did the Wizards<br>
say that this Insignia of Mithaniel was made of?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The finest platinum,&quot; I purred, my voice filled with<br>
arrogance.  Then I choked, startled.  &quot;Sir Banegrivm<br>
has a gold one!&quot; I trembled at Arathur.  His Insignia,<br>
shining boldly, was made of pure, gleaming platinum.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is I you will fight.&quot;  The Lieutenant's voice rang <br>
with authority, and the drunken rogues shook!<br>
<br>
Raising my head haughtily, I declared, &quot;We will<br>
duel.  Such a fight can only take place in the arena,<br>
the red Grounds of Fate, under the hot gaze of the <br>
Warlord, Rallos Zek!&quot;   <br>
<br>
&quot;Done!&quot; Lieutenant Arathur's voice now boomed out<br>
with power.  &quot;If you win this fight, fiery Bard, great<br>
Miss Chrysothemis of Ro, you shall win my Insignia<br>
to take back to your Wizard friends in the Academy.<br>
If you lose, haughty one, you shall humble yourself<br>
before all in the arena and prostrate yourself in the <br>
dust.&quot;  His wager contained an air of inexorability.<br>
<br>
I placed my hand in his.  &quot;At votahct!&quot; I cried.  This<br>
was said to be Solusek Ro's declaration of war when he began burning Tunaria, now known as Antonica.  &quot;At&quot;,<br>
in the ancient Flame Tongue, meant &quot;it,&quot; and &quot;votahct,&quot;<br>
a half-verb and half-noun, was the ultimate cry of &quot;War!&quot;,<br>
second only to Rallos Zek's great shout of battle. <br>
<br>
&quot;At votacht,&quot; muttered Arathur, with grudging respect.<br>
He took my arm fiercely, which duelers did to ensure<br>
that neither one turned a coward and fled.  Behind<br>
us came Klieb Torne, Micc Koter, the Ranamers, and<br>
Trumpy Irontoe, plus other patrons of Fish's Ale and <br>
the bouncer, Ragna Sehjar.  We were a fine parade!<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure that Banegrivm would come.  Just as<br>
well.  I suspected it was against nature to view such<br>
inherently proud things as duels, except...he might<br>
come, I thought, to see me win, and to see the great<br>
Lieutenant Arathur brought low if...when...he lost! :-)<br>
