For example, take, say, a retired person, who can play 16 hours a day, enjoys doing so, and does so. He will almost certainly level faster than someone who plays an hour every other night. In comparison to the person who plays 3.5 hours per week, he will almost definitely gain levels FAR faster. And that will be so even if 75 percent of his time is sitting in the bar in FP telling folks stories of his exploits the other 25 percent of the time. And he can be an avid RPer as well.<br>
<br>
Now take someone who actually has that much time and RPs someone who avidly seeks 'power', e.g. more powerful spells, weapons, whatever. There certainly have been such characters in fantasy literature and it is not impossible to conceive of someone roleplaying such a character. Even to the extent that if they can get some druid or cleric or enchanter or whatever to do their bidding and facilitate their acquisition of power (read: leveling), that they would do so in a heartbeat. Perhaps they are thinking 'Foolish druid. Yes, you help me gain this power and I shall someday repay you...with death!'<br>
<br>
Who is to say that that cannot be roleplaying? Are we to understand that you are the one who defines what is and what is not roleplaying? What violates it and what does not? What actions we can perform, what motivations we can have for those actions? I don't think so. I am an adult, and fully capable of making such determinations on my own and not only do I not need some Big Brother type looking over my shoulder and telling me how I should play, I sorely resent it when people try to do so.<br>
<br>
People who annoy me I put on ignore and pretend they don't exist. If that doesn't work for you, well boo hoo. But in no way, shape or form will I have my actions dictated by another person. Ultimately *I* am responsible for my actions, so I will decide what those actions are, and bear full responsibility for them, for good or for ill. I don't need a 'roleplaying parent', I don't want one, and I won't accept one. If you try to be one, you will be one of those I ignore and pretend does not exist. Which *does* work for me.<br>

<br>
I'm going to weigh in here on the power of suspension of disbelief, like an earlier poster.<br>
<br>
I'm IC a *lot*, even in the forums and email.  But I know people who from choice, or lack of experience, or sheer bloody-minded ignorance are not.  Depending on *their* attitude, and how far they are willing to bend in my direction for my sake, I am willing to bend with them.<br>
<br>
When I meet someone like Shintou, it's fun.  I know I'm just gonna be IC with him.  If I *have* to check on something, or make OOC plans, like timing schedules, I'll say so. ((   )).  And he copes with it, politely (surprising, isn't it).<br>
<br>
I rarely meet anyone who is *willfully* being OOC, and won't accept my being IC.  Someone who comes at me and wont' *let* me try to roleplay is the largest candidate for /ignore that I know.  Some fellow came by a Sister's event, an IC event, and was consciously OOC mocking all of us.  That was *not* fun.  <br>
<br>
Yet, At one point, Shintou came by where some of my Sisters were having a guild meeting.  He came and disrupted it for awhile, totally IC.  We all had a great time, and when we had to get back to work, he left.  When he &quot;kidnapped&quot; me at the end of my wedding ceremony, he did it with my full foreknowledge and planning, working carefully to be sure that he was not hurting someone's feelings OOC on an important and emotional occasion.<br>
<br>
On the flip side of the coin, I've heard that Fire and Fury is not a role-playing guild, does not focus on role-playing, or several other variations of same.  But I've never had one member that I've interacted with not be willing to deal with me IC, or who in any way violated my sense of IC.  In fact, the first time someone told me that F&amp;F wasn't an RP guild, I laughed, because the only 2 members I knew at that time had done some very nice, quiet RPing with me.  One of them even promised to teach me Iksar, though he spoke human perfectly well.  (/waves at her nice Iksar friend.)<br>
<br>
The only other problem I've run into on this server so far, was one person who was so totally IC, that you couldn't communicate with her.  She was playing an extreme personality type, and blithly ignored completely all my attempts to even attempt to find out if she was just playing an extreme, or if she was in fact being OOC totally rude and offensive.  Even after I walked away, I was getting tells from her that made me not want to have anything to do with her.  I've never seen her since that day, and am glad.<br>
<br>
So my advice boils down to this:  If you see something you think isn't IC, either make up a rationale in your head IC for it, or ignore it.  It never happened.  Or - stop and talk OOC for just a minute with them.  They might be willing to accomodate your own requests for IC, if they know you can stop and be OOC at them long enough to make them comfortable.  Even in a game, it's nice to be able to &quot;check in&quot; with the person on the other side of the keyboard, and get the feeling that they have a handle on things, even when their character is a maniacal knee-gnawing berserk hobbit who uses words of 5 letters or less when they stop foaming at the mouth long enough to tell you how you're gonna die.<br>
<br>
End OOC.<br>

<br>
If you're reading for a poll of answers, stop there. My reasoning is coming up.<br>
<br>
Why should power levelling affect roleplaying? Actually, they go hand in hand. A person learns MUCH faster with a teacher. In my opinion, Shintou's just jealous. That's my opinion, and strictly mine. I'm sure I'll be flamed for it, but oh well. <br>
<br>
I also think Shintou is just annoyed that someone he wants to /duel is a higher level than him. I haven't heard of Shintou challenging ANYONE of a higher level to a duel. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/18/02 6:52:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=249.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   &quot;Power-gaming&quot; just ..</span><hr size=1> .. provides an incentive to invent a nifty back-story to cover your RP'ing ass.
