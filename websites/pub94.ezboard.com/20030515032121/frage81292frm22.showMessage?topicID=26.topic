<br>
The day started out full of determination.  We had a goal : Saryrn dead before the end of the day.  To accomplish this, we needed to complete the key to her lair.  We split up our raid force, one group camping the avatar of suffering and the other two doing a quest where we went into the stomach of Baraguj Szuul, and fought through it to the end where we escaped and fought the mob himself.  Just as we killed him and completed the quest, the avatar managed to spawn--we had completed our key!<br>
<br>
In order to gain access to the Plane of Torment, you must first kill the goddess Terris Thule.  Since there were several people who were not flagged for Torment, we assembled the forces and headed off to the Lair of Terris Thule.  We dispatched her quickly, with ease.  The loots were nice, as always.<br>
<br>
With Terris dead and everyone flagged for Torment, we began crawling through the zone.  The deeper we went, the harder it got.  Finally, we arrived at Saryrns tower.  On the second floor, we encountered our first boss, named Salczek the Fleshgrinder.  He hit fairly hard, and he had a bunch of HP's...it was a fun start.  We were very surprised when he rampaged...and everyone in melee range was hit.  He was the first monster that we've ever encountered with area-effect rampage.  We won though, fairly easily.<br>
<br>
However, things did not remain so easy for us.  On the next floor we encountered Ta'Grusch the Abomination.  He was not nearly as easy as the previous boss.  When we reached him, I attacked him away from the raid to test his melee abilities.  He quadded and hit me for 2900 on his max hit.  This nasty little guy was no pushover, and his max hit peaked at 3500 damage.  We worked out a strategy, however, and ended up killing him very cleanly.<br>
<br>
After Ta'Grusch, we continued up Saryrns tower and found Maareq the Prophet.  This fight, I must say, is one of the most interesting and amazing fights that i've ever encountered in EQ.  I truly wish that there were more fights like these...it was very fun and inventive.  When we engaged him, he hit hard, and he hit fast.  While I do not wish to release the specifics of the fight nor do I wish to reveal our strategy, I can say that what made the fight so interesting was that he gained strength during the fight, getting stronger each time he 'morphed'.  The morphs made the fight extremely difficult.  We dispatched of him regardless, and there was now nothing between us and the goddess Saryrn.<br>
<br>
We quickly ascended the stairs to Saryrn.  We saw her standing there in the back of the room with her pet bird, Sorrowsong, and quickly formulated a strategy.  Saryrn was engaged, and everything clicked.  Our crowd control was perfect, our healing tight, and tanking went smoothly.  The end result was the one that we all had predicted that morning--Fire and Fury standing triumphant over the corpse of the goddess Saryrn and her pet bird, Sorrowsong.<br>
<br>
This was a great day for Fire and Fury.  Saryrn was a very difficult Goddess, and we are now one step closer to the Elemental Planes.  At the rate we are going, the other gods do not stand a chance.  I can almost feel bad for them...almost! =) <p>Is that a feint or a parry? For a man who prays for my mortal demise, I'd recommend a sharper step and keener concentration.<br>
