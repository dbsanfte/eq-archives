The wyverns were hunched over as they had always been, timeless stone guardians they seemed as they kept a weary eye on the sea.<br>
<br>
I blessed myself with the Spirit of Eagle and crept closer to the cliffs edge for a better view. Taking a seat, I gaze upon a battlefield which would soon be erupting.<br>
<br>
They seemed in an overjoyous mood for such a chilly morning. They sat there eating their clams and mussels hardly expecting a thing. Though I knew that deep in their minds lurked the visions of my last attacks.<br>
<br>
Noiselessly I pounced out of the fog that dreaded day. Confused by the fog, his warriors were helplessly lost as I had their chief chase me out of his encampment. Alone we were, and soon he realized his predicament. How surprised I was to see him charge at me that day. I fully expected him to turn and flee, but brave he was. I unleashed an attack on him that would make even Rallos Zek cringe. In a last ditch effort, he gated. Cursed him I did as I fled into the fog.<br>
<br>
Today would be different however. His warriors were no match for my power as I snagged them one by one as he watched in horror. This time he would have nothing to gate back to. I unleashed upon him the same furry as before, yet this time stunning him in his attempt to flee. I took the spear from his decaying corpse and walked to the water.<br>
<br>
In the distance I could see sails. As the small rafts approached, I saluted them. The chief thanked me as I handed him the proof of his fallen foe. His small army soon disposed of the followers of the newly diseased with ease. I was then proclaimed an honorable member of his tribe. And blessed I was to receive this.<br>
<br>
I stayed behind as I watched them sail away, back to the lands of which they came. I knew they would be back. Why did they send me here to begin with? Their food source was failing and they needed a new home.<br>
<br>
With that I opened my own gate, stepping back into the shadows of which I had come. <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=139650>Elder Beornn</a><BR>

Ayida sat down before the chef, and watched as he made dinner for the two of them, demonstrating the skills which she wished to improve, and chatting as he worked.  It became clear that druids and wizards were constant depradations upon their people.<br>
<br>
Ayida sort of half-understood how the wizards might be able to overlook the cuteness and basic non-prejudiced kindnesses of these simple folk, but the druids were another matter.  How could those who were dedicated to the lords of nature so single-mindly try to hunt these folk into extermination, especially given how the ulthorks and the bulthor were so gross and uncouth by comparison.<br>
<br>
Well the food chain worked well for a reason.  Perhaps she should stick around some and see if any sentient steak dinners could be enjoyed, she hadn't had wood elf, or high elven veal in a long time, and she'd never yet had the opportunity to sample barbarian roasts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~msamuel/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.emailToFriend?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.threadControl?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/rust/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=6.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="rage81292frm22">What we do<option value="rage81292frm1">General Discussion<option value="rage81292frm2">Guild Rules<option value="rage81292frm3">Applications<option value="rage81292frm19">Roleplay if ya wanna!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/brage81292>Fire and Fury</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19>Roleplay if ya wanna!</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org">Fire and Fury </a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
