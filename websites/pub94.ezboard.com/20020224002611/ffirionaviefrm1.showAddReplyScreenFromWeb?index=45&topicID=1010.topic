The old server tactic of 'Kill em when they're green' or 'Greenie masaquer' would come back. What is the need for any planning when you can just go into the zone when everything is green to get what you want? Thus focus would shift to leveling again. The higher the level you are, the more items and quests you can complete, without the danger of dying. So level, level, level, would become the norm. &quot;<br>
<br>
The emphasis is already on leveling, even more so than normal in my opinion. Why bother with the quests when you can simply, in the same time, level and get better equipment? I assure you, this works; the TLC irritations are in the low levels, not the high levels. Removing the TLC would thus allow people to take their time, do quests, be spontaneous, taking off a day or a week whenever, because they know that their level, or lack of it, or oversupply of it, will not affect their ability to quest.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;2) Twinking would increase even more. Guilds would simply Twink lower level members with better items by employing the examples in number one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Twinking is giving one of your characters things from another character that they could not themselves achieve. Those with more than one account do this now; they are unaffacted. Those with one account cannot be twinked. They can be given gifts by OTHERS, but that has always been the case and, again, the TLC changes nothing there. If your definition of twinking is giving ANY character something they cannot themselves achieve, then I have done a great deal of that, if for no other reason than that one character leaves me little bank space and I am often too lazy to spend hours selling when I can make someone happy with a gift. The lack of bank space and the lack of multiple characters contributes far more to economic saturation than anything else.<br>
<br>
In the case of guilds equipping lower level people, they do that now, and they would do so with or without the TLC. They probably do it more now, again, because of the lack of bank space, which has nothing to do with the TLC.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;3) Farming would increase. A player can 'farm' a 'green zone' alot faster than a 'blue zone'. Thus the economy would progress to 'old' server status quicker than with the TLC.<br>
<br>
You disagree? Take a look at the 'old' servers. Are you trying to say there is no 'twinking', Farming or economic problems on the other servers?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bogus argument. Apples and oranges. Comparing this server to a normal blue server isn't a viable comparison. How about we compare this server to a server where each account can only have one character. Ah, but there is no such server. Which is, of course, my point. There can be no comparison, because there is no server enough like this one to MAKE a comparison, TLC aside.<br>
<br>
As for economic problems, if you mean mudflation, of course that problem exists on all servers. It will be, and already is becoming, VASTLY more mudflated here, again, because of the lack of bank space and the lack of desire of people to spend all of their time auctioning. When your bank is full, you have very few choices: 1) delete stuff; 2) sell stuff; 3) give stuff away. I do a little of the first (the most valueless stuff), a little more of the second (but with such a small economy, not easy), and by far I do the third, simply find people and give them stuff. And it is usually stuff they cannot achieve themselves. I suspect most people do the same.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;4) Add to that, the fact that all the NO DROP tags are removed, so imagine the impact on 1 - 3 with previously NO DROP items.&quot;<br>
<br>
So what low level NODROP items do you foresee there being a farming problem with? The biggest problem I see with the NODROP thing isn't people farming greens for low level NODROP stuff, but guilds farming the planes and giving planar armor to their L6 paladins and whatnot on secondary accounts. However, I can live with that too. What can I say, I am a proponent of freedom, in as many respects as possible where it doesn't impede the enjoyment of others. But the PnP already addresses the problem of people camping greens when others wish the camp who get xp. And, in that particular case, I see nothing wrong with invoking the PnP - that is its best use.<br>
<br>
As to it being easier to farm greens, of course it is. But it is also, well, no experience. It's better to farm blues for xp AND loot, or at least light blues. You won't see piles of L60s farming greens anymore, because they have 250+ AA levels still to attain, in all likelihood, which will probably take them years. And even if they should achieve THAT, the fact is, the best sellable loot, especially on a server which economically saturates as fast as this one does, is found on higher level monsters, not on things which are ever green to anyone.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;While you might not change your habits, others definately will. This would eventually impact you. So, things would change if you simply removed the TLC.&quot;<br>
<br>
The 'others definately (sic) will' part is an assumption. If someone had answered my questions indicating that would be the case, I'd lend more credence to that assumption. But no one has answered my questions. They are:<br>
<br>
1) Would you suddenly devalue your reputation in order to go farm greens (especially as regards impeding others who get xp from that camp), if the TLC were removed?<br>
<br>
and <br>
<br>
2) If the TLC were removed as of right now, what would you do differently at your next login?<br>

And, as we all tend to cling strongly to our ideals and beliefs, the conversation was heating up.<br>
<br>
With your post, I noted that the tone had gone far enough beyond a discussion and into an argument that the entire thread might better be placed in the 'rants' forum.  It wasn't your post specifically, although that post did 'tip the scales' in my opinion.<br>
<br>
You'll note that I didn't move the forum.  I figured that, with the observation, folks might return more towards discussion and less towards argument.  That appears to be the case to me.<br>
<br>
Note that, while I might disagree with what you're saying, I defend your right to say it.  All I'll ever ask is that board rules be maintained and that rants stay in the rants forum (if that is indeed the case). <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>

TLC doesn't prevent levelling or getting experience. It prevents players from looting certain items off or creatures that are green to them.<br>
<br>
This issue seems to have some folks that feel very strongly about it (on both sides). A recent article on castersrealm outlined Mr. Vancouvering's take on &quot;change&quot; at the Verant HQ. I didn't know what to make of it to be honest. I know for a fact that the campaign to remove TLC from production servers was started and finished in a matter of months. But Verant seemed to get a lot of folks who voted against it. The article mentioned Verant had to be careful about who they were upsetting vs who they were pleasing etc.<br>
<br>
If I were verant looking at these threads it would look like a no win situation. I think the only thing we have agreed upon here so far is...<br>
<br>
1. Difficult and unreasonable are relative terms.<br>
2. Folks wouldnt mind if TLC were tweaked, and if it were, both sides would be watching closely.<br>
3. Chip and I are horrible spellers and massacre the english language.<br>
<br>
Well, I can't say we actually agreed on number three, but I doubt will get many disagreements on that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
