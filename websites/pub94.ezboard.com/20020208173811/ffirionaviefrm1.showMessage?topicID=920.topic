Populations are low but enthusiam is high, people need to be able to see other adventurers of their caliber and professions wanting groups. as it stands now the only way to do this is try and remember the class and lvl of everyone you meet or know.  I realize some are against this so as a compromise i suggest that maybe only those with the LFG tag on can have their class and lvl shown.  I think it would ease some peoples frustration, the frustration that is casue people to abandon the server.  I dont think this would adversly effect the role playing aspect and would give accessabilty to many more people especially the casual player who doesnt play everyday and keep up with the half the servers class and lvl.  Feedback V.I. If you agree with this suggest or feel free to contact me ingame.. I am Phiste 47 monk of the guild Resolution.

I understand how specific classes are needed for high-end encounters.  But going back to the old system just because that is what everyone did on the other servers is not a good enough reason to get out of roleplay.<br><br>That's like saying:<br><br>&quot;we should turn the ooc channel back on because that is the easiest way to talk over the entire zone during a high-end raid.&quot;<br><br>... or ...<br><br>&quot;we should let any alignment group with any other alignment because we need both evil and good -aligned clerics in various groups for the raid.&quot;<br><br>... or ...<br><br>&quot;we should remove the language barrier so that raids are easier to do.&quot;<br><br>... or ...<br><br>&quot;we should allow for multiple characters so that we can make spawn-check twinks (ie, camp a newbie ranger just to check on rare spawns with tracking)&quot;<br><br><br><br>Instead of doing an omniscient &quot;/who all warrior 45 60&quot; or something like that, players on Firiona Vie *have* to learn of other characters thru either first-hand knowledge or word of mouth ... the way an actual character would do in-game.<br><br>Leader: &quot;Hey gang!

Even without anon, it's is by far one the most tedious activities in EQ.  Increasing the time spent doing something that is not fun is not good.  The forced anon is probably the single worst thing about FV and will likely be what forces more people to leave than anything else, though they'll phrase it as &quot;I'm bored&quot; or &quot;can't get a group&quot; instead of &quot;don't like /anon&quot;.<br><br>I did a ton of group leading on my last server.  It is a lot of work setting up a group.  Sometimes for a week or even a couple of months, it's really easy and you have a steady set that just seems to be there all the time for you (and vice versa).  That's fantastic when it happens, but then the cleric roams off or whatnot and you have to setup all over again.<br><br>I'd say post-50, I spent about 60% of the time setting up groups.  I'd go off and solo-camp some green ultra-rare quest mob that hadn't spawned in 4 months, do &quot;who all xxx&quot;, and send out tells to people as I saw them log in.  Sure, I knew all of them (by 50+, you really do know nearly everyone), but there's just no way I could have kept it up by name and not by class.<br><br>Sure, it's possible to limp along with everyone anon.  It's definitely not desirable, though.  What we really need is to expand the search capabilities, not reduce them.  Make it so groups can advertise for classes &amp; levels they need as well as for people to advertise availability.  The current &quot;/who all xxx&quot; is pretty pathetic, so tie it up in a nice interface so people don't have to spend all their time looking and can spend more time actually playing.<br><br>With anon it's even worse.  Currently, the very first question asked of anyone that is LFG is &quot;what's your class &amp; level?&quot;.  I'm even thinking about hotkey'ing it.  IMHO, asking someone class and level is a lot more jaring wrt. suspension of disbelief than being able to do &quot;/who&quot; and seeing it there without asking or being asked.<br><br>Getting people together so they can play is what this is about, whether it's for killing XP MOBs, or questing, or chatting up an RP storm.  Puting artificial bariers up that make it harder and more tedious for people to do those things for which they bought the game is bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 2:26:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This would be a huge ..</span><hr size=1> I agree with Stormtower here.<br><br>I've found it ridiculously easy to pull together groups if you go to a city zone and /auction.

Use /consider on players--it'll give you a general idea if they're in your level range or not.<br><br>Please, let's be honest.  The reason this server's population is low is because twinking is difficult, and near impossible without having two accounts.  A good number of players on the other servers don't understand how to play without powerleveling and twinking.

But...<br><br>If people leave the Firiona Vie server because they can't get a group... I'm OK with that.<br><br>If people leave because they can't bind in dungeons, can't deal with langauage barriers, can't have more than one character, etc... I'm OK with that, too.<br><br>I know, it's a harsh statement, but I love this server's low population. I have friends that I group with regularly, I've made more friends that know they can count on me when things get ugly.<br><br>The low population &quot;forces&quot; this server to be more social, and that is a good thing. It forces you to actually talk with, and get to know, others so that you'll have people to call on when you want to hunt. In my opinion, that's all good.<br><br>I actually feel sorry for anyone who thought things would be different here, specially if they have raced to the end-game in two months and are now bored. The Firiona Vie ruleset makes the endgame more challenging, which is a good thing in my opinion. But just because I feel sorry for them, doesn't mean I want to cater to them and have Verant start easing restrictions on this server.<br><br>I think that if Verant starts &quot;easing&quot; any of the challenging/restrictive rules on this server, it will make the server worse, not better.<br><br>If Verant feels they need to attract more people to the server, they should do it with incentives not compromises.<br><br>Grimwyrd Storm<br>&lt;Lux Aeternam&gt;<br>27th Human Druid of Karana<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ustormtower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormtower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Travelling Circus</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 4:24:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small rules change needed for server health</span><hr size=1> *looks at Grimwyrd Storm*<br><br>ack!  Another &quot;Storm&quot; character!!!<br><br>I kinda share your sentiment, Grim ... if you find the ruleset too difficult, maybe this is not the server for you.  The other servers don't have forced /roleplay.  If you've achieved 40+ in the last 2 or 3 months that FV has been up, I'm sure you can do it again (maybe faster) in another server.  But we'll miss the potential of your company.<br><br>On the other hand, there are other things that may be bugs.  The different alignment groups and guilds, for one thing.  The TLC effects on some quest drops as another.<br><br>So ... we should remain open to suggestions and discuss them further.  Maybe come up with solutions to present to the development team.<br><br>The /lfg as a mandatory break of /anon and/or /roleplay has some potential.<br><br><br>I'll also introduce another idea to the original poster:  What if I don't want to be singled out in a /who?  Let's say I'm a cleric or enchanter who only trusts a certain small set of people to group up with.  I might be waiting in a zone for my friends and don't want to be bothered by all the other players.  If /roleplay was not forced, I would stand out -- after all, we all know to look for the /anon people in a /who to check for hiding druids and clerics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukarlithas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlithas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 5:02:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small rules change needed for server health</span><hr size=1> I don't think the low population of FV is actually caused by the difficulties in finding a group directly.  Finding a group on FV maybe tricky and even difficult at some point, but it is still possible.  When I hunted in High pass, I got to know people around my level that is also hunting the areas.  I add to my friend list those who I find pleasent to group with.  My friend list is the source when I want to find someone to group with.  I believe grouping on FV is very different from the normal blue servers.  Instead of doing the amazing (and very unrealistic) who all cleric 40 60, one is actually forced to get to know a cleric and befriend with him/her.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 6:32:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Small rules change needed for server health</span><hr size=1> I agree with Grim's statements....starting to get to be a regular thing I think LOL.<br><br>I enjoy the low population but I think you will all agree we have had a serious influx of newbies over the last 2 weeks.
