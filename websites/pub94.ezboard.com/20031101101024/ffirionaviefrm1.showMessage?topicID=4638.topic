Well, yesterday I was in a group in PoV, Razor cave. After one of the kills we noticed that we didn't get xp. We also noticed that our puller went after another victim before we finished the mob and in the moment of the kill he was quite far from us.<br>
<br>
Could it be that SOE will nerf this hmmm... &quot;exploit&quot; this way?<br>
I guess this would be their best choice if they don't want to nerf the recently granted group xp bonus. <p>Coercer Csalimosoly<br>

The puller bug is ancient.  I used to get that pre-Kunark pulling with my warrior.  The network grouping thing refers to people sitting AFK at the ZI while someone else is off getting an 80% xp bonus solo.  Or, 5 solo'ers and a duo all off doing their own solo things and getting 80% bonus.  And, despite the grouping bonus, you get MORE xp in a smaller group still than in a full group -- not just a little more, a lot more.<br>
<br>
SOE is so damn lazy.  There's a pitifully huge imbalance between the xp rate of those classes that do need a group to xp and those that don't (or those that can group with anyone).  The fix for that is to actually add utility to the classes that lack it in order to make them the most attractive classes for grouping.  Instead, SOE added the grouping XP bonus as a quick hack and, of course, it backfired into Network Groups of those same solo'ing classes just getting even more xp.<br>
<br>
Even if the network grouping bug was fixed and the bonus applied only to those present at the time the xp is earned, it still wouldn't fix the utility imbalance and encourage more grouping.  I get my best XP in two situations: duo'd on unslowed critters or small group on slowed.  The smaller the group, the better the xp rate even with the bonus.  Being able to kill faster doesn't compensate for the division of the xp by the group, it decreases it even with the bonus -- and that's in areas where spawn rate isn't an issue and you can chain pull.  Just going from 2-&gt;3 in a group means that you have to kill and pull 28% faster just to maintain the same xp rate.  Going from 1-&gt;2, you have to kill 67% faster to maintaing an equal rate to the solo'er.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, unless it's a pure plant-your-butt-and-grind, a full group is a lot more fun and the xp rate isn't that much lower for 4-&gt;5 (11%) and not lower at all for 5-&gt;6.  However, for the xp-grind times, I feel both irritated and guilty when someone asks to join.  Irritated because it significantly reduces my xp rate and guilty because I don't like turning folks down for groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=decius1@firionavie>Decius1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 513<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/03 11:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4638.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Puller OOR ..</span><hr size=1> *DISCLAIMER* maths is very rough and its 5am could be totally wrong =)<br>

Add a rogue. Damage dealt = 2.5x<br>
<br>
2.5x/3 = 5x/6  &gt;  1x/2<br>
<br>
In a meleeing group with plenty of easy pulls, xp is better more people you add.<br>
<br>
It's only when either <br>
<br>
1) you are not meleeing (i.e. where you aren't having to &quot;lose&quot; damage slots to utility classes such as clerics, slowers, pullers or whatever) <br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2) There are a very limited number of pulls / difficult and time consuming pulls.<br>
<br>
that experience should be better when soloing.<br>
<br>
That is the problem with solo xp. And it isn't really a problem with solo xp itself, more a problem with lack of penalties for certain low-risk, low-maintenance methods of fighting e.g. kiting.<br>
<br>
At least, that's if I worked it out right. I could easily be wrong =)<br>

In your duo-&gt;trio example, suppose you have 60s for a kill duo and 30s for pulling.  Add a rogue and your kill rate does not go up by a factor of 2.5 because adding a rogue doesn't speed up the spawn rate and pull rate.  Supposing the actual fight time drops by 60% as for your examp, you now have 24s fight and 30s pull.  That's 54s per kill instead of 90s, or a roughly 1.6x increase in xp rate rather than a flat 2.5x as your assumptions show above.<br>
<br>
XP for a duo is 0.6 XP of solo for each player in the group (1.2 total / 2).  Going to a trio, XP is 0.47 XP of solo (1.4 / 3).  So, under ideal conditions, your trio is makeing 12% better xp.  In practice, it's never nearly that good.  Typically the trio will make worse XP.  The actual xp rate of my monk+druid duo tanking things chain-pulled is about 10% real xp per hour.  Add a 65 uber geared rogue and that drops to about 7% per hour.<br>
<br>
You really can't get nice XP in a full group until you go kill bigger critters in a higher ZEM area and chain pull them; ie. grouping doesn't scale even with melee.  You can't add players to an existing kill group and improve the xp.  If you add players, you have to move and find a new spot just to maintain the same XP rate.  If you're moving, you're not making XP, so that's even further disincentive to add new players to an existing group.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I get so little time to XP these days, that I'm pretty focused on squeezing the last little drop of XP out of what time I do have for it.  The most valuable xp-trait for any class around is the ability to log on and get XP right away.  Doesn't even matter if it's &quot;good&quot; XP.  The fact that you are getting it instead of setting up to get it or hunting for a spot to get it means you will progress much faster than those that have those burdens for xp'ing; ie. it doesn't matter that your xp rate is half of a hot group's if it takes someone three times as long to setup that hot group and find a spot for it.<br>
<br>
If there's a ready made XP group availble, I'll hop on it or try to form one.  But, if it takes more than a couple minutes, I'll just go duo.  It's not worth the time to wait for people to make last minute bank runs or dither about feeding the cat.  IMHO, that's a problem with the game when the best advancement in a social game comes from asocial behavior for one of that games most common activities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=muisje@firionavie>Muisje</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/23/03 7:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4638.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're neglecting pull time</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The fact that you are getting it instead of setting up to get it or hunting for a spot to get it means you will progress much faster than those that have those burdens for xp'ing; ie. it doesn't matter that your xp rate is half of a hot group's if it takes someone three times as long to setup that hot group and find a spot for it.<br>

I can only agree Ansur. Though like Bjond said, I absolutely despise grinding, so I try to get the most efficient xp when doing so. Takes less time away from rp and exploring, guild events, etc, the activities that I actually enjoy. And yes considering preparation time, etc. soloing often is more 'productive'.<br>
<br>
But then again groups are definitely more fun. I'm more than willing to sacrifice xp rate for people to chat and joke with. As long as they're not a complete group of incompetents or goofing off too much.  Which, at 63, seems to be fairly rare. In fact the opposite is true; people seem to obsess over xp a little too much for my taste. What's the point of playing if every moment you're just leveling? To each his own I suppose.<br>
