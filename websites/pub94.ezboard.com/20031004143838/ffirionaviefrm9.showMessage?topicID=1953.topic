<br>
Look at this <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/articles/451/451238p1.html?fromint=1">link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We currently have three types of social structures in EverQuest II: Guilds, Families, and Fellowships.<br>
<br>
Guilds function much like they do in EverQuest, but with an additional political element. When a player founds a Guild, it will be registered in whichever city he or she is a citizen of. Guilds must pledge to support one of the five factions in that city (see our Lore page: http://everquest2.station.sony.com/lore.jsp). Essentially, each Guild will be competing against other Guilds to raise its prominence within its home town. The Guilds that achieve the highest standings will receive tangible benefits as long as they continue to maintain that standing.<br>
<br>
Where the Guild is registered will not impact who can join it. For example, a player from Freeport is free to join a Guild that is based in Qeynos, but that player will essentially be contributing to the strength of the opposing city. This won't hurt how that player is perceived in Freeport, but it does mean that this player wouldn't receive all the benefits that a citizen of Qeynos would.<br>
<br>
Families are registered in a city, but they don't vie against each other in the political meta-game that Guilds play. Members of a Family enjoy the camaraderie present in a Guild without the atmosphere of competition. When a player founds a Family, he or she creates a unique surname that will be adopted by any player who joins it. Seeing a character with a surname will instantly tell you which Family that player belongs to. Players who quit one Family and join another will see their surname change accordingly.<br>
<br>
Fellowships are limited to six members. This is a small social structure that helps friends stick together in the game as they level up. Fellowships can pool a certain percentage of experience, which is then distributed among all members. It is designed to allow friends who want to play together keep their progress fairly consistent. Shared experience will be distributed even when players are offline.<br>
<br>
Fellowships are not a substitute for gaining experience on your own. A level 40 player who forms a Fellowship with a level 3 player will not be able to help that character gain levels at an accelerated rate. Experience will be distributed proportionately, so the level 3 player would only receive experience as if he were killing monsters of his own level. Fellowships are designed to provide the most benefit when its members are relatively close in level and invest a similar amount of time to the game.<br>
<br>
A player can be a member of any or all of these three social structures at the same time. One person can be in a Fellowship, a Family, and a Guild simultaneously, because the three structures don't compete against each other.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What do you think about this? I think being tied either to the evil or the good city might be good for roleplay. On the other hand I personally don't feel comfortable with the competitive aspect of the guilds, the surname fixation and the dualism Freeport/Qeynos. Well, let's see how it will be in practice... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3746<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/03 7:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1953.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: social structure in EQ2...</span><hr size=1> Well, you don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be a competetive guild.

There's limited space in towns... they can't go givin the nicest guildhalls out all willynilly... it makes sense that the guilds which do the most for the city would receive the most preferential treatment in return.<br>

My guild won't be competing at all.  We'll be doing quests and stuff I'm sure, but not with any hopes of being the bestest questers or anything <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Sure, guilds don't have to compete. But they are swimming against the mainstream if they don't.<br>
Basically these plans suggest that guild = competitive and family = non-competitive.<br>
<br>
Players who enjoy competition will like it. Players who don't enjoy competition will have to look away a lot...<br>
<br>

<br>
Families are there so you don't have to page guides to get married n stuff.  If you wanna be Mrs Trumpytoe you can just do it, etc.<br>
<br>
I mean, everyone pretty much knows that, right off the bat, the guilds that win the &quot;competition&quot; aspect are gonna be all the uber ones... do you really think most are gonna bother trying?  I think most guilds will do some town related quests, for fun or profit, but most won't be doing them with the hopes of gaining city benefits from them.  I mean, think here on FV, out of all the tons of guilds, how many do you really think are striving to be the best guild (in terms of quests / kills / etc)?  Most are just out havin fun and doing as much as they have time for, etc.<br>
<br>
So, I really don't think you'll be in a minority if you join a non-competetive guild.<br>

If I read this right, you and Tallonar are the target audience for fellowships.  By that, I mean people who 1) Wish to remain close in levels, despite 2) Different amounts of EQ time.<br>
<br>
This is a really cool idea.  How many stories have we heard that &quot;I can't hunt with my friends anymore because they all outlevelled me&quot;?  This may solve that problem.  It also solves SOE's problem of people quitting when it happens <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I assume they'll make it a zero-sum game, too, so there's no exploiting.  If I want somebody to keep up with me, I assign them 50% of my experience points.  As long as I begin this when we are the same level, they stay with me, even if they hardly ever play.<br>
<br>
Dang, somebody at SOE has their thinking cap on.  Ideas like this may keep me in Norrath v2.0, as opposed to my current plans to head over to Worlds of Warcraft <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I mean, say we share a proportion of the experience he gains even when I'm offline.  By the time he's 65 (or whatever the equivalent is) he may have dragged me up to, say, 45, although he's put 3 solid weeks of playing time in and I've only been able to put in 5 days.  There's no way I'd have a good feel for my class, advancing that fast.  I just won't have been in all the fighting situations he's been in.  Unfortunately there's a lot of RL experience required, in-game experience is not the only thing that matters, and they can't give you that with offline experience.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I would WANT to be levelled up that fast without participating in it either.  I wouldn't feel like I could trust myself to play well.<br>
<br>
I'm sure we'll find out more ... but it seems like there are a few potential problems, anyway.

But that happens now.  Though you have resisted doing so, powerlevelling is pretty common.  It's just too easy (see, e.g., the level 65 froggies running around a week after LoY was released).<br>
<br>
I think the same guideline should apply to 'fellowships' as it does to power-levelling:  Don't do it unless you already know the basics of the class, how to work in groups, etc.<br>
<br>
I still think this is a brilliant idea, from the standpoint of retaining customers.  Let's see what else they come up with. <p>Hunter Gyre Redbranch<br>
