In anyway this event turns out, it shall serve as a lesson in warfare for firiona vie. Will rules of warfare be born from this? Or will it simply be a refresher course in PnP ? Which lesson is to be learned is determined by the people who show up.<br>
<br>
 Personally, I came up with the lag idea as an only alternative to the free for all rules set for the raid. It was the only response available to us at the time. Since then, many people have expressed and interest in having an actual pvp event, though most, if not all, of the suggestions come from the defenders.Typical of the underdogs to find a way to strengthen their position, and typical of the favorites to cling to their advantage. I expected no less.<br>
<br>
<br>
The event is too far into preparations to change anything now. We shall see the results of all the bickering, flaming, plotting, criticizing, backstabbing, taunting, and adversity that this event has caused come tuesday, July 30, 7:30 central. Every form of roleplayer will be there to show how we can all shine true to our roles and every form of heckler will be there to tell us how stupid  we are.<br>
<br>
I for one will be proud to stand with my fellow rp'ers, good and bad, attacker and defender, for what shall be as far as I am concerned, our moment of glory. Let us not let this pass into teh books of failed raids, but exault it to the new form of roleplay that all other rp raids shall use as a standard.<br>

But how would you justify it in a roleplay event?<br>
<br>
Simply put, because you want your side to win without giving the defenders the benefit of attempting to roleplay it to a conclusion. Make up any rp reason you want, you still have proclaimed yourself a bully for showing you can summon the powers of a gm to grant your way.<br>
<br>
But you are also assuming the attackers give no other recourse for the defenders.Give us a chance, we will gladly take it over using game mechanics. What would do to defend Ak'Anon in this situation, Sinnaji? Let them go ahead and raid it? Make a raid against Neriak? Not even care one way or the other? Therein lies the difference between you and all of us who chose to find a way to defend Ak'Anon.<br>
<br>
And since we are WAY off the subject of what this thread was intended for, I suggest you take it to the soapbox forum.<br>

ALL I can say is Apep and Ebon have obviously put a lot of work into creating what could be a GREAT RP event. <br>
So how do we respond?  By promising to bring up the lag beast.  How terrible is that.  He should be given credit for doing this, and bringing some true RP into this server since the gm's(if there are even any) have no idea or clue how too.<br>
I'll be there defending Akanon but I and everyone with me will be doing it the right way.  If your coming just to create lag, don't come at all.  This should be a great event and It would be terrible to have it spoiled by ppl who just want to use unfair methods to stop it.  Hell maybe all the true defenders should meet in Lfay and try stopping them there.  That way if they get through to akanon there will be less lag for them.  Thats just an idea.  IF your coming to just ruin this event don't come at all.  If you coming to RP and have a good time, then by all means join in.  But all credit should go to Ebon and Apep for putting this event together, no matter the reason for it.  <br>
This is all just my humble opinion.<br>

<br>
It dismays me to see the same things continuing here that have resulted in the near destruction of Tinkers Pride, sadly, all from within.  Many, many members of the Pride have left to join other guilds because of the thoughtless actions of others, who don't seem to consider the whole point of this is to have fun.<br>
<br>
Xianya, you continue to disappoint.<br>
<br>
Apep has indeed planned a fine RP event.  Yes, it is disappointing that the GM's won't get involved so that it could really become something spectacular.<br>
<br>
What I see is strictly from a gamers viewpoint.  You can't possibly win in this scenario, so you decide the best thing to do is to cheat and use something that would never exist.. LAG.<br>
<br>
Whomever made the suggestion of everyone joining a particular guild and then declaring /guildwar hit the nail on the head.  You want Verant to get involved when you yourselves aren't doing what is already made available to you in order to have the results you wish.<br>
<br>
There is NO reason you can't leave your current guilds and join one side or the other and then release a total free-for-all, no reason other than that you don't want to.<br>
<br>
Instead, you would rather lag out the entire zone.  You would rather destroy not just the roleplaying but the entire game for many people.  It saddens me that I have seen only limited consideration for the results of such.  This blatant lack of consideration for others is WHY so many have left Tinkers Pride in favor of the Gnomish Alliance Group.  When will you learn?<br>
<br>
The suggestion to switch to alternative guilds and declare guildwar is the most plausible and accomplishes what so many speak of wanting to do.<br>
<br>
Apep, I have no doubt that you WOULD encourage switching to a guild and an opposing guild to make this happen. <br>
<br>
Defenders?  Just how stalwart are you?  Dare you join a temporary guild and be set upon by the likes of Gore Bloodlust?<br>
<br>
To those of you who have argued against using LAG and other in-game inconsistencies, I do indeed salute you and your sense of fair play which allows everyone to enjoy the game.  To the rest of you I say but one thing: <br>
<br>
It's time to put up or shut up.  <br>
<br>
Join opposing guilds, declare guildwar, and let nature take its course where the strong shall devour the weak.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

It's not something to remove lightly.  In fact, it's not something to remove at all.  It's not a matter of being 'stalwart'.  While wearing my current tags I have already duelled Gore twice, most recently just last weekend.  I'm sure that if on Tuesday I challenge Gore again, he'll happily accept my duel again, and I'll die again for the honour of Ak'Anon, wearing my League of Shadows tags.  <br>
<br>
Your arguments make no sense.  And as most of them seem to be confused up with personal attacks on Tinker's Pride members, perhaps this is not the right place either?<br>
<br>
Understand that for some people, guild loyalty means a lot more than it apparently means to you.  This is our choice.  The fact we will not remove our guild tags has nothing to do with cowardice. <p><table border=0><tr><td width=20%><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/didi/a_didisig.gif" height=120 width=120></td><td>

Why would Apep give up leadership of Ebon Storm? If an entire guild participates, then all others must join that one guild for the event, lest the full participatory guild be disbanded. And perhaps that guild doesn't  want the hassle of booting the new members because  they dont want to leave.<br>
<br>
Easy for you to suggest it, you have no guild, and for good reason. If Zapoo didnt get around to it, I will boot you. Your uncooperative, demeaning attitudes are not welcome in the Pride.<br>

The problem at hand was how to respond to Apep's raid of Akanon.  You wished for the GM's to get involved and make the zone a PvP zone so that you could challenge the invaders in a manner more appropriate than trying to lag them out.<br>
<br>
Clearly they don't intend to do that so what is left?  The guild tag that you are so fond of is nothing more than a moniker which may represent a great deal of things, but ultimately, it's nothing more than a symbol.  What you have as a guild is what you carry inside.  I doubt seriously that will change if you join opposing guilds for a few hours of fun and mayhem.  Well, it may change if that is the sum total of your strength.  I'm thinking it's not.<br>
<br>
Why not belly up to the bar and use the suggestion as was made by another person before I added my comments?  It gives you EVERYTHING you want in the ability to meet this raid challenge in a manner fitting of the server and the players.<br>
<br>
As for my 'attacks' on Tinkers Pride members...   I would actually happily extend this attack upon anyone who made suggestions that go outside of the spirit of the game and in turn end up lessening the fun for everyone involved.  <br>
<br>
It just so happens that Xianya has put forth the strongest cry for using the LAG measure rather than the components that already are in place for such things.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease. *s<br>

I emailed to talk to them about several different ideas, such as turning the zone into a pvp area, bringing life to the king, bringing in some big guns, and other surprises.<br>
<br>
I received no word back. Gms all couldn't help me for whatever reason.<br>

I guess I should be spending $49 a month to get a response to an event as big as this on the server.<br>

PS Leave Xianya alone. She is doing a great job, and is facing a lot of adversity. I appreciate what Apep and Charizma are doing in their rp, but Xianya is doing the best with what she has been given, and I for one also appreciate that.<br>

Now to my point.  I think making two guilds Attackers and Defenders is an excellent idea.  I don't think disbanding from your guild for the purpose of an RP event is doing it any disservice.  I have been in some great RP guilds especially on Solro(Bashin Ordur!!-as Swathalun and Legion of Dawn) I never needed a guildtag to tell me I was a part of those guilds, I knew I was a part of those guilds.No two words above my name made any difference.  So while I agree that making LAG on purpose is not the greatest of ideas(although I'm not completely against it) I think because of the mechanics of the game the idea with joining two seperate guilds is best.  People who know you, know where your loyalties stand they also don't need to see a guildtag above your name. The tag doesn't prove your loyalties anyway, what you do does.  Well that's it thanks<br>

Katryna surveys all that has been said trying to use the wisdom that had been passed down to her from many generations and then thinking of her own experiences.  Not liking some of the things that come to mind but knowing today is the day that what is to happen will happen regardless of the mixed up actions of others.  The Shamaness starts to speak<br>
<br>
&quot;Apep and his minions plan to be attackin Ak'anon and I donna believe his actions be a good response to which that that bothers him, but I donna expect anythin except this from things like him *shakes her head in sadness*.  To kill those that are of a lower training and then to take some of them as slaves, which would be reducin them of their honor is not acceptable.  I donna see a way to truly and honorably stand against them as we are forbidden to raise our weapons in defense, but *looking around at the others with a fiery piercing stare* we can work on freeing the slaves that he takes, give him nothing more to boast of except his victory over murderin those that be obviously of a lesser experience in training.  Donna give him anything to be gainin honor over.  I be planin to be at the city in case there be a way I may stand at the side of me friends but I willna do anything that will be makin Apep and his followers seem like they be the ones done wrong.&quot;<br>

About time some action hits this server.  (my apologies if I have missed an event of this level before).

Tactics such as that is why I took a holiday from Tallon Zek (DE SK, Minions of Zek).<br>
