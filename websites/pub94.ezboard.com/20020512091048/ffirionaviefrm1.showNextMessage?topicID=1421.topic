What class should I play (my thoughts)</span><hr size=1> /ooc - O.k.  Everyday it seems like we get a “what class should I play?” topic.  I actually enjoy the threads, because I like seeing folk’s analysis on the subject.  However, because often people repeat themselves, since the topic comes up every week, I STRONLY suggest that the board moderators simply make it a permanent thread.  Would stop the constant reposts, and eventual re posting of responses.  I've heard a few people suggest this. Moderators - please make it happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Below are my thoughts on the subject.  Obviously the easy answer to “what class should I play?” is “Play what makes you happy!”  I think that is simplistic.  Put simply, people have to pick classes that fit their play style, thus a more appropriate answer would be “What’s your play style?” and then answer based on the feedback.  Below are my thoughts on what class you should play, based on one’s play style.  I don’t account for races, and role-play.  Barebones “what makes me happy” analysis.<br><br>Don’t flame me, hehe. I just felt like offering an opinion, and I think with over 150 levels of EQ experience across a wide variety of classes, I think I could help someone out.  My thoughts:<br><br>- You think: “I avoid groups like the plague.  I don’t like to group.  I don’t care if people invite me to join their group.”<br><br>Primary Pick: Druid – By far the best soloing class in the game.  Snare, Sow, Nukes.<br>Secondary Pick: Necro – Pet is fairly tough, and well-rounded spells will allow you to solo into the 50s.<br>Offbeat Pick:  Ranger:  I know some Rangers who have soloed to late 50s.  Must be extremely talented, with good gear.  Can be done, but only if you are an experienced player that knows zones, and knows how to plays.  If you are new to game, don’t play ranger so you can solo.  You experienced player looking for solo challenge, player Ranger.<br><br>- You think: “I like to pimp gear.  I want to look good.  Cool weapons, cool armor.  The cooler I look, the better I feel.  I take screenshots of myself constantly”<br><br>Primary Pick: Warrior  - Hands down the pimp gear master.  Just look at their light saber Epic.  <br>Secondary Pick: Bard – Cool armor and cool Epic.  If you want to pimp gear, this is a respectable choice.<br>Offbeat Pick – Cleric – Clerics, with the ability to wear plate, have some nice pimpin choices.  However, you should probably like purple for the planar gear.  Rez stick looks nice.<br><br>- You think: “I want to impress everyone with my ability to deal damage.  I don’t care about anything except launching huge nuclear explosions on my enemy.  I want my group to win the experience in a raiding environment”<br><br>Primary Pick: Rogue.  Might be surprised that Wizzie isn’t first.  Here is why they aren’t: RESISTS.  Admittedly wizzies will annihilate for much of their careers.  However, for high level post 50+ game, resists become a big problem for wizzies. I’ve know a many wizzie to give up after 50, because none of their stuff sticked.  Rogues, on the other hand, hit for insane backstabs.  If you care about impressing your girlfriend with dealing damage, pick a rogue.<br><br>Secondary Pick: Wizard – For most of your life, you’ll be dealing out some massive damage.  Also, I believe there is an unresistable nuke that you get at some time in your career.<br><br>Offbeat Pick – Warrior – Get some mega gear and lots of haste items, and you will be a damage machine.  50+ you got the disciplines, and everyone loves those critical hits.<br><br>- You think: “I love to group, and I want to be a valuable addition to the group, whether low level game or high level game.”<br><br>Primary Pick – Cleric – You can never have enough healers.  Especially on FV, where clerics are in short supply.<br><br>Secondary Pick – Warrior/Enchanter – For every good group, is a good tank.  Warriors are the best at this, hands down.  Enchanters are also valuable, especially after Clarity.  Dungeon raids with lots of mobs – you MUST have enchanter.<br><br>Offbeat Pick – Shaman – The jack of all trades.  Found a tank/healer/chanter group.  It becomes devastating with Shaman.<br><br>- You think: “I enjoy helping people.  I get nice feeling in my stomach when someone says thank you.  I just want to help those in need”<br><br>Primary Pick: Cleric – Make lots of friends, and give out rezzes, buff noobs.  If you are in the game of helping out, be a cleric.<br><br>Secondary Pick – Druid.  Heal, ports, sow.  Those three will make you friends with a many.<br><br>Offbeat Pick – Not really offbeat, but Shaman.  Everyone loves Shaman buffs.  And a SoW will brighten anyone’s day.<br><br>What about ME!!<br><br>Mages: Pros: Solo for a while. Call of Hero is mega spell for 50+ dungeon raids.  Possible negatives – no pimp gear factor.  After 50+ less of need for groups, unless you have CoH.<br><br>Shadow Knights &amp; Paladins: Great tank class till 40 or so in terms of value to a group.  Post 20 no real solo ability.  Great pimp gear ability.  I know this will anger folks, but 40+, and definitely 50+, they are basically a pet.  Spells don’t really help out much, and the HP/AC doesn’t make them a viable option for being primary tank 50+<br><br>Beastlords: Don’t know much about them, so won’t comment.<br><br>My 2 copper for a topic this always shows up.  Again, I STRONGLY recommend group moderators to post a permanent thread on “what class should I play” because it comes up so often.  I just wanted to post my opinion on the matter as I think the debates are fun.  <br><br>/roleplay<br><br>Bloodbringer Fearfyre<br>Dark Elf Warrior of 40 Seasons<br>League of Shadows<br><br>&quot;Let them hate me, so long as they fear me&quot;<br><br><br>Wife of<br><br>Sinstealer Fearfyre<br>Dark Elf Cleric of 36 Seasons<br>League of Shadows<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubloodandsin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bloodandsin</A> at: 2/28/02 10:55:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 586<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/1/02 5:42:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1471.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pretty similar to my thought, but ..</span><hr size=1> .. I'd drop the wizard from your damage list entirely.  Very low damage output.  They do quick damage, but not a lot of it (the key to raid &quot;ks-xp&quot; is not how much you do, but when you do it -- this is why wizards and rogues get xp in raids).  Replace warrior with monk and ranger.

BTW, as far as wizard solo being boring, I'd agree somewhat.  The fights are great, the med'ing is dull, and there's about 3 times as much med'ing as fighting.  Most grouping for a wizard is even duller, except for an AE team.  That's a blast.<br><br>At very high levels (eg. 60), shaman and enchanters surpass necromancers for solo-kill ability.

If the wizard can't hit, then nobody else in the group/raid is gonna land a nuke on it either. <br><br>The Staff of Temp flux is a great asset to a wizard and does help quite a bit.<br><br>Also, in situations where a wizard can't land a nuke, chances are there are enchanters and shaman there as well already landing debuffs on the target.

Most bards I know usually prefer to run overland rather than port. <br><br>Enchanter -- Illusions and faction-fixing spells (Benevolence, etc.) let you walk freely through places no one else can go near. Illusions are an added bonus on FV, where people can't tell who you are in the first place. <br><br>Control Freak<br>Monk -- You'll usually be expected to pull, and as main puller, in addition to seeing more than everyone, you are responsible for controlling the flow.
