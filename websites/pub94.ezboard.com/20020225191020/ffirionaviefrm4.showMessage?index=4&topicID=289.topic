<br>
Simply put, gamers really don't care (thus the amazing 'restraint' we've seen) enough about this &quot;issue&quot; to get so worked up about it that they delete their character and leave the server. Can anyone really imagine a High level &quot;uber&quot; member of this community posting &quot;d3wd, y0u RP n4zi's s0xx0r, y0u l4m3rs WIN! I'm g0n3!&quot; ? Most don't speak like this hehe... my point is immerrsion can be ruined, power gaming cannot be ruined.<br>
<br>
In the end no matter what your stance is on the Gameplay styles of this server, if your ultimate goal is the server remaining a place you'd like to play, your better off keeping the peace and not bickering. That is unless your goal is to drive roleplayers off.<br>
<br>
As for Shintou, maybe he'll simply delete Shintou and start fresh, perhaps not reading the boards this time through. I'd suggest that over him leaving altogether.<br>

It will be stated once, and only once.<br>
<br>
I think the Moderators dropped the ball on enforcing the rules they themselves wrote.  The first rule of this server is &quot;No personal attacks or harrassment of any kind towards any player.&quot;<br>
<br>
For at least two weeks, Shintou was bombarded with every sort of name-callling I can imagine, mostly from the same three posters.  He was a &quot;whiner&quot;, he was a &quot;fanatic&quot;, he was an &quot;extremist&quot;, he was a &quot;racist&quot;, he was a &quot;nazi&quot;, he was any-name-you-could-throw-at-him-that-would-discredit-what-he-was-saying.  These posters were not attacking the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>content</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of his posts, but the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>person</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> making the argument.  And these posters were relentless in their repitition of these <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    ad hominem</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> attacks.<br>
<br>
None of the Moderators did or said anything about that name-calling.<br>
<br>
And then I see that one of the Moderators joined in the attack.<br>
<br>
Well, no wonder the rules weren't enforced on those attacking Shintou (not Shintou's ideas).<br>
<br>
It's one thing for the Moderators to express their opinions.  That's fine with me.  It's another thing for the Moderators to expressly violate the rules they've set up for the board in the expression of their opinion.<br>

He started at least 3 long threads that I know where locked and/or deleted by one of the mods(not me). Its &quot;HIS&quot; negative attitude that brought alot of the fighting on this board. Starting posts just to say and I quote &quot;fuck you to the powergaming man&quot; along with various other crap that I'm sure you can go click on his prof and look up. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=245.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...=245.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Now as for a mod joining in on these so called attacks is complete trash. Shintou had everything coming to him that he got and more. This wasn't some select case where I wanted to join the &quot;bandwagon&quot; and start bitching at him. Frankly, I was sick of the crap he would post and I unlike some people, I say what I feel and will stand behind it. Sure, I could have just deleted his posts, or locked them, like the other mods do, but I am pretty laid back and let people say what they wanna say. Thats imo part of being a mod, this whole you have to say what I tell you to say, otherwise I will delete it crap doesn't fly well with the big T. <br>
<br>
Now just because someone is this so-great roleplayer doesn't exempt him from any of the other RULES that are stated on this board. There has been people that have done MUCH LESS than Shintou has and have been banned for it ie: Fuvi. Frankly I think that is bullshit and I'll say it right now, and its all because alot of people see him as a very good roleplayer they let him go on his merry way of bitching and cussing at everyone over level 40 without ANY cause whatsoever.<br>
<br>
If you honestly think that all the whining and bitching that he did up to the point did not warrant some kind of reply I suggest you really go back and look over all the crap that was posted by him. He got about 1/20th of what he dished out by me. Thats giving him the benefit of the doubt. Look it sucks that someone had to delete their character and cry themselves to sleep because he got cussed at, but you know what, it goes with the territory. You start swearing at people, chances are someone is gonna say something back. Now just because alot of people respect and like someone does not give them free reign over what they can do. Board rules were set-up when the board was made and apply to everyone, including mods. I don't go around pushing my opinion on anyone on this server, or board and really don't care what you do with them(within reason) but when you go around changing rules and other shit just to suit one person is crap. It doesn't really matter now anyways, whoever the other mods are don't agree with me on that and its pretty self evident, hell even my posts are deleted by someone. That is admin abuse. Me, telling someone to quote &quot;F$ck off&quot; after he intentionally tried to cause shit on these boards is not. You don't believe me? The last post in the mod board before I said anything was about possibly banning Shintou. Now, IMO that would have been abit harsh on anyone that has even come to this board. <br>
<br>
This post in all essense basically says all I have to say on this subject, if anyone really gives a crap.<br>
This whole crap comes down to 1 single fact which was stated by Vordul.<br>

I would have said much the same thing.<br>
<br>
But there was two problems with it.<br>
<br>
1. You are a mod. You clearly broke your own rules in your earlier post. Moderators just shouldn't do what you did, very unprofessional.<br>
<br>
2. You gave the impression of being upset not because of how whatshisname said what he did, but because he said it about the uberguilds which you are a member. Even if that isn't true, thats how it LOOKED. It looked like you weren't defending the board against a poster out of line, but someone defending their guildmates and those like them from things you just didn't like to be said about you.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I mostly agreed with your point of view... but I would never have said it as a moderator.<br>

<br>
I noticed moderators on this board participating &quot;actively&quot; on threads along time ago. I even brought it up to Valquiss. But I wasn't confrontational about it. It was just a discussion. Basically, my thoughts are this...<br>
<br>
First, while this board is a public board, it is still owned by somebody and that somebody makes the rules. Jaxy I believe is the owner and she and her Moderators help with the rules being created, enforced and revised.<br>
<br>
Second, its true that &quot;Moderator&quot; does imply nuetrality, but thats all it does. The title moderator is just a label and the owner(s) of this board can chose to define &quot;Moderator&quot; any way they see fit. Hell, half the Moderators my country's Government selects are the farthest fooking thing from nuetral and their actions show it (but I'm not bitter).<br>
<br>
I know other moderators on other boards that have 2 accounts. One for posting, another for moderating. That way they can express their opinions and keep their moderator name out of it. Does this seem wrong? Maybe. But they sure don't get half the flack the moderators get on this board.<br>
<br>
The moderators on this board have chosen not too hide behind another account and have decided to express their opinions on some threads without restraint. There's nothing wrong with that. This is fine as long as they follow the same rules we are expected to follow while they post.<br>
<br>
Ankles posted her thoughts and opinions regarding Shintou. She wrote, &quot;You are ruining the boards you have whined so hard to protect.&quot;. I don't see this as a personal attack. I see this as a very blunt statement to get a poster to change their tone. Perhaps this could have been done privately, but then again maybe it needed to be done publicly; to drive the point home that the type of language and tones used by that poster were not acceptable.<br>
<br>
The moderators on this board are intelligent, articulate, funny and they happen to have opinions too. I don't see them as nuetral parties &quot;referee'ing&quot; this board. I gave that vision up long ago over the TLC stuff. I do see them as active participants on this board that also have the ability to enforce the rules we are all expected to follow. I think if everyone just steps back and can re-think how they define &quot;moderator&quot;, that is, let go of the concept of nuetrality, then they will be able to appreciate some of the posts these folks have done and quite possibly engage in some great discussion.<br>
