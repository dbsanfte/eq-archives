No body holds a knife to their throat.  They read what the company offers and they sign it.  If they don't like what's being offered, they go somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Am I 100% for the big record companies?  No.  I haven't bought more than 3 CDs in the last few years.  Mostly because 98% of music avialable out there is crap...but that's an other story and totaly my opinion.  <br>
<br>
If you don't like their way of doing business, don't buy their product...but make sure that the &quot;small/indipendant&quot; company you are supporting isn't really run by the big guys.  Radio is a good idea gone corrupt...but you can't really blame the radio stations for wanting to play what's popular, can you?  You can't expect a company to make advertising money playing unknown European Techno bands, can you?  They're forced to play what people want to hear.  It's not really so much what the record company tells them as much as what the advertisers, listeners tell them.<br>
<br>
Have I gone to the propoganda sight?  Nope.  Will I?  Nope.  It's not unbiased, so I'm not going to waste my time there.  The music industry isn't an easy one to get into...nor is it guaranteed that you'll make any sort of money.  All the money you spend on a CD isn't going into the Exec's pockets.  There's alot of people who work for that company, and since it's in America, the folk who work there constantly want raises/time off etc.  You can't really expect them to lower their prices can you, with the demands of the American Worker?  (I'm American...not against the worker at all..just using this for explination's sake).  <br>
<br>
A tiny fraction of what you pay for a CD goes to the artist.  So every CD they sell counts.  If you like the artist, do them a favor and support them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zekspawn>Zekspawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/27/03 2:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

A lot.</span><hr size=1> What would have happened if the railroads had fought the airlines?  It is the exact same principal.  Airlines destroyed the railroads' success.  It demonstrates a trend that exorberantly profitable industries will eventually be put in check by new mediums.<br>
<br>
What is happening here is that we are dealing with a whole new medium.  While there are some similarities to existing precedents, the laws are being misinterpreted.  The technology has changed too rapidly for them to apply.<br>
<br>
There needs to be a new set of laws regarding digital material and DMCA does NOT count.  It is based in antiquated legal logic and is merely a tool bought by corporations to serve them in the court battles they foresaw.<br>
<br>
Free speech is not just the right to say what you want.  It is also the freedom to be exposed to what you want.  What governments are dealing with now in piracy is the wanton exchange of information.  History has shown that you cant put a stop to that.  Eventually restraints and punishments will lead to violent upheaval.<br>
<br>
This is basic economics and consumerism.  A market has opened up that is far superior at the task of getting products to consumers.  And as economics can predict, the older market will die.  Deep seated companies held by old grizzled mogols are unwilling to change.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows what the Kelly Blue Book is (a listing of used car values).  The company that printed it however, does 99% of their business online now.  They saw a more efficient way as the times changed and rather than attacking other online price consulting they put their name on their own service.<br>
<br>
Companies are trying that with 99 cent downloads.  It is a start but it will never catch on.  The reason... its a dollar per song.  At one point my collection would have been worth in excess of $5,000.  The price has to come down to something more reasonable, like 10 cents, for it to compete with the free market.  As of now, record companies only agree to such licensing because they will only accept equal compensation per song as CDs.<br>
<br>
Yes, I do have the audacity to tell recording companies to lay down and die.  Because they inevitably will.  Its not the future they are fighting, it is the established laws of economics in a free market.  <br>
<br>
Eventually the million dollar rock stars wont have so many million.  They main revenue will come from live entertainment and promotional deals.  It is just a mere fluke that the 20th century saw musicians become major social and financial powers where they had never been before in history.  The 21st is going to set them back to equilibrium. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/ermoksig1.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Order of Crimson Hands</span><br>  Posts: 1582<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/27/03 9:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

A lot.</span><hr size=1> Acutally, in ethics I did learn that personal moral law was, in some cases, superior to government enforced laws.  Here are some people I learned about in that class that felt the same way.<br>
<br>
Martin Luther King Jr<br>
<br>
Ghandi<br>
<br>
Martin Luther (the original)<br>
<br>
Following your own code of ethics when it conflicts with societie's in gerneral isn't always a bad thing.  While my opposition to the RIAA certainly isn't on the level of say, Martan Luther King Jr's oppostion to oppression, there is some similarity here.<br>
<br>
And, Cartels are illegal in the U.S.  They constitute a  market failure.  The only purpose of a government is to rectify market failures.  Unfortunetaly with the vast amounts of money and political capital that the RIAA and Disney are throwing around, in this case the government has been essentially bought out.<br>
<br>
We are not dealing with laws here that were made to be fair and equitable for all.  We are dealing with laws that were paid for part and parcel by special interests.  Recently.<br>
<br>
So in this case, yes, by ignoring them, and circumventing them so that they can not be used against me, I feel fantastic.  I have no moral uncertainty at all here.<br>
<br>
I can point out numerous instances in which the RIAA has shown complete and utter disregard for due process, fairness, and honesty.<br>

This article is entitled &quot;How the RIAA increases it's membership&quot;.<br>
Apparently they sign up labels that want no part of their heinous tactics with out their consent.  and when asked to be unsigned up, resignthem up with in a few days.  This is an obvious tactic to confuse the active boycott taking place against the RIAA right now.  If I were the victim company here, I would be looking in to sueing the RIAA for damages.<br>
<br>
You don't feel bad for artists becuase the Signed the dotted line?  How the hell else were they supposed to be artists then before p2p came out?  Here is a nice link for you to consider.

If you take the buisiness out of music, you're going to kill the music industry as a whole.  I don't think an artist is going to pay 100+ dollars an hour for studio time just to let people listen to it for free.  <br>

So you're saying it's constitutional to steel?  That's what it seems like to me.

<br>
So, since I would never buy a Hummer, it would be OK if I went out and stole it?<br>
<br>
Obviously physical vs intellectual property is a bit different, so...<br>
<br>
Or, since I would never buy Warcraft III it is OK if I just use pirated copies?<br>
<br>
Perhaps you don't understand the concept of Intellectual Property.  You pay them for the right to USE that stuff.  You never OWN the music you buy, you just have right to use it.<br>
<br>
So whether you were planning to buy the CD or not, you are reaping the benefits reserved for the paying customers.<br>
<br>
Now, I am not saying I think the concept is flawless...  But until such time as we decide that Intellectual property doesn't exist, it is only fair to follow the rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fortuneoffear>Fortune of Fear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/27/03 11:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

<br>
If I like an artist I fing using kazaa enough I will find a way to pay them.  I'm almost positive that the majority of people feel the same way.<br>
<br>
With their current model though, look what the industry has given us over the past few years.<br>
<br>
Britney Spears.  A watered down metalica (the started out bootleg and were amazing.  The more legit they get the more they become just another alternative band.)  Christine Aguelara.<br>
J-Lo.  among others.<br>
<br>
Out of these, only metalica had any real talent, and that is rapidly fading away.  This is some of the music I reffered to earlier that you can't pay me to listen to.<br>
<br>
Stuff that has come from p2p is superior in quantity and quality.  and many of the artists have never had anything to do with the RIAA or the old business model they are fighting tooth and nail to hold on to. Through legislation.  <br>
<br>
Admitedly a lot of people might not like Afroman, but I think he's the shit.  Considering that the only other music I listen to is Grateful Dead bootlegs from the 60s and 70s, Frank Zappa, and techno, with the occasional ICP thrown in for humor, That's saying  a lot.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you try going to the Store and getting some GD bootlegs.  see how many they have.  Bootleg is somewhat of a misnomer though, The Dead always had a special section set up at their concerts for people that wanted to record them and share the tapes.  Metalica's roots go back to bootlegging.  The became famous on it's tapes that were traded around a growing loyal fanbase.  And their music was fantastic. Now listen to it.<br>
<br>
If there was ever evedince of a business model corrupting good music, that's it.<br>

Courtney Love actually has a brain that functions. That is assuming that she didnt have a editor. <br>

But reading, just the first 3 pages, makes me wanna barf. <br>
<br>
I cant belive that the record companies are raping the artists that baddly. Tony Braxton had to delare bankruptsy and her records sold $188 MILLION dollars? Thats, excuse my language, fucking insane.<br>
<br>
I have no respect for the record execs. Fuckers do nothing. Its the artists that bust hump. <br>
<br>
I'll take music off Kazaa. I dont want to pay 15 bucks for 1 or 2 songs I want to listen to. Screw that. I'll pay that 45 bucks a month to a broad band provider and down load all the songs I want. <br>
<br>
Call me a thief but after reading C.Ls comments, it doesnt sound like im screwing anyone over besides the record people.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/warden4423/newzaith2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

System of a Down (quite possibly the best artist in there genre no body sounds like them) Queens of the Stone Age, Audio Slave, Foo Fighters.<br>
<br>
All of those guys are really good artist, musicians.  Besides that, who are you to judge how good a musician is?  Millions of people disagree with you on the Christine Aguilera/Britney Spears thing.  I'm not a listener of their music, but I recognize that there is talent there.<br>
<br>
Honestly, Techno is probably the worst form of music out there..because it's not really music is it?  How many instruments are in these techno groups?  Most of it is Drum Machine and Synthesizer.  Is it art?  Yes.  Is it music?  Not really.  More computer programing than music.  <br>
<br>
Not that I ment to bash that style or anything..I'm sure alot of it is enjoyable, but don't call people that actually trained them selves musically crap and turn around and listen to something that was generated electronicly.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Order of Crimson Hands</span><br>  Posts: 1587<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/27/03 11:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

You misinterpreted what I said. <br>
<br>
I use Kazaa as a way to DEMO music. I download a couple songs from a CD, listen to them, and if I like them, I write the name of the album down with intent to buy at some point. <br>
<br>
And if I don't, then I don't buy the CD and delete the files. <br>
<br>
It's nice to be able to listen to songs from artists I would never have otherwise been exposed to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showMessageRange?topicID=688.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showMessageRange?topicID=688.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showMessageRange?topicID=688.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showMessageRange?topicID=688.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showMessageRange?topicID=688.topic&start=101&stop=118>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showPrevMessage?topicID=688.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showNextMessage?topicID=688.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.threadControl?topicID=688.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=688.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=688.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62>In the Real Life News</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246f<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
