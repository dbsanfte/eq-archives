Silly is quite relative. If you want to talk silly then EQ itself would seem to qualify as quite a silly way to spend one's precious free time.<br>
But I don't think so.<br>
I also don't think roleplaying a marriage is silly either especially on a roleplay server where leveling up and becoming an uber sleeper waker uper was SUPPOSED to be secondary to the journey towards his lair and the people you met on the way.<br>
You seem to me like one of those bitter old men who never found anyone that would love him (in character and maybe out too) and so have to belittle those who are lucky enough to have at least found someone they can give it a try with.<br>

<br>
I don't think he was saying it's wrong... jsut that -he- thinks it's silly.  What he does find wrong (&amp; I hope I am not one of his guilty parties) is when someone superceeds their group stuff for the sake of the romance letting a group member fall because they were too busy making googly-eyes.<br>
<br>
Personally, if I died because some one was too busy chatting in /say, /tell, /group, /guild, or whatever and not paying attention to the group and anyone's health bar, then I would be mighty pissed at the idiotic death.  <br>
<br>
If someone dies because I can't get attack on or get off one of my little heal spells because I was lost in tells or some other chat, then I am a pretty damn poor player for neglecting those I am immediately grouped with.  <br>
<br>
But.... if I am in downtime and Caillou and Bippin are in the same group or he is around, then, yeah, they make funny noises at each other.  But we have both dropped it off immediately when a wanderer wandered in or the static returned.  Both of us understand not hearing a reply for while because we realise that a reply might mean the one replying risks death (theirs or someone else's) to do so immediately and neither of us find that acceptable.<br>
<br>
However... I have had situations where people send me a tell and then expect me to answer immediately and get miffed at me when I don't.  If when I then say &quot;I'm in battle&quot; or &quot;I'm the puller&quot;, if the person doesn't understand and wants me to drop every last thing for them, I -try- to find a convenient moment to go AFK (telling my group thus) and deal with telling the person who doesn't understand jsut what a jerk he/she is being and that pretty much ends -that- conversation.  One exception to this would be my RL SO (not Bippin's player) when I needed to do something for him.  On the one occassion that I can remember when that happened and I was in a group, I made my appologies, went AFK, left the computer and went to the person of my SO.  I would expect the same of any player with an SO or child or any RL situation.  <br>
<br>
RP romance can add a nice dymanic to a character, IF the players so choose, but should not ever ever ever jeopardise other people in a group.<br>

OOC I am very happy in my life and I have been married for a long time. So bitter I am most certainly not. IC Siffo is a very happy character who has no interest in romance as he is already married and has been for a long time. It would be rather dishonorable for him to show a romantic interest while he was out adventuring with Mrs. Siffo waiting at home for her adventuring husband to return. I didn't belittle any one. I stated my opnion. And I would much rather have a group welcome me with a hunt or quest as I already have romance in RL but I don't have shardwurms dragons, arachnids or magical adventures (OK a few times when I was younger but those chemicals can cause serious problems so they are not recomended.).<br>
<br>
I would say I am most definatly not jelous. I just have little tolerance for some one who is endangering or delaying the group for their RP romance. I do attend RP weddings, I do respect RP romances and marriages and treat them in a proper manner. I still think they are silly and just have no need for them on a hunt.<br>
<br>
Note: I did not bring up RL mixing with EQ romance or cybering till Didi implied I was speaking of them.<br>
<br>
I will repeat. This is my opinion, others may have any other opnion no matter how wrong they are. I also did not belittle any one, I stated my opinion and some of the reasons why I feel that way. If you feel that this was an attack on your beliefs or anything else then you should re-examine why you believe the way you do rather than attack me.<br>

That said, I don't think that relationships that are &quot;only&quot; RP are silly either.  They can add depth to the story of your character and those around him/her.  I would agree that it's important to pay attention to what you're doing when you're hunting in a group - that's just not the time for being verbose and concentrating on something else.<br>
<br>
After having read the above, I'd also agree that it's important to be careful in your RP relationships.  Both parties have to be fully aware that what they're doing is in-character only and doesn't extend to the RL players, unless the players are getting to know each other out of character as well and agree on romance.  Of course, the usual internet safety tips apply: don't give out personal information unless you're really sure of what you're doing. <p><div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/velsig.jpg"><BR>

Siffo is a bookkeeper turned adventurer, for goodness sake. How much romance can you expect from the ex-bookkeeper for the Deeppockets?<br>

Marriages aren't necessarily romantic, like Siffo's.  (And, I have to confess, mine isn't wildly romantic either.)  <br>
