<br>
I am sick and tired of how California handles their fucking court system.  As Blood said in another thread even with the death penalty someone there will most likely die in prison.  My story (minus names) is one that I hope outrages people like it has my family.<br>
<br>
My aunt and uncle seem to live a pretty normal life.  They both have good jobs and like most people in the very late 70's they have taken out life insurance.  Here is where we enter the evil greed demon that takes control of the man I no longer call my uncle.  He concocts a plan to kill his wife and have it look like a murder so he can claim her insurance.  The plan is simple he and her would go for a Sunday drive, he would act like there was a flat (by taking air out of one tire) in the middle of no where.  His two co-conspirators would drive by and kill her while he &quot;went to get help&quot;.  <br>
<br>
The action.  Well everything goes according to plan, except the two co-conspirators realize they don't want to be killers and drive off without killing her.  He comes back sees her still alive and proceeds to shoot her.  The police find him with the gun in his hand, her blood on him, and him being an asshole not even denying that he did it.<br>
<br>
Court case- Soundly convicted in a very quick trial in which he barely offered a defense.  Sentenced to be put to death.  Spends many years on death row. <br>
<br>
Time machine (to the late late 90's)<br>
<br>
Still on death row this man and his lawyer suddenly become part of the limelight again in their little area.  For one of the deceased jury member's brother claimed that during his trial his sister was insane and talking to her dead uncle.  He claims that he told her on multiple occasions how their dead uncle told her to convict him to make him a martyr.<br>
<br>
Result, another appeal after all the other have been exhausted.<br>
<br>
Result of appeal is motion for a new trial, (still wasn't decided last time my family updated me).<br>
<br>
Problem is that the 2 material witnesses are dead.  All the the evidence such as the gun and whatnot that were used in the original trial are gone.  There is almost no possible way that with a new trial he will be convicted because the evidence of the crime no longer exists.<br>
<br>
Suffice to say my family is pissed off about this and has been fighting in court to keep him from getting a new trial.<br>
<br>
I just find it sick that someone would be able to get off on something simply due to the errosion of evidence over a more than 20 year period. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Tragic.<br>
<br>
There seem to be 2 complains to your post.  One - is the criminal justice system in general (i.e., new trial), and two, the death penalty.<br>
<br>
I don't support the death penalty.  My primary reason is that it is simply applied unfairly and recklessly in this country.  It is undeniable that whether you die or get life often times hinges on what race you are, or the race of your victim, i.e., if you are are black you are gonna fry, and if you kill a white women you are gonna fry.  To me that is insane.  Time and again statistics show that death hinges not on the facts, but how you look.  Good looking kid from the suburbs who did a horrible murder? You get life.  Ghetto lookin &quot;gangsta&quot; from compton - death.<br>
<br>
Another problem with the death penalty is that undoubtedly innoncent people are executed.  You just can't take it back. The former gov of illinois (who was republican)  communted ALL death row convictions to life, because people were just shocked at how DNA evidence was freeing wrongly conficted folks.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, with that said, I might be for the death penalty if they took out the subjectivity into how it is applied, i.e., if you did it -death - no jury to decide if you die or live.  As a proud liberal this might seem strange to some, but again, I just hate how death penalty is applied.  If they applied it fairly, I probably would be for it.<br>
<br>
As for the criminal justice system in general - its the best around - but crap happens.<br>
<br>
Californai courts and the 9th circuit are the most liberal courts in the country.  I doubt they'll change the slow death penalty cases on the west coast, because basically, the west coast on the whole is not as gung ho for the death penalty as those in the south are.<br>

Unless you're OJ...ok that was a bad example.<br>
<br>
Blood, it's not just blacks. It's not.<br>
<br>
There are three men sitting in Arkansas state prison, on death row, for the murders of three little boys.<br>
<br>
The evidence against them is circumstantial at best(One of the guys was a suspect because he wore lots of black, was wiccan and listened to Metallica.), and yet, they were all but tarred and feathered, while the person(s) who really did these heinous crimes, runs around scot-free.<br>
<br>
It's far more, imho, about money. If you have the money to spend on law teams, media, spindoctors, etc, then you're more likely to get off, at least with a lighter sentence. <br>

I have debated for it and against it and that comes down to a common denominator in all the arguments.<br>
<br>
Second, I couldn't have said it better than Traelle did about being classist rather than racist.  <br>
<br>
Funny thing about the case in my family is that he was a rich white male upstanding in the community.  He got the death penalty for how he was unremorseful, and the sheer brutality of the murder.<br>
<br>
My issue is why did the system let him get this far to where he might get a new case, based on a testimony about someone who cannot defend themself (the supposedly &quot;insane&quot; juror).  The death penalty helped it as he would have lost his ability to appeal long ago as he went through more than a common person gets.  But its really a joke.<br>
<br>
and Traelle, I am very familiar with the Damien case.  Being in Arkansas I can just remember how it was portrayed on television.  There was no possible way for them to get a fair trial simply due to all the media coverage before hand.  I mean weeks and weeks before the trial they reported confessions that never happened.  People in churches talked about the &quot;heathen demon children&quot; all this time.  I'd like to think of myself as open minded but had I been a juror there is no way I could walk in that court with what had already been put in my head and say I was not going to convict them.<br>
<br>
Their lawyers were shitty.  They did not need to be tried in Arkansas, or even in the Bible Belt period as it made a fiasco of things in this area. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
However there is one study that says that the race of your victim has a huge bearing on whether you get death penalty.  But again, its probably tied to socio-economics (i.e., kill poor black homeless guy - not that bad - kill white suburban women - death asap).<br>
<br>
Here is where I would support death penalty:<br>
<br>
a) Convicted beyond reasonable doubt with circtain circumstances (young victim, more then one crime, brutal)<br>
<br>
b) &quot;Special evidence&quot; you did it.  This special evidence would have to be video tape, more than 1 eye witness and/or something similar so you basically have no doubt you did it.<br>
<br>
- if a &amp; b apply - death - do not past go.<br>
<br>
This way we take &quot;subjectivity&quot; out of the equation, which drives me crazy.  However, it would cut down death penaltie because circumstantial evidence cases wouldn't qualify.<br>

<br>
As we do it now (at least in most states is)<br>
<br>
Trial- Verdict.  If high enough to ask for death penalty and prosecutor asks for it we go to the <br>
<br>
Something (can't remember name) Trial - where you simply put character witnesses on the stand and they try to show why this person should or should not be put to death.  I think this is where the real racial discrimination (if there is much of it, Im still inclined to economics) would take place.   <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

It is an unforgivable thing to kill someone in the name of greed.<br>
<br>
However, the point you are making is to criticize the justice system.  I disagree.  I believe that the system we have now is one of the best in the world (with the exception of the barbaric death penalty).  <br>
<br>
My reasons are this.  Justice is vengeance and I do see a problem with vengeance.  We do not live under the law of Moses though I hear a lot of right-wing fanatics advocating that we do.  <br>
<br>
I once was dumbfounded to watch a preacher on television in a &quot;Family Bible Study Hour&quot; reading from Deuteronomy(sp) about how when a wife talks back she should have her hand cut off;  the preacher's elaboration during this &quot;Family&quot; show was that due to modern laws we unfortunately just simply cannot do this (but we should hold to the principal).  Thats a big wtf.  Back to the issue and away from conservative ideals, revenge solves nothing unless it is a serious civil trial in which tangible monetary damage have been done.  <br>
<br>
We could be like isolated tribes in Africa that periodically wipe themselves out by avenging family member's deaths until no one is left alive.  When does the vengeance stop?  When you kill a death row inmate you are still taking away someone's family member.  If we kill criminals for the &quot;sake&quot; of the victim's family, then we are right back to square one.<br>
<br>
And of course we *must* be more civil than those Muslims that beat their women and kill criminals on a whim.  Actually their laws and punishments are more grounded in social and religious ideals rather than skewed justice beliefs we have.  I can at least respect Islamic criminal law as it has remained unchanged for so long.  Someone steals, cut off their hand, they cant steal with it again.  Makes more sense than spending $1,000's sending a teenager to bootcamp for a $2 candy bar shoplift.  Perhaps those examples are too extreme though.<br>
<br>
Finally, the &quot;fucked up&quot; justice system.  Is it wrong that we would rather let 1 guilty man go free than imprison 100 innocents?  No, it is not.  It was set up this way hundreds of years ago and has been interpreted liberally ever since so that we may avoid a facist criminal justice system.  Hundreds of death row innmates in the last few years with DNA technology have been absolved.  The system is not without flaw.  Oh, but at least we catch &quot;some&quot; guilty people right?  What if you, or a loved one was that person wrongly convicted or railroaded through the courts to make a political or social statement?  That could never happen you say?  Yea, you are probably right as long as you are not a black male age 18-35.<br>
<br>
I think what we have is just fine.  You never hear about all the times the system works.  You just see all the over-covered isolated events where someone gets off on a technicality.  Make all the conjectures you want, but without being the judge, jury, or a person in that courtroom you really cant trust what the media tells you about how &quot;fucked up&quot; the CJ system is. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/ermoksig1.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=inconnutheenchanter>Inconnu the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 7:41:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: California and Death Row</span><hr size=1> I have no problem with the death penalty being applied in cases where there is video evidence of both the pre-meditation and the killing.

<br>
I have a major problem with the death penalty being an allowable sentence in the USA, a country where it has been proved (in the case of OJ Simpson) that provided you have enough cash, you can buy your way out of prison.  <br>
<br>
Convictions should be based on how expensive your lawyers were, they should be based on facts.  <br>
<br>
And stricter boundaries for sentencing are needed, this is true in the UK, (no clue on US). Here one person steals 100 cars and gets 100 cautions and walks, and another steals 1 and goes to jail.   It's plain stupid.  Crimes should have a standard penalty.<br>
<br>
e.g. Car Value &lt; 10k, £1,000 fine + repair costs + 200 hours community service.<br>
<br>
Murder (1st degree) = Life, no appeal before 20 years<br>
Murder (2nd degree) = 20 years, no appeal before 10 years<br>
<br>
Oh (Personal Vendetta this)<br>
<br>
Identity Theft = 1 month in the stocks, and infinite free tomatoes and eggs for the victim to use.<br>
<br>
etc etc<br>
<br>
Sorry, I like ranting,<br>

The police just frightened and confused him into spouting back at them what they said to him.<br>
<br>
That they chose to disallow evidence, such as bitemarks on the victims and dental &quot;pictures&quot; of the three guys...just...&lt;grr&gt;. ok, done hijacking.<br>

Although I agree that the justice system we have is not a bad one...it, like, anything else, is corruptable. It's not the whole system, I doon't think, but a few people in high places who abuse their power. <p><center><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/traelle4.jpg"><br><i>Still keeping things sane(or not) at <a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner" target="_new">Sar's Corner.</a><br>Yes, you can touch my <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=588147" target="_new">clothes.</a></i></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blood is sexah ;)</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 12:12:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/DavidStrange/vamp.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: California and Death Row</span><hr size=1> Ermok, I agree that we have a pretty good system.

Whatever that judge is smoking needs to be passed to me.<br>

Traelle, yeah but in Arkansas you know they reported all of them confessing.  They &quot;had&quot; statements of each one.  Later they reported that someone had given them bad information but the damage was already done. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
