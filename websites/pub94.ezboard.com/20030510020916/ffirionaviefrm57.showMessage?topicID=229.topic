Also, for a while in the past, I worked at a moving company.  These are two lines of work where you end up meeting a variety of people, most of which are...well...odd, to say the least.<br>
<br>
An incident the other day got me thinking though.  I went on a delivery to a pretty lousy part of town...these roads have rows of condemened houses, houses with missing doors or windows, halfway caved in rooves, you name it.  The thing that got my attention was, the house I delivered to had 14 people living in it, and it was no bigger than my living room, kitchen, and dining room combined.  This house also had plastic sheeting for windows, and no front door.  Seven children there, all who looked to be under the age of 10, and 7 adults.<br>
<br>
One could say that they are all high school flunkies or dropouts, which is most likely true.  But the thing there is, I never graduated either.  I thought I was the shit when I was younger, and really screwed myself over in school.  I ended up failing 19 classes throughout high school, just because I was a little punkass.  Yet, I have a rather nice apartment, and cover all the bills alone, with only one job.  I moved out when I was 19.  I am not seriously in debt, I have never had to go to my parents asking their help in covering my bills.  Car repairs..yes.  Has Dad tossed me a bit of cash for the holidays? Again, yes.  But I repay my debts, and have paid off almost everything I owe to my parents.  They offer me food money all the time, and I refuse it.<br>
<br>
I in no way was born into any kind of wealth.  I am actually better off now than my parents were at my age.  <br>
<br>
I do feel that everyone has an equal chance.  The child born into wealth has the same chances as I do to succede in life.  For every chance I have to make a dollar, the wealthy child has a chance to lose one.<br>
<br>
What string of decisions was made, to have these 14 people end up living in a shack together?  Where did I finally go right, after being a total waste during 10 of my 12 years of my schooling, to end up in what my friends have called &quot;A mansion of an apartment&quot;?<br>
<br>
What choices are made, to where people who are born millionares lose everything?  What went through the peoples heads when I was mugged earlier today while on the job?<br>
<br>
Hhmn....maybe I am just trying to understand how people work.  I see wealth, and I see poverty every day, and it just perplexes me how some people can live the way they do, and what caused it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am not really going anywhere with this, just something I wanted to say. But please post your thoughts, I am interested in what others think about this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 716<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/11/03 7:19:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=229.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Choices...</span><hr size=1> Probably revolves around how you spend the money you earn, however much or little it is.  Evidently YOU put things like apartment, car, and food as a priority.  But what if those weren't your priorities?  People with drug habits, drinking problems, compulsive gambling, even smoking ... these eat up a lot of money and could easily lead to many people sharing a home.  If the money-earner drinks or gambles all the money away, for example ... <br>
<br>
Or what about people with heath problems?  I hear tell there's a pretty backwards (or nonexistent) public health system in the US, so ongoing chronic health problems for one family member could really drag a whole family down.<br>
<br>
What if they're illegal immigrants or for some reason are not legally registered for work?  Once you become homeless it can be quite difficult to get back on track because without an address you can't apply for government assistance, get social insurance number, etc.<br>
<br>
Those are just a few reasons that might lead 14 people to be living in those conditions ... I'm sure there's many others ... I guess it boils down to priorities.  Some people just have screwed sense of priorities.<br>

Due to Dissabilitys neither myself nor my husband work full time. I dont work at all and he works part time durring the summer when he is able to. we are certainly not well off.<br>

Does that meen our 8 year old son is going to grow up to be a non motivated empoverished waste of space with no direction in his life?<br>

Why do some people end up wealthy(successful/rich/content/what ever you may wish to call it).  And others end up scum?<br>
<br>
Over my life I have seen this played out many times, and no real ryhme or reason to the strating and ending points.  <br>
<br>
I have noticed several groups of people<br>
<br>
1) gifted/talented:  some start out poor, some rich.  they maybe educated professionals, or self taught starving artist.  They all have a passion, talent, or drive that leads to success.<br>
<br>
The &quot;success&quot; maybe riches, accomplishment, or some other intangible.<br>
<br>
this group always seems to overcome most things<br>
<br>
2) the middle class (people I grew up with) they start in the middle, they stay there...the ones who fall out generally develope addictions, or the weight of the poor choices push them down.<br>
<br>
3) the cattle.  the poor etc.  by poor I do not mean the wide spectrum of people who have limited means.  Poverty is not an income level it is a way of thinking, the end result of a series of choices.  In general modern western society has damned these people. In the 60s they were given freedom, with out the ability to handle it, and many never will be able to flourish without constant assistance.<br>
<br>
Really it is about choices, and your choices have weight.  The more poor choices you make and the more likely you end up in a dire sitiation.<br>
<br>
some random thoughts, could be a good debate. lets see <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=meijisweetflower>Meiji Sweetflower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/11/03 12:13:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=229.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gifs.net/animate/laughs.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Choices...</span><hr size=1> Having a great foundation is a wonderful thing.

<br>
I believe if someone is given a good foundation of knowledge, so they can make good choices, the ball is in their court. Personally, I blew it. I was the last person anyone would imagine to screw up. It wasn't drugs, liquer, or any other substance. I just made bad choices in higher education and priorities. I pay for it now, which I won't bore you with. <br>
<br>
I think I've got it figured out now. And I have a long road to work it out, with a spouse, and two 5-yr olds. I have bills to take care of (no matter how small), and I want to own my own house. It'll happen someday, because I'm going the right direction now. <p>In Love &amp; Silliness,<br>

and who are we to judge others for their choises, we dont know their reasons, <br>
I honostly dont think Genetics has anything to do with how you turn out as a person, i am a live example of that. But I do belive that when we are young, we find someone who we take after, it doesnt have to be parents, it can be a friends parents, an uncle a neighbour ect.<br>
Evryone in lives make choises.<br>
Often you dont know before you taken them, if they are right or wrong.<br>
