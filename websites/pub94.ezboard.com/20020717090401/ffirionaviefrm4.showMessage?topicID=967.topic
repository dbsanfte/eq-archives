There's a huge difference between &quot;I'm not really willing to pay more than that&quot; and &quot;it's not worth that much.&quot;  As if you have some arbitrary listing of what things are worth.  If someone says they're not willing to pay me some amount, I'll simply say if I'm willing to sell at that price or no, and there we go.  But if they say &quot;it's not worth that much&quot; you can bet I'll tell them to get it themselves... obviously, it must be easier to get than to buy at that price, since it's not worth it to pay that much.<br>

my favorite thing is when i am running around minding my own business..... and then get a random tell asking to buy a random item, ie one day i got a tell &quot;sell me a lodi shield?&quot;  i have never once even thought about selling a lodi shield.....<br>
<br>
i responded with &quot;.....&quot; and the person got mad when i explained that i found it rude to get a random tell from a random person to buy an item i dont even have for sale, nor have at any time.<br>

<br>
of course, if you are watching the market channel all the time, you will see a lot of items being sold for a somewhat similar price. but that doesnt mean that this *is* the price for that item. maybe some days later, this item will go for less because a lot of people already have one. like the infamous netherbian chitin. <br>
<br>
granted, if somebody would be trying to sell a lammy for 20k, it would be a little bit overstated <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . but then again, if somebody sells item x for. lets say, 200pp more than you normally see it go, there is really no reason to tell &quot;hey, thats not worth it!&quot; - simply dont buy. or HAGGLE. its a market. try it. <br>
<br>
another shot on the &quot;thats not worth it!&quot;-thing:<br>
who are you to tell? maybe you could get yourself that item in about 1hour? alright, do it then. or you have seen this item go for less recently? fine, but that guy over there is selling it for more now. bad luck. haggle.<br>
<br>
i also dont like the &quot;hey, i looked it up the internet and this isnt worth that much cash!&quot;-thing. oh, you have looked it up in the internet? good for you, then go buy in in the internet. because im not selling it to you.<br>
<br>
another favorite of mine is &quot;hey, the quest is sooo easy to do, so i wont pay your price!&quot;. if you say something like that to me, you *will* get a &quot;then go get it yourself!&quot; in return.<br>
<br>
if you dont like a special price, try to haggle. dont argue. because arguing wont get you the item.<br>

<br>
To the initial poster, I agree.  When Auctioning, the thing I dread most is &quot;Make an Offer.&quot;  When it is OBVIOUS that virtually everyone has a set price in their mind, they are just HOPING you will give them MORE than they want.  So you make an offer, and they say 'That's not good enough.'  Well, if you HAD a price in mind, SAY it.  Or at the very least, if you don't like the offer you get GIVE A COUNTER-OFFER.  It is only polite to engage in negotiations, and not require the buyer to keep gussing until they hit your 'magic number.'<br>
<br>
To everyone who pipes up in Auction or Market channels that someone is selling things for 'more than they are worth' - Stuff a sock in it!  There is no 'real price' - Everything is worth the combination of No Less than what the Seller will sell it for, AND No More than what the Buyer will pay.<br>
<br>
Things are worth different amounts to different people, based on desire, need, and wealth.  I wouldn't pay squat for a Shiny Metallic Robe - its Ugly and I don't need the stats.  To me it is Worthless.  Yet people that need it for their Epic have paid exorbitant premiums for it!<br>
<br>
And that can be said for nearly anything in the game.  'Average' Prices rise and fall by the whims and perceptions of the masses.  But the actual price is dictated solely by the Buyer and Seller of each transaction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umosushi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mosushi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/10/02 7:00:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=967.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ROFL</span><hr size=1> I could see myself on either end of that conversation.  It hasn't reached the point where I could be on both at once, though -- my alt's have a mind of their own, but they don't talk back yet.  Anway, I don't really see the problem.  He wants more than you want to pay?  Buy it elsewhere or go get it yourself.  You want more than someone is willing to pay?  Find another buyer or lower your price.  What's the big deal?<br>
<br>
Example: going rate on flawless diamonds is about 6k.  I've had some nibbles, but I don't need plat in a hurry, so I'm holding the price.  If I discover a sudden need for plat, you can be sure I'd lower it, though.<br>
<br>
Another example: I've wanted a kavruul's mystic pouch for months.  I refuse to pay more than 7k for it -- just not worth more to me.  Most sellers ask about 10-12k.  This is a case where killing isn't an option -- Vox ports me out.  So, I do without.

I will reply with an offer and they have gotten just what you said.<br>
<br>
No I am not going to go and camp sirens for 200pp or whatever whenever plenty of people play more .... if you aren't willing to pay one of the few people on the server who will go get it what they want then well I guess you can go to hell huh? <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR>Mistress of the Black Rose<BR><I>Beguiler of the 57th Jewel</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujharycleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jharycleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 173<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/10/02 6:18:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=967.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: On the &quot;make an offer&quot; ..</span><hr size=1> I have no clue what 90% of the items being auctioned are worth. Most of the ones I'm interested in have no price listed. When I do send a tell, 75% of the time I get &quot;Make an offer&quot;. I always say 200pp. I get yelled at and scolded time and again, and I tell them I have no CLUE what it's worth, but if you say make an offer, don't be insulted by 200pp. Maybe your piece of uber gear is worth 10k, I don't know. If you don't know how much it's worth either say so, then we can ask around or go to eq prices or whatever. I always give people a straight up price when they send me a tell about an item. I have haggled, taken cash and trade, lots of things. But never once have I said &quot;Make me an offer&quot;. I have said &quot;Have no clue what it's worth, whaddya think 75pp?&quot; and we made the deal. Buying somehting shouldn't be so hard.<br>

<br>
I get a lvl 55 spell drop and want to sell it you know how much i sell it for?The same price a normal lvl 55 spell goes for why? pretty much cause the 100kpp in my bank just doesnt pay my bills or feed my kids so its all just play money to me but i will never give it to a greedy person i would rather destroy it.And no im not tight with my money just ask anyone in my guild im quite foolish with my cash heh i would buy bone chips for 1pp each off of lower lvl guildies before or cough up 1k for trade skills or pay crazy pp for lower lvl guildies to get a TLC item for me.<br>
<br>
That i dont mind doing but i wont give you 30k or whatever for this or that piece of equiptment!  <br>
