<br>
Was it an FnF that sold it, or Eldraded. Whatever the reason, AS is wrong for buying it, if it was FnF that sold the Character, then they are just as wrong as AS.<br>

<br>
He was pretty open to FnF that he intended to sell the character, and as you can imagine, the response from FnF was less than favorable - as Eld has been a fixture in FnF for a very long time - however no one can tell a player what to do with the time they've invested in their character.<br>
<br>
I guess it all boils down to how different people view the selling of virtual game objects.  Legally, there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with selling a virtual object - i.e. it is not punishable in a criminal sense.  That is violates the EULA of a given company is another thing - you break THEIR rules and you become open to corrective action on the part of the company.  However note that the legal issue of selling your time invested in a character vs. selling the virtual object has not been resolved...hence sites like PlayerAuctions are still open for business.  Furthermore, it is quite evident that VI/SOE turns a blind eye, to all but the most blatant of cases, on this activity as it keeps their monthly subscriptions rolling in.  And let's face it, while some folks view EQ with a certain amount of reverence and sense of purity/integrity, ALL VI/SOE cares about is revenue growth and profitability.<br>
<br>
As for social acceptability, that clearly depends on who you talk to and on which server.  Clearly FV has been viewed as a bastion of freedom from the &quot;evils&quot; that plague your typical blue server, and thus anything that cheapens or diminishes the concept of &quot;earning it&quot; or roleplaying is bound to incite the wrath of those who cherish what FV is supposed to be.<br>
<br>
So if someone is going to be blatant about selling their character and/or buying a character where the transfer is totally obvious to the community, they had best be prepared for the backlash...because to coin a phrase &quot;You're in our world now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Like drugs, abortion, contraception...it's one of those hot issues that cannot be answered/resolved in a definitive sense - all that can be expressed are opinions.<br>

Why didn't he come here with them in the first place? Because he knew he could buy a toon later and join them without putting forth any effort? Why not have all of them buy toons and go back and play on his server? Or they could all start over again on either, or a completely different server, and experience growing up together!! Oh wouldn't that be nice? Hell at this point VI oughta have pre-made characters at various levels that people can just buy unequipped. What the heck eh?  40 gets you a 20th level cleric. 60 gets you a 30th level monk. 100 gets you a 50th warrior. 300 gets you a pre-equipped ready to be hated quad kiting fiend; druid/wizard optional.<br>
<br>
 If my RL friend showed up for my Runequest game, 6 months after he was invited, but was just too busy doing something silly, like playing EQ, and then wanted to start playing..... but wanted to be kicked up to the level of ability that the others were, he'd get exactly what happened in RL. <br>

<br>
I used to group wiht Eldraed in VL five months ago — Lets face it bud, Eldraed is long gone.  His spirit doesn't live on vicariously through a simple auction to a simple person who wished to join a powerleveling guild.  Doesn't work that way.<br>
<br>
I rarely post here, but it appears that there is more here on Firiona Vie that is rotten than this, and its the Roleplayers vs the PowerGuilders.<br>
<br>
Lots of people came to FV when it opened to be fruity little roleplayers, and try to enforce the good vs evil ideal.  It's a nice concept, but once you get into your 50s its fundamentally flawed.  That's why there are so many fruity RP guilds who flounder and lose members left and right.<br>
<br>
Then again...<br>
<br>
Lots of players came to FV to start a new PowerGuild - using knowledge from years of guilding and experience they came to conquer, to be the best.  To get to the top the fastest, regardless of who was in the way or the consequences.  Winning is everything.<br>
<br>
You gotta respect them both, but they sure as hell wont get along.<br>
<br>
So far the Power Guilds own this server, and it will stay that way.  FV, its title, and its ideals are never going to be about Roleplaying in the traditional sense.<br>
<br>
Eldraed is just one way of proving that point — as are the other 200 posts about FnF, Reso and AS.  Wake up, its the way the server is.  <br>

<br>
And no one ever mentions the middle ground. There are powergamers, and there are hardcore roleplayers, and then there are the middle guys---those who like to roleplay but also want to play the game. <br>
<br>
I would say, of anyone, that large middle group balances the server out. <p><br><img

<br>
While this particular roleplayer is an unabashed &quot;fruit&quot;, I find the attempt to link &quot;roleplaying&quot; with effeminacy/homosexuality and thereby denegrate both to be disturbing, but also somewhat revealing of the mentality of at least some &quot;powergamers.&quot;  It also unconsciously reveals some anxieties over masculinity/potency. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

<br>
Um, how so I have seen many many characters that have been sold including one who had a level 60 troubador that he was using to power level his bard cause he didnt have a bard just a troubador.  In my experience the 12 year old with momma's credit card tends to buy the account and not someone who knows what they are doing.  You say that you have played for years, fine, what class?  You might not think it but their are actually decisions to be made by a level 60 warrior that are not the same as for a level 60 any other class that ensure the success of the raid.  The gift of the character to the guild would at least allow the memory and respect that the person behind the pixels remain, the chance that those decisions will be made properly on raids, and an opportunity to come back if you choose to.  The way you are doing it is like shoving a doppleganger in there and not caring whose memory you scar or feelings you effect.<br>
<br>
Should you be expected to start over well um duh yes, my real life friend started me on this game, he was playing on Prexus turns out  that like 2 months later he quits playing and my other real life friends from back in Mississippi start playing and start on The Rathe. A year later they quit playing and our guild falls apart we decide to take a break for  a little bit and start playin on Xev server much to our suprsise another real life friend is playing on this server we just didnt know each other played. Another year or so passes we decide to move to FV for the small server population and to stay playing with a couple of friends of ours who moved over from Xev.  So lets see the highest toon on each server was. prexus  20, rathe 50, xev 53, and now currently my FV toon is almost 36.  Its the rules, others comply by them you should too. The fact that your &quot;guild&quot; supports this blows me away.<br>
<br>
As to moving servers to be with friends RL or otherwise. Well lets make this a RL example, your real life friend is in another state. You could A) move to be with them and let them support you for a bit till you get your feet under you or  B) rob a bank and buy the house next door to them. Thats right you should go with the one that doesnt equal breaking the law.  It is not a policy it is a contract, by logging in everyday you are agreeing to that contract. The contract is legally binding. You have thus broken the law. Is it a shooting someone law? no, but that makes it no less valid.<br>
<br>
I have known other people who have bought accounts, aquaintances at work and such, and I have never seen it work out. They have no idea the persons rep, factions, or abilities, play them poorly and then in a month or two have the account taken back when the original owner takes it back.  It is a risk you have taken, but the part that still blows me away the most is that you would come here and confess to it.<br>
<br>
There is BIG difference between breaking the law and confessing to breaking the law.<br>

Yeah, seeing as 1st Fist of Light is one of those &quot;fruity&quot; roleplaying guilds.<br>

<br>
premise<br>
<br>
not getting caught breaking the law is not wrong<br>
<br>
confessing to breaking the law and allowing yourself to be thus convicted or caught breaking the law is wrong.<br>
<br>
This is what OJ did  and the way our legal system works. Thus there is a big difference between breaking the law (in this case not getting caught) and confessing to breaking the law (getting caught)<br>

There is no way they can control a single private account. Now if they were taking new accounts and powerleveling them up and selling them then you can blame them.<br>

<br>
Reso has had a couple accounts get ebayed on us. Can't say we were happy about it as one of them is one of the handfull of KEI enchanters on this server with epic to boot. <br>
