<br>
Part I:<br>
<br>
After deliberating and planning for weeks, Clan McCulloch marches onto the tundra to meet the forces of the Wrath Orcs, under the leadership of their Cheiftain Redwind. The Northmen had sent emmissaries to Kaladim, in an effort to gain Dwarven favor, but the reception from the Underfoot was less than warm. In the end, Clan McCulloch was to stand alone against the hordes of Orcs spilling onto the tundra of Everfrost, or so they thought...<br>
<br>
Unlike their Dwarven cousins, the Gnomes of the Underfoot were curious about this young barbarian clan, and sent two representatives to Everfrost to aid Hrothdan and his forces. Another Gnome would join his bretheren later in the battle. <br>
<br>
The air was still, strangely still for autumn, yet in the distance, war clouds gathered thick as night. Redwind ordered his forces from their holes in the ground just as Clan McCulloch and the Gnomes of the Blackmaul Crusaders reached the battle site, a small plain containing some ruined structures including an ancient tower... <br>
<br>
Squeaker studies the lay of the land.<br>
Hrothdan prepares a speech.<br>
Hrothdan looks to his gathered friends.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Sons an' daughters o' Halas tonight we fight fer teh safety o our homes'<br>
Glug, glug, glug... Andora takes a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Teh Orcs have threatened our people fer centuries. We'll endure their aggression nae longer!<br>
You tell your raid, 'Me father, an' me father's father spilled their blood fer teh safety o Halas'<br>
You tell your raid, Tonight we follow our ancestors an' take up teh sword against our enemies!'<br>
Cidwm cheers.<br>
Agaar growls.<br>
Horen emits a low rumble and then roars like a lion!<br>
You tell your raid, 'For when teh night is through, teh tundra will be painted with Orc Blood!'<br>
Cidwm howls.<br>
Erulaga nods and prepares.<br>
Agaar growls, &quot;My blade craves flesh!!&quot;<br>
Hrothdan raises his axe defiantly.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Tonight teh Wrath Orcs will come tae fear the names....'<br>
You tell your raid, 'McCulloch and Blackmaul!'<br>
You emit a low rumble and then roar like a lion!<br>
You tell your raid, 'Fer Halas!<br>
Horen cheers.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Fer Halas!'<br>
Cidwm raises his stick and howls.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Fer Halas!'<br>
Agaar says, 'For Halas!!'<br>
Hrothdan tries to control his horse amid the wild cheers of his war host.<br>
Cidwm says, 'Fer Justice an Home!'<br>
Cidwm growls.<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'They be out there, let's be ta it!'<br>
Agaar holds his mount also, spooked by the bloodlust!<br>
<br>
<br>
McCulloch's scouts had been away for hours without any word. The allies stood with nerves on edge, waiting for any sign of their hated foe. By mid afternoon the silence on the tundra would be replaced by the clang of steel on steel, and the cries of the dying... <br>
<br>
Cidwm says, 'Things be clear, but still be ready ta bash. A good feelin.'<br>
Erulaga nods.<br>
Erulaga says, in Barbarian, 'aye'<br>
You tell your raid, 'I hear them comin' lads! Prepare yerselves!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Tae battle lads! Fight!'<br>
Agaar growls, &quot;My blade craves flesh!!&quot;<br>
You say, 'Fer Halas and Clan McCulloch!'<br>
You emit a low rumble and then roar at a snow orc shaman.<br>
Cidwm says, 'Arroooo! Sink yer fangs inta a snow orc shaman.'<br>
Squeaker waves goodbye to a snow orc shaman.<br>
Squeaker emits a low rumble and then roars at a snow orc shaman.<br>
a snow orc shaman says 'Orc stomp, orc kill - orc weapons, your blood will spill.'<br>
You cheer.<br>
You say, 'Pray tae whatever gods motivate ye Orcs! Pray that they keep ye safe because only teh gods can keep me from rippin' ye apart!'<br>
Hrothdan bangs on his shield three times.<br>
You emit a low rumble and then roar like a lion!<br>
Hrothdan charges into battle like a crazed animal.<br>
Hrothdan howls.<br>
Cidwm growls.<br>
You say, 'Fer Halas and Clan McCulloch!'<br>
You emit a low rumble and then roar at a snow orc trooper.<br>
Hrothdan fights with abject fury.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the midst of battle, shrill cries could be heard on the wind. The Redwind had been preparing his forces for this day, for a very long time. The earth trembled as orcish archers charged into battle, shooting flame-tipped arrows from the safety of two-story towers set on top of fully armored mammoths, trampling all who were unlucky enough to be in their destructive path...<br>
<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Mammoth riders!'<br>
Cidwm says, 'Arroooo! Sink yer fangs inta an orcish mountaineer.'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'It be a slaughter!'<br>
a snow orc trooper says 'Orc stomp, orc kill - orc weapons, your blood will spill.'<br>
Hrothdan howls with rage'<br>
<br>
<br>
The battle raged for a few hours before the Clan McCulloch and allies stopped the first Orc advance. Although the fighting had calmed with the coming of night, Hrothdan knew the Orcs didn't fear the shadows. In fact, they embraced the darkness, and used it to their advantage in battle. There would only be time for a short rest...<br>
<br>
You tell your raid, 'Me friends.. we need tae rest a bit. Teh Orcs will come again with teh growin' shadows.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Teh bloody Orcs are tamin' Mammoths'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Aye that was some fierce fighting'<br>
Erulaga says, in Barbarian, 'Wow that was awesome'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Bloody bastards'<br>
Hrothdan shouts.<br>
You say, 'Is that all ye have Redwind?'<br>
Squeaker cheers at Agaar.<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'I saw 2 orcs get away Hrothdan'<br>
You kneel down.<br>
Hrothdan pulls a knife from his pack, and with a swift cut, scalps the corpse of his enemy.<br>
You grin evilly.<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'I would expect them to report this... '<br>
Hrothdan shakes his head.<br>
You say, 'They'll nae see tomorrow, little one. Me sister is trackin' 'em as we speak.'<br>
Andora tells the group, in Barbarian, 'Never fear! Andora's here! a snow orc trooper is no match for me!'<br>
<br>
<br>
The allies barely had time to bandage their wounds before the scouts reported another orcish advance moving rapidly under cover of darkness...<br>
<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Stand to! They are right behind me!'<br>
You emit a low rumble and then roar at a snow orc trooper.<br>
Hrothdan charges into battle like a crazed animal.<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'I'm chasing one o' teh filth!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Tae battle brothers an' sisters! Dinnae give 'em any quarter!'<br>
Cidwm says, 'I'll be showing it a Northman's fury!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'They charge again! Stand To!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'I hear teh ground thunderin'! Ye gods what a battle!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'By teh Six Hammers! We be yer executioners, ye slimy, pig-snouted, waste o' flesh!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Fight on me clan! Fight like yer very souls depended on it!'<br>
Cidwm nods.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Ye gods!'<br>
You tell your party, 'Stand to! a wooly mammoth wishes tae face us in battle! Prepare yerselves!'<br>
Agaar growls, &quot;My blade craves flesh!!&quot;<br>

By midnight the wind had picked up from the west, and the sound of orcish war horns pierced the night. A heavy wind-driven snow soon followed, stinging the faces of combatants on both sides. The Orcs, along with their war mammoths, would eventually brake ranks and flee. Whether it was the fury of the wind, the fury of the allies, or some signal carried by the blowing war horns in the distance, Hrothdan could not tell. It mattered little to him, for the fleeing enemy gave the allies time to welcome reinforcements from Ak'Anon... <br>
<br>
You bow before Erulaga.<br>
Cidwm cheers.<br>
You beam a smile at Erulaga.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Brothers an' sisters our enemy flees like teh cowards they are. They'll be back though. Ye can be sure o' that.'<br>
Agaar nods at Hrothdan.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Me scouts tell me teh Orcs are ridin' on Spiders now.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'More abominations'<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'They be gettin some other kinda leadin. They nae be smart enough fer all these plans!'<br>
Ottoe giggles.<br>
You raise an eyebrow inquiringly.<br>
You peer around intently<br>
Erulaga points at ottoe come to where they can see ya.<br>
Agaar says, 'Ottoe?'<br>
Cidwm glares.<br>
You peer around intently.<br>
You say, 'Another squeaker?'<br>
Cidwm says, 'another finger wiggler?'<br>
Erulaga says, in Barbarian, 'aye the latter.'<br>
Ottoe smiles.<br>
Agaar is confused by these little folk.<br>
Cidwm nods at Ottoe.<br>
Agaar snaps to attention and salutes Ottoe crisply.<br>
Erulaga says, in Barbarian, 'Hallo ottoe and welcome.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Tis good tae have ye little ones! Stand fast along side o' us!'<br>
<br>
<br>
Ottoe had come just in time, for out of the night shrill cries echoed through the surrounding hills. As the allies anxiously searched for the source of the cries, they were met by the stares of a thousand glowing red eyes. The eyes were arranged in neat vertical rows of eight, and steadily rushed towards the Northmen and their allies...<br>
<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Gah! They ambusehd me! Spider riders and Mammoth riders, along with their Orcish vanguard!'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Look to the south, comrades!'<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'Ready fer a beatin, they are. Bring them ta me wee one!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Bloody hell! Come tae mee ye abominations! I'll nae go down without sendin some o' ye tae teh underworld ahead o' me!'<br>
a snow orc trooper says 'Orc stomp, orc kill - orc weapons, your blood will spill.'<br>
a snow orc mountaineer says 'Orc stomp, orc kill - orc weapons, your blood will spill.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Tae Agaar me friends! He's bein' mauled!'<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'No Mercy!'<br>
Agaar tells the group, 'My health grows weak...'<br>
Agaar looks pale and tired.<br>
Agaar goes into a berserker frenzy!<br>
Agaar growls, &quot;My blade craves flesh!!&quot;<br>
Cidwm says, 'Arroooo! Sink yer fangs inta a gigantic wooly spider.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Fight as if all teh demons o' Araluu were on yer heels lads!'<br>
Hrothdan goes into a berserker frenzy!<br>
<br>
<br>
Like the previous waves of Orcs, the allies turned this charge as well. The storm intensified, and conditions became so harsh, that fighting became impossible. The allies were weary at this point, and secretly praised their individual deities for the respite. Hrothdan in particular wondered if Xelita and Tahranu were correct is saying that Lord Karana's power extended to the tundra of Everfrost. Was it he that sent the storm? The chieftain had no time to ponder this. His remaining war host needed looking after... <br>
<br>
Hrothdan tends to Hrothdan's wounds by applying a foul smelling, sickly yellow colored salve.<br>
You begin to bandage yourself.<br>
Agaar tells the group, 'Maybe it would be wise for us all to rest while the storm rages.'<br>
Hrothdan nods<br>
You tell your raid, 'Bring teh wounded tae teh tower, an' post scouts along teh surroundin' hills. We rest in teh tower till teh storm lets up.'<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'Rest! We be Northmen in battle! Rest be fer storytellin after.'<br>
Horen tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Aye!'<br>
Erulaga sits and holds his head.<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Did all survive the day?'<br>
Cidwm nods at Squeaker.<br>
Erulaga tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Aye. We all did.'<br>
Hrothdan looks at the carnage through blood soaked eyes.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Teh first day is ended friends!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Victory be ours!'<br>
Agaar looks exhausted.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Fer Halas an' Teh Underfoot!'<br>
Horen cheers.<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'The Tribunal ruled against the orcs.'<br>
Cidwm says to Agaar, 'Lad ye need be slayin yer foe, like a true man o the north.'<br>
Hrothdan tends to his friends, cheking their condition before resting himself.<br>
Cidwm tells the raid, 'I thank ye wee ones. Hoping I get ta meet some o yer mates. I hear they be dwarven. *grins*'<br>
You say, 'Ye've done well lads'<br>
You say, 'Teh Orcs will be back though. We cannae let our guard down yet. Have teh watch on teh hills signal if they attack again.'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'I don't think any escaped to warn Chief Redwind'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Nay. Our scouts killed their runners.'<br>
Agaar growls at the mention of Redwind!<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'May I make a fire to cook with?'<br>
You say, 'Aye General. We need warmth as well as rest.'<br>
You say, 'Come tae teh fires lads. We all need tae keep warm.'<br>
Squeaker prepares her fire and begins her stew.<br>
Ottoe holds out his hands flaming, in front of Squeaker.<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'Thanks dear'<br>
Squeaker feels good without the breeze.<br>
Ottoe says, in Barbarian, 'Its so cold here!'<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'Darn tootin '<br>
Agaar says, 'Barbarian ale will warm you wee ones.'<br>
Erulaga nods in aggrement with Ottoe.<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Nothing like heated grease to warm the bones'<br>
Ottoe tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'I must know your feelings of Innoruuk, Hrothdan. It is my understanding that you worship Rallos Zek, ally to Innoruuk.'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Aye alot of my clan frowns upon the god of war'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Nay Ottoe'<br>
You tell your raid, 'We worship a pantheon.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'All of us have patron deities, but we all recognize teh pantheon'<br>
Agaar says, 'I have no alliance to Innoruuk or Bertox friends, though Zek is my patron deity.'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Marr blesses us with valor from our birth, teh Tribunal guides our everyday lives, spurring us tae action when need be, and Zek gives us strength in battle. <br>
Ottoe tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Would you protect someone that follows Innoruk, Bertox, or Cazic Thule?'<br>
Hrothdan grins then spits.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Never. Tae ye we seem barbaric, but we understand more'n ye realize, little one.'<br>
You grin evilly.<br>
Ottoe tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Then I think we could drink together as friends'<br>
You tell your raid, 'That be welcome little one'<br>
You bow before Ottoe.<br>
Ottoe tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'I am a follower of the Nameless, myself.'<br>
Ottoe bows before Hrothdan.<br>
<br>
<br>
As the storm pelted the tower with snow and wind, a bond formed between the allies that, at first, seemed weak and fractured when the war began. As the Northmen and Gnomes rested their weary limbs, exchanging stories from their people's history, a most unlikely young barbarian traveller sought refuge from the storm...<br>
<br>
You say, 'Welcome lad. Ye may enter.'<br>
Tarbon says, 'Aye, thank ye, sir'<br>
Tarbon says, 'Was by luck that I happened to run by this place'<br>
You say, 'Have ye come tae pledge yer sword fer us or tae observe?'<br>
Agaar says, 'I am Agaar, Warrior of Clan McCulloch.'<br>
Tarbon bows.<br>
Cidwm says, 'Go play, me pup.'<br>
Cidwm`s warder says 'As you wish, oh great one.'<br>
Tarbon says, 'An honor, Agaar'<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'I don't believe in luck during battles'<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'I say we search him.'<br>
Tarbon says, 'And as fer yer question, sir, I have come to observe... I have little to offer '<br>
You say, 'Tarbon ye can watch over this tower, then. We use it fer a bandage station, an' yer help would be most welcome.'<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'Can we trust him?'<br>
Squeaker says, in Barbarian, 'It be conveninet he shows up now'<br>
You say, 'I think we can'<br>
Agaar says, 'You are a brother and a Halasman. Your presence on the battlefield brings us honor friend.'<br>
Tarbon says, 'If ye dinnae trust me, let me prove me valor'<br>
You say, 'Teh weather is nae fit fer travellin', an' like it or nae, we need his sword. On teh morrow there will be more battle.'<br>
Ottoe says, in Barbarian, 'Tarbon, What are your feelings of Innoruuk? <br>
Tarbon scowls.<br>
Tarbon says, 'The hateful fool can go rot in his eternal grave'<br>
Tarbon spits.<br>
Ottoe laughs<br>
Ottoe says, in Barbarian, 'That's good enough for me.'<br>

You tell your raid, 'They'll pay little one! Justice be ours this day!'<br>
<br>
<br>
Morning gave way to the afternoon and the morale of Redwind's forces faded with it. The allies beat back the Orcs once more who retreated over the hills, throwing their weapons in the snow as they flee. The more inexperienced of Hrothdan's army believe the battle on the plains was over, but the veterans of countless wars thought otherwise... <br>
<br>
Agaar slaps Tarbon on the back.<br>
You peer at Ottoe, looking him up and down.<br>

Tarbon says, in Barbarian, 'It has tasted orc blood this night, and we're both content in that'<br>
<br>
<br>
As the allies celebrated their temporary victory, the air suddenly became very still. From the distance, towers of flame shot into the sky, originating from an unknown source somewhere deep in the tundra of Everfrost. This would be the final wave of Orcs to burst forth from their holes and challenge Hrothdan's forces. Redwind had unleashed the most fearful of his war beasts, and the allies would pay dearly for standing their ground against him...<br>
<br>
You tell your raid, 'Teh ground shakes again... another wave! Tae arms!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Andora!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Run girl!'<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Where are ye, miss?'<br>

You tell your raid, 'I see teh trees movin... more mammoth riders!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Attend tae me sister,lad!'<br>
You say, 'I have ye back Andora! May teh Tribunal smile on us!'<br>
Hrothdan tends to Andora's wounds by applying a foul smelling, sickly yellow colored salve.<br>
You begin to bandage Andora.<br>
The person you were bandaging has moved away.<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'And off she goes again!'<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'That lass has spirit, eh?'<br>
Horen tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Ta much bleedin gonin on if ya ask me'<br>
Tarbon emits a low rumble and then roars at an orcish mountaineer.<br>
Erulaga says, in Barbarian, 'Look, out!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Stand to! a gigantic wooly spider wishes tae face us in battle! Prepare yerselves!'<br>
Squeaker points at tainted wooly mammoth. Yeah you!<br>
You tell your raid, 'This beast be tainted! It is posessed of a Demon, it is!'<br>
Agaar lets loose a berserk yell.<br>
a snow orc trooper says 'Orc stomp, orc kill - orc weapons, your blood will spill.'<br>

Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'GAH!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Egads! Little squeaker down!'<br>
<br>
<br>
The northmen are saddened by the loss of one of their allies. They knew that Redwind would have to pay, and pay dearly he would before the war ended...<br>
<br>
Agaar cries over Ottoe.<br>
Andora tells the raid, 'How did that happen?'<br>
Tarbon says, 'The snow grows dark with the blood of the slain...'<br>
You lower your head and mourn the loss of Ottoe.<br>
You tell your raid, 'May teh Tribunal have mercy on ye little friend...'<br>
Tarbon touches Ottoe's shoulder gently, his eye closing in sorrow.<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'The little master fought as brave as any Halas man...'<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'May Mithaniel Marr touch ye with mercy, little one'<br>
Hrothdan grins with determination<br>
You tell your raid, 'Me friends its time tae bury teh dead. Redwind falls soon, an' we WILL have our vengence!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Redwind ye spawn of a steamin' pile o' mammoth dung! Ready yerself, cuz teh fury o' teh North be unleashed now!'<br>

The wind howled all around the allies and the temperature dropped as night fell, but the fire burning within the chieftain would keep him warm for the duration of the journey...<br>
<br>
You tell your raid, 'Our little friends from a far off land came tae fight at our side, an we are honored by their comin.''<br>
You tell your raid, 'We've spilled blood together this day!'<br>

You tell your raid, 'Mount up lads!'<br>
Hrothdan motions for his forces to move out<br>
You point straight ahead<br>
Tarbon cheers.<br>
<br>
<br>
By noon the following day, the orcish garrison protecting Redwind's keep peered out from their watch towers, and were blinded by the reflection of a thousand gleaming spears. Hrothdan's army had come, and with them came the warmth of the sun, and a desire to do battle. As the allies prepared themselves for the inevitable siege, both sides knew the war would end soon... <br>
<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Ye ok Ottoe need any oil?'<br>
Ottoe tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Nope, just like new  <br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'I have some Steamfont Spring Water if you need it'<br>

You tell your raid, 'Bah. It will crumble like his fortress'<br>

Tarbon tells the raid, 'Come now... let us hurry! Me blood cannot take much more fiery spirits!'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Wait fer our scouts tae report, lad.'<br>
Hrothdan lifts his kilt at Redwind's Army.<br>
Tarbon roars in laughter, then does the same.<br>
Agaar says, 'Eww put that thing away Chief!!'<br>
Agaar says, 'CAGE THAT BEAST!!'<br>
Tarbon says, 'Show 'em what we're made of!'<br>
Horen chuckles.<br>
<br>
<br>
The haunting sound of bagpipes carried on the wind as Hrothdan ordered his army forward to the seige. Steel met steel, magic met magic, and the ground trembled under the fury of the allied assault. Never had a battle so fierce been fought amid the snow-capped hills of Everfrost. Travellers on the tundra looked on in wonder as reports of the sheer ferocity of the battle spread far and wide...<br>
<br>
You say, 'Pray tae whatever gods motivate ye Redwind! Pray that they keep ye safe because only teh gods can keep me from rippin' ye apart!'<br>
Hrothdan bangs on his shield three times.<br>
Hrothdan charges into battle like a crazed animal.<br>
Tarbon emits a low rumble and then roars like a lion!<br>

Agaar looks pale and tired.<br>
a snow orc trooper says 'Orc stomp, orc kill - orc weapons, your blood will spill.'<br>
Hrothdan goes into a berserker frenzy!<br>
<br>
<br>
Redwind knew he had been beaten, and fled his pavillion even as the remnants of his personal guard fought to the last Orc. Hrothdan's Gnomish allies, veterans of countless battles over the centuries, were one step ahead of the Orc Chieftain however. They made certain he would meet death that day, and that death would come at the hands of a northman... <br>
<br>
Redwind says 'Ugly creature near my feet, me thinks that you'll be good to eat!'<br>
Erulaga begins to cast a spell. <br>
Redwind has been mesmerized.<br>

Tarbon says, 'Ottoe, ye be a fine taunter'<br>
<br>
<br>
Redwind stood enthralled by the magic of Erulaga. From behind a fallen pillar, Hrothdan appeared, his faced smeared with the blood of his foes. Redwind's eyes met Hrothdan's, and for a moment the Orc Chieftain saw the fire and hatred that raged within the northman's, the same fury that was about to be unleashed...<br>
<br>
You grin evilly at Redwind.<br>
You point at Redwind. Yeah you!<br>
You say, 'Pray tae whatever gods motivate ye Redwind! Pray that they keep ye safe because only teh gods can keep me from rippin' ye apart!'<br>
Hrothdan bangs on his shield three times.<br>

Hrothdan kicks the corpse and spits.<br>
<br>
<br>
Erulaga tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Finely done Hrothdan.'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'Aye was worthy of song'<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'Aye! A fine battle!'<br>
Agaar Pokes at Redwind with his spear.<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'Before ye all go, I'd like to request somthing'<br>
You tell your raid, 'Aye lad'<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'Ye took me under yer wing and allowed me to spend time in yer fine company'<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'We spilt blood and slew many a foe'<br>
Tarbon bows before Hrothdan.<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'Hrothdan, I offer me sword to the Clan'<br>
Agaar looks to Hrothdan.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Tarbon... I'll have yer sword.'<br>
You nod at Tarbon.<br>
Tarbon kneels before Hrothdan in humility and reverence.<br>
Squeaker cheers at Tarbon.<br>
Ottoe applauds Tarbon's performance.<br>
Horen cheers at Tarbon.<br>
Agaar cheers at Tarbon.<br>
You tell your raid, 'Welcome tae Clan McCulloch.<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'Thank ye, sir!'<br>
You snap to attention and salute Tarbon crisply.<br>
Tarbon tells the raid, 'Tis an honor to be with ye.'<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'I am glad I was here to witness this Hrothdan'<br>
Squeaker wipes the tears aside.<br>
Squeaker tells the raid, in Barbarian, 'I am proud of ye all!'<br>

Andora tells the raid, 'Our race's father was the physical embodiment of Valor, after all. *nods*'<br>
<br>
<br>
And so the allies marched home victorious, and confident that the future would look brighter... for both peoples. In time, the battle would become part of history, but the Skalds of Halas would make sure that the sacrifice of the northmen and their gnomish allies would never be forgotten.<br>
<br>
THE END<br>
