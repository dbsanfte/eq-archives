And some mixed information from the same source regarding factions, and those who wish to be &quot;good&quot; evils or &quot;evil&quot; goods...<br>

<br>
I'll say the same thing to you I said in the banking thread: You have all the tools you need to roleplay that way if you want to. If you don't think you should group with players of opposite alignment, don't group with them. <br>
<br>
It's certainly possible that special-rules servers could be added somewhere down the road. But until that point, you just have to accept that the vast majority of players don't want such restrictions forced upon them. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Moorgard on evil players pledging to good cities, and vice versa, in order to create a unique character path Info as of August 27</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> <br>
<br>
The issue is that as soon as you offer another path--no matter how difficult--that gives any kind of uniqueness or benefit, players will flock to it. And it won't just be the roleplayers who do it; it will be the folks who spend 40 hours a week playing the game and have the time to invest in such endeavors. <br>
<br>
Now, that said... there is a concept I will discuss further down the road which will present some unique challenges to those players that want to take a more difficult road. But keep in mind it's going to be quite limited in focus and definitely won't be for everyone. It's something that really doesn't make sense until the whole class tree is out there, so you'll have to wait a bit for it. <br>
<br>
Somehow I think you'll remember I mentioned it. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Moorgard on switching city factions</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> <br>
<br>
This is not EverQuest. Factions that you swear loyalty to cannot be abandoned at will so that you can in turn swear loyalty to your former enemies. In fact, &quot;faction&quot; is a very different concept in EQ2. <br>
<br>
While you can cite roleplay reasons why you might want to be the friendly troll or the kind Iksar, that's just not the direction we're going in our game. Your citizenship dictates whether you are good or evil. In some cases, your race determines where you can have citizenship. <br>
<br>
Don't think in terms of EQ where you can just do faction quests for a KOS city and earn safe passage inside. Our system has a lot more layers, and doing something like that simply won't be possible. If you're evil, Qeynos will always reject you. If you're good, Freeport will always try to destroy you. <br>
<br>
Yes, your race does determine what class paths you can take. It works that way in most fantasy games. <br>
<br>
If this delineation seems too absolute for you, consider the circumstances. The world as these people know it has all but fallen apart. Aside from the cities of Freeport and Qeynos, nobody knows for sure what's out there and how much of civilization remains. The races of Norrath are clinging to their only chance to survive. <br>
<br>
In Lucan's case, this is his opportunity to gain more strength and extend his dominion. For the Bayle family, this is their chance to nurture the goodness in the world and bolster the republic. You don't accomplish either goal by opening the gates to your enemies. <br>
<br>
Your city is your city. This design is at the very root of our game. While it does limit you in some ways, it also provides us an extremely rich context in which to tell a cool story. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Moorgard with more on &quot;unique&quot; class/race combinations</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> <br>
<br>
Additionally, we are including a select few race/class combinations that are more challenging because they blur the lines as to what roles would typically fit certain races. These won't be for everyone, because training will be more risky and more costly. <br>
<br>
Again, there's only a *few* of these. We didn't want to go too far with it because doing so would run the risk of compromising the game lore. But we think the way we're doing it adds some flavor and challenge for those who want to play (or roleplay) something a little bit different. <br>
<br>
These non-standard paths don't create a more powerful character. We understand full well that if we did that, powergamers would flock to them and you'd end up with guilds full of nothing but these combos. <br>
<br>
Instead, these paths are all about flavor and variety--just a way to make your character a little different. You'll have a somewhat more difficult path, but you won't end up with advantages over a more standard race/class combo. If anything, you're expending extra effort to be the same level of power as everyone else, just because you want a more unique character. <br>
<br>
Look at it this way. In EQ, you had no idea initially what combo worked best or that one race/class had a significant experience penalty compared to another. We're telling you up front that these paths will be more challenging from an ease-of-training and monetary standpoint, but there is neither an exp penalty nor an ultimate advantage to playing one. <br>
<br>
Variety is the only motivating factor here. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Moorgard with more on good/evil races, class selection, and Qeynos/Freeport citizenship</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> <br>
<br>
The races that can *only* be good will end up in Qeynos. <br>
<br>
The races that can *only* be evil will end up in Freeport. <br>
<br>
Neither of them has a decision to make in the matter. <br>
<br>
Neutral and the &quot;good/evil optional&quot; races will pick an archetype first. They will have a few levels where they can actually travel between cities and not be KOS in either. <br>
<br>
At a certain level (it will be within a few levels of selecting an archetype) characters will have to swear citizenship to one of the two cities in order to progress further. At that point, the neutral character has picked a side and the &quot;good/evil optional&quot; character will either be good or evil, based on what city was chosen. <br>
<br>
Your citizenship then defines your ultimate sub-class options, because certain trainers will only be in one city or the other. <br>
<br>
The classes that are clearly delineated between good and evil (Paladin and Shadowknight are easy examples) will have obvious splits; only good characters can be Paladins, so the only Paladin trainer is in Qeynos; only evil characters can be Shadowknights, so the only Shadowknight trainer is in Freeport. <br>
<br>
Other classes will not be so cut and dry. Brawlers, for instance, are comprised of both good and evil races. So Freeport and Qeynos will both have Monk and Bruiser trainers. That means a human, for example, could pick Fighter as an archetype, swear citizenship to Freeport, and eventually become trained as an evil Monk. But that same human could instead choose Qeynos citizenship eventually become a good Monk. <br>
<br>
In other words, the class trees aren't all as clear-cut as some people have been speculating. <br>
<br>

Steve &quot;Moorgard&quot; Danuser: As we have already stated, our facial customization options will allow you to create a truly unique visual appearance. We will also have a wide variety of different armor and clothing available that will provide another level of individuality. <br>
<br>
Additionally, the choices you make in game affect much more than just how you look. Our extensive class tree lets you select a profession with which you can closely identify. As a player, you will choose to support a faction within your city just like a Guild does. Which faction you support will in turn provide access to unique spells and abilities. This means all members of a particular sub-class won't be carbon copies of each other, but we will make sure that uniqueness doesn't negatively impact game balance.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Certainly the gods have an interest in the mortals of Norrath, for many of the reasons postulated in this thread. The gods are often petty beings, and even the &quot;best&quot; of them can be prideful and vain. <br>
<br>
One might wonder how the gods would react to mortals ravaging their planes and killing the embodiments of their powers. Perhaps the gods would have different ideas about what course of action to take. Maybe, as they've done in the past, some of them would set their plans in motion... <br>

<br>
It looks pretty obvious from both of these statements that the gods will be there - but there will be no choice in who your deity is going to be.  <br>
<br>
Maybe they will tie in some event in your characters life that includes a visit from a deity that is based on the actions your character has taken and choices you have made?  EQ II is definately going to be a completely different beast than EQ is.  <br>
<br>
Balanced classes from the beginning! woot!  No more Quad Kiting, no more super fast PL's for those creating characters to sell on the auction sites,  no more player dominated economy,  no more &quot;zerg&quot; raiding, and *every* class will be usefull in a group and have equal amount of responsibility.  <br>
<br>
Some other items that were of interest to me were the points he made that Croud Control will be completely different, the cost of dying has changed a little, and the item decay was removed.  Now it's part of the cost of dying - if you die your weapons decay a little bit.  Oh and the Artisan class sounds like it's actually going to be a BLAST to play <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Personally - I will be playing EQ II and I am positive that I will have 2 characters - and one of them is definately going to be an Artisan.  No more &quot;Stack - Combine - Repeat&quot;!!!<br>
