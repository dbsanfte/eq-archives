I mean stuff like the FBSS, SMR, things that drop that you will actually wear. I don't really have a problem with it there. It's not much fun to raid a dungeon after it's greened out anyway, so it wouldn't even affect me, would keep the farmers out, yay whee fine.<br>
<br>
Where it pisses me off is on the quest items. Stuff (like the infamous shackles) that has nothing to do with needing to get a group of the appropriate level to handle it; it's just a matter of slaughtering things to get the much-lower-level rare thing to spawn, and by the time you finally manage to get it to spawn, it's trivial. And then people say, &quot;Oh well, that's part of the tradeoff, you just can't do all the quests you want to,&quot; well screw that. This is (to use the oft-repeated cliche) EverQUEST, and I'd like to do QUESTS with my character on this, the roleplaying server, because it is in character for him to want to accomplish these things. The Iksar quest lines in particular don't even return all that great of rewards, but it's a matter of RP, cultural pride in wielding them. And currently the only way to do them is to get high level friends to babysit you (so they kill the higher stuff so you don't get exp from it and outlevel the thing you're camping), or constantly delevel yourself to stay in that tiny tiny window where you can kill the placeholders and still get exp from the quest mob.<br>
<br>
TLC forces micromanagement of exp in order to do quests. It REQUIRES you to go to spoiler sites and carefully plan out your character's &quot;life.&quot; Yeah. That's really in the spirit of RP. Heaven forbid you actually try to do some quests in order, in actual RP fashion, one step at a time, because the TLC will screw you. (Case in point: The 2nd Iksar Shaman quests requires you to kill a rare level 10ish mob, which is surrounded by level 17ish placeholders. If you somehow manage to survive this, the 3rd quest then tells you to go kill a level 7 mob. Solution: do the quests out of order - which makes no RP sense since your character wouldn't even be assigned the 3rd quest until he did the 2nd - &quot;hire a newbie&quot; to go hunt the level 7 mob for you, if you're stunningly lucky to find a newbie who doesn't mind wasting several hours/days hunting in an area that otherwise holds nothing of interest for him, or delevel. Whee.)<br>
<br>
TLC in dungeons, on loot drops, is cool and fine, and that's where the farming is gonna happen, if it's gonna happen at all, so that's where it's &quot;needed.&quot; TLC server-wide, in a blanket application that doesn't take into consideration the difficulty level a lot of quests were designed for, is just lame.<br>

What EVERYBODY needs to do is report these impossible/almost impossible quests to Verant via feedback or to our server GM so that they can be adjusted, whenever you encounter and verify them.  The solution would be as simple as removing the magic/lore properties from the quest items that are nigh impossible to obtain thanks to TLC.<br>
<br>
It should not be required for a race who is KOS in virtually every town but their home town to trek across half of Elanthia to find a group of characters willing to trek through a continent which is almost equally dangerous to them on a quest that is intended for low level characters.  It's unreasonable in the extreme.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of TLC in general and think we should give it a shot.  Before we throw out the entire idea of TLC, we should at least attempt to adjust those quests which are too majorly affected by TLC. <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujape2lions.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jape2Lions</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/27/01 1:37:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=740.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial</span><hr size=1> (gag) I can't belive so many people like the TLC.

This is my opinion:<br>
<br>
I don't like &quot;farmers&quot;.  And by farming, I mean the players who camp a much lower-level spawn repeatedly because the mob drops a unique item that sells to PCs for good plat, AND, the player refuses to leave when a lower-level group comes along.<br>
<br>
I can understand a player's &quot;right&quot; to equip their character with the best items to improve their survivability and advance further in the game.<br>
<br>
But I believe that they cross the line when they don't need the item itself ... they just want to sell it for more plat or for bartering.<br>
<br>
The game has very limited resources, and has absurd random drop rates for items that seem to be &quot;necessary&quot; for higher level play.  If we, the players, are to be forced to share those resources, it behooves us to share them efficiently.<br>
<br>
A level 40 shaman farming a level 20 spawn is not as efficient as a group of level 25 characters camping the level 20 spawn.  The lower level group gain both exp and items, the high level player is better off gaining more exp elsewhere.<br>
<br>
That is why I like TLC.  And I hope they iron out the inconsistencies with quest items.<br>
<br>
This is my opinion.  You are entitled to a different one.<br>

<br>
The TLC is supposedly used to enforce a stricter sense of RP'ing in this server. But in reality all it seems to reward are people with multiple accounts (then you can afford to have that lil newbie around to loot a half dead mob that's been mem blurred, even though I'm not even sure if this &quot;bug&quot; has been fixed) or those that rely heavily on spoiler sites. <br>
<br>
Reading Restorias post for example, she makes mention of how she's a seasoned player and therefore already knew what to get, where to get it and how to get it. In effect TLC doesn't make the game any more real it just adds those extra hurdles that make you feel that much more powerful after having surpassed them. <br>
<br>
As far as RP'ing is concerned, TLC is the most horrid abomination I've seen. You run around in fear of leveling, of surpassing the deadlines set forth by the TLC and exploration and adventuring are discouraged. I think this is in no small part why people complain about seeing little role-playing at times. Everyone with half a clue, knows they'd better start collecting pieces of their epic (clerics for example need to start at level 30 or so), or meeting other quest requirements that might be pre-reqs for future quests. <br>
<br>
In addition, new quests added will be wholly out of the reach of the high level players. If epic quests were to have been implemented with TLC on, none of the high level players in any server would have really been able to get their epics on their own. Instead they'd probably have to pay newbies thousands of plats for items they were theoretically supposed to gather themselves. If for some reason you mess up along the way or there's a bug in the quest, you'll be forced to dish out the plat again. It's really starting to look like fun now.<br>
<br>
In addition, like the concern I posted earlier, loot tables have been tweaked with full server populations in mind, not with a fluctuating level restricted population in mind. Quests will be ALOT harder to complete thanks to mob spawn rarity and drop rarity. In addition, different levels in mob PH's will lead to further discrimination against players trying to complete various quests. So basically, our server drops (except for the high end drops) are going to be terribly skewed and low. <br>
<br>
I hear many of you applauding the TLC because it screws over phat lewt dr00ds/d00dz. WHATEVER. You're so delluded by your hatred for those players that you can't see that TLC favors THEM and uber/power gamers over anybody else. <br>
<br>
Let me illustrate, I've seen druids solo to level 60 in startup servers with minimal and I mean MINIMAL equipment faster than any other player. And at level 60 NOTHING will go Trivial on you, and you have the BEST loot available to you. So you'll just go about and camp the best loot you can camp, which at level 60 is any mob level 45+ (maybe even less with light blue exp in mind). So basically, you're better off saying &quot;screw the mid-level game&quot; and zerg rushing to the 50's where not only is your TLC range larger, as your blue /con range increases by level, but you'll also have better loot optoins available to you. <br>
<br>
Take for example, Restorias example, regarding camping the Frenzied Ghoul for fear it might go TLC. You'd have to be level 56+ for the Frenzied Ghoul to go TLC on you (maybe even higher with light blue exp now in). Hell, I've solo'ed his spawn with a level 50 necro when some guildmates needed FBSS'. So, like I said the TLC doesn't prevent camping and it definitely doesn't screw over the phat lewtz people. <br>
<br>
Some people claim for example that the lower level people will benefit because they'll be able to sell prized items to higher level people. Two big problems with this. It's A PAIN to try and sell anything on this server. Especially in an RP fashion: High_elf01 &quot;here mr necro, here's the piece you needed to complete your necro epic&quot; Yeah.... lots of RP going on there. Plus like Ifirin(sp?) pointed out with no /shout or /ooc it's hella hard to recruit people to help you out with quests. It's guild or bust (or have tons of luck). The second problem is that big guilds will really have no need for anyone's aide, and will be quite capable of camping items regardless of TLC for their members. ie, you need 4 cleric epics, well you just set up a group, PL a char to the appropiate level, clear the spawn of PH'ers, kill the mob with the make believe char, trade to he cleric in the guild that needs it, repeat until you get the four items, and you're set. And trust me PL'ing will probably be easier (you can get level 40 in less than a day if done properly), than trying to enlist the help of players. Because let's face it most encounters of this sort will require a group, not just one character who is within TLC. So not only do you have to convince one person, but you'll have to convince of group of these players and PAY them all to do your biding. Either that or hope players will be guided by greed to the point that they'll want to do these camps on their own. Yet the vast majority of people who are in it for these types of monetary gain are the same people who TLC discourages from joining the server in the first place! <br>
<br>
I've no problem with a challenge, TLC is just not a challenge in my eyes, it's this convoluted horrible abomination of a solution that's been unleashed in an attempt to prevent farming and twinking in what's supposed to be a role-playing environment. And it's failed to do its task as far as I'm concerned. The one character rule has had a stronger effect on that.<br>
<br>
Yet people still support it despite its obvious flaws if only for the reason that d00dz don't like it. It seems all too analogous to driving nails into your skull because it will keep the people you don't like from being around you, nevermind that you'll now have nails in your skull. <br>
<br>
I mean the longer I spend on FV, the crazier devout RP'ers seem. It's like they must make RP'ing into this painfully convoluted process that only a few may engage upon, and is only available to a select few. When newbies inquire about wanting to play on a role-playing server on Verant's TNZ, I have to guide them away from the FV server because they'll be so baffled, frustrated and confused, they'll probably quit the game outright. There actually was a post from what seemed to be a nice girl who was about to give up on the game because of the tragic experiences she'd had while starting out her first character in FV, and if I remember correctly there was not a single post encouraging her to stay in FV because everyone just to accept it was not a viable solution. Is this the type of environment that fosters RP'ing, one that's so hostile and elitist that new players have to be turned away? I  mean how's this server supposed to prosper if only after we've reached higher levels in other servers we can come and play here? <br>
<br>
No wonder in the other servers people sometimes laugh and hold disdain for RP'ing, especially if that's the way it's going to be. <br>
<br>
I've RP'ed most of my EQ life, so don't get me wrong here. I mean to the point that I would walk into Nektulos forest and RP'ing newbies would gather around my character and ask me about tales they heard about me from their guild leaders. And we'd sit around and talk and I' teach them things as if I was some experienced veteran instructing the troops of tomorrow. So don't think I dislike RP'ing, to the contrary, I'm just becoming terribly concerned with how it's been kept away from the public. <br>
<br>
But role-playing is intrinsically a SOCIAL activity, it's something you do between people/players/characters, you need others to role-play, otherwise, does a character even have a story if nobody has heard it? Yet the low population numbers seem of little concern... &quot;oh good, least there's no d00dz&quot;. It's like being in a twilight zone episode, where everyone is just talking to themselves and somehow think that's a perfectly fine way of socializing. It's like holding a LARP with yourself! =P<br>
<br>
And this whole none-sense of &quot;/tells aren't RP&quot;, &quot;Call it seasons, not level&quot;, &quot;Levelling is anti-RP&quot;, &quot;Twinking is anti-RP&quot;, &quot;Grouping is anti-RP&quot;, &quot;Communicating with others in the game is anti-RP&quot;, &quot;making life impossible for ourselves so no one will be around to taunt us is RP&quot;, /boggle <br>
<br>
Maybe the solitude is getting to me in FV, but I've gone from a Love relationship to a strong Love/Hate one, maybe even insanity :P<br>
<br>

I can't say I fully agree with you.<br>
<br>
But I do agree that the way TLC stands right now is really bad: ... with the super-large exp range that high level people have ... and the badly designed quests.<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that a lot of newbies may be shunted to the FV server to face this stringent ruleset.<br>
<br>
And as for &quot;roleplaying&quot; ... I don't think Verant ever sat down and decided on a definition.  As far as I know, Verant's &quot;Vision&quot; has nothing to do with roleplaying ... FV server included.<br>

What I've been trying to say all along. It stops a few solo farmers (which to be honest, I've NEVER run into a problem with in 52 levels of play on my home server). That's it. Organized uberguilds can get around it just fine, and honest regular joe casual players get screwed.<br>

But in no way did this server daunt me.<br>
<br>
I'd like to know where these people are that are having no roleplaying...its my belief that either they're lost in Rathe Mountains or just don't like initiating it themselves.  I'm an Ogre, an Ogre, and I have had lots of RP encounters.  As an erudite I had about twenty times as such.  Simply harder for me because of the language barrier...but oh well.<br>
<br>
To me, alot of the quests seem useless anyways.  Like in Paineel, they want you to kill like a level 32 paladin and her lover, a decent level himself tho I forget what exactly, and you get rewarded with a worn halberd that is unfit for a level 10.<br>
<br>
In some cases you may need the quest.  But getting upset that you can't turn in 8 backpacks full of some loot for experience and the odd item...bah.  That makes me sick.  Getting mad because you can't farm an item, that's ludicrous.  I am greatly glad for the TLC thusfar because it does tend to piss off the d00dz to the point where they go back to their regular server.  I get enough of that talk from half-life mods...I don't need hordes of illiterate morons following me to every game.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll reconsider after I miss out on a great quest because of the TLC, but even if that happens I imagine I'll find a way around it or just count my losses and move on.  I'm not a fan of getting the l33t items anyways, as its a poor excuse for roleplaying in my book.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to know where people get so burned out.  I'm biased to think that if a person gets emotionally crippled because one person tells them they aren't living up to their RP standards that the person in question should give up the game and seek help.  I've had more people tell me IRL that I wasn't roleplaying up to their standards than on EQ, and they never really hurt me, so why should I let someone in EQ, who has no impact on my life whatsoever, get so under my skin?  Sure, get pissed for a little bit maybe, but let it go.  Make friends that DO rp like you.<br>
<br>
Hell I've got a friend now that I group with in the Warrens that beyond tells saying he'll be right back has NEVER spoken to me, and it is great roleplaying.  Cheers and waves and claps and laughs and thanks and yawns and the like are our only communication, as he's a barbarian and I'm an ogre.  Some, of course, may not see it as such, but I do and in the end it is only me that matters.  You play the game to please yourself, not other people.  If you're unhappy with the server, you go to a server you enjoy.  If you're unhappy with EQ, you give it up and go play a more fun MMORPG.  I'll never understand why so many people flame Verant but still continue to play...if they hate them that much, why stick around?  I left Ultima Online, Underlight, Meridian, Nexus, Dark Ages, Asheron's Call, and too many MUD's, MUX's, and MUSH's that I can't even count.  If I'm not having fun with it I'm not going to stick around.  I'm considering Anarchy Online and Dark Ages of Camelot right now, waiting for them to stabalize a bit before I invest money in it.<br>

I didn't mean to say that there's no role-playing in FV, on the contrary it's quite abundant and very easy to start up generally as most people are here for that reason! I guess when I started ranting, cause I did turn into a rant, I was referring to the RP police :P And the language barrier is a nice thing as it leads to creative communcation, one of my first friends was an Ogre who taught me Ogre and I taught him DE. I was the only DE in nektulos forest who took the time to try and understand him and finally figured out he wanted to learn the Dark Elvish language!<br>

Okay, just not, right at this point, I see 0, that's read ZERO, difference between you and a kewl d00d. WHO THE HELL CARES if it's a useless item!? Hello?! I'm doing something for an NPC for my own in game/ RP reasons. Be it me turning in halfling heads to the DE cleric guildmaster or to the DE warrior guildmaster. I'm doing it to gain the esteem of my fellow Teir'Dal and frankly cause it's just damn cool killing my enemies and having the game reward me even if in some minimal/trivial way. Hell, I've even completed SK quests that required you to go to the Karana's and then Erudin for a few coins and a ration. And I wasn't even playing an SK at the time! It's about playing the game, becoming engrossed in it and doing the quests and following the storyline. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the best thing you can come up with is &quot;you get a shitty halberd not fit for a level 10&quot; and you're supposed to be different to the power/uber gamers, how? <br>
<br>
And don't get me wrong, I'm not sitting there fuming inside of FV because of the way some people might want me to RP. Like you said, it's irrelevant and you can always find people who will RP like you do, and get along just great. I'm just expressing my disdain for such behaviours, not because they're driving me crazy, causing me to not enjoy the game, but because I find them ludicrous. Much the same way I might point out to someone trying to fly off a building with a pair of featery wings that they will most likely plummet to their death, but I won't be in any way altered or concerned for the rest of my existence if this person tried out his little experiment. Just calling it out as I see it ;P<br>
<br>
Finally, I'm not a fan of the &quot;if you don't like it then leave&quot; theory of things. If that had been the case sooo many things in this game would never have been improved upon. The UI, extra spells, mob pathing, improved spell messages (dmg done, amount healed, spells wearing off), buying in stacks, improvement of class balance, improvement of individual class' performance, new trade skills, revamped trade skills, Sol Ro temple quests, Epic quests, Tboots, horses, more teleport locations, faster SoW spells, a /bazaar /trader option/zone in SoL, reduced death penalties (yes, you used to lose lots more xp when the game came out). These are all things people had a problem with, and they made the effort to have them changed. Things that annoyed people, made them want to even quit EQ, yet they stuck it out and made EQ better for themselves and the rest. So please, give me a break, continue your nomadic existence, but don't ever discourage discussions that might lead to an improvement of the game.<br>

As for being bent out of shape, dont' worry about me. I got DAoC last night as a gift (along with Metal Gear Solid 2 hehe).

<br>
(For those of you that dont believe farming happens - pop into upper Guk and check the Heart spiders.  The Chitin Shell shield is not lore or magic and is unaffected by TLC - its no co-incidence that this shield is comparitively common on this server).<br>
<br>
The fact is - rules are anti RP.  Any restrictions whatsoever are against the concept of RP.  A true RP server would have no restrictions at all.  No alignment restrictions, no loot code restrictions, no PvP restrictions.<br>
<br>
The rules here do not in any way promote RP - what they do is deter people whose primary interest is power play or PvP grief (by encouraging them to play on another server) and require others to follow what might be considered 'common' RP themes (language barrier, alignment grouping etc).<br>
<br>
They have had an effect - the effect is not perfect - the language bug lost us alot of good people (as Hecate said, I think - RPing is social, with the ability to communicate seriously hampered, many RPers couldnt be social and therefore left) but on the whole I like the effect - and excercise my choice to play here rather than elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I'm a bit nonplussed by Hecate's posts which are long, clear, expressed in good grammar and order, but ultimately I dont think the main points come across well.<br>
<br>
The reason that I dont think Hecate's points came over well is this:<br>
<br>
She is right to say that things get better when you challenge them, and make VI sit up and take note.  But all the examples she went on to give were things that effected ALL EQ players.  TLC doesnt - it is ours and ours alone.  If you dont like it - you DO have the option of going elsewhere.<br>
<br>
She summarizes at the end by saying she doesnt like the 'if you dont like it - go away attitude'  then says she is going away to play DAoC.  As she says /shrug.<br>
<br>
(A final note - this discussion has raged and will rage for a long time - and the Iksar shackles thing comes up often.  There is no doubt that this quest (or series of quests) needs fixing - because the code is having a detrimental effect.  However - it is the ONLY example that gets quoted - we do not need to tear down TLC to fix a single item.  Everyone who is affected should /bug it - regularly.  And maybe petition - to get the GMs aware). <p>Lord Regent <b>Gray Hateborn</b><br>

(for those of you who do not know, the orc impaler is the 2nd weapon after the short sword of morin.)<br>
<br>
The reason this quest is going to be difficult is the Lesser Fay part where you are hunting the shadow leader. This camp is not that bad for a group of that level, it is just that the camp is near the wandering of brownie scouts, who are literally the toughest mobs for their level that I know. (Know a level 60 ranger and lvl 50 druid once who got killed by 2...were attacked by one, and then an additional one came along). The brownie mobs will make the camping of the shadow leader not just difficult, will be almost impossible. I will definitely salute any ranger who does achieve the orc impaler. <br>
<br>
Maybe someone should make a list of near-impossible quests now that the TLC is in effect. Might get Verant to look them over for our server.<br>

Some are nice to have for example the Fork in Upper guk. This TLC does make questing a bit difficult for chain quests, for example you has done the first investigator quest yet ? That being said you can with little effort work around any TLC issue you come across. For those that have multi accounts they could level a character up, but why waste a day or so when they can just get a guildie to do it with them. Or even a complete stranger.<br>
<br>
I was playing a monk of qeynos, when out of the blue some guy in plate armor, started talking to me then had me help him with a quest, it wasn't easy it actually took most of 5 hours of play time to get done, but we did have a blast roleplaying until we finished it. On a normal server the guy would have just pharmed X spawn for 4 hours then left. Atleast this way he had someone to talk to. <br>
<br>
Another time i was in Neriak and i get this tell asking for help with a warrior quest there, it ended up root,nuking the mod until it was slowly running then gating so that TLC wasn't a factor, as the person got the xp for the kill. Yes that person had to be halfway social and ask for help, and roleplay a bit to get it but that is why we are here right ?<br>
<br>
So if the iskar can't find a level 4 or what ever is needed to get that particular quest peice, and can't clear place holders and let the NB loot until he gets the spawn he needs. I really don't feel all that sorry for him or her. They got rid of no drop for a reason, and with a little thinking and socializing, you can get around this particular issue.<br>
<br>
Atleast I've been able to.<br>
There are folks out there of the correct level that can get you the item that you need, If you don't want to find them. Then you have yourself to blame. You knew that this was on this server why are you suprised by it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Al that being said TLC is one of the reasons we have such a low population it isn't for every one and as we saw was removed from the normal servers because of the dislike for it.<br>
<br>
I personally like it, it's another challenge that makes this server diffrent. Not that I haven't logged back onto my old server for revenge on a zone now and then.<br>

They aren't quests, they're mundane tasks and chores.  I personally think it's a bit jarring whenever I hear somebody mention they need something &quot;for a quest&quot; and in that respect I think quests are, if anything, a slight barrier for roleplay between characters.<br>
<br>
Do quests add to the immersiveness of the game?  Somewhat, but the fact is most people do not have the patience to spend hours completing a quest that yields nothing satisfying in the way of material rewards.  I'll do simple quests that are &quot;on my way&quot; or that only require a couple hours worth of work, but if a quest is going to take me multiple hours of dedicated effort, I'm sorry, but there are better ways I could be spending my time, like roleplaying with living breathing characters instead of static, scripted NPCs.<br>
<br>
The idea of farming is repellant to me and I applaud Verant for making some effort to make farming a bit more difficult.  I know TLC isn't perfect, largely due to the fact that range of mobs you can gain experience from at higher levels is so large, and the fact that you can use tactics to get around TLC (the mem blurring technique described).  I still think that instead of throwing out the entire idea of TLC, we should take the sensible criticism of TLC and adjust the system so it is more likely to do what it is supposed to.  Instead of making whether or not a person gains experience from a mob the detrimenant, make it so at higher levels the range is manually set, so it is somewhat smaller.  I'm not sure what can be done to prevent the memblur technique, but perhaps someone more knowledgable and creative than I could come up with something.<br>
<br>
If all else fails, I'd just implement TLC on specific mobs... those which drop heavily farmed items. <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhecateenthroned.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hecate Enthroned</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 9:14:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=740.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> On second thought...</span><hr size=1> So like I said, I started playing DAoC since I had gotten a bit tired of EQ, and it reminded me of this thread.<br>
<br>
Why? Because DAoC also has trivial loot code. If you can't get exp from the mob you don't get ANY loot from it. But the thing is, the whole game has been built with that in mind. Items degrade and there's anti-twink code enabled in the sense that using equipment too good for you will cause it to deteriorate or work at less than its maximum capacity.

This includes the standard farm gear, such as Ykeshas and FBSSes and efreeti boots and so on. The ancient croc is being farmed quite a lot lately, by those at the outer edge of the level range. Plenty of farming going on now, and more to come as more people gain levels. All the TLC has really done is change WHO is doing the farming. Instead of L60s farming FBSSes, it will be L57s. Instead of L50s farming the ancient croc, it is L40s. Anyone who can kill the ghoul lord can farm him forever, since I don't think he ever goes trivial.<br>
<br>
So, forget the 'TLC prevents farming' idea; it doesn't. It just means you do your farming a little earlier in some cases. But really, if making money is the goal, then zipping to 60 is, as always, the way to go, since the attainable loot at 60 is still vastly superior to anything you can get at lower levels and, on this server, it's most likely tradeable too.<br>
<br>
The TLC has only inconvenienced me a few times, primarily related to quests for things on low-to-medium level mobs. Having gotten what I need now, it doesn't bother me at all anymore. I realize it does in general screw over the many to 'get' the few (and doesn't even succeed in the latter), but at least I know *I* am no longer one of the many who will get shafted by the TLC but shouldn't, nor am I one of the few who SHOULD get shafted. I have escaped. /cheer<br>
<br>
As for sending in reports trying to get things fixed: um, be serious. The odds of any of this stuff being addressed in any remotely reasonable timeframe is so low that I sure wouldn't hold my breath. These problems exist on ONE SERVER. They have problems unfixed from the original EQ, from Kunark, from Velious, and now (I'm sure) from Luclin that affect ALL servers. Any FV-specific problems will be so far down the 'to do' list that you can basically forget about them ever being addressed. I have personally reported some of these issues almost two months ago, and there is no sign that any fix is even being considered. Hell, when people were leveling past 20 after EQ was released, it took *months*, until some folks were 50th, before they added research into the game, thus allowing mage pets higher than 20th level. Ever see mages in their 40s with L20 pets? It's pretty rough. And that WAS a problem that affected all servers. So, if you have a problem with how the TLC is affecting you, then your only realistic choices are to work around it if you can (and I realize many you simply cannot work around), or just forget the quest.<br>
<br>
And yes, I carefully planned out my character's leveling. Even so, I did miss a few things on the way. It seemed bizarre to me to HAVE to plan things out like that, but I did it. I mean, how un-RP can you get than knowing fairly precisely what your destiny is (and must be) for the next few weeks, in such specificity?<br>
<br>
I am deeply sorry for those of you who will ultimately be screwed by the TLC and will have no real recourse except the 'report and pray' option. But at least you can rest happy knowing that while you are being screwed hard, at least the powerlevelers and uberguys will be enduring the same hardship. Oh wait, no they won't, because they have the means to bypass the TLC, and you don't. Welp, guess there is no consolation for the many innocent who will suffer, whereas the guilty few walk away laughing en route to the next farm.<br>

<br>
I started a Erudite SK on the FV server and when I hit level 9 I headed to Qeynos after getting my spells. After killing some gnolls to become non-KOS in Qeynos I remembered one of the quests I did as a monk on another server, the &quot;find the lost girl in the qeynos aquaducts&quot; quest. Basically, you find her dress as loot from Cubert and turn it in for something lame (I don't remember what).<br>
<br>
I headed down to kill Cubert and he happened to be up and he attacked me immediately. Well as it turned out some lvl 7 magician was camping the spot. I killed Cubert but he was trivial so I couldn't complete the quest. The lvl 7 mage started calling me names and laughing about how I couldn't farm the dress and &quot;I love TLC&quot; etc. Basically, I couldn't complete a quest that I only did for RP reasons but some non-RPing moron was farming the freaking thing because he was in the &quot;right&quot; level range. Of course, he thinks I'm trying to farm the thing because that's what he's doing.<br>
