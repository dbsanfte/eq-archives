Placing her cloak on a hook by the door she walks over to the bar and sits down. Beckoning to the barkeep she orders a glass of red wine and downs it with relish upon its arrival and orders a second. When it too arrives she tells the tavern keeper, &quot;Ah it has been much too long since I last tasted some red wine. Truly the finiest of all drinks. And do you know why it has been so long?&quot; she asked looking the tavern keeper in the eye. As he shook his head no she went on.<br><br>   &quot;Because for the past month, during a trip to Felwithe for matters which do not concern you if you wish to continue to breathe, those scum pale elves discovered my presence and with their heretical arts took my prisoner that's why!&quot; she finished slamming her glass on the table shattering it.<br><br>   &quot;Ah a waste of good wine get me another will you.&quot; Kyri mourned. When it arrived she continued, &quot;Aye tripped up by some magical alarm of some sort i could not detect. In their ignorance i was first taken to the 'holy' knights of Tunare for questioning. Their pitiful attempts at what they would call torture still brings a smile to face, a child living alone on the streets of Neriak suffer greater agony when caught than what they could muster.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;In the end, they gave up after my snoring interrupted one of their sessions and passed me on to the magicians in the northern part of town.&quot; A shadow passed across Kyri's eyes at the mention of the magicians, the tavern keeper noticed a look of raw terror and unfathomable pain in the youngster's eyes and quickly looked away before she knew that he had seen it. <br><br>   &quot;There I found those who DID know the meaning of torture. Pain of the body can be ignored through force of will, but when it is your very will that is being punished, there is no place to hide from it. Time and time again I was taken from one cell to another, while their foul pets tortured my body, a hooded figure who's name I never learned pushed at my mind, trying to break my will, learn my purpose in being there.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;In the days that passed, mostly in a haze, my control must have slipped for soon they began to ask me of the League of Shadows, the true elite of Norrath mind you. Who was in charge? who were the strongest? who could be manipulated into betraying them?  I bought myself some time by giving them the names of those I knew were no longer among us or had fallen by the wayside. That bought me time until they saw my lies for what they were.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;The next part of their plan proved to be that which would lead to their failure. In an effort to desparage the might of the Tier-dal they tied my hunger thinned, filthy body in the few tattered rags which remained of my clothing to a post, placed it on a cart and drove it through the streets of Felwithe that the common scum could mock and revile me. The fools, even now do I wonder if they have realized where they erred.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;The fateful day came and living up to my expectations of pale elf scum they proceeded to throw rotten fruit,vegetables and other filth at me as I went on. Fortunately I had some connections and favors owed me and a lone voice called out above the din in the secret traders' tongue that help was on the way. Of course my captors were too ignorant to intercept the message, such a language too common and lowborn for those snobs to lower themselves to learn.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Brought back to my cell, my will was strengthened by the knowledge of a rescue, a note had even been smugggled into my cell from my contact among the Coalition of Trade Folk with more details of my rescue. My captors were shocked that my will, so close to being finally broken, proved immune to their tactics now. One of my captors grew incoherent with rage at this change, the other grew more sly. I didn't think they had it in them to be honest.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;This woman claimed knowledge that some of the mighty among the League had vanished without a trace and implied that she was responsible. Then she added that since I was obviously too young to know anything or else I would have told them by now, she calmly told me I was to be killed in the morning.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;Now I was truly desperate, no rescue in sight when that night a new pale elf, one I had not seen before came to me and whispered that this was my rescuer. He brought my gear with him and covered me in a hooded cloak and led me out of my cell under the guise of a sick woman going to the priests for a cure. The magicians were so involved in their books that we did not attract a second glance until we neared the temple when someone checked in on my cell no doubt and found it empty.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;Time was short and we were nearly taken by one knight who turned a corner at the smae time we did. However my rescuer had magical power of his own and easily used his might to overwhelm the pitiful will of the knight to the point where he actually ordered us to move along and not to interrupt his search further.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;After that we neared the gates of the city and slipped into a tavern, the tavern keeper thinking my hooded figure to be some sort of secret tryst for the high elf and gave us a room, trying to hide his smile. One which I wished to cut off his face. Giving me the key the high elf (whom by that point I firmly believed was not what he appeared to be) gave me my gear and told me to be ready.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;Once I had changed into my working clothes I felt much better, even more when he presented me with the twin daggers taken from me at my capture.  Quickly he explained his magic could get him by the guards safely but trying to use it for both of us would be too risky so I had to use my own skills to evade the guards at the gate. He wished me luck and said we would meet at freeport.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;From there it was a simple matter, the guards were too busy checking the moat rather than the path and I easily avoided their unwatchful eyes to notice me slip pass. As I left the tunnel into Greater Faydark I breathed the first fresh air I had felt in weeks. The rest of the trip was uneventful, the dwarven outposts didn't think much of me one way or the other so I did not even need to avoid them on my way to the docks where i slipped aboard while the Captain argued fare with another passenger and hide myself behind the crates at the bottom of the ship.&quot;<br><br>   &quot;The ship just got in a few hours ago and I decided to stop here for a drink or three before looking for my rescuer for a proper thank you. This drink seems to be going to my head though. Would you mind keeping an eye on my cloak for me while I do so? The wine has warmed me up and i don't think i'll be needing it for a quick run outside but i have heard thieves often steal things left unattened around here.&quot;<br><br>   With a reassuring smile, Kyri got up from her now nearly empty glass of wine and walked out of the tavern. The tavern keeper was not fooled, he knew Kyri herself appeared to be from the shadier part of Neriak but the cloak would fetch a good price if need be. In fact as he looked at it closely, it seemed almost too fine for someone who just escaped weeks of captivity. As he walked towards the hook the cloak was on a half elf rushed into the tavern and saw the cloak on the hook and shouted,<br><br> &quot;Tunare be praised, I have found my cloak that that Tier-dal wench stole from me!&quot; As the tavernkeeper looked confused and suspicious the half elf went on, &quot;Yes some Tier-dal wench wearing rags was begging at the street corner a couple blocks away about how she was cold and hungry and would do anything if someone could help her out. So I gave her my cloak since she looked like she was freezing and went off to buy some food for her. I came back and she was gone! I've looked for over an hour until someone finally told me they saw a Tier-dal woman matching that description come here and so here I am. But she's gone now it looks like.&quot;<br><br>   Well done young rogue, the tavernkeeper thought to himself with a slight smile at the swindle, this round goes to you it seems. I'll be more careful next time. Then to the half elf, putting his arm around his shoulders, &quot;Well young man, you have your cloak back, the girl is gone and I have an empty bottle of red wine that isn't paid for and since you were so happy to pay for food and drink for the girl I am certain you'll happily pay her bill.&quot;<br><br>    As he led the spluttering half elf  back towards the bar the tavern keepered nodded to himself. Next time little rogue.<br>    <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=57.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=57.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=57.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=57.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=57.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
