<br>
The world has been rocked by terrible cataclysms. Destruction has rained down from the skies. The gods of old are silent. The ancient empires of the elder races lie in ruins and their surviving populations have scattered, searching desperately for shelter and leadership. The human cities of Freeport and Qeynos-mysteriously spared the devastation inflicted upon the rest of Norrath-have become the havens for refugees from all across the Shattered Lands.<br>
<br>
Freeport<br>
<br>
The corrupt city of Freeport remains fixed in the undying grip of its eternal overlord, Lucan D'Lere. With the aid of his Lucanic Knights, D'Lere watches over the city and manipulates its ruling factions to extend Freeport's influence and domination. Evil races displaced by the Shattering now make their home within the city walls. The five strongest factions of Freeport all vie for individual power while doing their best to appease the dark will of the merciless Lucan.<br>
<br>
The Freeport Militia - Military Might<br>
<br>
The Freeport Militia is the primary defensive force of the city. It is made up of mercenaries, scoundrels, and roughnecks from around the globe. Its ranks consist mostly of recruits from local warrior guilds, taverns, and the borderlands. Most Militia members are Fighter types, but certain specialized units are comprised of other classes. The Militia has a long history of corruption and brutality. It still maintains this demeanor, but has become a more organized and efficient fighting force-one more fitting for the great trade city of Freeport. It is a highly skilled and organized army of the state, and one of the most powerful fighting forces on the face of Norrath. This organization is not bound to any deity or spiritual doctrine. Lucan himself formed the Militia ages ago.<br>
<br>
The Dismal Rage - Heralds of the Divine<br>
<br>
The Dismal Rage is a dark, sinister order that worships all evil deities. Within this single faction can be found a multitude of religious castes and beliefs, all unified by their dark goals. This order is founded on a strict doctrine that follows the Covenant of the Accursed, an ancient tome rumored to have been stolen from the Plane of Knowledge. This organization is deeply spiritual and insidiously evil. Priests and Crusaders are most often associated with the Dismal Rage, but other classes are also found within its ranks. Hate and Suffering are the driving forces of this organization, as is the will to bring faith back to a world that has seemingly been forsaken by the gods of old.<br>
<br>
The Arcane Scientists - Keepers of the Arcane<br>
<br>
This ancient order was once devoted purely to magic, but it has since become a massive repository of arcane knowledge and artifacts. Its members are an emotionless lot who seek knowledge over all else. Its roots lie in a blood-soaked past founded upon the massacre of all good members of the Academy and the introduction of the black arts. Any Freeport citizen who believes himself capable of passing the entrance exam may attempt to join the society's ranks. Upon acceptance, the new member must pledge to support the order through research and by seeking out lost arcane artifacts and knowledge within the world. No mercy will be given to anyone who stands in the way of the acquisition of mystical power, and no remorse shown for the lives that must pass in order to expand the Arcane Scientists' dominance.<br>
<br>
The Seafury Buccaneers - Traders of Intelligence<br>
<br>
A pirate organization based in the city of Freeport, the Seafury Buccaneers was founded by outlaws and scoundrels of the high seas. This unsavory lot found it profitable to assist in Freeport's defense by providing the Militia with intelligence gained through the raiding of enemy ships, for which they were allowed to keep most of what they plundered. The Buccaneers are more akin to pirates than a respectable naval force. They sink and commandeer ships, doing so under the protection of Lucan and the twisted laws of Freeport.<br>
<br>
The Coalition of Tradesfolke - Commanders of Commerce<br>
<br>
The Coalition is the unofficial governing body of all trade activity within the realm of Freeport, including any satellite communities that may sprout up within the claimed borders of the empire. The Coalition is, in fact, a highly organized crime syndicate and the most dangerous faction in Freeport: a relentless cartel that will stop at nothing to monopolize regional trade. It is a major force in the world market and is notorious for doing away with any competition, either by economic means or through sheer brutality. The Coalition employs a diverse legion of hit men and mercenaries of various classes to manipulate the global market in its favor.<br>
<br>
Qeynos<br>
<br>
Qeynos is a benevolent city that has opened its arms to those willing to work toward the betterment of society and the cleansing of evil from the Shattered Lands of Norrath. Standing as a beacon of strength and nobility, good beings from across Norrath have sought shelter under the guidance of Antonia Bayle. Assisting the valiant ruler of the Kingdom of Qeynos is the Circle of Five, a council made up of the leaders of the five major factions of the city.<br>
<br>
The Qeynos Guard - Military Guardians<br>
<br>
The military forces of the Qeynos Guard are separated into four divisions whose commanders report to a single General. The four divisions are the City Guard, the Tower Guard, the Qeynos Navy, and the Outland Brigade. The General takes orders from the Circle of Five, the city's ruling council of government. Soldiers receive their training through the Steel Warriors or the Order of Life.<br>
<br>
The Celestial Watch - Defenders of the Divine<br>
<br>
The Celestial Watch is a religious society made up of disciples of the now absent gods of benevolence and light. This order honors all good deities and is an extremely spiritual congregation. Members watch the skies for the return of their gods, preaching diligently that the deities of old are not gone forever. The Celestial Watch is a selfless organization that ministers to the physical and spiritual well-being of the good people of the Kingdom of Qeynos. It sometimes undertakes missionary crusades to distant lands to spread the word of the righteous.<br>
<br>
The Concordium - Masters of the Arcane<br>
<br>
The Concordium is a benevolent society of mages dedicated to spreading the positive influence of the arcane arts throughout Norrath. Its members love to entertain the people of Qeynos, and have been known to tour the lands giving demonstrations of their abilities. While embracing the lighter side of magic, they are extremely potent mages capable of wielding immensely destructive powers. The Concordium's mandate is to acquire all arcane knowledge lost in the Shattered Lands. Should they fail to do so, it will surely fall into the hands of evil.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
