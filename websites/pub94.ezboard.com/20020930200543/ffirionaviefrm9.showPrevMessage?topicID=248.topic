Now in my 12th season (can't wait for dual wield!)<br>
<br>
I am totally new to RP, but am enjoying it immensely, I couldn't imagine playing this game any other way. I love FV.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I seek advice, direction, general comment? I just started 2HS. Thought I should develop more skills than just 1HS.<br>
Need to upgrade my armor, but fairly poor.Where to find or go? Haven't started any type of trade, skill, or anything. Thought they must add value to myself though for the future. Fletching, smithing, or tailoring? Which would be best? Guilds? I would love to join one. I am neutral. Help?<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to help.(I promise I won't /tell anyone to death, I try to figure things out as I go, or research the sites)<br>
<br>
Looking forward to getting out of work to get back Home! (Everfrost zones)<br>

<br>
<br>
If you're the MA (main assist, a.k.a main tank, a.k.a the meat shield, a.k.a the thing that mob chew on, and so forth), you'll want to develop dual wield, 1 hand slash and 1 hand blunt.  It is easier to maintain aggro and keep it from clubbing those paper made casters to death if you're constantly beating on the critter quickly and furiously (you know as well as I do the myth about tanking cleric/shaman just ain't true).<br>
<br>
However, if you're NOT the MA, it might be better to switch to a 2 hand slash or a 2 hand blunt.  It deals out more damage but with less aggro.  When you're not the MA, you are not there to compete with the MA to see who can taunt the mobs better.  That just really annoys the cleric to no end having to switch back and forth healing the two tanks.<br>
<br>
You need to work on your archery skills.  It is just much easier to pull with bows and arrows rather than having to run to a critter and attack.  Fletching also helps to cut down expenses in producing arrows, so it is a good idea to start that as well.<br>
<br>
Right now, you should try to find a friendly smith and ask him to make banded armor for you.  The cost of an entire set of banded should range from 75 platinum to 150 platinum (maybe more, it's been a while since I had to buy a full suit) depending on the service charge of the smith.  If I remember correctly, the going rate is 1 platinum per 1 AC.<br>
<br>
Lastly, since you're a barbarian, find a barbarian shaman of your level and MAKE FRIEND with him/her.  A warrior/shaman duo would be pretty much unstoppable in the early games.  Warrior kills anything that moves while shaman buff/heal the warrior.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukarlithas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlithas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/26/02 12:02:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uanklesdirtyfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ankles Dirtyfoot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_magentaspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mudslingin' Admin<br>Crunchy Goodness<br>k thx la~!</span><br>  Posts: 559<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/26/02 12:08:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=232.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Seeking Direction For A Barbarian Warrior</span><hr size=1> I think a set of banded should cost around 40 shouldn't it?

<br>
As much as possible, max out ALL your available skills at EVERY level.  At the very least, get each of your weapon skills to 51, then 71, then 101 at various stages in your life.<br>
<br>
If you don't, you might find yourself in the following embarrassing situations:<br>
<br>
You'll be fleeing from something in a watery area and will be easily overtaken and killed because your swimming is Feeble.<br>
<br>
You will find a kick-tail weapon of a type you've never practiced.  You will be 48th level.<br>
<br>
Kenyon will have a higher hand-to-hand than you.  Kenyon is a wizard. <p>---<BR>

<br>
If you're new to the game, I'm guessing you're like me who didn't know the good spots to go to at what level and you are broke at level 12, I certainly was. I wasn't starving but I sure wasn't throwing platinum around at will and banded would have been out of my partners (who could wear it)  league at level 12 as well.  There was just no way for us to afford nice armor or to work on tradeskills, a very expensive addictive habit for me, lol.<br>
<br>
Then we found Erud's Isle and willowisps. Great fun, but you need a group, and the greater light stones sell for 7-9pp each in North Karana.  A dangerous trip but well worth it and it got me out and about and exploring instead of staying in my same old haunts. And you are at the perfect level for it, as long as you have a magic weapon. You might also want to try a group in the Warrens too. Good learning, good experience and good money. <br>
<br>
Like someone else said, find a partner if at all possible. If you met someone you got along with during a grouping experience, put their name on your friends list and be sure to contact them next time you see them on. I was lucky and met two great friends at an early level (one of which my character just married, hehe) and the three of us had a blast and learned alot and traveled quite a bit too. We are all three still together and in the same guild as well.<br>
<br>
Regarding guilds, pay attention to people you group with that are guilded, do they seem like good people? Ask them about their guild and what it stands for, that kind of thing. I truly think that just about everybody on FV that conducts themselves in a friendly helpful manner, eventually gets invited to a guild. It's a small community, people and guild officers are always paying attention if they meet someone who seems like they would fit in well with their ideals. Having said that, I noticed most of the invites started around level 15 and up though for us.<br>
<br>
For further information, if you dont mind spoilers on how to do things, you can try going to:<br>
<br>
www.eqatlas.com <br>
This site has maps of every zone in Norrath justabout and for the constantly ost like myself, it's a lifesaver.<br>
<br>
www.eqtraders.com<br>
This is where to go to learn everything about trade skills and then some.<br>
<br>
I don't have the address written down anymore but do a search for a site called Allakhazam's, it lists all kinds of information but especially level appropriate quests, it's just great for.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

<br>
   I have been working my other skills also. I think you have to work the other attack skills now. I have my 1 Hand Slash and Kick (This is neat to have. I kick for 7-9 points at 8th) maxed. Working on 1 Hand Bash, Two Hand Slash (I like the big sword and really like to see that 19 point hit with my tarnished Two Hand), Archery (Get the Hunting Bow and arrows off the Gnolls in Blackburrow they are by the stand to the left of the train station at the bottom of the ramp), Hand to Hand, and Bash. I decided to take just a couple of tradeskills Blacksmithing and Baking. I like being able to use all that meat you end up with. hehe. As far as armor, if you are not completely in some sort of leather (patchwork, tattered or store bought) you might want to see Ms. Cindi at the kilt shop. Give her a tell. If you are killing Orc Troopers on the plains you can turn in the wrist bands to the Warrior in the pit or Cindl for some other armor. Cindl is giving out Raw Leather armor pieces. You might want to talk to the two people out by the fire at the Glade after you get your faction up they will make some dandy armor. The guy wandering the plains of Everfrost if you talk to him will make a nice polar bear cloak for 1 pp and a polar bear fur. All this is pretty cheap to do as you can get this by killing creatures you are already hunting. If you need any help give me a tell when I am on. I am back in the Qeynos area again. Trying to get the Lion Delight. <br>

<br>
I have had some very good experiences with an all Barbarian guild called Wolves of Antonica. <br>
The ones that I have hunted with was not too far from your level. (16-20), and I have met younger members as well. <br>
So it might be a choice to look into if you are actively seeking a guild<br>
<br>
(I am not 100% sure that it is a Barbarian Only guild, but the only members I have seen was Barbarians...Ohh and welcome to FV, I hope you will continue to enjoy it as most people seem to :)<br>

<br>
 I would suggest that you get a Shaman and another warrior or two and do the Langseax quest. This will result in 1hs magic weapons at the least. Sometimes it results in 2HS weapons.  Now, take a party of 3 or 4 if you are under 15. The entire quest runs in Halas-Everfrost -West Kanas. It is a ton of fun and yields weapons that you can use for several weapons. <br>
<br>
1hs weapons will help max your offensive skills faster. I always use 1hs for the first yellow or two in a level. The I switch and max out 2hs. Then piercing, blunt etc.<br>
<br>
AC is your friend. Buy banded for 90pp a set or 1pp per AC for an individual piece. When you get to level 22ish go to RunnyEye and get Blacked Alloy armor. It has the same AC as bronze and has a few bonuses as well. Also, it is a free drop off of the critters there when you kill them.<br>
 <br>
RunnyEye is also home to the weapons of choice for you 25-35 levels. Blacken Alloy Bastard Sword (BABS) and Blackened Alloy Longsword (BALS). The BABS is the best 2hs you will see for a long time. The BALS is a great 1hs.<br>
<br>
When you get to your mid to upper 20s start doing your crafted armor quests. This is nice armor with strength, agility, dex, magic res buffs all around. It has the bonus of being a quest too so you get exp.<br>
<br>
Join a guild, soon. Look around (shameless plug for Tribulation www,tribulationguild.com) there are many fine guilds out there. They will help you get groups, do quests, etc.<br>
<br>
Good luck fellow Barbarian<br>
