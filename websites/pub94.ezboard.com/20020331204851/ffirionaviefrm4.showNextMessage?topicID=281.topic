It has largely fallen to the category of a status symbol, and &quot;for looks&quot;.  A good example of this is Totemic armor.  It is nice in the sense that a Barb/Troll/Ogre Shaman can get a plate graphic, but the complete armor set itself is 3ac more than banded per piece.  This is comparable to Northman chain (2 ac more than banded but alot more wisdom), Rygorr, and a host of other relatively easy to obtain armor pieces.  The two hardest to obtain pieces of totemic are the helm (AC 10 wis +5), and the totemic Breastplate AC 19 (sv dis pois mag +5).  Ok resists but situational.  To get a totemic helm you have to camp a rare spawn creature on a 8 hr spawn timer.  At least he spawns in a set spot and eventually with patience you will get what you need.  The BP on the other hand reqires a piece of bark from grizzleknot.  A very very rare spawning treant in South Karana.  He spawns on the order of once every two weeks or so and wanders.  On blue servers he is usually taken down immediately by tracking classes (wtg verant) and the bark or quested bp is sold for up to 1k plat.  Well that was before rygorr, new velious armors, and whatever luclin adds to the pot....<br>
<br>
Anyways last night I had an opportunity to buy this quest piece for 1k or so.  I started to round up resources.  My partner and I had half of it, we could have borrowed the rest from a friend.  Then I got to thinking that it wasn't really worth that much anymore.  Just an expensive status symbol that would only be a decent BP for about 10 more levels.   <br>
<br>
Anyways my rant is at Verant for making this piece so difficult to get that most won't be able to get it until a) the armor is no longer useful) and b) you will have long since looted a better one in the course of your travels.<br>
<br>
Ahh well, my monk friend and I will be questing in South Karana for some time for her gear, maybe we will get lucky and run into Grizzleknot ourselves..<br>

I have also spent some time this week reading through the armor quests on luclin.....BLEH!  The stuff isnt worth the time to quest it.  There are so many things that you need for each piece and they have poor stats....whats the point.  Why even put the material into the game???<br>
<br>
Oh well.  I have been wearing my darkforge armor for 20+ levels and will do so until loot something better.  I feel bad for the Shamen on the BP because the grizzlenot part is BS.  It should be something that is more geared around Shamen skills instead of a druids or rangers.  Makes more sense to me to have the shaman part on the named orc in everfrost than on the wandering mob in SK.<br>

<br>
There are plenty of &quot;uber&quot; quest items out there for the higher levels, and the quests are actually quite entertaining.  I mean here are just a couple of examples of only a few quest items (most of which are in the reward&gt;risk category):<br>

Some of the velious ones are pretty good, and luclin too.  My rant was about how the original class armors, the stuff thats supposed to last until you get to the planes, is primarily only good to level 40 or so these days, and then only a few pieces can last that long.  <br>
<br>
My other rant &lt;sub rant&gt; is the price people put on rare quest drops.  Its ok to look at a blue server like torvonnilous and say a Grizzleknot Bark is worth 1kpp.  On FV it is very hard to accumulate any sum of cash, the market is mostly offline. My last two play sessions consisted in runing all over Norrath to sell 3 earrings at 30pp per. We are not as affluent as a &quot;production server&quot;.  For the most part if you want something you need to camp or have something that someone luckier than you wants.<br>
<br>
I suppose I just wish the original quest armors were more in line with the way they have mudflated the game.  A full suit of totemic would be a pyrric (sp?) victory at level 40, and actually useful at 20, well before you could get all the quest pieces alone or with your group, and when it would actually be decent gear for your level.<br>
<br>
Through luck, friends and actually buying a quest piece or two from merchants I have a decent start on totemic quest pieces, but its still 160pp per to buy the gem per piece, and without a real market its hard to generate the cash to do these when they would be useful.<br>

A warrior going for his Crafted armor will probably be able to get most of the pieces before he is in range to hunt Ry’Gorr orcs.  As a cleric, I can get most of the pieces for my “Gold” armor well before I can resonably go after anything better (in fact, the toughest part on FV is finding a 34+ enchanter to zap the platinum bars).<br>
<br>
Most of the Ro stuff is do-able in the mid to late 20's, whereas the Twilight stuff (based on what I've seen) is more for the upper 30's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrimwyrd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimwyrd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/24/02 4:15:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=274.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: &lt;sigh&gt; Risk &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reward</span><hr size=1> On one hand, I agree with you totally. But you have to remember the history. Back when these class quests were put in, the maximum level was 50 and people were heading to the planes at 46 on a regular basis (because they had nowhere else to go at that level). The class armor WAS great back then, and WOULD last you til you got planar armor.<br>
<br>
The part I agree about is that the risk/reward on many of the pieces is simply no longer worth it. With the addition of Kunark/Velious, many single pieces (or complete sets, like Ry'Gorr) became available that are easier/better than the class armors.<br>
<br>
Verant definitely needs to either update the stats on the old quest armors, or at least make some of the tougher ones a bit more do-able. <p>Grimwyrd Storm<BR>

Y'all are right about the trend towards outdating the older gear, though.  Every release has made the older gear less desireable to obtain.
