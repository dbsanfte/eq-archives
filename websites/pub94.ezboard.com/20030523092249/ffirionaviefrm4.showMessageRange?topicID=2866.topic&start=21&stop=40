Why in the WORLD would I be jealous?  I love this argument.  What, I'm jeaslous because I have the discipline to roleplay when confronted with the ability to use an exploit instead?  Hardy, ha ha.  I have 3 accounts.  My alts get NO gear from my main on blue servers.  NONE.  Could I give them great gear?  Sure.  Am I jeaous when I see someone in uber gear at 3?  No, I am disgusted.<br>
<br>
To role play well, it'd be nice if the surroundings for my character weren't filled with the corruptions of greed and the need for power of RL people.  I find it exillerating to interact with people really playing their characeters.  Earning their gear through quests, work, gathering components for high level characters, etc.<br>
<br>
A level 5 pally equipt with PoP gear is an afront, a tear in the role playing environment that says &quot;screw you verant, I'll get around your rules anyway I can, so I can look big and bad and with the &quot;my characters better than you contest&quot;.  No roleplaying there, just  a need to feel superior.<br>
<br>
Jealous?  I was jealous of FV players, because I thought they had such a better environment than the blue servers.... So I came over.  I might be jealous of someone that has something I don't in RL sure.  But jealous of someone doing something I could?  Get real.<br>
<br>
Again, FV is a role playing server.  Verant specifically tries to stop this activity.  Some choose to work around it, then somehow think everyone else is sooooo jealous.  Its a joke.  I suppose if I'm playing monopoly with friends and someone finds a way to steal money out of the bank I'd be jealous of that too right?  No, I'd just be disgusted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gherethfv>GherethFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#009900>Draconic Mod</font><br>

<br>
At it's heart, it could be said that roleplaying is acting in a manner consistent with the character a player is trying to portray.<br>
<br>
Perhaps in the fantasy world you live in, no young knights are ever presented with the armor and weapons of their father who died in war (like Pan in Record of Lodoss Wars)... no aspiring mages are gifted with their mentor's robes and belongings when he passes away of old age (like that dork in the movie Dragonslayer)... no young heroes are showered with the handmedowns of their uncle who's retired from his adventuring career (like that crazy Frodo guy in Lord of the rings).<br>
<br>
Inheritance... it happens in Fantasy... deal with it.  It doesn't happen to everyone.  It might not even happen to most people.  But it does happen, and is in no way inconsistent with fantasy or roleplay...  <br>
<br>
...especially in the case of characters like Sarhea... who reroll... and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>it's the same character, just a different profession</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Are you gonna get on her case too?<br>

<br>
I, the player, create the character.  After time, my characters may or may not develop &quot;on their own&quot; (as it were) once they interact with other characters but I develop the initial background, initial personality, etc.  The reasons for which I develop said history and background can be many and varied ... ultimately, for me at least, because a certain concept catches my interest.  I have many concepts, all equally attractive to me, that I can choose from for any given game, session, adventure, or group.<br>
<br>
Now, when I, the player, become involved in a new game, session, adventure, or group, I take stock of all the concepts I have whirling about.  I then take stock of the actual game, group, etc. and choose whatever concept that mechanically suits the given game, group, etc. For example, if a pen and paper group I'm about to join is lacking a cleric, I'll choose from one of the clerical concepts I have.  Certainly, I don't ~have~ to do that, but since all my &quot;outstanding&quot; concepts are, to me, equally appealing, my deciding factor will be a player-driven one.<br>
<br>
As far as EQ and the &quot;handing down of gear&quot; is concerned, it all depends completely on the situation at hand.  I have created characters without a penny to their name.  I have created characters that were well taken care of prior to their leaving home for adventure.  My current character lived in a gilded cage (still does, to a certain extent ... and no, I'm not spilling the entire story right here and now ... find out in game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) ere she began her adventuring days, but did possess of one or two inherited items from her mother, who was a cleric (I re-rolled from a cleric into a necro)  as well as some cash (around 50pp).  Now, these items were not ones that she could necessarily ~use~ , so she spent quite a bit of time peddling them in the Bazaar, as well as hunting for good bargains in the Bazaar, using the cash she inherited.  Then she &quot;got addicted&quot; to the Bazaar, started spending time studying economics and The Market, saw needs for certain items that she could acquire, and then acquired them for re-sale, either by hunting or &quot;vendor diving&quot;, using the little bit of cash she'd been &quot;bequeathed&quot; as capitol.<br>
<br>
Nidge has some very nice things for her level.  However, she is also very much a self-made gnome.  Sixty percent of my time paying her was spent in trader mode in the Bazaar, as well as going vendor diving.  Did I twink her out a bit at the outset?  Sure, insomuch as she started out with 50pp and 2 nice cleric pieces.  Did she earn everything she owns?  Absolutely.  Did I choose to play that particular &quot;gilded cage becomes self-made gnome&quot; concept on purpose to accomodate the fact that I had 50pp and two nice items to transfer over?  Sure did!  And yes, the character who served as my transfer point was someone that both characters had known.<br>
<br>
Could I have chosen another concept?  Certainly!  However, as I view all my outstanding concepts as equally valid, I chose the one that would accomodate the personal game-mechanic situation at hand.  If there are more compelling reasons to choose a salt-of-the-earth-starting-out-with-nothing concept, would I choose that one, destroying the previous character's goods?  Yep.  And I have done so.  Again, I'll repeat, I have many many character concepts ... and they are all equally valid and compelling.<br>
<br>
As far as separation of character and player, yes, you would not necessarily wish to meta-game ... however, my characters do not 'live&quot; in a &quot;breathing fantasy world&quot; without ~me~.  <br>
<br>
So anywho ... sorry for the long-windedness ... But that's my view ... I'm sure other views will differ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yalpeelor, I think you are being disingenuous when you are saying you are not telling people how to play.

<br>
Ok, I see that.  I suppose I would like people to miraculously see the point I'm trying to make and switch.  Often in AD&amp;D in the olden days (back in college) I'd try and convince people that if their CHARACTER had never seen a troll, they'd probably not know to use fire to kill them right off.  It used tio irk me that people wouldn't role play these encounters, they'd just use all the knowledge of the AD&amp;D monsters they had from reading the books.  So, I acknoledge you're right.  I guess I'd like to have an effect on peoples play styles, but only if I somehow got my point across and swayed them, certainly not if they still disagree.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>With respect to roleplay, I do agree that passing off gear to a reroll is not roleplay-driven. Let's be honest. If you have put in hundreds of hours into a character and want to start another character, it would be hard to throw all of those items/pp away that your old character acquired. Just because people will build in a storyline to support how they acquired all the items does not mean that the sense of roleplay was the driving factor. They want to keep the phat lewtz! That said, I don't see anything wrong from a roleplay perspective in terms of passing on gear. Some of the finest roleplayers on the server have rerolled and use gear from the prior character. In creating Trakon, I passed on a lot of Siman's items to my old guild but kept a little bit on him in case I wanted to play again.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Absolutely!  I can see the point.  People should make their own call. I was again, responding to someone that there was NOTHING wrong with it.  In some peoples eyes, mine included, this act degrades the overall environment, and therefore to a small degree, reduces my enjoyment too.  But, to each his own.

Only if they had level limits on *every* item would your idea that they actually had an official opinion on twinking seem to be valid.<br>

Perhaps...<br>

Correct me if I am wrong here, but the only way to reroll and keep gear is via a 2nd account or a friend's account right?  It seems to me, if this was intended, it wouldn't require such a thing.

<br>
There's nothing preventing a person from going to an out of the way place, dropping all their gear, camping out, logging the new character in, and retrieving the items.  This is how I transfer gear w/ almost any newbie-ish character that I reroll.  It's less hassle than bothering friends to help, and if I do lose equipment I haven't really lost that much.  <br>
<br>
Money can't be transferred that way anymore, since they made it undroppable (which was done to prevent a trade window scam, not to prevent it from being given to a rerolled or alternate character).<br>
<br>
There's nothing at all exploitative about asking someone to hold your equipment, deleting, making a new character, and then picking it up.  You may not like the practice, but that alone doesn't put it in violation of any rules.<br>

Powerlevelling is not twinking.  You can argue one is better, worse, or equally as good/bad as the other; but they are not the same.  The virtues and ills of powerlevelling probably ought to have a thread of their own.  And indeed, probably do...<br>

Twinking, at least as you seem to be objecting to it, is passing items from one character, to the next incarnation on the same account, correct?  How in the world is TLC even relevant?  The items already exist.  <br>
Again, farming != twinking.  Two different animals.  <br>

<br>
On EQ2, I am in agreement.  However, many of these same features are also aimed at stabilizing the economy a bit.  Could very well be a chicken/egg argument.  The fact that in EQ, your armor never degrades, or you sword, or your bow, etc, means that the longer the game is played, the more armor,swords, and bows, are in the game.  Eventually, the low end items become worthless because there are so many.  After that, the mid-level items become worthless, etc. etc.  (The main one I have heard of in regards to this would be that if you are not of the recommended level for an item, it degrades much faster.  Are there any others?)<br>

You are correct that one must give one's gear to another to be able to keep it when you reroll.  Assuming that Sony &quot;intended&quot; that you lose all of your things because of the reroll is foolish though.  It could be, and likely is, only the fact that sony didn't want to take the time to add the extra code in to allow you to keep your gear as you reroll.  It is far easier to just limit you to one character than it is to create a new method of recreating characters.<br>

This rule is laughable.  A first season wizard can get KEI if he wants it.  True, he can't have Clarity II because it is a single target spell, but who wants that?  Same goes for many of the major buffs of the game.  And it is not 20 levels lower than the caster which matters.  It is 20 levels below the spell level, and at times I even doubt that.  I can cast my 49 haste on a first season character, but boon of the Garou won't take. *shrugs*<br>
<br>
If this rule was to be effective, they would have to put more effort into it.<br>

TLC, I think, combined with the lack of No Drop, would have the reversed effect than what you stated if we had more than one character.  But since we have only one per account, only those who have multiple accounts or those who are helping friends benefit from these rules.  There is just more that goes around to twink with if you want to.<br>

If they really wanted to stop twinking, keeping of old equipment and such, they would simply need to put required levels on everything like Diablo has.  As they did not do this, it would imply that they are not against it completely.  <br>
<br>
I believe that Sony tries to balance the game as much as they can.  They add what they feel we need at the time.  <br>

Perhaps you don't like the fact that someone can decide to change professions and keep all of their posessions.  Perhaps you are jealous of a first season warrior who inherited a fortune.  Perhaps you wish your character was the one to discover that treasure chest hidden in that field under the remains of an old burned out house.  But let's just face it.  People can have a life before they decide to adventure.  They can be lucky.  They can decide to go from a very successful ranger to a warrior.  And they can do so while keeping more than a rusty dagger, some water, some fish rolls, and a note for a guild leader. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/Oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Koada'dal Illusionist of the 53rd Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yalpeelor@firionavie>Yalpeelor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/31/03 2:52:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2866.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Not exactly...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just think that the name roleplay, backwards, is a really craptastic name<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Great.  So now because I express an opinion you attack my name.  A first name in EQ is somewhat arbitrary.  I like to play for 20-30 levels to get a feel of who the character is, and how the environment and friends affect my character.  Then I can usually come up with a great last name that is truely RP centric.<br>
<br>
I don't see alot wrong with coming up with a name by playing alphabet games with existing words.  I'm not role playing because my first name happens to be close to a real word backwards?  I tried reversing roleplay and didn't like the sound, so I added an e and I loved it.  My favorite wizard was named Sucaba, a name I grew to love.  I chose it by spelling abacus backwards, and I loved the sound for a wizard name.  That means I'm not role playing? Perhaps you'd like the name better if I had &quot;inherritted&quot; it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Again, to those that say I am &quot;jealous&quot; of twinks...  I repost for those unable to read the whole thread due to ADD disorder...<br>
<br>
People that complain about twinks do so because they don't like the way twinking affects the server and the role playing environment.  We have absolutely nothing to be jealous of.  We can do what yoiu do, we CHOOSE not to to preserve what we consider better player/character separation.  Why can't this be understood?  The jealous argument is just oh so very unfounded in any rational thinking.<br>
<br>
reposted from above, as it was obviously not read:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
There it is, the jealousy card. Why in the WORLD would I be jealous? I love this argument. What, I'm jeaslous because I have the discipline to roleplay when confronted with the ability to use an exploit instead? Hardy, ha ha. I have 3 accounts. My alts get NO gear from my main on blue servers. NONE. Could I give them great gear? Sure. Am I jeaous when I see someone in uber gear at 3? No, I am disgusted.<br>
<br>
To role play well, it'd be nice if the surroundings for my character weren't filled with the corruptions of greed and the need for power of RL people. I find it exillerating to interact with people really playing their characeters. Earning their gear through quests, work, gathering components for high level characters, etc.<br>
<br>
A level 5 pally equipt with PoP gear is an afront, a tear in the role playing environment that says &quot;screw you verant, I'll get around your rules anyway I can, so I can look big and bad and with the &quot;my characters better than you contest&quot;. No roleplaying there, just a need to feel superior.<br>
<br>
Jealous? I was jealous of FV players, because I thought they had such a better environment than the blue servers.... So I came over. I might be jealous of someone that has something I don't in RL sure. But jealous of someone doing something I could? Get real.<br>
<br>
Again, FV is a role playing server. Verant specifically tries to stop this activity. Some choose to work around it, then somehow think everyone else is sooooo jealous. Its a joke. I suppose if I'm playing monopoly with friends and someone finds a way to steal money out of the bank I'd be jealous of that too right? No, I'd just be disgusted. <br>
