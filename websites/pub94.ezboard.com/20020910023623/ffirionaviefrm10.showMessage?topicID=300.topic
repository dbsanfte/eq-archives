She wipes her wet bangs away from her eyes and glares at her pet standing silently behind her.<br>
<br>
“I hate you,” she mutters to the undead being.<br>
<br>
She sighs and shivers in the cold and wet, the wind cutting through her wrappings mercilessly. She wraps the fur cloak around her tighter and peers through the early morning half light and wind at the white landscape. Her tier’dal vision picking up much more information that what the eyes of a lesser race would see. She stands in the mountains of the accursed continent of Velious. Harsh ridges of bare rock jut up where the wind blows the snow free and into the valleys. Hardy ice-covered trees have surprising managed to survive this awful environment and are scattered around her and her pet’s forms. Behind her, in the distance, she can barely see the dual waterfalls that mark Thurgadin, and warmth.<br>
<br>
She scans the snow, looking for any sign of the creature she was pursuing, but finds none. The tracks have been obliterated by the wind. Vivienne grumbles to herself and fights her way to the ridge top just ahead. Once there, she lowers herself and peeks over, looking into the valley beyond.<br>
<br>
Below her, she can make out a small group of humanoid beasts around the opening to a large cave. Tizmaks, so named by the strange dwarves of Thurgadin, odd humanoid yaks. Vivienne ponders for a moment if they might be relatives of the minotaurs in the Gorge, then dismisses the thought as useless wondering.<br>
<br>
Vivienne sighs, disappointed. All of the yak-men gathered there appear to be of around the same height. They stand about as tall as a human male, but much broader and more powerfully built. Yet the one she hunts is much larger, with a broken horn and wielding large morningstar.<br>
<br>
She thinks back a couple weeks, when she first saw that monster, not far from here actually, she realizes. She was with Lady Dawninglight and coveted the morningstar it wielded as a gift for one of her young priestess who just entered her twentieth season. Realizing it would be too much for just her and Dawninglight to handle, she requested the aid of Lady Silenae, of whom she spotted awake and active earlier that day. The attack failed, badly. The monster tossed them aside like they were rag dolls and stormed off through the snow, leaving them for dead. The only lasting wound it suffered was the broken horn, caused by one of the undead pets.<br>
<br>
Restless and unable to sleep, Vivienne woke in the very early hours of the morning. She disengaged herself from Lady Dawninglight’s and Lady Synnaelle’s arms, and crawled out from under the warm furs and blankets into the chill of her inn room. She quietly donned her robes and furs and snuck out of the inn into the quiet Thurgadin streets, determined to prowl to ease off this nervous tension she’s been feeling lately. She passed by the silent dwarven guards and out into the icy blast of the Velious winds.<br>
<br>
Vivienne didn’t get far before she spotted it, the monster, moving through the river valley and heading up into the sharp ridges to Thurgadin’s east. With the magicks of her darkest art, she summoned the spirit of a long dead warrior to her side. Then, gripping the shaft of her Harvester tighter, gave pursuit, determined to track the creature to its lair.<br>
<br>
Well, that was the plan, she laughs ruefully, “I didn’t plan on losing it so easily and freezing to death...”<br>
<br>
She looks with dismay at the guarded cave below her. She could sneak in, cloaking herself in the shrouds of the netherworld. But, if the creature is indeed inside there, it would be impossible to kill and get out alive, and she is not about to take that kind of risk with her beautiful neck.<br>
<br>
“I need a strong warrior, I think, Varn,” she whispers to her pet, “one that would happily die for me...”<br>
<br>
Suddenly grinning menacingly at the unsuspecting yaks below her, she realizes her fiance is not too far away, having just arrived on Velious and is currently freezing himself in Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
“Yes, my dear, Varn, the slaughter he could create would be glorious,” she giggles.<br>
<br>
Vivienne snuggles deeper into her fur cloak when a powerful gust of wind threatens to blow her off the ridge, blowing snow and ice crystals in her face. Her pet suddenly stiffens, sensing something living very nearby.<br>
<br>
The snow behind her explodes outwards, and Vivienne curses as she wheels to face the threat. She dives to the side as a large velium morningstar smashes the rock where she was an instant before. Varn leaps into the fray at the moment its mistress was attacked, cackling insanely and smashing the enormous tizmak with its boney fists.<br>
<br>
She rolls and comes clumsily up to her feet, the snow and ice impeding her lithe movements. She ducks a second powerful swing of the morningstar and completes the ritual of her first spell, pulling tendrils of energy from the netherworlds to surround and invigorate Varn with unholy energy. Varn’s eyes pulse with greenish light and his blows against the creature’s tough hide come faster and harder, invoking yowls of pain from the monstrous beast. Vivienne is rewarded for her efforts by a backhanded punch from the creature’s huge paw, sending her spinning from the top of the ridge into the snow ten feet below.<br>
<br>
Stunned, she stumbles trying to pick herself up. Her ears ring as she looks up the monster fighting the pet above her. Her words come out in gasps as she pulls forth more unholy energies about her. As the spell takes form, she is surrounded by motes of white light, encompassing her body. She extends her finger, pointing at the monster.<br>
<br>
“Give me your life,” she snarls, and the collected energies arc from  her body to that of the gigantic tizmak’s. The motes of light constrict around the beast’s throat, strangling it, drawing out its force of life. Vivienne shudders as her body absorbs the tizmak’s essence, carried through the link.<br>
<br>
The tizmak howls in rage at the vampiric spell. Ignoring Varn, it leaps from the ridge, straight at Vivienne. She dodges the third swing of the morningstar, but the tizmak catches her calf in its fist as she tries to leap away.<br>
<br>
Varn leaps onto the creature’s back, bashing downwards with a double fist, crashing into the creature’s skull. With a swing of it’s powerful arm, the tizmak throws Vivienne into a tree and, in the same motion, tosses Varn from its back. As Varn leaps to its feet, a swing of the morningstar smashes away its entire left arm and a sizeable portion of its ribcage.<br>
<br>
A second glow pulses around the tizmak and causes it to yowl in pain and rage as its own blood begins to heat up, causing vessels to burst and a searing lasting pain to rip through the creature’s body. Lady Vivienne leans feebly against the tree, blood running down her chin. She knows the creature’s powerful attacks have made things go very wrong inside her body.<br>
<br>
Another powerful swing of the morningstar causes Varn to explode in a shower of shattered bone. The tizmak then turns to face the battered necromancer and slowly advances upon her. The mystical words of a fourth spell slide through her bloodied lips. As the tizmak moves upon her, a dark mist of death seeps through up though the snow, wrapping around the beast’s legs and lower torso, eating away at the creature’s flesh and gripping it in a steely embrace.<br>
<br>
Confused and enraged, the tizmak swats at the mist, trying to pull itself free. Vivienne, seeing the creature caught, turns and stumbles away, her eyes set on the waterfalls in the distance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Half blind in pain from her damaged and frozen body, Vivienne fumbles her way back to Thurgadin. Coming up over the final ridge she sees the river below her. A beastial howl of rage behind her promises her of death. She looks back through the red haze to see the monster coming for her. Her only hope is to reach the guarded entrance of Thurgadin.<br>
<br>
Falling and stumbling down the slope she collapses in the ice-lined waters of the river. She won’t make it, the gates are too far and she can almost feel the tizmak’s hot breath on the back of her neck. Better to just die in the soft slumber of the freezing cold than feel the smashing brutality of that morningstar.<br>
<br>
Two figures materialize before her failing eyes. One with dark skin covered in white, the other with pale skin and covered in black. With far-away whispers, sudden heat passes over her, before her body gives in and blackness envelopes her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Vivienne opens her eyes to look at the soft and beautiful face of Lady Cinny, her high priestess. She licks her chapped lips and offers a half-smile to the concerned motherly expression. A dull throb of pain pulses through her body.<br>
<br>
“I hate this place....” she murmurs before blackness envelopes her again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Soft voices force Vivienne from her slumber. She opens her eyes to see Lady Synnaelle and Lady Dawninglight, her tier’dal and koada’dal companions, chatting quietly on the fur rug of the inn room. Her eyes travel from her two lovers to the foot of her bed. Resting on the blankets is a large rune-inscribed velium morningstar.<br>
<br>
Vivienne laughs, despite the pain it causes.<br>
<br>
“Lady Aumynarra had better appreciate her gift,” she murmurs to the delighted pairs of eyes now looking at her.<br>
<br>
 <p>What is the point of living if life is not spent dancing on the edge of the razor-blade?<BR>
