There are several things it could be.<br>
<br>
Many months ago I believe it was right after Xarpolis achieved his epic quest I was hunting on the ledge in Velk's. I was lucky enough to get the ledge before Ramel and was having a fun time grinding out the old AA points when I noticed that some lizard shaman decided it was cool to plop down in the middle of the top floor from where I had been pulling from for the previous hour or so. I told the shaman that that area was camped and my response from him was F You! Well that answer really didn't go over with me very well so when I noticed that the guild leader of AS was in the zone I let him know about what his minion had to say to me and I received another F You from Xarpolis himself. This is a great way to begin a relationship with somebody you had never talked to before. At that point I pretty much wrote off any dealings with AS considering they had an extreme lack of vocabulary or manners. So why did Xarpolis have so much hatred for me before he even talked to me? <br>
<br>
AS came to this server to be the number one guild. Nobody was going to stop them and Xarpolis was the driving force behind this. After it became obvious that they were not going to be number one Xarpolis decided to make a deal with one of the two devils in his way.  He chose FnF and herded his old guild towards them. He proclaimed that they were going to teach those guys in Resolution a lesson! Well a month later Resolution was still taking down the larger mobs and shortly after Resolution took down AOW Xarpolis ebayed. Why did he ebay? Because he felt he couldn't be number one and damn those Resolution members from getting in his way. Xarpolis is overly competitive and was probably spoiled rotten by his parents. He is probably not used to losing not because he wins often, but because he will give up and live in a state of denial making up excuses for why he didn't win. He is now back after selling his toon trying to extract more revenge on the evil Resolution who thwarted him from his rightful place as the number one guild on the server.<br>
<br>
<br>
Got any more BS for us Xarpolis? You personally failed so suck it up soldier and go back to your barracks room and cry.<br>

  You have no idea what your talking about Rollen.  1st he does not live in the barracks and ever think that maybe just maybe he quit eq for a reason like his KIDS? No cause obviously you dont know what kids are because maybe you are one yourself.  Get your facts straight. I personally see why Xarp and lots of other people dont like you because you think your high and all so mighty.   Get over yourself already.<br>

Ok, I'm going out on a limb and assuming that this translates into Mods, Where are you now?<br>
<br>
And answer it this way..<br>
<br>
Xarp didn't get modded for accusing Syll....of less than ethical sexual favors for mod decisions...and that's a bold faced lie, I don't think Syll knows Coin and Rollen in RL.<br>
<br>
Now.<br>

Ok, two things.  I hope he's different around his kids than he is here on the boards. It would make me sick to think he's as verbally abusive to them as he is here.<br>
<br>
Secondly, since you want to play the personal attack card, lay off Rollen. Even little kids know what kids are.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Rollen!  Such vile personal attacks can not be ignored.  In all my life I've never seen such a horrendous and vicious assault on the personal character of one of our most upstanding board members!!<br>
<br>
Insults like these cut to the core, and you might very well drive away one of our most beloved posters.<br>
<br>
If you do not apologize forthright I shall be forced to issue you 1/4th of a warning for personal attacks.<br>

<br>
Question- Why in the fuck make board rules when you only follow them when its convenient to you? Make your sorry little jokes, I personally dont think its abit funny, and Im sure alot of others dont think its funny either.  Syll I now have 0 respect for you.  I also knew you wouldnt do anything about the personal attack.  Maybe what Xarp said about you was correct after all.<br>
