His clothes are old and worn but well cared for. They also tell the tale of a fall from the Third Gate to the First.<br>
<br>
“My name is Maelgroth Waes’Harventhar.” His voice is strong but un-emotional, lacking the arrogant fire that usually betrays the inexperience of the younger Teir Dal. “It shall be long and long before I am worthy to join your ranks, but I wish to make myself known to you.” He pauses for a moment, keen eyes surveying the empty hall. He knows his words shall be heard and weighed and he chooses them carefully.<br>
<br>
“I understand it is tradition to tell a tale about yourself, well I am young and have accomplished little that would gain me fame as of yet.” At this the young Teir Dal sighs heavily.<br>
<br>
“But, in order for you to understand myself and my goals I shall indeed tell you a tale, a tale of murder, betrayal, pride and hate, it shall be the tale of my house, listen well…” <br>
<br>
“In my mother and father’s time, great was the pride of the Waes’Harventhars.” At this the speaker seems to stand taller, “For those of you who do not speak a real language it means ‘skin taker.’” <br>
<br>
“My house was renowned for their music, it was said my mother Shadowbliss could make a captive shriek with such subtleties of tone and cadence that listeners could dance to the screams. Great were her gifts, quick were her hands, total was her obedience to the queen.”<br>
<br>
“My father was her accompanist, his skill with the flaying knife was unequalled. It is said that he once skinned a troll so slowly and skillfully that when he was done there were no seams or cuts in the skin.” The speaker pauses for a moment collecting his thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Together they made beautiful music, and they stood high in the Queen’s favor, indeed they came to her attention during the night of the long knives.” Maelgroth looks carefully around the room, perhaps trying to spot a hidden assassin.<br>
<br>
“At one time several lesser houses attempted to move against the Queen at the King’s bidding. My family got wind of it and ambushed the assassins. In my time I have heard bards of many races sing, but it is said that the sweetest music of all can be coaxed from the throat of a captive Teir Dal, perhaps it’s the superior bonestructure, the perfect teeth and the dexterous tongue.” At this Maelgroth seems to loose himself in meditation, but only for a moment.<br>
<br>
“They took their captives to the Queen, and begged permission to display their skill. She readily agreed. It is said that the music which came from the throats of the Matrons and Patrons of those houses surpassed anything heard in Neriak before or since.”<br>
<br>
“The Queen was so delighted with her new musicians that she took them everywhere with her. Many were the agents of the King who came to a beautiful end on the stained tables of the Waes’Harventhars.” Maelgroth smiles at this last description. He hums a bit of a particularly well known tune in the Maiden’s Fancy, ‘Tarsheva’s Shriek’. <br>
<br>
“My mother was dutiful, but my father was a bit of a fool, and he allowed himself to believe that it was their efforts that kept the Queen safe. He saw himself reflected in the hate directed at the Queen.  So it is that Hate gives birth to many fell children, Pride, Envy, and Fear being its chief agents.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed it was his pride that caused him to claim that it was fear of the Waes’Harventhars that kept the enemies of the Queen at bay. It was envy of their position that caused the remnants of those first four houses to ally once again, this time their target was not the Queen but the Waes’Harventhars. At the last, however, it was fear that did them in.”<br>
<br>
“It is said that the Queen herself began to doubt the loyalty of her servants and to question the position of power she had placed them in. After all the public torture and slaughter of Teir Dal nobility was a privelage entitled only to the royal house. She feared their power, the Waes’Harventhars were becoming an institution exercising authority on their own, increasing their popularity with the masses even earning the grudging respect of the King for their skill.” The speaker pauses again, running his fingers along his clean shaven skull, only the slightest sheen of sweat betrays any sense of nervousness.<br>
<br>
“So it was that the Queen lifted the protections she had placed around her favorite flayers and the scheming of four houses was given her tacit approval. They came for my parents soon after. They lacked skill, it is said my father died of his wounds after only an hour of song. They never got my mother to sing.” The last is said with a bit of grim pride.<br>
<br>
“They would have made me sing as well, but a servant placed her infant in my cradle.” A single tear runs down Maelgroth’s face, he wipes it away with a single finger. “Make no mistake, this is no tear of sadness, but of pride, no house was ever served better by those in its employ. I have not forgotten the generosity shown to me by my nurse maid.” <br>
<br>
“Instead of the idle life of a young Teir Dal noble, I was brought up in the House of the Dead, assuming a slot and identity long prepared and paid for by this woman’s family, passing up her clan’s best chance for advancement to hide the last heir of a broken house. The way of the necromancer became my path and passion.”<br>
<br>
“You wish to know my goals, I will see these four houses brought down in ruin. They shall provide such sweet music that the name of the Waes’Harventhars shall be spoken with respect again, their works shall become the hallmark of civilized folk and not a part of the sweaty ballads of the streetwalkers.”<br>
<br>
“It is said that the game of houses is not for the weak, or the foolish. I am neither, I shall strike at the time of my own choosing, and I must hone my skills, I am not yet the musician my mother was, coaxing her instruments to shrieks of perfection with only a caress or possesses the steady hand and strong fingers of my father.” Maelgroth reaches into a large sack and pulls out four decayed hands.<br>
<br>
“I suppose I should correct that.” <br>
<br>
“I do have their hands.” He holds them up carefully. “They shall be the instruments of my vengeance.” Lovingly he kisses each withered finger, the tips worn away from long contact, after a moment he places them back in the sack.<br>
<br>
“Did you know that the hand has 27 bones in it?” Maelgroth says conversationally, dipping out of the formal mode of address for the first time.<br>
<br>
“That give me 108 chances at vengeance...” <br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
In the darkness of Nektulos Forest the halfling raiders began to know fear. It had been a long time since the importance of their mission had been called into question. They had taken many losses, but that was to be expected. No, something entirely new had come to the forest. Something that filled the lowliest scout and the mightiest captain with a nagging doubt.<br>
<br>
“I don’t want to go out alone.” Whined Preston the scout. He had drawn the black stone from the bag. It meant he had to make the patrol to the fallen tree near the road to Lavastorm. It had always been a difficult route, one which he had successfully negotiated in the past, this time was different.<br>
<br>
“You have to…you drew the black stone!” Hissed Shandor, his best friend. He had nearly moistened his breeches when it was his turn to draw from the bag, so strong was his fear. Now that his neck was out of the noose he was eager to buy a reprieve, even if it was at the cost of his friend’s life.<br>
<br>
“Won’t anyone come with me?” Preston asked. He knew that no one would offer. After all he had not accompanied any of the others when it was their turn. <br>
<br>
“We can’t risk undermining our position here any further, yet we must continue to perform our duties.” The Captain barked. He had not slept for a week and the hair on his feet was matted and dirty. He had sent out double patrols in the past, it just got his men killed quicker. Now his band was cowered around the stump of a mighty tree long since fallen. Their patrols a shadow of their former strength. He did not have the heart to tell his men that he was unsure if word of their plight had gotten back to Rivervale.<br>
<br>
With a heavy heart he blessed Preston with what magics he could. “Be quick, and be quiet.” The Captain whispered. As Preston hurried off into the darkness he added mentally, ‘die well.’<br>
<br>
Preston scuttled soundlessly along the forest floor. He had spent part of his youth as a troublemaker, and had picked up some skill at sneaking and hiding. It was one of the reasons he had volunteered for the position. Well, actually he had been caught with his hand in the mayor’s ‘candy’ jar and given the option of serving in the Nektulos scouts or exile. He had chosen the scouts.<br>
<br>
The coming of the trolls to the forest had caused some consternation initially, but they quickly proved to be less of a problem than expected. They were large, slow and not particularly intelligent. They could be tricked. This train of thought increased the scout’s confidence as he continued on his mission.<br>
<br>
Sure a few scouts had been captured and…well eaten, by the trolls, and that had initially terrified the scouts. What had come after was worse.<br>
<br>
Preston’s friend Shandor had actually come across the first example of the flayer’s work. The feet had been skinned, leaving the bone exposed, that was nothing new, being a horrible part of the Teir Dal’s practice of paying bounty on the scouts. What made this death different from the others was the fact that the skinning had not stopped at the feet, but continued up the legs of the unfortunate scout.<br>
<br>
The captain put it down to a particularly inept Teir Dal who obviously did not know what he was doing. He had ordered the scouts to be more careful.<br>
<br>
The second corpse showed similar mutilation, in this case all the skin from the ankles down had been carefully peeled away, almost like removing a sock. After this discovery the Captain had doubled the patrols.<br>
<br>
The third corpse was one of the sergeants. It was obvious from the tracks on the ground that there had been a terrific struggle. Only one foot was maimed, the other left untouched. It appeared that the flayer had been prevented from completing his grisly work. The Captain had placed his best scouts around the body, hidden by skill and magic for a week. It was heartbreaking to watch that body decay away to nothing, food for the wolves and beetles that frequented the wood, but the Captain had insisted that the flayer would return to complete his work. It did not happen.<br>
<br>
Preston had been in on that last mission. They had caught and killed a few young Teir Dal and one Troll that had been foolish enough to stumble into the ambush. But none of them possessed the skill to take down one of the sergeants. Still there had been no killings for that week, and secretly the Nektulos scouts breathed a sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
The reprive did not last.<br>
<br>
Two days ago both scouts on the Lavastorm road patrol had gone missing. Preston had found the bodies himself. It was the first time that he had seen the corpses up close, and before the Captain or one of his sergeants had examined the body. As he stared at the bodies laid out next to each other he realized something. They had been skinned alive. He, like the rest of the scouts had assumed that the scouts were killed then skinned. With cold certainty he knew that this had been the case with the first bodies too. Scouts were being flayed alive and the Captain had not revealed this information to the rest of his command.<br>
<br>
The news rocked the little command back on its heels, shaking morale to its lowest level ever. Even the boldest scouts became afraid to venture into the wood, and not a few looked suspiciously at the Captain wondering what other things he was neglecting to notify them of.<br>
<br>
Preston paused to examine the road. His acute senses told him that there had been traffic there recently. With a quick prayer to his god and thoughts of pie, he ran across the road and climbed over the sizable fallen log. He paused there for a moment and looked back. There was a slight rustle in the bushes where he had stood a moment ago. His heart leapt into his mouth, he could feel the blood pounding in his ears. Carefully he gripped his short spear.<br>
<br>
The bushes parted.<br>
<br>
Newton the Sergeant had been following him. He almost called out to him, waving the other halfling over to his position of safety. Then the realization hit him. The Captain was using him for bait. Still he felt safer with the knowledge that he was being followed. With a sigh of relief he continued with his patrol. He made a point of not stopping too obviously and waiting for Newton to catch up for the rest of his patrol.<br>
<br>
The road to Lavastorm was clear.<br>
<br>
The road back was not nearly as tense. Preston practically skipped all the way back to the fallen tree near the road. That was where he first heard the sound. He had heard beetles make loud shrieks, and knew well the howl of the black and shadow wolves. He was even familiar with the death roar of the young Kodiaks that were known to frequent the other side of the river. This noise was different from those.<br>
<br>
Preston crouched down and scurried to the side of the log. It was far too big for him to see over, but it gave him excellent cover. Carefully he began to sneak towards the root ball, there were plenty of good places to hide near the fatter end of the tree.<br>
<br>
He had been in the forest long enough to learn quite a bit of the Teir Dal language. In fact he had learned so much about these Dark Elves that he was afraid he would never be the same. Few returned from their tour of duty in Nektulos unscathed. Tales of the cruelty of the Teir Dal were if anything muted in Rivervale, it was enough to know that they were bad and needed to be defeated. He took a certain grim satisfaction from the fact that he had seen the Teir Dal at their worst, and he knew that what they did to outsiders paled to the tortures they inflicted on each other.<br>
<br>
He had reached the end of the log. Ever so slowly, using all the woodslore and cunning he possessed he looked around the edge of the log. He could see the other side. There in the shadows crouched a Teir Dal. A bloody knife was in his hand. At his side stood one of the dead they summoned into their service. From the poor dress of this one he knew he faced a youth. He gripped his spear firmly and prepared to put an end to another of these verminous elves.<br>
<br>
“Sing for Maelgroth again.” The Teir Dal whispered gently. He moved the knife with the delicacy of a butterfly. It danced in the air, almost like a conductor’s baton. The pitiful mewling began again. It was the same noise he had heard earlier.<br>
<br>
‘It must be some animal.’ Preston lied to himself as he crept closer. He knew the truth though, it was there before his eyes. The discarded Leatherfoot Raider skullcap lay at the skeleton’s feet, as did Sergeant Newton’s longsword. <br>
<br>
“Die!” Preston shouted, his fear turning to anger, now that he faced a tangible foe. His spear was a blur as it hurtled towards Maelgroth the Teir Dal Necromancer. He would have his vengeance.<br>
<br>
His spear was turned aside by defensive magics, and the Necromancer turned towards him, his robe was plastered with blood, and his hands were scarlet, no gloves for this one. The worst were his eyes. They told the scout that the Teir Dal knew where he was all along.<br>
<br>
“Ah, time for the Duet!” Maelgroth smiled.<br>

The recent influx of trolls had forced most of the occupants to seek lodging elsewhere, only the most desperate and tenacious remained.<br>
<br>
“I am back from slaughtering paladins in West Karana mother!” Maelgroth shouted as he pulled aside the ragged curtain that separated the shack from the street. He carefully stepped over Jabaner the house guardian. The poor skeletal pet had seen better days, most of his ribs were missing and the local children had “decorated” him once again, replacing his rusted halberd with a toilet plunger.<br>
<br>
“My son, it is good to see you have returned.” Naelaelayle whispered. She was an old Teir Dal, the servant who had rescued Maelgroth those many years ago when his family had lost their position. She invited him further into the room with a gnarled hand, and twitched her good ear into a better position.<br>
<br>
“Where is my brother, Malingrad?” Maelgroth asked with some degree of trepidation. Malingrad was the natural son of Naelaelayle, and more than a little jealous of his mother’s continued loyalty to a fallen house. Mael had taken his position at the lodge of the dead, leaving Malingrad to make his way in the world as an assassin.<br>
<br>
“He is out, gathering information, preparing for The Day.” Naelaelayle hissed. The Day had become an obsession with her, becoming more urgent and important as the aged Teir Dal slipped into cronehood. She knew it was only a matter of time before she died, to a drunken Troll, an accident in the forest or simple old age and disease. She drove her sons relentlessly.<br>
<br>
“Where is Blisshadow?” the Necromancer queried as he opened his backpack and began to remove its contents.<br>
<br>
“Your sister has left us, she did not see the value of revenge.” His mother growled. It was the same answer every time he asked about her. He knew that Bliss was a point of serious concern for the whole family, as the only eligible female, she would take over when his mother died. She continued after stifling a dry cough, “She still seeks power through the clergy, forgetting who she is and where she came from.”<br>
<br>
“I have brought you some food…” Maelgroth said as he began to lay out the supplies he had collected. When he was a youth, they had subsisted off whatever they could scavenge, now it was with some pride that he presented real food to his mother. Sure it was simple peasant fare but it was better than rat tail stew.<br>
<br>
As his mother ate, with all the delicacy an elder matron of a noble house, he looked about the one room shack. Rats had long learned not to come here, lest they end up in the stewpot. Curtains divided the single room into sections each barely large enough for a pallet to sleep on. It was fortunate that the Teir Dal could see so well in the dark, no fire provided light or heat, it cost too much. Maelgroth had learned to read in darkness. <br>
<br>
“Tell me of our enemies.” Naelaelayle sighed, as she did each time she asked. It was a daily ritual when her children were growing up. Each day it was the same, each day his mother seemed to gain strength from its being repeated.<br>
<br>
“House Chath’elg’Caress (the Fire Hags) lives in 3rd gate, where we used to have housing for our cousins. House Sol’Calar (the Eye Eaters) live in 2nd gate our first ancestral home. House Vlos’Shannaal (the Blood Chalice) lives in the shrine to Innoruk built by my family.” Maelgroth paused for the requisite time to let the enormity of what he was to say next to register. “House Ragar’Golhyrr (the Truth Finders) rests in our rightful place both in our home and in the eyes of the court.”<br>
<br>
“It is good to have such a dutiful son.” His mother whispered. “Tell me now what is the real name of the Ragar’Golhyrr?” By this she meant the meaning of their house name before they rose to the 3rd gate. In Teir Dal it was all about inflection, the same words with the right inflection could mean a hundred different things, all similar, yet different, names to the Teir Dal were like onions, each had a hundred layers.<br>
<br>
“They Uncover Tricks, matron they are snitches.” Maelgroth replied with considerable venom. Of the four houses the most hatred was reserved for the Ragar’Golhyrr who had seamlessly assumed the position of the Waes’Harventhars. Rising from the reviled position of snitch to that of torturer within a generation. Now they squatted like a bloated spider in 3rd gate garnering the respect and wealth due the Waes’Harventhars. It was even rumored they accepted bribes to determine the length of the torture.<br>
<br>
“You know, between the three of us children, we could easily afford to move you to 2nd gate.” Mael began carefully, it was an old argument, but it was one that he refused to loose. It would be a tragedy if some accident were to befall his mother before the family could extract vengeance.<br>
<br>
“I will rest in my old quarters in 3rd gate or I will die in this shack!” Naelaelayle howled.<br>
<br>
“As you wish.” Mael deferred.<br>
<br>
“Do you know there is a young maiden of the Chath’elg’Caress that has reached the age of marriage?” his mother said with a sweet smile.<br>
<br>
“Have they opened their house to suitable courtiers?”<br>
<br>
“Indeed they have, an announcement was posted in 3rd gate just yesterday.” She reached into the folds of her dress and removed an invitation. “Your brother was able to acquire this from the Ragar’Golhyrr, they would never consider an alliance with such trash, and it was easy to rescue this item from their care. <br>
<br>
The matron stood from her rocking chair slowly and hobbled over to a large chest that had been sealed all Mael’s life, she carefully removed a small key and opened the chest. It was protected by more than a lock, powerful wards glimmered momentarily before fading.<br>
<br>
“Long have I kept these things in preparation, as you progress more heirlooms of your house shall be returned to you, but you will have need of some of this now.” She carefully removed several packages, each wrapped in spider silk and each apparently as fresh as the day they were first put in the chest.<br>
<br>
First there was a simple black robe, made of spider silk, the tailoring was exquisite but in a style that had gone out of fashion a century ago. It would cause quite a stir, however, since a similar fashion was currently all the rage, and it was apparent that the younger generation had no idea they were actually aping a much older style.<br>
<br>
Next she handed him a simple mask made of bone. “In the old days, great houses wore masks to avoid embarrassment when courting other houses.” Her gnarled hands caressed the mask with great fondness. “I think it is time that we bring this tradition back.”<br>
<br>
Maelgroth dressed carefully in the clothing, it fit him well, though the robe did not radiate magic. The mask had a slight aura about it, and it grafted to his face with no trouble and remained there. He was amazed that his mother had access to such wealth, yet had not made use of it during all their hardships, it spoke volumes about her loyalty to his house.<br>
<br>
His mother handed him the knife last, it was made from the tooth of a walrus and it was as sharp as sin. As he cloaked himself in shadows and left the shack, he heard his mother whisper, “win her heart…”<br>

A day she had waited all her life for. Today she was eligible for marriage. Her mate had long ago been chosen, bolstering the position of the Chath’elg’Caress in the court, but tradition had to be observed, and ascension days were one of the best ways for a house to show its power and influence publicly, indeed some houses had beggared themselves with lavish displays.<br>
<br>
It was a good indication of the power of the Fire Hags that no less than four representatives from third gate stood in the common room, sipping wine. There were seven more from the second gate, mostly desperate young houses eager to expand their reach into the world of the third gate. Also in attendance were the heads of the Chath’elg’Caress’ allied houses. In all nearly30 houses were represented directly or indirectly. It was a good showing.<br>
<br>
The gift table groaned under the weight of offerings made by the guests. Many were the precious gifts that lay upon that slab of black marble. Zalindra looked at it with barely disguised greed, forgetting for a moment the even vaster sums of money that would have to be paid back to those houses who made gifts on this day, in compensation and reparation to their apparent loss of face when her betrothal to another house was announced.<br>
<br>
“Ok, go now!” hissed her Matron-mother. This was a proud day, one long prepared for, yet fraught with danger, for soon the Fire Hags would be playing ardently in the game of houses, the ascension of her daughter Zalindra being the first move in a game long planned and prepared for. Her daughter wore a gown of the thinnest spider silk, encrusted with jewels, on her head a coronet made of velium and enchanted to make the wearer appear inhumanly beautiful.<br>
<br>
It was common in these days for all the details of the ascension day to be tied up before the actual event, it had become more of a pageant where the houses could openly display their power and position and less of an announcement of availability for alliance. Zalindra recalled tales told to her by her mother, tales about her grandmother and the duels that broke out in the old days as houses vied openly for the hands of the most eligible maidens. With a sigh she pranced down the steps, secretly disappointed that there would be no blood spilt on her behalf this day.<br>
<br>
As she sauntered down the stairs she used her elevated position to evaluate the guests, there in the corner stood several of the second gate representatives, their hunger for alliance all to plain in their stance and all to elaborate clothing. They aimed above their station and she ignored them with a deliberate blink of her eye, she was not for them. In another part of the room, near the fireplace where a fat halfling revolved on a spit, stood several of her houses vassals. They stood about, waiting for the food to become available, ready to pounce on it and devour it like the leeches they were. It was good that their vassals were kept hungry, better that they appear at such occasions where their loyalty was on display.<br>
<br>
She allowed her eyes to flit, only for the briefest moment, to the bar where the real power lay, there stood several of the mightiest houses in third gate. They were here out of respect, having tactfully declined all previous attempts at alliance, but they were here today, some of their gifts were said to be the most extravagant. With a snicker she recalled the groans of the house Patron, her father, when those gifts had arrived. “so they would blackmail our house!” was all he said, the realization that the Fire Hags would have to send gifts back to these houses of equal or greater value to make up for their “loss” writ as misery on his face. <br>
<br>
Zalindra knew this was how the game was played, the wealthier houses retained wealth through such displays and brought low weaker houses through such gifts. To return a gift of lesser value than the one offered was a cause for open war. Only one house would be receiving that most precious of gifts, herself and the alliance with the Fire Hags that she represented. As she neared the bottom of the stairs she saw a newcomer.<br>
<br>
He was dressed in the most fascinating robe, it was simple black silk, but the tailoring was exquisite, putting to shame the elaborate clothing of most of the houses presenting on this day. In his hands he held a box of treant wood. Eagerly she took the last few steps down, she could not see his face since before him stood Tehchad the master of protocol.<br>
<br>
“This is highly irregular.” Tehchad muttered, the appearance of yet another guest, totally unannounced was a throwback to the old days when one house attempted to outdo another in formal display. The fact that the candidate wore a bone mask further underscored the antique nature of this house. <br>
<br>
Inwardly he cringed with fear, he had been a master of protocol for two hundred years and recalled well the old days where such ascension days resulted in bloodfeuds that paralyzed the city. However, this guest had observed all the formal protocol the situation demanded and most importantly, he had an invitation.<br>
<br>
A careful magical scan revealed only two magical devices, the mask, which was expected and the box, which obviously contained a gift intended for Zalindra. He had always hated the masks, since they prevented the detection of the identity of the wearer, in the old days courtiers had insisted on privacy to protect the honor of their houses. Ascension days were matters of high drama then, not the civilized promenades they had become.<br>
<br>
“May I have your name sir?” Tehchad droned.<br>
<br>
“We have had dealings with the Ragar’Golhyrr, you can call us ‘Jindurn’Plynnar’.”<br>
<br>
Tehchad stared at the newcomer, what arrogance, what brashness, why this guest pushed the limits of good taste. It was completely normal for houses to attend these functions under assumed names, but always the name was a play upon the name of the actual house. In the old days it might take days of cogitation to unravel the true names from those given as riddles. Today house pseudonyms were nearly as well known as the actual names of the houses involved.<br>
<br>
In this case the guest had named himself ‘Face Taker’ at a political function a name like this was provocative in the extreme. Still he had admitted an association with the Ragar’Golhyrr, after a bit of thought he drew the conclusion that this guest was an ally of the Truth Finders, and with the outcome of the ascension day hardly being a secret, this house Jindurn’Plynnar would soon become an ally of the Fire Hags as well. <br>
<br>
It was, however, impossible to tell if this house of Face Takers was a vassal or a sponsor of the Ragar’Golhyrr. <br>
<br>
“I would like to announce the arrival of Jindurn’Plynnar!” Tehchad shouted, thumping his staff on the rich marble floor with a smart rap.<br>
<br>
As the newest guest stepped into the room and the representatives began to circle the newcomer like hungry piranha Tehchad prayed that he was not going to see a return to the old ways. <br>

She had never heard of house Jindurn’Plynnar, but her long court training told her much about the man before her. Eagerly she catalogued his status. The mask spoke of an interest in the old ways, the robe bespoke class and wealth. The riddle was obvious to her, this guest must be a lord of the patron house of the Ragar’Golhyrr. The Truth Finders claimed they owed their position at the court to no one, but they had risen far and fast in the world of the third gate, faster then her own house, they must have a hidden patron.<br>
<br>
“It is a pleasure to meet such an august personage as yourself, I am flattered that one such as you would come to my ascension.” Zalindra whispered in the ear of the guest. Carefully she linked her arm in his and steered him away from the throng of lesser houses eager to make the acquaintance of the newcomer. She was pleased to note that the rest of the guests took her cue and backed off, granting house Jindurn’Plynnar the space afforded to only the greatest of houses.<br>
<br>
Since this was her ascension day, she was allowed to address her guests in the singular, it would be the last time she would be able to do so at “official” gatherings where in the future she would always be speaking for her house.<br>
<br>
“We are most gratified, that the Chath’elg’Caress would take the time to speak with us on such an important day.” The speakers tone was clear and cold, obviously well educated. It came only as a tiny shock that he addressed her in the old tongue not Teir’Dal. Secretly she forgave her tutors who had drilled the complexities of the old tongue into her as a child, despite her protests that it was of little use in the “real world.”<br>
<br>
Very few spoke the old tongue now, it being reserved mostly for court ceremony. The thought sent a tiny thrill through her body, could this person be a representative from the court? Had her house risen high enough to attract the attention of the royal house? The possibilities were dizzying.<br>
<br>
Expertly she steered the newcomer to the courting alcove, a special place in nearly all houses. This was where private discussions could be held while in public view. Paranoia being what it was no house would allow an eligible female out of their sight on an ascension day. While few really embraced those tales of romance where the beloved of a young maiden broke into the ascension and kidnapped the girl under the noses of her family, it had happened. It would not happen here.<br>
<br>
“I am surprised we have not met before, I am Zalindra.” She smiled, her considerable beauty augmented by the coronet. No man could resist her. She found the mask a fascinating puzzle, she could not tell if her guest was young or old. For a moment the romantic in her conjured up images of an elder member of a high house looking for a new matron. Hurriedly she catalogued what she knew of the houses and their positions, there were a few houses of the highest rank that were currently without Matrons, it could be. What a mess that would make of the long arrangement between her house and the Ragar’Golhyrr.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was glad of the mask. He found he gained confidence with each moment that passed. Long had his training been in court etiquette, and painful his lessons. Mother had punished him severely for each fault in language and bearing. As a child he had seen little point in learning the old tongue, dance, and protocol, while eating rats in the foreign quarter. Now he slipped into his true element as easily as he slipped into the robe and mask.<br>
<br>
His heart beat faster than it ever had, Zalindra was beautiful, so alluring in fact he was tempted to tell her everything. The box shifted a bit in his grip, breaking that train of thought. He turned back to the beauty and envisioned her dead, strangled, her fair neck made a darker purple, her face peeled away, he thought of his real mother. He was himself again.<br>
<br>
“Well it has been a very long time since we have taken interest in matters here.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
“You flatter me.” She cooed, rubbing his arm gently, and scooting closer to him. Across the room she could see De’Nav her consort to be staring at her, he was a well known knight from a good house, he would be an excellent match, but he could wait. After all it was her day not his.<br>
<br>
As a necromancer Maelgroth had studied anatomy extensively, it was little known outside of the Lodge of the Dead that a great deal of time was spent observing the living. How the machine worked when it was alive was of critical importance, the power of the undead servant was directly proportional to how well the magical energies mimicked those of the living.<br>
<br>
He was looking closely at Zalindra. The signs of arousal were there, the darkening of the lips and ears, revealing the pumping of extra blood to those areas making them more sensitive. The dialation of the pupil and quicker breath, as the body demanded more fuel in its excited state. He had seen it all before. He did not dare look any lower than that, though he knew other signs of interest would be readily visible. Of course any maiden worth a copper knew how to fake these signs.<br>
<br>
“We have brought you a gift, it is our hope that it will capture your heart.” He handed her the treantwood box.<br>
<br>
“You already have.” She replied, snatching the box from him. As she looked more closely at it she realized there was no lid or keyhole. ‘It must be a puzzle box!’ Zalindra thought to herself. She had always loved puzzles, and been encouraged in her interest since it trained the mind well for court life. This was one package that she would open personally. Let the servants handle the other gifts.<br>
<br>
De’Nav was furious. It was perfectly acceptable for a maiden on her ascension day to mingle with the guests, but to take one to the courting alcove that bordered on scandal. That place was reserved for the most important of discussions. He found it hard to believe any discussion could be more important than the one he was due to have with Zalindra in a few hours. <br>
<br>
He stormed over to the alcove, barely restraining himself from slapping the box out of Zalindra’s hands.<br>
<br>
“House Ragar’Golhyrr is pleased to make your acquaintance, and requests some of your time.” De’Nav hissed in Teir’Dal, barely recalling his manners.<br>
<br>
“Our business here is done, and Jindurn’Plynnar stands ready to meet with Ragar’Golhyrr in any way they deem acceptable.” Maelgroth replied. His words were formal and polite, but were couched in the terms of an invitation to duel, they were also in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
It took a moment for De’Nav to realize what had just been said. It hit him like a shock. Had he really been foolish enough to be rude to an unknown guest at his consort’s ascension day. The very thought and the veiled threat filled him with shame. This was not some second gate bitch breeding party, this was the third gate. He feared no one, but brawling like pimps outside the Maiden’s Fancy would do little to enhance the status of the Ragar’Golhyrr.<br>
<br>
“Jindurn’Plynnar apologizes to Ragar’Golhyrr for their late and unexpected arrival.” Maelgroth stood up carefully. “We wish the alliance between the Ragar’Golhyrr and the Chath’elg’Caress to be as successful as it is long.”<br>
<br>
As Mael stood up to go he saw a flicker of disappointment on Zalindra’s face. A duel at her ascension would be the talk of the town. De’Nav had recovered himself nicely and there was little point getting killed so early in the game. De’Nav was known as an accomplished duelist and the young necromancer was unsure if he would be able to defeat him.<br>
<br>
“Walk in hate.” De’Nav replied as the guest left the alcove. Relieved he had been given an out. Inwardly he berated himself, he had no idea what house this guest was from, or even how powerful this person or even worse this person’s champion might be.<br>
<br>
“I do everyday…” <br>

Behind him De’Nav and Zalindra glowered at each other. He knew they would not speak about his presence at the party, each assuming the other knew more about house Jindurn’Plynnar than they did. He was, however, gratified to see that Zalindra still held the box closely.<br>
<br>
“We are most pleased to make your acquaintance.” Nystyre De’Vir smiled. He was standing with two other highest ranking houses. His clothing was perfect as was his command of the old tongue. None wore masks.<br>
<br>
“It is a pleasure to encounter such company here.” Malegroth replied. He knew house De’Vir well by reputation. Their house was ancient and well respected. Their symbol was the lidless eye.<br>
<br>
“We must confess to a certain confusion,” one of the other houses added, Maelgroth could not see his symbol, “We thought we knew of all the guests.”<br>
<br>
“We have been long away from the court, and the game of houses, we have returned.” The young necromancer snapped. Heading over to this group was a mistake, it would only be a matter of time before his ruse was uncovered. As versed as he had become in the intricacies of the game through long hours of practice with his mother, the three houses before him literally owned the game.<br>
<br>
As Maelgroth accepted a drink from the servant behind the bar and turned to go, Nystyre glided up to him.<br>
<br>
“We have a niece who will be reaching her own ascension soon, you would do well to attend that gathering.” Nystyre whispered.<br>
<br>
The offer appeared to be sincere, at least as sincere as any offer was made at such gatherings. Especially when couched in a whisper. “We would be glad to attend such a gathering, make your intentions known through the usual channels and we will grant you the courtesy of notifying you of our arrival in advance.”<br>
<br>
It was all Mael could think of, he certainly would not tell he Scion of house De’Vir to send his invitation to the third shack past the first gate. It was a cunning ploy, any legitimate house would certainly give house De’Vir a glimpse at the face behind the mask to ensure an invitation to that ascension, something that Jindurn’Plynnar could not do at this time. Even at the height of Waes’Harventhar power, house De’Vir was given the same healthy amount of respect a wise gnome gave a hungry troll.<br>
<br>
“What do you think of the wine?” The matron of Chath’elg’Caress asked nervously. She had crept up from the other direction. To Maelgroth’s trained eyes rouge on the ears and lips did little to hide the fact that blood fled from those places. Fear and stress were draining the blood from the surface of her body.<br>
<br>
Mael had no idea what to do, he had actually forgotten he wore the mask for an instant, so eager was he to come up with a reason to leave the bar. He had grabbed the glass without really thinking about it. Now he was faced with the challenge of removing the mask to drink and revealing his identity, or lack of it, or attempting to drink through the mask.<br>
<br>
With a prayer to Innoruk he attempted the latter. <br>
<br>
The wine was the sweetest he had ever tasted.<br>
<br>
He only risked a single sip, even though it appeared the enchanted mask enabled him to consume food. He had never really been able to afford the luxury of alcohol and was afraid to drink any more lest his concentration slip.<br>
<br>
“We find it suitable for the occasion.”<br>
<br>
He turned back towards the alcove where Zalindra and De’Nav were still glaring at each other. The house matron seemed to take this for a signal and clapped her hands loudly. The room grew quiet.<br>
<br>
“We wish to thank all the houses who attended this ascension!” the matron announced. “We regret that we only have one daughter to give in alliance.” She continued.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth ignored the rest of her speech, which went on for some time. Instead he concentrated on the box. The past, present and future of the Waes’Harventhars rested within it.<br>
<br>
Finally, house Chath’elg’Caress ceased its blathering. All eyes turned to the surly couple in the alcove. Mechanically Zalindra removed a brooch from her dress, it was an elaborate piece of jewelery, depicting the blazon of the Fire Hags in ruby and mithril. <br>
<br>
“I give myself to house Ragar’Golhyrr.” Zalindra said without much feeling.<br>
<br>
“Ragar’Golhyrr accepts your sacrifice.” De’Nav said formally, accepting the brooch and planting a chaste kiss on Zalindra’s  brow. With a short bow to the rest of the guests he left the mansion.<br>
<br>
It was not the most passionate of alliances, but then again such affairs rarely were.<br>
<br>
The guests were now free to leave. Maelgroth diplomatically waited for house De’Vir to make their exit before heading out himself. He knew that De’Nav would return secretly as soon as the last guest left, sneaking into Zalindra’s bedchambers where they would consummate the alliance. <br>
<br>
He gated home.<br>

<br>
“It was most interesting.” Maelgroth replied, removing the mask with a shaking hand. “We have been invited to another ascension day, House De’Vir has requested our presence.”<br>
<br>
“House De’Vir!” For a moment the years of sacrifice and terror were gone, and a century of hard living seemed to vanish from his mother’s frame. It was as if Maelgroth was afforded a window on what life in his house must have been like before its fall. His mother was as excited as a school girl with a choice piece of gossip.<br>
<br>
Her excitement only lasted a moment, and soon they were once again standing in the wretched shack in third gate.<br>
<br>
“I have everything prepared.” Mother growled, handing him a small blade.<br>
<br>
“I have been looking forward to this all night.” Maelgroth smiled. It was the cold, merciless smile of a Teir’Dal noble.<br>
<br>
Zalindra was in bed. As soon as De’Nav had left she had excused herself and headed to her room. On this night the wards that usually protected her were removed, guards would look the other way and strange sounds would be ignored. Her Consort would be arriving soon, “sneaking” into her chambers and consummating the alliance.<br>
<br>
She had tried to open the box, but found she was too nervous to concentrate on uncovering its secrets. ‘I shall have plenty of time later, I can’t image De’Nav will keep me amused for long.’ She thought to herself.<br>
<br>
She lay back on her pillows, smoothing the diaphanous silk gown over her curvaceous body. Maybe it was the stress of the day, too much wine or simply the weight of tradition, Zalindra began slip into that borderline between being awake and asleep.<br>
<br>
Soundlessly the box on the table by her bedside opened.<br>

PoValkri and PoMaelgroth))<br>
<br>
“Did you know, mother, your information on the Ragar’Golhyrr was wrong?” Maelgroth muttered, he had the far away expression of someone scrying, his hands fluttered before him like the trapped wings of a moth. <br>
<br>
“I had hoped my fears were incorrect, the alliance of the Ragar’Golhyrr and the Chath’elg’Caress would make a potent house indeed, allowing them to move up to the levels of the highest of houses.” She too had the vacant expression and flat tones of a scryer, her hands, gnarled with age, danced lightly along a table top.<br>
<br>
“Such an alliance would be a threat to some of the older houses would it not?” The young necromancer mumbled, half to himself.<br>
<br>
“Aye, it would..” Mused Naelaelayle.<br>
<br>
“It is time mother.”<br>
<br>
“Aye…”<br>
<br>
Zalindra watched in fascination as two sets of skeletal hands shuffled uncertainly out of the box. She nearly called for the guard, but the jeweled rings on the fingers of the automatons gave her pause. Here was wealth indeed.<br>
<br>
“Are you for me?” She whispered to the hands.<br>
<br>
They paused for a moment, as if sensing her presence. Finally one of the male hands rocked back on its stump and gave her a cheery wave.<br>
<br>
Zalindra gave a little squeal of delight, no one had ever taken the trouble to give her such an animated gift, the mummified hands would have to go, but the jewelery was simply stunning and as a method of delivery it was certainly unique. She once again thought about calling the guards, but thought better of it, it would take time and there would be questions about why this gift avoided the scrutiny of the house mages. Better to bring this matter up after the ascension rite was consummated.<br>
<br>
She reached out and picked up the female hands, they were still beautiful, after a fashion. Long and delicate fingers danced in the air like the legs of a spider, without a doubt they had belonged to a Teir’Dal matron in her prime. The rings glittered in the candlelight, painting rainbows of color on the walls.<br>
<br>
“Let’s see about getting those nice rings off your scabby fingers.” Zalindra sighed, she was not eager to get dead flaky skin all over her sheets, before De’Nav arrived, but it would not be the first time that she had called in the servants to replace the sheets on a bed before a paramour arrived.<br>
<br>
She put the left female hand down on the bed, and gripped the right in both of hers. It writhed powerfully, resisting her efforts to remove the ring.<br>
<br>
“By Innoruk, Help me get it off!” She shouted at the hand.<br>
<br>
Outside her door, the last of the house guards smirked and stepped away certain that De’Nav had arrived to consummate the ascension. He headed to the far end of the hall.<br>
<br>
In her petulant fury at being denied the treasure she sought, Zalindra lost track of the male hands. She could feel the left female scuttling around on the bed. It leapt onto her stomach and began to tickle her mercilessly.<br>
<br>
She dropped the right hand and attempted to seize the left, but it was too quick for her. She heard a slight scraping sound coming from the box, but ignored it for the moment, she almost had the troublesome right trapped between her knees.<br>
<br>
The left male hand clambered onto her bed next, it moved much more slowly. She moved to slap it away, but it caught onto her hand and pinned it to the bed. This was unacceptable. Zalindra sucked in a breath to call the guards, but the female right clutched her neck turning her shout into a loud moan. The female left scuttled around pinning her other arm.<br>
<br>
In the hall the guard heard a long drawn out moan, followed by desperate thrashing. He had heard those noises coming from Zalindra’s room often enough. He wished his family was important enough to hold formal ascension ceremonies. He moved a bit further down the hall to be sure not to embarrass or more importantly disturb Zalindra.<br>
<br>
Zalindra had gone from being bored, to amused to annoyed in only a few moments. Now she saw the right male hand, it moved even more slowly than the left had, it was dragging a knife made of bone with it. Annoyance quickly gave way to anger.<br>
<br>
“You don’t know who you are messing with!” Zalindra hissed explosively, the sound was barely a squeek. A distant part of her mind realized that she did not know who was messing with her either.<br>
<br>
Male right had dragged the bone knife up to her face where she got a good view of the sharpness of the blade, it glistened in the candlelight.<br>
<br>
Fear replaced anger.<br>
<br>
“I will do anything you want, just don’t hurt me.” Zalindra whined. The hand on her neck would adjust its grip from time to time, giving her the chance to catch a hurried breath and wheeze out a comment or two.<br>
<br>
At first it felt as if one of her hairs was laying on her jaw line, so light was the touch. It was the bone knife, it lovingly caressed the edges of her face, the pain, which began as an itch slowly increased in tempo, blood, rich, purple, the noble blood of a Teir’Dal maiden began to seep into the sheets.<br>
<br>
The hand gripping her neck began to clench and loosen in a particular pattern, in time with the cuts to her face. Zalindra sighed in agony with every opportunity, the distant part of her mind that was not paralyzed with terror or gripped by the agony visited upon her struggled with understanding what was going on.<br>
<br>
The faintest of noises reached Toffol the guard in the hall. With a wicked grin he recognized the pattern of moans and stifled shrieks. It was a pretty good rendition of  “Tarsheva’s Shriek.” ‘Why old De’Nav must have smuggled a slave or two in with him.’ Toffol thought to himself, allowing his foot to tap in time to the music.<br>
<br>
Occasionally Zalindra could feel the blade scrape upon the bone of her skull, as always the cuts were gentle, and followed by soft tugs. There must be some magic at work with the knife, something that kept her still when it touched her. She could not stop herself from moaning when the hand at her throat relented.<br>
<br>
De’Nav was eager to begin his part of the ascension festivities. A short visit to the “Fancy” had whetted his appetite and he climbed the ladder ‘conveniently’ left out for him to his consort’s bedchamber.<br>
<br>
She appeared to be a pretty imperious bitch, but he felt sure that they would learn to tolerate each other. Tonight he would concentrate on the pretty part of the equation. As he got closer to the window he heard the pants and moans clearly. Anger flared, ‘what an insult to have a pleasure slave in on your ascension day!’ he thought to himself, he climbed quicker, glad he had brought his longsword with him. ‘I might not be able to make the bitch pay for this insult, but her companion will feel my wrath.’<br>
<br>
He vaulted into the room, drawing his sword in a silvery blur. In front of him Zalindra writhed in an agony that cruelly mimicked the motions of ecstasy. Blood seeped from around her face and bloody tears decorated her cheeks. <br>
<br>
His shout of outrage turned to one of stark terror as the hands peeled off Zalindra’s face.  Her scream of agony joined his shattering glass.<br>
<br>
Toffol would never forget that scream, even as he died under the torture racks of the Chath’elg’Caress. It was the most perfect sound he had ever heard.<br>

He was big for a Teir Dal, nearly as big as a warrior, and his hands were quick. While the Ebon Mask claimed no formal allegiance with any of the houses or to the king or queen, individual members were known to dabble in politics. It was the morning after Zalindra’s ascension.<br>
<br>
“What?” Naelaelayle coughed wearily, the casting last night had taken a lot out of her, dark bruises still marred her gnarled hands, testament to her struggle with the much younger Teir’Dal.<br>
<br>
“House Chath’elg’Caress has closed its doors to the Ragar’Golhyrr.” The assassin crowed.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth could tell by the swagger in his step that Malingrad was more than ready to take credit for the entire affair himself.<br>
<br>
“Calm your joy, son, it was not through your efforts alone that this alliance was averted.” His mother growled.<br>
<br>
“Of course,” Malingrad laughed, “How are your hands mother.”<br>
<br>
While at home Malingrad preferred to ignore his brother, who he secretly called the true thief. Weather the resentment was feigned or not, Maelgroth could never tell. It seemed to him, the life of the assassin was more suited to Malingrad than that of the necromancer. <br>
<br>
Mael’s own hands were stiff and sore, and he was exhausted, it had been a very difficult and complex spell that had animated the hands.<br>
<br>
“What are they saying happened?” Maelgroth croaked.<br>
<br>
“Nothing, other than the ascension of Zalindra was ruined when De’Nav refused to consummate the union.”<br>
<br>
“What are they whispering?” Naelaelayle hissed. She was more tired than she had ever been, and the sight in her left eye seemed to be gone.<br>
<br>
“Well that’s the interesting part,” Malingrad chuckled sweeping some of the food off the table and into his mouth. “Can’t you get mother something better than rations?” he glowered at his younger ‘brother’.<br>
<br>
“I don’t see you turning you nose up at it.” Mael snapped back. <br>
<br>
When they were younger Mal had beaten his little brother regularly just for kicks. He could still do it too, but now Malingrad sensed it would be much more difficult.<br>
<br>
“Rumor on the street has it that De’Nav refused to consummate after he saw a pair of hands peel off Zalindra’s face. A household guard has been blamed officially for the event and was promptly tortured to death, but the loss of face…,” the assassin chuckled grimly “…is too much for either house to bear without blaming the other.”<br>
<br>
“So there shall be war.” The old Teir’Dal cackled.<br>
<br>
“There is war.” Malingrad enthused, “I have accepted contracts for the deaths of several members of both houses. I had not expected to become wealthy from this vendetta.” At this he patted his bulging purse. “I am not the only on taking money from the feuding houses, the knives are out!”<br>
<br>
Someone brought up outside of Neriak may not have understood the intracies of what Malingrad was saying. Maelgroth knew well the protocols of house war. There were several stages, the first, the closing of the doors, signified the cutting off of formal ties to the other house. No business would be done between the houses until the doors were opened. Allied houses were expected to close their doors as well. To date none had. This was to be a feud directly between the Fire Hags and the Truth Finders. <br>
<br>
Such feuds were often shorter in duration than those that brought in their allies, since the number of principals involved was fewer and ancillary grudges did not come into the feud. Single house feuds were rare and renowned for their viciousness. No house could back down once war was declared, and the other houses kept score, such an affair was a disaster for the loser and usually left the winner weaker than before.<br>
<br>
Malingrad’s statement that the knives were out, meant that fighting had begun. It would usually start with the murder of a few low ranking house members, those cousins or nephews on the periphery of the family, store keepers, guardsmen and other non-entities. The true powers of the houses would be hidden in their fortress mansions, planning strikes and counter strikes at their enemies holdings. Poison, rumor, fire and steel were the currencies that these former allies would deal each other now.<br>
<br>
The fact that both sides were hiring professional killers further underscored the deadly intent of the combatants, both were going for the jugular.<br>
<br>
“Do not forget our purpose here.” Naelaelayle pointed out. “We still have much to do. I will see the Waes’Harventhars restored to their position before my death.”<br>
<br>
“Of course mother.” Malingrad said patronizingly. <br>
<br>
“Since you are so well connected, brother, I suppose you would have no trouble in getting another invitation?”<br>
<br>
“Of course.” Malingrad smirked. “Where would you like to go? The royal ball?”<br>
<br>
“We require an invitation to an affair at house D’Vir.” Maelgroth had placed the mask over his face once again and had spoken the last in the old tongue, speaking as the head of his house. It was something he had never dared. He was unsure why he did it now. Partly anger at the way his brother treated their mother, partly frustration at the lack of respect shown to him and partly elation at the small victory achieved last night all contributed to this gamble.<br>
<br>
Malingrad stopped chewing on his food and stared at his masked brother. Getting an invitation would be quite a challenge, house D’Vir was not to be trifled with. “Have a care you don’t try to grasp what is beyond your reach.” The assassin hissed, his hand crept dangerously towards his dagger.<br>
<br>
“How can I, when it is with your fingers I do my reaching?” Maelgroth countered, removing the mask.<br>
<br>
“How indeed, I shall do your will in this thing.” Malingrad replied in a mocking tone, still he addressed Mael in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
Naelaelayle quivered with pride. She loved Malingrad as her true son, even when he did not understand her goals. Maelgroth, however, seemed to grow in power and stature before her eyes. Hearing him speak as the head of his house, and listening to the way he cajoled his older brother into doing his duty was a wish fulfilled. For a moment she glimpsed what life would have been like had the Waes’Harventhar’s never fallen.<br>
<br>
Across town Nystyre relaxed in his study. It had been an eventful night for house D’Vir and an even more interesting morning. The great houses had survived by working together to keep the more ambitious younger houses weak. Sure they would feud with each other, but they had grown too few to risk really harming each other, to destroy one of the great houses would create a power vacuum that would place all at risk.<br>
<br>
The alliance of the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr had been a dagger aimed at the heart of the old houses. Now that knife was cutting into two upstart houses. He had made discrete inquiries to determine the identity of the house that had taken such delicate and brutal steps. None of the old houses took the credit even indirectly, this was truly unique, such a coup was always bragged about.<br>
<br>
None of the younger houses possessed the maturity to make such a play, or the wisdom to keep such a move secret. No it was not them.<br>
<br>
Many openly speculated that a new house had decided to make its presence known. There were many candidates, some from the more powerful guilds would make their own alliances and settle in town, but Nystyre made it a habit to keep informed of these individuals. He had his own theory.<br>
<br>
“How could I refuse such a beautiful request.” A honeyed voice crooned.<br>
<br>
Nystyre turned carefully, his mansion was warded with spells and traps as well as guards living and dead. He had been expecting a visitor but had done little to relax his protections save de-activating some of his most singular defences. His guest possessed the skill to reach him with little trouble, but he wanted to keep his privacy as well as retain a few surprises if this knife ever turned against him.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, you have always had good taste.” Nystyre smiled, pushing a small bag towards the newcomer. She was dressed for work, armor, daggers and other implements of her craft rested in their appropriate places. He had always admired her professional attitude even if her adherence to platinum bordered on a mania.<br>
<br>
The female carefully opened the bag. Inside was a single platinum earring, the mate to the one that had been delivered to her quarters the night before. They were exquisite in craftsmanship, not flashy, not gaudy, classic in their workmanship.<br>
<br>
“As do you, how may I be of service?”<br>
<br>
“No doubt you have heard of the feud that has erupted between the Fire Hags and the Truth Finders.” Nystyre waited a moment, hoping that his guest would share what she knew of this matter, someone with her skills would be highly sought after by both sides. When she did not react he continued, “I met house Jindurn’Plynnar last night.” That caught her attention.<br>
<br>
“Really, what did you think of them?”<br>
<br>
“Lets say I was impressed by what I saw, obviously someone is playing the game of houses very well.”<br>
<br>
“Someone new?” She asked, sliding closer to Nystyre, she smelled of jasmine and leather, a heady combination.<br>
<br>
“That’s what everyone is saying.”<br>
<br>
“You don’t pay me to find out what everyone is saying.” She replied petulantly, sticking out her lower lip in a very attractive pout.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, I think it is not a new player, but a very old one. Find me this missing house.”<br>
<br>
With a giggle Kyri Velkyn disappeared into the shadows, leaving the scent of jasmine and leather.<br>

Apparently a pair of disembodied hands had skinned Zalindra Chath’elg’Caress’ face off. They had also escaped, along with the face in the confusion. Kyri had seen some very strange things in her time, talking rat and fleas being some of the most recent, but this was something new.<br>
<br>
Her sources were full of gossip, however when it came to determining who had sent the hands and set them to their task. She was not discounting House D’Vir as a potential candidate, it would not be the first time she had been hired to detect and deal with any stray threads that might unravel a complicated plot.<br>
<br>
This lack of concrete information forced her to take a more direct hand in the investigation. She scouted the Chath’elg’Caress mansion. It was locked down tight, as tight as a second teir house playing at first teir politics could make it. Entering House D’Vir unasked would be a challenge. The Fire Hags were simply amusing.<br>
<br>
She ghosted across the street and slipped up the wall soundlessly, there were complex wards on the window, but they were new, easily detected and avoided. In a moment she was in the room.<br>
<br>
Blood still clotted the sheets, turning the pillows and blankets into a jagged sea of congealed scarlet. Kyri expanded her awareness, a old trick, which enabled her to take in every detail of the room, literally drinking in the details. After a moment she located what she sought. Nestled in the sheets was a strip of desiccated flesh. Silent as a shadow she coasted over to the bed.<br>
<br>
Paranoia from a hundred capers however, prevented her from simply snatching up the skin. It saved her life. The bed was laden with wards and alarms. It was an intricate net designed to snare the unwary, the skin was genuine, however. She chuckled to herself when she realized that not all of the spells belonged to Chath’elg’Caress. It only took a deceptively simple flick of her fingers to snatch the prize and disappear.<br>
<br>
“I have need of a necromancer!” Kyri announced as she entered the hall of the League of Shadows. Several members of the league were in residence at the time and  it was not long before she stood before Maladominus’ quarters.<br>
<br>
“What do you want?” Maladominus the gnome necromancer looked terrible, even for a gnome necromancer. He had taken the apparent death of  his protégé in the Plane of Disease hard and had not returned to Qeynos as was his habit in some time.<br>
<br>
“I would like you to tell me something about this.” Kyri replied, handing the gnome the bit of dessicated flesh, while scanning the contents of Mal’s room, cataloging potential hiding places and the location of valuables, strictly out of habit.<br>
<br>
“Its dead.”<br>
<br>
“Ok, how about you tell me something I don’t know.”<br>
<br>
“It’s from the hand of a Teir’Dal.”<br>
<br>
Kyri raised an eyebrow at the disheveled gnome.<br>
<br>
The gnome’s eyes glowed for a moment with cold fire. “It is an old corpse, recently animated, there is a lot of power in this fragment. Despite the power of the spell it is of limited use since the caster would have to concentrate continuously to make the hand do his bidding.” <br>
<br>
He paused for a moment. “Why are you interested in something like this?”<br>
<br>
“I am doing a favor for someone.”<br>
<br>
“Well if you really want to study animated hands, I would suggest a trip to Unrest, Mistmoore or possibly Lower Guk.<br>
<br>
“There is no profit in such a journey, can you tell me who cast the spell?”<br>
<br>
“No, but I can direct you to where the rest of this particular hand is.” He waddled over towards his worktable, he was never one to totally abandon a successful cover and as an apothecary he was regularly involved in both tinkering and potion making.<br>
<br>
He took the bit of flesh and dropped it into a beaker, added some components Kyri shuddered to think about and cast a short spell.<br>
<br>
After a moment he handed a potion vial to her. “Drink this soon, it will attune your senses to the location of the hand that this strip came from.”<br>
<br>
“Thanks.”<br>
<br>
“Lets see if you are still thankful after you drink the potion.” Maladominus cackled closing the door.<br>
<br>
Deciding there was little point in dragging the noxious potion around, she popped the cap and drank it down. She had swallowed worse, surely at some point in her life she had swallowed something that tasted worse than this…<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was busy. Even with the assistance of his mother preparing the flesh mask was a difficult process. As he carefully stitched it into the drying rack he thought of the owner of this face, she had been fair indeed on her ascension day, now that beauty would be preserved forever.<br>
<br>
“What do you intend to do with that?” his mother had asked once Malingrad had left.<br>
<br>
“I don’t really know.” I am sure it will be of use to us some day, at the least as a trophy of the restored Waes’Harventhars.<br>
<br>
That was when his mother had opened the chest again and taken out the rack. The silken support structure was intricate and once the skin was stitched in it looked like a spider web with grinning Teir’Dal maiden’s face in the center. It even appeared to be animated as tiny gusts of wind moved through the shack causing an eyelid to flutter alluringly or the lips to quiver.<br>
<br>
“I am going visit your sister.” Naelaelayle muttered, climbing laboriously out of her chair and shuffling out the door.<br>
Maelgroth rocked back in his chair and regarded the face on the table in front of him. It seemed to smirk back. He knew that tracking the face through magic would be nearly impossible, since the spells cast by the priests would be obliterate any trail as they attempted to heal the wound.<br>
<br>
Kyri felt very ill, and it was not the sort of illness that settled into a single spot and made you miserable. No this was the kind of sickness that gripped your whole body and said ‘Hey, pay attention to me!’ For a moment she was convinced the gnome had poisoned her intentionally, and she was about to return the favor when she felt a presence in her mind. It was like the feeling she got when a guard was watching her.<br>
<br>
She followed the feeling, it led her past the temple, the bank (her temple if she had one) and into the foreign quarter. She stumbled along, swallowing repeatedly. It was as if the potion were trying to work its way out of her body by force. She had her pride, this last part of the trip was made in the shadows. As she came to a seldom frequented part of town, she could hold it in no longer. She vomited noisily, the noxious fluid jetting out of her body, leaving a trail that pointed directly to a non-descript shack.<br>
<br>
“As much as I hate to drink on the job, I think I will make an exception.” Kyri muttered to herself as she reached into her pack and pulled out some kalish. The harsh liquid actually settled her stomach.<br>
<br>
Her mind began to catalog the information, a new player appeared to her. Could it be an outside force was attempting to influence politics in Neriak? Only a few possessed such a subtle hand, the Erudites and Iksar immediately coming to mind. Kyri was hardly a patriot when it came to her home city, but after seeing what happened to the trolls, she was more than ready to personally address any threat to her home. <br>
<br>
“Damn trolls!” An elderly Teir’Dal hissed as she shuffled past the pool of bile. She had come from the shack.<br>
<br>
Kyri let her by, and ghosted up to the small structure. She could sense the presence of another person in the room, the door warden, a battered skeleton half crouched, half slumped in the entryway would not be alerted to her presence.<br>
<br>
She waited for a particularly strong gust of wind to stir the raged curtain that served as a door and slipped inside.<br>
<br>
There she saw Maelgroth, one of the most recent recruits to the League of Shadows. There on the table before him was the missing face.<br>
<br>
She was about to confront the young Necromancer, demand he reveal what he was doing, and if it was a risk to the League, put a stop to it; when she caught sight of a chest out of the corner of her eye.<br>
<br>
The fact that it did not register immediately upon her entry into the room spoke volumes about the wards that protected it. She snuck up on it, this was totally out of place in the foreign quarter, in fact, such an artifact belonged in 3rd gate. This was a House Treasure vault. Her expert eye detected that it had grafted itself to the stone floor of the room. Such chests were semi-sentient and had to be tricked open, they could not be unlocked.<br>
<br>
‘Someone has a secret!’ The assassin mused as she crept closer. Lost treasures were something of a hobby of hers. House politics made the market in antiquities fluid as treasures were kept in vaults for centuries then shared with others as new gifts, bribes or payments.<br>
<br>
One rumor persistent to the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr was the fact that each claimed the other had stolen something of considerable value. It was seen as an insurmountable obstacle to their working together ever again. Recent events had nearly proven the lie to that rumor. As she inspected the chest she mused on what she knew about that feud. There had been other houses involved, Sol’Calar and Vlos’Shannaal had also been blamed at the time. She chuckled to herself, ‘Someone must have been really bad to get four houses to ally against them.’ <br>
<br>
Suddenly the situation was no longer amusing. She recognized the house blazon on the chest. This was the vault of the Waes’Harventhars, a house so steeped in murder, torture and death that mother’s told their children that if they did not behave themselves they would sing for the Waes’Harventhars nearly a century after their fall. <br>
<br>
Kyri rushed out of the shack, pursued by childhood boogeymen, fear drowned avarice and curiosity in a black tide of horror.<br>
<br>

That's impossible. While my own parents had been killed long before they could tell me the tales, my old mentor that took me in afterwards often used such stories to keep us youngsters in line. &quot;If'n ya git caut, da Skin Takers will be a'takin yer hands&quot;  or so he claimed.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And Maelgroth, how does he fit in? With Gray's vanishing I haven't paid as much attention ta the new arrivals as I used ta. Of course the whole Renux deal took some time ta settle too. I think its time for another inspection of the D'Aryth security again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  she thought to herself as her breathing settled down. Pausing briefly to make sure her sudden departure hadn't been noticed by the young League member, the thought that perhaps the chest had been stolen crossed her mind.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No, that wouldn't work- those smart chests would recognize who could and who couldn't use it. If a rogue came in to try and steal it they'd just find his corpse next to the chest the following day.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she realized. Now the question came as to whether she should report back to Nystyre with her discovery. Technically the contract had been fulfilled. But this was a Shadow involved now, things changed a bit.<br>
<br>
  She had always sought out the newcomers to measure the possibility of gaining their alliance in her own quest for self preservation against Gray's plottings. Knowing what she now knew, this Maelgroth might prove useful to her own plans. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course his magics would prove troublesome if their paths went against each other. No better to learn more, the more leverage she had the better. At least better to have some in case the necromancer did side with Gray.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she concluded.<br>
<br>
   Then her thoughts turned to the old woman who had left the shack, Maelgroth hadn't mentioned anything about a mother in her hearing, but she had been busy as well. A grandmother perhaps? In any event she was connected in some way to this. <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Better to follow the old woman, who knows where she might lead me to</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri concluded as she tried to remember the old woman's route. Fortunately the old woman didn't travel too fast and to one who was born and raised in these streets Kyri was quick to find her target and maintain enough distance to observe while not appearing to except to the most paranoid of eyes.<br>
<br>
  The old woman appeared to be in no hurry in her wanderings making her way. Kyri noticed some eyes were indeed following her, the underlings of the Truth Finders- who actually seemed to number quiet a few among her snitches, and truth was purely optional she had found as well. Since she seldom returned to her home city her presence was often noted among the mighty as her reputation had grown a bit through her adventures- let alone the ones the common folk hadn't heard about. The assassin's guild had its own networks after all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guess i should lave a false trail or two then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thoguht as she felt the eyes on her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The old woman won't get too far ahead</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri figured as she made a detour to the bank watching the old woman head to the second gate. Chatting idly with the banker, who for some reason started closing and locking everything in arms reach when he saw her enter, she lingered and took out a few coins. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yes i'm just picking up some pocket change,nothing to see</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she muttered to herself as she left.<br>
<br>
   Picking up the trail again, Kyri was a bit surprised to find the woman move on to the 3rd gate. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What would an old woman from too poor to move out of the foreign quarter be doing here?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri wondered. Now very curious, making sure she still wasn't being followed, even checking for unseen watchers. Kyri moved into the 3rd gate herself.<br>
<br>
  She wasn't exactly a regular here either, at least during the day. But she did have an excuse, one she hadn't really done much with for some time if questioned. In the end her tracking didn't have far to go as the old woman stepped into the great temple to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
  Kyri stopped, not willing to enter the temple of a lesser divinity such as Innoruuk, the priests there recalled her from her youth when she first heard the call of Lord Platinum as she watched these priests demand payment before releasing their scrolls of learning to the younger priests. Naturally she would not be welcome there and might cause a commotion to get her noticed. And notice was a bad thing.<br>
<br>
  Slipping to plan B, she moved past the temple to the Furrier Royale and slipped inside. Now it had been a long time since she had done any tailoring but she still remember the basics. While she had no desire to pick up that trade again, she ordered a few patterns to keep up appearances, and at least it WAS a legitimate reason for her to come to the third gate for any spying eyes to report. <br>
<br>
  The real reason why she came this way was that the owner of the shop was actually an agent of house De'Vir, one to whom she had passed messages back and forth for those times when it wasn't appropriate for her to appear too often at the De'Vir estates. From what she knew, this &quot;tailor&quot; was rather high up in the ranks, chosen for his ability to pass things along and keep quiet. Kyri suspected he had a false tooth with a poison capsule in case of capture.<br>
<br>
  &quot;So will that be all?&quot; the tailor asked packing up the patterns.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes that's all for today, some sewing might help relax me.&quot; Kyri answered sending some coins which hid a small scrap of paper she had hastily scrawled on her way here.<br>
<br>
  Taking the coins and note, while pretending not to see the note, the tailor smiled and said &quot;Well then, enjoy your rest. Perhaps i'll see you again if you need to relax some more.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Smiling back Kyri answered &quot;Yes if i discover i need more patterns to put together i'll defintiely be coming back.&quot;<br>
<br>
   As she left the shop the tailor/agent looked briefly at the hastily scrawled riddle that he would be passing on to Lord De'vir. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Remember what was taken, the boogyman might still live.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>   Well His Lordship might be able to make sense of this gibberish, but i sure don't. But they don't pay me for that.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the tailor mused as Kyri left . Putting the note in among the next batch of dispatches to be delivered the tailor went back to business.<br>
<br>
   Kyri decided since she was so close, to visit the guild halls of the Ebon Mask. She was still amused by the front they maintained as none of the members wore a piercing weapon, rather relying on swords like there were some group of warriors. Disguising one's self to limit your combat effectiveness never seemed prudent to her. The place was a bit more chaotic than usual, the feud of the two houses was certainly good for business it seemed. A lot of the faces here seemed new to her. The young novices she had left now grown into useful members of the Mask. Few equalled her skill now though- including some of her old trainers she noticed. <br>
<br>
   Her business there complete, she stopped to pick up some fishing gear and made her way back to the moat around the temple. The old woman would surely still be there since Kyri's side trips only took a few minutes. In any case Kyri knew where she lived. While frowned upon by the watch usually, some folk sought to fish in the moat around the temple, fed by underground streams to ensure a steady supply of fish. And of course the watch could always be paid to look the other way if the fisher agreed to stay out of the main passageway.<br>
<br>
  Making the appropriate brides Kyri tossed out her line in a spot behind the enterance to the Temple. Far enough away to not be noticed but close enough to be able to see anyone coming or going from the second gate. Not the best fisher around Kyri figured at worst she'd have a couple of fish for supper tonight. nything extra she'd pass along to some urchin to feed whatever den of pickpockets the urchin was from. Greedy she might be, but Kyri did pay her debts and having been taken in by one such group in her own youth she owed those groups a helping hand from time to time.<br>
<br>
  And so Kyri sat back and idly wondered if her first bite would come off the fishing line, or from her intended target.<br>

This place lacked proper security, the sooner he could convince his mother to relocate somewhere else the better. No matter the chest had remained undiscovered for his entire life time, with the family becoming active again the risks of discovery were too high.<br>
<br>
He had to admit though, that no one would think to look for them here, and a cover so laboriously created would perhaps last a bit longer.<br>
<br>
“So was it the wind or something else?” Maelgroth asked the face drying on the rack before him.<br>
<br>
It only fluttered a bit in the last dregs of the wind gust. To the young necromancer it seemed the mask was winking at him.<br>
<br>
The journey to the temple was not one that was enjoyable to Naelaelayle, first there was the pool of vomit, nearly on the family doorstep, then the long hobble through the troll infested foreign quarter, the second gate and finally the temple precinct. When she was a child, she had strode these passageways with pride, the Waes’Harventhar crest proudly displayed on her cloak. Now she shuffled along, careful not to catch the eye of the temple guards, afraid that she would be denied access to the temple.<br>
<br>
Her only real difficulty came when her daughter kept her waiting.<br>
<br>
“Is this a safe place to talk?” Naelaelayle asked, looking around carefully.<br>
<br>
“When will you realize no one cares about your stupid crusade mother!” Blisshadow barked. She hated being reminded of the low status her family had. Her mother coming here and pretending to have real news or knowledge of events worth her notice was tiring. She only saw her mother now because she knew the crone would wait until she was seen. That was worse than seeing the old bat and sending her on her way.<br>
<br>
“You would not say such a thing if you visited your mother more often.”<br>
<br>
“This room is as safe as any in the temple.” Bliss replied. It was true, all rooms were open to the spells of the high priests, but it was rare that they bothered to look. They were too busy spying on each other than to waste time on some mid level church functionary. Bliss had been successful in the church because she was efficient, and not connected to any one family. Sure others had rocketed up the church hierarchy, but few had attained her position from the lower rungs of Teir’Dal society.<br>
<br>
Naelaelayle hissed disdainfully, she recalled the shrine the Waes’Harventhars had raised to Innoruk. The fawning of the priests when house members came calling. To take pride in this bureaucratic position was to be foolish.<br>
<br>
“Your brother went to a party last night.”<br>
<br>
“Good for him, I hope he got lucky.”<br>
<br>
“Your other brother.”<br>
<br>
“And this is of interest to me?” Bliss whined. She had better things to do than listen to this poor information.<br>
<br>
“The party was at the Chath’elg’Caress mansion.”<br>
<br>
Now Blisshadow was paying attention. Several high ranking members of the clergy had attended that affair, it was the talk of the temple.<br>
<br>
“Really, did they hire him to clean up the mess?”<br>
<br>
“He caused the mess.”<br>
<br>
It was as if Cazic himself came down and caressed Bliss’ spine so intense was the fear. Her position, everything she had worked for had been put at risk by her ‘brother’ and her crazy mother. What would happen if word got out that it was her family that was responsible for this war. For a moment she considered killing her mother.<br>
<br>
“Are you crazy! People will find out, we will be punished. How can you be so stupid!”<br>
<br>
Naelaelayle slapped her daughter hard. She had always been the passionate one, the most animated and excitable. Good qualities for a priest of the hate god. She possessed a certain animal cunning as well, but she lacked vision.<br>
<br>
“You will listen to me. You will come when I call. You will obey Maelgroth as if your life depends on it, because it does. If you fail your family in this, I will kill you myself.”<br>
<br>
Never in her entire life had her mother spoken to her in this way. She slapped her in return, the mailed gauntlet striking much harder. The blow knocked her mother to the ground.<br>
<br>
“You will listen to me hag. You will not come here again, you will not play games with other houses because you have no right to. I am going to deal with my ‘brother’.” She cast a quick spell, rooting Naelaelayle to the spot and stormed out of her quarters.<br>
<br>
Bliss marched across the drawbridge that separated the temple from the main road. She thought about kicking the fisherwoman she saw into the moat, but decided it would be too much trouble. She might get her boots dirty.<br>
<br>
It did not take her long to reach her old home. The shack was as she remembered it, the pitiful skeleton crouched in the doorway looked like he had been cleaned recently, white bone glowed dully in the subdued light, really a slap in the face to everyone, it was as if her family attempted to put on airs in a slum by having the most interesting pieces of garbage in the front yard.<br>
<br>
She ripped the rotten curtain off the doorframe and confronted her brother.<br>
<br>
“I hope mother is ok.” Maelgroth greeted his sister.<br>
<br>
“That better not be what I think it is!” Bliss hissed, pointing at the rack on the ramshackle table.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth turned the rack so his sister could see the face. “I still have a way to go before I can match my parent’s in skill.”<br>
<br>
Bliss kicked the table hard, it had never been the most sturdy of furniture but it weighed enough to knock her little brother to the ground. It shattered before it reached him.<br>
<br>
“This is not the time or the place for such behavior.” Maelgroth said calmly, standing up and brushing bits of broken table off his robe.<br>
<br>
Bliss began to cast the same spell she had used on her mother. She was nearly done when she was knocked to the ground from behind. The door warden was attacking her, with more strength and skill than she had thought possible. As a child she had taken delight in kicking the pitiful construct as she left for temple each day. She had nearly destroyed it practicing her earliest spells, it was a joke.<br>
<br>
“Return to your post!” The angry priestess barked.<br>
<br>
The skeleton continued to bludgeon her. Its blows dented her shield, a quick bash of its arm disrupted another spell. Somehow her brother had gotten control of the warden, it should obey her orders.<br>
<br>
“Maelgroth! Call off the warden!”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so. I think you need to learn a lesson in humility sister.” He was enjoying this moment utterly. Bliss had always been mean to him, but in subtle cutting ways, at least with his brother Malingrad you knew when the fight was over. With Bliss the knife was always there.<br>
<br>
“So be it!” The priestess swung her mace wildly at her brother. To be frank she was amazed she connected, combat and spell practice had always taken second place to polishing boots and writing reports for her superiors. The blow caught him in the shoulder and staggered him a bit as his personal wards were dispelled.<br>
<br>
“You hurt me sister. Let me show you what that feels like.” Bliss watched in awe, his hands were a blur so quick was the spell. Her chest blossomed in sudden pain, it was as if  one of the temple wardens had broken  her shoulder. She tried to move her arm, it was broken. The skeleton behind her landed a series of blows, knocking her to her knees. She needed to heal herself before she got hurt too much more.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth waited paitently as his sister began to croak out a desperate prayer for healing. As she neared its conclusion he kicked her in the face. He cast another spell.<br>
<br>
Bliss felt her heart start to beat wildly and irregularly in her chest, her blood burned as if it was on fire, she could not concentrate. She was dying.<br>
<br>
“Will you obey?” Maelgroth asked calmly.<br>
<br>
“Your killing me.” Bliss gasped, she was on her hands and knees now trying to breathe. At some point the skeleton had stopped beating on her, it stood at attention its hands purple with her blood. <br>
<br>
“I don’t believe you have much time.” Maelgroth smiled. It was a cold smile.<br>
<br>
“I am your sister!” <br>
<br>
“No, you are my servant, you will serve the will of the Waes’Harventhars or your face will join my collection.”<br>
<br>
She looked into his eyes. It was as if a mask had been removed. The little brother she had tormented was gone, replaced by the stern face of a stranger. There was no fear or mercy to be found there. She had always believed the tales her mother told were just that stories to pass the time, tales to make the small family feel that they belonged to something more than the shack in the foreign quarter. Now she knew better.<br>
<br>
“I will serve. I understand and I will obey. Master.” Blisshadow gasped, sagging forward to kiss her brother’s foot. Her loyalty to Innoruk had always been one based on convenience. Now she had a new loyalty, one based on necessity. She believed the tales now, all of them, and she was eager to prove her usefulness, after all to fail was to die, either at the hands of her brother or their enemies.<br>
<br>
At a gesture from Maelgroth, the pain stopped.<br>
<br>
“You will apologize to mother, you will show up for dinner and you will do as I say.”<br>
<br>
Bliss began a healing chant.<br>
<br>
“You will not ask Innoruk to heal you of the wounds you suffered today.”<br>
<br>
She stopped the chant, “I understand.” She stood up to go. “Will there be anything else master?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, get a new table, nothing fancy, do it before Mom gets home.”<br>
<br>
She left her old home with a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
Nystyre was not smiling. A servant had brought in the note some time ago. It had taken little effort to figure out the rest of the riddle. The thought of the Waes’Harventhar’s returning was more than a little scary. All the houses had breathed a collective sigh of relief when that house fell. They had shown pity to none in the pursuit of their craft, it was something that Nystyre respected, despite the fact that nearly all the noble houses, including his, had felt their knives at one time or other.<br>
<br>
“I wonder what she knows,” the scion of house D’Vir mused aloud. He was more than a bit annoyed at the brevity of the note, no doubt Kyri had much more information, he would simply have to pay for it.<br>
<br>
He wondered if the talented assassin was aware how valuable this information was. Blackmail had a certain appeal but without knowledge of the strength of the Waes’Harventhars it might be too dangerous. This would be information of interest to the other great houses, but now was not the time to share.<br>
<br>
He looked at the invitation on his desk. He had been wondering how to get the invitation to the Jindurn’Plynnar, now he knew who to send the invitation to, he just didn’t know how. Sending an invitation directly to the Waes’Harventhar’s would be tantamount to revealing his knowledge of their existence. Perhaps there was a way to get the letter delivered without tipping his hand… <br>

His skin was pale so great was his fear. He had found the invitation on the table upon his return from Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
“It has been here for several days, you really should contact your mother more often.” Naelaelayle chuckled. “I must admit my heart nearly stopped when I saw it.”<br>
<br>
“I take it is not Malingrad’s work?” It would be like his brother to play such a prank.<br>
<br>
“He assures me that it was not delivered by him. Bliss has checked the invitation for tracking magics and found none.”<br>
<br>
“Still someone knows where to find us, and can make a pretty good estimation of our strength just by looking around. To be frank I am surprised they bothered to leave it after seeing our mansion.” Maelgroth replied, he had not opened the invitation, it perched on the new table like a hawk about to swoop down on unsuspecting prey.<br>
<br>
“Open it.”<br>
<br>
The letter was the finest elf hide, sealed with black wax bearing the sigil of the D’Vir house, the lidless eye.<br>
<br>
Gingerly, Maelgroth opened the invitation. A single platinum coin rolled out of the corner of the document, to land on the table, it spun about like a tiny metallic whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Mother and son watched it intently, eventually with a dull rattle it stopped its circuit of the table and lay flat. It was an old platinum coin. Maelgroth looked at it carefully, going so far as to poke it with his finger.<br>
<br>
“Well that is unusual.” Naelaelayle picked up the coin, it had been struck a long time ago. In the 552nd year of exile, the very year the Waes’Harventhars had first come to the attention of the queen.<br>
<br>
She waited patiently while her son read and re-read the invitation before sharing this new information.<br>
<br>
They traded items. Maelgroth examining the coin while his mother read the invitation. It brought a tear to her good eye to be receiving something like this again. The language, in the old tongue, was perfect, written in the blood of the very elf whose skin made up the parchment. She grinned at the irony of it all, the Waes’Harventhars had begun their long climb to respectability by crafting these letters. It had been quite the valuable skill, the family talent for flaying was perfected on the hides of slaves procured by the wealthiest families for their invitations, critical information concerning alliances and betrayals passed from the noble houses to the Waes’Harventhars to be written by the heads of the house onto official correspondence.<br>
<br>
It was only a short step from being the trusted scribes of the nobles to becoming court chroniclers to the queen. Elevation to the petty nobility followed soon after. Still it had all begun with letters like these. The craftsmanship of this letter was quite good, their reply would have to be better.<br>
<br>
“My son, this is a task only I can accomplish, you will have to bring me the following items, and find me a safe place to do my work.”  Naelaelayle quivered with excitement and a little fear. It had been so long since the Waes’Harventhars had sent any correspondence to a noble house. She offered a short prayer to the hate god, hoping for the steady hand required to complete the reply.<br>
<br>
“I know of a place, mother, I have been thinking of relocating to it. I believe they will accept your presence as my servant.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
“Well, it is time I fulfilled my true role, where is this place?”<br>
<br>
Maelgroth then told his mother about his alliance with the League of Shadows. <br>
<br>
“They at least are true to the cause, their goals are not in conflict with our goals. I assume none of our enemies are members of this League?”<br>
<br>
“None have bothered to look beyond their own house.”<br>
<br>
“I would not have recommended this path, but now that it presents itself I see the opportunities.”<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was relieved to hear his mother speak this way, it was a major deviation from the plan they had so often discussed over the decades of exile. “I have already made the arrangements, we can continue to use the house to meet, but we should relocate to the mansion of the League, since its in Third Gate we will be better able to keep an eye on our enemies.”<br>
<br>
He looked questioningly at the chest. It had been there all his life.<br>
<br>
“It shall be easier to move than you think, after all, your father and I took it out of our halls the very night of the attack. I shall handle those arrangements. You just get me the components for the reply.” Naelaelayle made excited shooing motions with her hands.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was reading the list carefully. Nearly all the items could be purchased in town. All but the last.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> A live female wood elf, no more than eight years old.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/21/03 5:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> Maelgroth loved the smell of Greater Faydark. It was a dark forest much like his home, it was full of dead elves and confused youngsters. The journey here had been nothing short of harrowing and he truly resented having to hide below decks when the ship had docked at Sister Isle. The journey back would not be as difficult.<br>
<br>
He moved carefully an invisible predator looking for prey. It did not take him long to find it.<br>
<br>
Shantira was playing with her friends. They had traveled farther than they had intended, but even at their tender age they knew enough to keep the Orc scouts at bay and the pixies had learned to flutter away as quickly as possible when they saw the gaggle of Woodelven youths descend from Kelethin.<br>
<br>
The danger of moving out beyond the borders of Keletin proper was intoxicating. The tales of danger and adversity hammered into them by their parents seemed unrealistic and childish. After all they knew better than to get too close to Crushbone where true danger lay.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately a very old danger had come to the Faydark on this day.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was frustrated. He had wanted a high elf, their skin was so perfect, so white and without blemish, but his mother had informed him that particular skin was reserved for royal correspondence. He had been patiently following this gang of brats as they stumbled through the forest. At first he had feared the retaliation of the guardsmen, but he learned from observation they were too intent on the dangers they could see, the wasps, the pixies the orcs.<br>
<br>
This group had slowly moved away from the guardsmen and their platforms, it was time to strike.<br>
<br>
Shantira saw the Teir’Dal appear out of nowhere, at first she thought it was one of her friends playing a joke and she laughed. Her other friends saw it too, they ran screaming into the woods, scattering like a flock of starlings surprised by a hungry cat. She tried to run, but she couldn’t. Fear rooted her to the spot.<br>
<br>
“You will do fine.” Maelgroth said in Teir’Dal. He had acquired a body bag in the Plane of Knowledge particularly for this caper. He stuffed the mesmerized child into the bag and disappeared with a flicker of magic.<br>
<br>
“Whats in the bag?” Poyson asked laconically. She was also a newer recruit into the League of Shadows, though she was a much more accomplished necromancer. She had spotted Maelgroth as he gated back to the League’s headquarters.<br>
<br>
“Something I picked up for an experiment.” Maelgroth huffed, he was tough for a Teir’Dal but his guest was beginning to shake off the effects of the spell.<br>
<br>
“You can find entertainment here in town, you don’t have to go out for it.” Poyson replied, twitching her white robe so it better complimented her charms.<br>
<br>
“Well, I will keep that in mind…” Mael replied hurriedly. He had considered visiting the slave marts, but was afraid house D’Vir would be watching them to see who procured an envelope of the appropriate age. Paranoia was the master of convenience in this case. He hurriedly slung the twitching bag over his shoulder and shuffled off to his quarters in the basement.<br>
<br>
His new quarters would serve him better than he expected. He had learned there was a large suite available in the basement. No one wanted it, mostly because a Shadow Knight of Bertox had held it for her quarters for years. Mael had no idea what to expect when he opened the door. It was surprisingly clean, except for a few lizard scales near the wardrobe. Still he threw everything out, and had servants wash the walls down with boiling water.<br>
<br>
“Look what I have brought you!” Mael shouted as he entered his quarters. The family chest had attatched itself to one of the corners. He heard his mother coughing in the back. He headed towards her position in the small laboratory he inherited, many of the beakers were made in Qeynos and were quite sturdy, but they did lack the delicacy of the work done here in Nektulos. It would suffice.<br>
<br>
He reached into the bag and dragged out the terrified girl.<br>
<br>
“Be glad, for on this day you will aid in our rebirth!” Naelaelayle whispered in elvish.<br>
<br>
Shantria screamed for help. This was her worst nightmare, captured by Teir’Dal. All the childhood tales, cautionary stories really came back to her. The two elves, the young male and the old female laughed uproariously.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth moved to strike her, but was prevented by his mother.<br>
<br>
“You must not bruise the skin. I has been a while and I might need a lot.”<br>
<br>
The elderly Teir’Dal turned to the captive. “If you do as we say, my son will return you to your home.”<br>
<br>
Shantria had heard about Teir’Dal mercy. “My mother is a famous ranger, she will track me down, she will kill both of you.”<br>
<br>
“How nice.” Naelaelayle said distractedly. She was looking for a particular flaying knife, one developed specifically for this kind of work. “Strap her face down on that table.”<br>
<br>
Shantria fought as hard as she could but the Teir’Dal were too strong for her. Soon she was immobile on the table.<br>
<br>
“Let me clarify, I am old, and this will be hard enough to do without you twitching all over the place and ruining my work.” Naelaelayle cut away the back of Shantria’s dress, revealing her unblemished back. “If you are a good girl, you will live and have an interesting story to tell your friends. If you are a bad girl…” She held the knife in front of her like a sword.<br>
<br>
“I will do nothing to help scum like you, when my mother gets here, I will be sure to have her let you live so you can always remember who destroyed your family!” She heard the young one casting a spell, then recalled nothing.<br>
<br>
“I will restore the spell as often as necessary, mother.” Maelgroth growled. The girl was rigid in her bonds, her mouth open in a silent scream.<br>
<br>
“It is a shame we will have to do this work without music.” His mother replied. She removed a tiny skin drying rack from the family chest. Carefully she began to stitch the girl’s back to it. When she was done it lay flat tiny threads reaching from the bone rim into the skin between her shoulders.<br>
<br>
“Hand me the crystal knife and the ink.” Naelaelayle’s voice was taut with stress. This would be the most difficult part. Delicately she began to make tiny incisions into the skin, pulling the freshly cut flap back and then inking the wound. The knife which began the process as clear crystal, absorbed the blood like a sponge, slowly turning a dark pink color.<br>
<br>
The tattoo process took hours, interupted occasionally by the screams of the girl or his mother having to take a break for her aching hands. The work was exacting and after a few characters she would have to stop to keep her fingers from trembling uncontrollably. <br>
<br>
“Now comes the tricky part.” Naelaelayle panted. She tightened the threads on the rack, pulling the girls’ skin taut. Carefully she cut the patch of skin loose from her body. The properties of the knife were such that the flesh did not realize it had been cut. Blood pulsed through the patch on the rack, now adorned with the reply of the Waes’Harventhars to house D’Vir.<br>
<br>
Shantria was in agony, the elaborate torture the two elves put her through was terrible. At least the pulling sensation on her back was gone now. She was startled when the young one released her from the table.<br>
<br>
“The spell will last as long as she lives, be sure that she lives long enough for the letter to be delivered.” The old one hissed. She was carefully scraping away at the skin on the rack in front of her. As the crystal blade stroked the hide, Shantria felt a peculiar scraping on her back.<br>
<br>
She turned about in horror, unable to see what had been done to her.<br>
<br>
“You wish to see?” Maelgroth said eagerly. He held up a mirror.<br>
<br>
Shantria saw her back, it was missing a patch of skin about four inches square, the skin was just gone, exposing the bone and the flesh underneath. She knew she should be crazy from the pain, but instead all she felt was the pricking on her back, in time with the work the old Teir’Dal was doing with the rack.<br>
<br>
“What have you done to me!”<br>
<br>
“You are a note, isn’t that special!” the old one enthused, turning the rack so she could see the writing on the patch of skin. Her skin.<br>
<br>
“Well that makes this next part easier.” Maelgroth said, stuffing the unconscious girl back into the sack, she had fainted on seeing the RSVP.<br>
<br>
“Remember if she dies, the note is ruined.”<br>
<br>
“I have already taken care of the details. She will be found by some of the lightbringers who hunt the guards in the forest.” Maelgroth replied, cloaking himself and shadow and shuffling out of the room.<br>
<br>
The next day a package was delivered to House D’Vir. It caused quite a stir. It was, however, delivered to Nystyre unopened. He could tell just by looking at it, what house had sent this reply. Carefully he picked up the note. Other houses had sent theirs, occasionally accompanied by small gifts, written on parchment, vellum and rarely tanned wood elf skin. This one stood out from all the others. It was still warm to the touch. <br>

No companion joined her back, the only odd part of the watch was the fuming priestess came out of the temple, of course angry priests and priestesses SHOULD be coming out of the temple if they were worshipping properly. No that wasn't the odd part, the odd part was when a short time later the priestess stumbled back to the temple, obviously in pain but not using her healing arts to ease her pain.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Must be some Inny iniatiation thing i suppose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused while she waited for the old woman. Eventually the old woman had left and seemed a bit more pleased with herself for whatever reason. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She heard something she liked it seems like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But nothing i'll learn about here.<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   Not expecting anything to occur, Kyri kept track of the woman until she came back to the shack, which Maelgroth still inhabited. Staying out of sight, Kyri figured she's listen for a bit then go report to D'Vir.<br>
<br>
   &quot;So my sister will be joining us for dinner tonight after all mother?&quot; Maelgroth asked as his mother came in.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes son she is. in no small thanks to you I would think, she thought to challenge your power didn't she?&quot; Naelaelayle asked and at her son's nod she continued looking at the new table now sitting in the shack, &quot;And you bent her to your will didn't you my son?&quot; At Maelgroth's brief smile the old women laughed.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah I am sure you waited for that day to happen for some time now. She was not happy at having to come back to the Temple and bruised and battered and have to make excuses as to why she did not heal herself. Yes son she told me, was not pleased with the idea but she will obey.&quot; Naelaelayle told her son. &quot;But if she is to be joining us for dinner then I shall have to get to it then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Listening to the old woman wander off into the kitchen, Kyri knew she had another piece of the puzzle, the battered priestess was actually the old woman's daughter- and sister to Maelgroth. A power struggle of some sort had obviously taken place between the siblings and maelgrowth seemed to have come out on top.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Back to D'vir then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought. Also what to tell him. With Maelgroth's involvement, in a more growing role it seems, things got complicated. Rather than a simple identitfy and get paid, she now had to decide whether to turn in one who walked the Shadows halls with her. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course if this was Gray we were talking about there would be no problem at all. Heck I might even give D'vir a discounted price for THAT job. But this is different. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she went back to the League halls to change into something more suitable for her employer's presence.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What to tell D'vir- I already sent word i learned something. How much do i tell him to keep him happy while i decide what to do for sure. Obviously these folk won't be able to pay more for my silence. Still a servant of the Dead beholden to me is something not to be tossed aside idly. Besides no doubt this is what Gray would hope I do, turn against a Shadow so he can banish me from the halls and have the rest of the League come hunt me down after betraying one of my own. I'd never find any allies to aid me against him if I go through with this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>NO Gray won't win that easily!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided aburptly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I'll keep D'vir curious for now, but now to find someone to pin this on instead. Misdirection always works best. Just need a victim so D'vir doesn't decide to come after ME for this. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   Chaning into the same leathers she wore at their first meeting Kyri made her way towards D'Vir's estates. She always knew when she was expected, the guard's patrols grew markedly predictable. Gaps unnoticable to the common eye yet huge gaping holes to those in the know of such things openned in their lines and soon enough she found herself inside the D'vir study and sure enough Nystyre D'Vir sat at his work. She was not decieved by his apparent inattention- she had made just enough noise entering to let him know she was there so it came to no surprise when, without looking up, Nystyre D'Vir asked, &quot;So you have learned something?&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;What no hello?&quot; Kyri asked glibly- she enjoyed trying to toss these serious folk off their game, Anson's reactions especially made her smile. <br>
<br>
   &quot;Spare me your humor. &quot; D'Vir asked unaffected, &quot;You pass a cryptic note about the return of the Waes'Haventhar and then leave me waiting all day before further contact? I am not amused.&quot;<br>
<br>
    &quot;If I had anything of use to speak of then, I would have came then. I sent word so you could be aware of what may be happenning.&quot; Kyri replied all business, &quot;I have nothing concrete to prove it one way or the other- only a glimpse of their symbol on a chest in a shack. Thinking that most of their artifacts had been destroyed when the house fell,it seemed to make sense that someone got missed to bring it along with them.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;And why is it so odd to see some chest, perhaps it was merely looted and kept as a prize by some house. I expected better of you Velkyn.&quot; D'Vir asked.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Because this chest was 'alive' for lack of a better term. It was a soulbound chest of a great house, you know the type- can fuse itself into whatever location it wished by magic. Could only be openned by either someone of the house or one of a handful trusted enough to be given the secret words by the ruler of the house that they may protect it in case of fire or some other emergency while a trueblood was away or injured. It can't be picked open, and people who try tend to die nasty deaths. So either we have a true member of the house or some high ranking servant of the house who was missed.&quot; Kyri replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah, I misjudged you it seems,&quot; D'vir replied, &quot;And where is this chest at now?&quot; <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>OK here we go</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought before replying. &quot;I saw it in some shack in the foreign quarter, the building was abandoned by the look of it so where its kept there long or not i'm not certain. I went back later and it was gone, a third time and it was back again. Some sort of temporary hideout i'm guessing for this person. I tried tailing some people who were seen nearby but nothing turned up. Never actually saw the person moving the chest around but they can't be from around there. I mean what noble would even think about living with trolls?&quot; Kyri finished with a laugh hoping this mismash of truth and lies would be swallowed. That's the key with a lie, be sure to have enough truth mixed in in case you get called on it, and toss in just enough of a lie to keep your victim off target.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Perhaps.&quot; Nystyre mused, idly fingering a sealed document in his hands. &quot;Well at least we know of one possible meeting place for these Waes'Harventhar remnants. That being the case, perhaps you could deliver this inivitation to this spot. If they do visit irregularly, I am certain the guest to my party will recieve it in time.&quot; he finished tossing the note at Kyri.<br>
<br>
  &quot;A party?&quot; Kyri asked with a smile, &quot;Filled with lots of rich nobles?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes it is and no you can't come!&quot; Nystyre declared knowing what sort of chaos Kyri could cause at such a function.<br>
<br>
  &quot;But I'd ONLY think of coming along to help Nystyre,&quot; Kyri cooed, &quot;after all it would be MUCH more helpful if i could see this person who has your attention. After all he DOES seem to be tied in to this Waes'Harventhar business somehow and things would be MUCH easier if I knew who i was looking for. Besides,&quot; Kyri added &quot;I PROMISE i won't take anything from people of your house, anyone else is fair game though.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Eyeing Kyri cautiously, D'vir answered &quot;There is some merit to the idea of having you and this 'Jindurn'Plynnar ' at the same function. Perhaps you might be able to find him more easily having contact with the fellow. Be assured I will be holding you to your word- if even one coin is found missing from my house after this...&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Don't worry i always keep my promises.&quot; Kyri assured him.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Very well then, having you among the servants that...&quot; D'Vir stopped as Kyri raised her hand in a negating gesture.<br>
<br>
  &quot;No no, a servant would not have the kind of access I'd need for this. &quot; Kyri interrupted before smiling brightly, &quot;However, isn't this a fine time to reintroduce your long forgotten neice from a very junior branch of the family, left in the Faydark to fend for themselves after so many years. Yes uncle, this party would be a fine time for everyone to meet your favorite neice Vynna K'yari.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps you're right,&quot; D'Vir agreed, then stopped suddenly looking up only to find Kyri was no longer there. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Where in Innoruuk's name did she come up with THAT name!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Nystyre wondered. After all the last members of House K'yari were killed about 25 years ago by some light bringers. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just a coincidence i'm sure.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> D'vir concluded, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>after all, Kyri couldn';t have been more than an infant if she was even born then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  That night, as an old woman slept, a guardian was slipped past and an invitation to a party was placed on a new table. A killer slipped back into the night and toawrds her quarters- again the odd question of &quot;what to wear to a party&quot; crossing her mind.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanare>Tanare</A> at: 3/24/03 8:59:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/03 5:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> “How goes the war brother?” Maelgroth asked Malingrad. The assassin was wearing new armor, ravenscale from the swamp, he was sure if the shack had a mirror he would be preening in it. <br>
<br>
“It is most profitable.” Malingrad reached into his pack and brought out a small leather sack. He slid it across the table.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth picked it up and looked inside. Gemstones winked back at him in the dull light of the room. “You have done well indeed.” The necromancer replied giving the pouch over to his mother. He knew she would be placing it in the family vault upon their return to the League Mansion. He got a bit of amusement at seeing the momentary flash of emotion rush through his brother. <br>
<br>
First there was his usual smug satisfaction when he handed over the pouch, then surprise as it was given to his mother for safekeeping, this emotion was followed by anger, when he realized he would not be getting his reward back. Finally fear washed away anger. Tithing was something all house members did. This was the first time he had ever contributed something personal to house Waes’Harventhar. He got a curious sense of satisfaction from it.<br>
<br>
“Where is Bliss?” Malingrad had heard about the run in his sister and younger brother had. <br>
<br>
“She is on an errand for us. Something in second gate.” Naelaelayle growled.<br>
<br>
Malingrad looked at his mother carefully, he had hoped to see her open the chest that had squatted in the corner of their shack for years, and perhaps get a peek at what lay inside. He had tried to open the chest once as a young rogue, he still had nightmares about the pain. Now the chest was gone. He had the good grace not to ask about it.<br>
<br>
“You have something for me to do?” Malingrad asked carefully. He still had an assignment to carry out for the Ragar’Golhyrr. It would be an easy one. He had already discussed the details with some of the other assasins involved in the house war. It really was laughable how these houses thought they controlled affairs. Both had contracted outsiders to do much of their dirty work and those they contracted with had already planned out who would die and when. The Ebon Mask pulled the strings of the houses now. Their destinies lay in the palm of the Rogue’s House. It had already been decided that the Ragar’Golhyrr would win this war since they paid better.<br>
<br>
“It shall be a small matter.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
Malingrad was beginning to learn about his brother’s sense of humor. It was as if someone entirely new inhabited the shell he had grown up with.<br>
<br>
“Speak the words and you will shall be done.” Malingrad replied in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
“We have been discovered, you are responsible for our security. Find out who knows and report back. Take no actions on your own.” Mael replied. He watched his brother turn pale with fear.<br>
<br>
Mal was afraid. He had two very good reasons, the first being that if an enemy house knew of the Waes’Harventhars their lives were in danger. The second was that he was ultimately responsible for the security of the house. It was his fault. His brother could order his death by torture.<br>
<br>
“The invitation.” The assassin was kicking himself, he had not taken its arrival seriously. He had always been better at planning offensive action than defensive. He realized he had not even asked to see the note. Suddenly he felt foolish and alone. He had placed his family in danger because of his interest in personal gain.<br>
<br>
“Exactly.” Naelaelayle replied. She was angry that her son had not put the information concerning the letter together on his own. It pleased her to see he was at least aware of the enormity of his failure.<br>
<br>
“May I see it?” Malingrad asked using the old tongue, using the most formal and submissive of tenses.<br>
<br>
“Pay particular attention to the coin that accompanied the invitation.” Maelgroth said handing the letter over.<br>
<br>
“None of the others were accompanied by such a trinket?” The date on the coin stood out. Such coins were scarce in Neriak, it would not be too difficult to find out who might have a supply of such old currency. Of course it could have come from a collector, or the vault of an old house.<br>
<br>
“I take it you have taken steps to protect yourselves?”<br>
<br>
“We have removed the vault and ourselves to a new location.” Naelaelayle replied. Nothing else would be shared with Malingrad until he redeemed himself.<br>
<br>
“House D’Vir knows some but not all.” Malingrad mused.<br>
<br>
“Now you begin to think.” Naelaelayle chuckled. Maelgroth was silent.<br>
<br>
“A third party, who left the coin knows our identity.” The assassin continued.<br>
<br>
“Now that you have caught up to the rest of us, find out who, how, and what they know.” Maelgroth ordered.<br>
<br>
Blisshadow stood outside the gates of house House Vlos’Shannaal (the Blood Chalice). The building bore all the marks of a shrine to Innoruk converted into a House mansion. It was a small house by any standard, but a wealthy one. She knew from her family history that this shrine had once been the property of the Waes’Harventhars, a showcase for their wealth and loyalty to the Maker. <br>
<br>
This building should have been hers, now their enemies slept in rooms meant for worship and danced where they should kneel. A cold but certain fire of hatred burned in her heart, and she knew that what she did, was with the tacit blessing of the god. Never had she felt so close to him, not when she had transcribed hymns, and written reports, not when she had groveled before her superiors, not once had she felt the sure touch of her god, but now that she embraced her family, she felt the strength of her faith growing. Innoruk was near and he whispered his will in her ear.<br>
<br>
“I seek entry into the house.” Bliss shouted. Inside she could her raucous music.<br>
<br>
The door burst open as two drunken Teir’Dal stumbled out. Their tongues stained a dark black from the wine they were besotted with. It took a moment for her to realize that these elves were the guards.<br>
<br>
“Why you wanna enter?” the first guard leered at her skeptically. He was sloppy drunk, and swayed on his feet.<br>
<br>
“This house has not paid their tithe to the church.” Bliss replied. It was true, in fact practically none of the houses paid tithe to the church anymore. It was a tradition that had lapsed out of favor. Indeed the Vlos’Shannaal had begun their rise to prominence as cup bearers during church ritual. That role had slowly moved from one of serving the church to serving themselves. All the great houses had shrines of their own, or had them at one time, they were a good place to send lower ranking family members. Over time many shrines became petty houses in their own right.<br>
<br>
“Well, you are welcome to come in and state your case to our Matron.” The other guard burped, gesturing for her to enter.<br>
<br>
The Vlos’Shannaal (Blood Chalice) might be their name, but the Xuil’Z’hindar (Wine Trippers) might be more apt a description. Security was totally lacking as she stepped over passed out house members and their insolent slaves. No one asked her why she was there, though a few made half hearted attempts to lure her into their rooms. When she asked where the matron might be found she was usually greeted with blank stares followed by a pointing finger up stairs.<br>
<br>
No doubt this house curried favor with others through entertainment and the occasional bit of blackmail. At last she found the door she sought. She knocked loudly.<br>
<br>
“Come in, and bring some more wine!” came a giggling voice.<br>
<br>
Bliss opened the door, inside the sanctuary, the most holy place in the shrine lay the quarters of the Matron of house Vlos’Shannaal. It was a disgrace. The holy chalice, a relic from the earliest days of the Teir’Dal lay upon the floor, a discarded drinking vessel, still holding the dregs of some wine, instead of the clotted blood of their enemies.<br>
<br>
“You are in violation of church law!”<br>
<br>
“Sure, sure, I will tell you what, when you can get the Chath’elg’Caress, the Ragar’Golhyrr and the Sol’Calar to pay your tithe then we shall do so, and gladly.” The matron laughed.<br>
<br>
“Very well, I shall have to post a notice of your delinquency.” Bliss said.<br>
<br>
“Post it where you will, we use them as toilet paper.”<br>
<br>
In reality, the notice had little power of its own. It simply stated that the house was not in the good graces of the church and was not under its protection. The church had never offered protection to any house at the detriment of any other, it could not act in such a manner without loosing its tenuous position of authority. As it was, the church had given up on even posting the notices, since they had become something of a joke, as houses flaunted the will of the church willfully collecting the postings.<br>
<br>
Bliss was eager to leave that den of foolishness. She had carefully tacked up the notice next to the front door, though she had her doubts it would be there for long.<br>
<br>
“It is done, master.” Bliss announced when she returned to the shack. It was quite nice, actually to come home and see her family seated around the new table she had bought. Malingrad looked like he had swallowed a tadpole though.<br>
<br>
“I take it security was lax?” Maelgroth asked.<br>
<br>
“It was non existent.”<br>
<br>
“We have acted indirectly with the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr, now we act together as a true house. We will enforce the writ of Innoruk on the Vlos’Shannaal.” Maelgroth laughed.<br>
<br>
“No one has enforced those writs for centuries.” Malingrad chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Exactly. They won’t be expecting it, and house Waes’Harventhar is within its rights to enforce payment of the writ if they so wish.”<br>
<br>
“When was the last time they paid tithe?” Maelgroth snickered.<br>
<br>
“I checked the records, they have never paid tithe, and they took possession of the shrine unlawfully.” Bliss replied.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean, unlawfully?” Malingrad asked.<br>
<br>
“Lands once given to the church always remain in the church’s hands. They cannot be passed from house to house.” Bliss replied.<br>
<br>
“So, you are saying they have stolen this land from the church?” the assassin whispered.<br>
<br>
“Indeed.”<br>
<br>
“What’s the penalty for stealing from the church.” Malingrad mused, already aware of the answer.<br>
<br>
“Death…”<br>

Malingrad simply entered the house with a wink and a nod to the drunken guards, Maelgroth cloaked himself in shadows and followed at his heels. Both crept upstairs to the matron’s quarters. There they waited for Blisshadow.<br>
<br>
“I have been informed, that I may have been a bit hasty in posting the writ.” Bliss explained to the guards, shuffling nervously, and using a lifetime of experience gained in bootlicking at the temple to add life to her role. “I have come to apologize to your matron.”<br>
<br>
The guards laughed cruelly. As she shuffled in one rudely slapped her bottom like a common harlot. She marked that one for a particularly painful death.<br>
<br>
Their mother was busy tying up loose ends. During the night they had accounted for nearly all members of the Vlos’Shannaal. There were only a few unaccounted for and she had a good idea where to find them. There would be no mistakes made on this night.<br>
<br>
As before, Bliss was allowed to wander freely through the house. She went directly to the matron’s quarters. She felt the presence of her brothers in the hallway though they remained invisible. She knocked softly, knowing such a timid knock was more likely to gather the ire of her target.<br>
<br>
The door jerked open abruptly. The house matron swayed in the doorway, her bloodshot eyes took in the apologetic cleric standing before her. “So you have come back to beg for forgiveness eh?” Her smile was cruel as she motioned for Bliss to follow her into the room.<br>
<br>
“I did not understand your position.” Bliss began.<br>
<br>
“Of course you didn’t, what would a church bureaucrat know about real power!” The matron slapped Bliss. “We have connections to all the families of Neriak, our position is secure, none would dare challenge us.”<br>
<br>
“You mean you can blackmail and threaten.” Bliss cringed.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, what would a houseless nothing know of influence.” The matron crowed. “To attack us it to see your own name dragged through the muck of the street.” She turned and sauntered over to the bed. “Some houses possess the power to kill others through might, we can do worse than litter the street with corpses, we can destroy the reputation of any house that dares challenge our position, and we all know that reputation is more important than life.&quot;<br>
<br>
“I just want you to know…” Bliss began but was interrupted by the ranting of the house matron.<br>
<br>
“You want me to know that you are sorry you ever bothered to come here and attempt to squeeze platinum from the Vlos’Shannaal. You want to say that your superiors have reprimanded you and that you are at my disposal for as long as I like, in atonement for your transgressions. Isn’t that right little one?”<br>
<br>
“I want you to know that house Waes’Harventar sends its warmest regards, and thanks you for the opportunity to gather the blessing of the church.”<br>
<br>
The matron could hear her heart beating so intense was the quiet. Her parents had warned her that this day could come, had urged her to stay vigilant, but there was always a party to organize, a minor noble to compromise, she had ceased to fear as her files filled with juicy bits of information coaxed out between the groans and pants of those who frequented her house. No active house would dare move against the Vlos’Shannaal, it was true, the risk was too great. But a dead house, that was something else entirely, she had no protection from the dead.<br>
<br>
“Let me…” She began, pleading desperately, only to be interrupted by a brutal slap.<br>
<br>
“You want me to listen as you beg for your life. I have no interest in the wind of a harlot. I am interested in your blood. It is time the Blood Chalice was put to its proper use.” Bliss bent down and picked up the chalice, it was warm in her hand, eager to be filled.<br>
<br>
The matron saw her opportunity, she had not risen to the top of her house on her charms alone. Her right hand crept down to the bracer on her left wrist, she kept a knife there, small and dusted with deadly poison. The blade was not there.<br>
<br>
As she drew in a breath to scream for help a solid blow to her back knocked her to her knees. Strong hands gripped her arms, pulling them behind her. A quick spell from the cleric rooted her to the spot, unable to move. <br>
<br>
“Hold the cup steady.” Came a harsh voice behind her.<br>
<br>
A young Teir’Dal strode into her field of view. All thoughts of resistance fled. Raw fear numbed her mind.<br>
<br>
“It’s a shame you won’t be able to sing for us pretty one, but I am sure we will find some in your house up to the challenge.” He said. The knife caressed her throat, blood splurted wildly, painting the walls, the floor and the chalice, which began to glow with a vibrant purple aura. The matron’s last thoughts were ‘what a pretty color.’ As her soul was claimed by the god of hate, the first in a long series of sacrifices that night.<br>
<br>
The Waes’Harventhars had planned well. Nearly all the house members were too drunk or exhausted from other activites to resist. And so it was that the Vlos’Shannaal from the greatest to the least went under the knife. Those that attempted to flee found the gate guards dead at the hands of a skeletal minion which fought with a skill and toughness out of proportion to that normally displayed by constructs of this sort. Thanks to the enchantments of Cora and Ephantasy. <br>
<br>
As the slaughter continued passers by began to gather to listen to the screams and cries that came from the old shrine. Blood flowed out from under the door and glistened wetly on the window panes, a dark rain was falling on the house Vlos’Shannaal.<br>
<br>
By midmorning the blood harvest was over. All three were drenched, it matted their hair, skin and clothes making them stiff. The chalice hummed with energy, it had been nearly a century since it had been put to its proper use. A purple aura surrounded the chalice and the young cleric.<br>
<br>
“Have you found the documents?” Maelgroth asked his brother.<br>
<br>
“It was difficult to find and disarm the traps, but we have the heart of this house.” Malingrad gestured to an ornate wooden chest which held hundreds of scrolls, inside lay the secrets of many houses. Malingrad was relieved that the Vlos’Shannaal had not invested in a true vault like the Waes’Harventhars it had taken nearly all his skill to simply find the chest, he put it down to the blessing of Innoruuk that he had not died to any of the myriad traps that riddled it.<br>
<br>
“What now?” Bliss sighed, the energy the chalice was giving out was intoxicating. The god was very pleased by this sacrifice.<br>
<br>
“With these documents we could set ourselves up in their place!” Malingrad shouted. He was eager to begin to root through the documents, desperate to confirm rumors heard in the mess hall of the Ebon Mask.<br>
<br>
“We could indeed, but we would have to use some if this information to let all the houses know we possess it. If we did not, they would move against us, hoping to claim this information themselves. We need allies, not enemies. We shall not build our house on paper.” Maelgroth replied, tossing a torch into the chest. The fire greedily devoured the documents.<br>
<br>
“Give this to the chief priests.” Maelgroth handed a note to Blisshadow. “And return the chalice to its proper home.”<br>
<br>

Blisshadow exited the Vlos’Shannaal manse alone. Her brothers remaining behind to discourage looting and to root out any additional members who might have been missed in the initial sweep of the house. As she walked down the black marble steps the small crowd of passersby parted before her. It was the first time in her life anyone had actually shown her respect and she liked it.<br>
<br>
She began her walk to the temple, holding the brimming Blood Chalice before her with both hands. Energy pulsed in the air, radiating from the bloody cup, causing her hair to crackle as she walked. Most of the crowd followed her, being curious to see what would happen next. She could hear the spectators speculating on what had happened in the dark mansion they were leaving behind. She ignored any questions directed towards herself.<br>
<br>
The guard over the moat at the temple had been doubled at the approach of the crowd, when they saw Blisshadow and the chalice they too stepped aside and allowed her to enter unhindered. The crowd they stopped.<br>
The stir her arrival caused at the temple was remarkable. She strode directly to the high altar of the god of hate and placed the chalice in its proper place. As she did so an intense shriek rose from the bloody cup as the souls of the Vlos’Shannal were devoured by the god. <br>
<br>
“Well done.” High priest Valben growled. He was annoyed that he had not been privy to this action, and was angry that he had not been the one to take credit with the god for the sacrifice.<br>
<br>
Bliss was startled out of her ecstatic state by the priest’s voice.<br>
<br>
“I can only assume you are acting at the request of one of the great houses?” He continued. Why they had chosen a nobody to carry out their vendetta against the Vlos’Shannaal instead of someone of importance like himself was a mystery. He had his own score to settle with that house as he was sure most of the powerful did.<br>
<br>
She handed him the packet her brother had given her.<br>
<br>
“So your time with the god has struck you mute, eh, if only that were the case more often.” Valben chuckled as he took the packet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That which was once given freely to the god and taken away by the godless has been returned. We would truly appreciate your promotion of this most excellent cleric to the position of priestess in charge of the restored shrine to Innoruuk.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
That was all there was to the note. He looked questioningly back at the priestess. She was busy with her backpack, totally oblivious to his impatience. He had no doubt now that she was the bastard daughter of some noble house looking to find a place for its byblows, their wishes would be accommodated.<br>
<br>
“I am to promote you to priestess and place you in charge of the old Vlos’Shannaal shrine. Tell me, to which house do we owe this great gift?”<br>
<br>
“KNOW THIS PRIEST, I AM WELL PLEASED BY THE WORK DONE THIS NIGHT, WASTE NOT THIS OPPORTUNITY!” The voice was the god’s. The priestess collapsed.<br>
<br>
“Yatva! Come here!” The high priest shouted. Already lesser church functionaries were rushing into the nave, called by the voice of the god of hate. The priest needed his pet bureaucrat to set things in order.<br>
<br>
The portly Teir’Dal appeared at his side moments later. “What can I do for you master?”<br>
<br>
“This one is to be promoted and placed in charge of the old Vlos’Shannaal shrine.” He said indicating the fallen cleric. “It is the will of the god.”<br>
<br>
“Of course, I am sure the Vlos’Shannaal will give her a warm welcome.”<br>
<br>
“I am afraid the Blood Chalice are no longer in charge of that shrine, as a matter of fact, let it be known that the same fate will befall any house that refuses the tithe of hate.” Valben picked up the backpack and looked inside<br>
<br>
“What fate is that master? Have the Vlos’Shannaal fallen out of favor?” <br>
<br>
“So it would appear.” Valben replied, upending the pack. A cascade of freshly skinned faces fluttered to the floor like leaves in Nektulos forest.<br>
<br>
Nystyre was sitting in his carriage looking at the outer gate to the temple of Innorruk. It was good to see a return to the old ways. Hammered into the teak gate with bronze nails were the faces of the entire Vlos’Shannaal house from the greatest to the least. It was a display not seen in several centuries. Attendance at ritual had increased ten fold, mostly as the curious went to look at the faces on the gate. House D’Vir had always paid its tithe and he chuckled to himself that what had been considered a waste of money by many in his own house was now seen as a shrewd political ploy.<br>
<br>
The city was aflame with wild rumor about what had really gone on the Vlos’Shannaal shrine, the greatest attention being paid to the destruction of the house vault and the loss of its secrets. That was something that intrigued him the most. Most houses would have attempted to use the power kept in that vault to further their own ends, and earned the hatred of the rest of their peers. Attempts to reconstruct the documents found in the empty house had met with failure, despite revealing that those charred ashes were indeed t he true documents. He for one was glad that information was lost, there were several indiscretions of his youth that were no doubt chronicled there.<br>
<br>
The gossip amused him. After all he knew the truth about the events the night previous. In fact, the truth was there for anyone with an appreciation of history to see. This was not a vendetta over attempted blackmail as so many believed. This act was based on a much older feud, the one that brought the Vlos’Shannaal to prominence. As he looked at the faces fluttering in the breeze he wondered how many recalled that aside from engraving invitations and chronicling the deeds of the great houses, the Waes’Harventhars had also served the church as inquisitors.<br>
<br>
He was certainly looking forward to his niece’s ascension day… <br>

De'vir's reaction to her pseudonyme for the night was a bit odd. Like he had heard something he hadn't expected. In actuality it was nothing more than something that popped into her head from a dream she had once when she first met Anrae. An odd dream it was, perhaps she should look into further one day.<br>
<br>
   Expecting little to happen until the party, Kyri took some time to return to the Temple of Lord Platinum on Luclin to attend to her duties there. It seemed Lord Platinum was pleased with her recent activities as many of his servants fell into her posession during her stay. She returned back to the League estate and was indeed a bit surprised to find the old woman she had followed to the Temple showing up in the League halls in servant's attire, unquestioned by the guards. Of course the woman paid no notice of Kyri when their paths crossed- she never knew she had been followed that other day.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps Maelgroth is wiser than I thought, then again it will be much easier if he is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused. She expected the leaving of the invitation would stir things up, let Maelgroth know someone was suspicious of him and whatever plans he had in mind. Better to shake them up when the plans are in their infancy than to grow accustomed to their false safety when it is just an illusion. Now to bring the old woman to the League halls indeed offered Maelgroth and the woman - no doubt the necromancer's nanny or something like that far better protection from harm than the old shack they were staying in. Even if discovered the defenses of the mansion were far stronger than most in Neriak. Naturally they didn't pose too much trouble for her, but Kyri had her own reasons to know the defenses inside and out.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps I should return to the halls of the Ebon Mask and see just who has been brought in for the latest round of killing. Get an idea of who might be talented enough to break in here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused. Of course the warring houses had come to her with their offers to assassinate one party or another. But such snobbish nobles also tried to cut every corner they could and the offers they had made were insulting at best. At least House De'Vir was wise enough to know that to hire one of the best you had to pay accordingly.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course now i'm planning to lay a false trail for him. Need to make it a good one or my rep might suffer from this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri told herself as she made her ways to the Mask halls. Inside the usual riff raff were up to their old tricks, a bunch of youngsters still learning the basics. A couple who seemed to have survived the first round of training. A few more experienced ones were in quiet conferences with some of the leaders of the Ebon Mask, professional courtesy prevented Kyri from interrupting, folk tends to get upset if they think someone is trying to steal the job they're planning. In this professions such disagreements tended to leave one party dead- so courtesy was recommended.<br>
<br>
   Off to one side she saw someone who's name she never learned who was claimed by a couple to be &quot;on his way up the ranks&quot;. He was wearing some Ravenscale armor, newly gained by the lack of bloodstains,rust and other signs of battle wear and tear. Normally she would dismiss him as another moderately skilled youth but though he was hiding it well this thief seemed a bit nervous about something. Quick darting glances, more than the usual caution when entering this place and some slight fidgiting that only someone else in the profession would notice. Kyri quickly went about her busniess, giving the nervous thief no reason to keep an eye on her. Stopping briefly to the Guildmaster she made her token report before taking a last look around and moving along.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well someone screwed up their job it looks like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself reflecting back on the nervous thief. The guildmasters didn't seem to concerned so obviously it wasn't a guild job that had been botched. In those cases, the failed thief wouldn't be in condition to stand for some time, nevermind fidgit around nervously. Returning to her quarters Kyri decided it would be best to just sit and see what happens next.<br>
<br>
  The next day Kyri was haggling with one of the merchant in the Commons during the early morning hours when she heard a commotion behind her. Turning around she saw a large crowd heading to the third gate. She was about to turn back to the merchant and finish that deal before skimming some profit out of that itightly bunched mob when she saw a familiar face.<br>
<br>
  Leading the mob, bearing some sort of chalice, was the priestess Kyri had seen leave the temple the day she followed the old woman who returned later a beaten mess. Curious now, she ignored the merchant and his trinkets and attached herself to the back of the pack following the priestess. Looking at the clothing of the mob, Kyri sighed to herself as she realized the pockets here wouldn't be worth the effort of picking. No doubt the Copper Demon had a great following among these common folk.<br>
<br>
 As Kyri expected the procession stopped just outside the Temple to Innoruuk in the third gate. Due to her profession Kyri manged to make her way closer to the front of the mob while still keeping a few to shield her from easy view, then listened in to the conversation as if they were speaking of platinum. Of course the god's booming declaration was no doubt heard in Freeport and left no doubt that this priestess would become a force in the church.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So like Inny to bluster and yell, Lord Platinum is much more mellow when delivering his wishes. Then again that must be what Lord Platinum hires Inny for- to do all the yelling and threatening that would interrupt Lord Platinum's counting of his servants in the world.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri reflected as the underpriests all came scrambling out of the temple to help the priestess inside. She was about to turn and leave when the High Priest dumped the contents of the priestess' backpack out, and the skinned faces fluttered to the ground as those nearest to them took several steps back when they realized what they were.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So another connection it seems. The priestess and the skinned faces, just like the one that De'vir brought me in for. Of course the priestess isn't behind this. Not like Inny to take such care when killing. So the question is, is the priestess part of the Waes'Harventhur, an ally of them, or some common lackey</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri pondered. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Then again, in either case she knows something of who is behind all this. She can put names and faces to these people. Do I tell De'vir this, or wait and see?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  As the crowd dispersed, Kyri went along so as to not attact attention to herself as she thought about this new developement. Things were moving faster now, perhaps the party might be too late by then. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well, if De'vir wants to talk to me about this he knows how to contact me.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as she walked off.<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I need the time to come up with something anyway to throw him off the real scent. Of course i'm still at the edges of this as it is. I need to know more. Perhaps its time Maelgroth and I have a little talk about a few things before things get more difficult. Perhaps he'll have some ideas as to who we wish to take the blame for all this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   After all the game of houses was a game Kyri never played being raised on the streets herself. Who ruled, or who outmaneuvered who only interested her in the skill or lack thereof involved in the set up. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So far Maelgroth has proven a clever player indeed, it will be interesting to see what we might accomplish together. Perhaps after this party De'Vir will be holding, so I can see how he handles himself in a social setting we'll have a little chat... After all,its always nice to see a Shadow get ahead in life after all, especially over the blood of one's foes...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided as she returned to the League mansion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/4/03 5:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> <br>
“There is another suitor at the gate master.” Vilkev the door warden announced. Suitors had been arriving all day, this being one of the preliminary functions for Athava’s ascension. <br>
<br>
“Really, how wonderful.” Nystrye muttered sarcastically. He hated this part of the ritual, it seemed every house in Neriak trotted out all their available males, be they in diapers or using a cane, just to gawp at his house and eat his food. The gifts were predictable as were the proposals. Just about everyone knew that Athava had been promised from birth to another house, this was simply more tasteful display and pageantry that masked the vicious infighting that was a part of daily life in Neriak. Still it was nice to have the opportunity to look one’s enemies in the eye for a change. He felt very much like one of his hunting dogs curled up in front of the fire surrounded by yapping puppies that insist on attracting his attention.<br>
<br>
“House Jindrun’Belbol!” Vilkev droned in his most impersonal voice, even though it was a house name he had never uttered in his many years as protocol master of house D’Vir.<br>
<br>
Nystyre smiled, a genuine smile for the first time that afternoon. Jindrun’Belbol indeed, the name translated literally to ‘Face Giver” but most likely meant ‘Gift of Honor’. He had been expecting this guest.<br>
<br>
He surveyed the rest of the gathered houses before turning to greet this guest. All faces were turned towards the marble pillared door, most bore the bored expression he was still struggling to maintain. A few, most notably the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr gaped openly. It was obvious each thought the other had this house in their pay. Both had come to this affair hoping to gain the support of some of the other noble houses in their war. It was bleeding both white, but it was quickly becoming apparent that the Fire Hags were going to loose.<br>
<br>
“It was a pleasure to receive your reply to our invitation.” Nystyre replied formally turning to greet his guest. In fact he had taken to carrying the response tattooed into living elf skin with him everywhere. It was delightfully warm and pliable, very soothing to touch.<br>
<br>
“Please accept this gift of respect from our house.” Jindrun’Belbol replied in the old tongue. He was wearing the same courting mask that had been displayed at the Chath’elg’Caress ascension. The robe was similar, black bristle silk from Kunark, cut in a style similar to that popular today, but an original masterwork from centuries ago. It was a robe fitting for a Teir’Dal noble. He extended a small treantwood box.<br>
<br>
Nystyre took the newcomer’s hand in his and exchanged the gesture of peace after receiving the box. It was time to see what this pup was made of. “We are taking great interest in your activites, Waes’Harventhar.” The last being whispered so only the two of them could hear.<br>
<br>
He had been expecting a reaction, and he got one. The eyes behind the mask suddenly locked onto his own, he sensed the pride that the listener took in the fact that his true name was on the lips of the great houses once again, even if it was in a whisper. There was no fear in this one, only cold determination.<br>
<br>
The greeting ended, house Jindrun’Belbol stode purposefully away, towards the rest of the guests awaiting a moment to present themselves to Athava.<br>
<br>
He opened the box. Inside was a single bronze nail, identical to those affixing the faces of the Vlos’Shannal to the temple doors. Nystyre chuckled softly, here was a valuable gift. <br>
<br>
He looked about for his new “neice” and spotted her in the shadows. Vynna K’yari had not yet been officially presented at court and was something of a mystery to the guests as well. She was absolutely stunning in the silversilk dress and platinum tiara, too bad most of the guests did not seem to notice her. He smiled to himself once again, it was probably for the best that she was hiding from the guests, and he was relieved there appeared to be no place to hide any additional items that might find their way into a pocket or purse.<br>
<br>
Vynna noticed his gaze though, and with a sultry wink in his direction she fluttered off in pursuit of Jindrun’Belbol.<br>
<br>
The newcomer was politely ignoring the stares and questions being put to him by the lesser houses who swarmed about him like flies. The higher status houses ignored him publicly pretending to know who he was and what he was doing, but to her trained senses their hunger for information was palpable.<br>
<br>
The afternoon had begun with little fanfare, her arrival in what she thought was appropriate attire had been easy enough. Vilkev had met her at the door, and immediately directed her upstairs where Nystyre was waiting for her. It was the first time she had ever openly entered the house.<br>
<br>
“Not bad, but as a representative of house D’Vir you will have to do better.” <br>
<br>
Kyri was about to take issue at that comment, why she had stolen oneof the finest gowns in Neriak. That was until she saw the dazzling dress Nystyre held out for her.<br>
<br>
In truth, she had never really had much interest in this world, other than as a source of quick cash from foolish nobles. She found their ritual and formalities boring and incomprehensible. Now she was beginning to appreciate the subtleties of the game and with that appreciation came a fascination with its intricacies. <br>
<br>
“I see you like the dress.”<br>
<br>
“It…its beautiful.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, and we will make you so as well. Try not to torment Vilkev too much over the next few hours, I have other matters to attend to, but I will check in with you as soon as I might.” Nystyre replied, handing her the dress and ordering Vilkev to enter.<br>
<br>
“I understand you are our cousin, freshly returned from Mistmoore?” Vilkev announced. His tone more than told her that he did not believe any of her cover story, but that he would play along. He walked over to her, appraising her much like she examined a fine bit of jewelry before she stole it.<br>
<br>
“A bath, a haircut, another bath and a manicure is in order.” He clapped his hands together at the last and a flock of servants appeared and whisked Kyri away. The next hour was full of the most delicious pampering she had ever received. She appreciated the way the staff kept her naked and busy most of the time, giving her no opportunities to properly case the building or to palm a few valuables. Their behavior was totally un-necessary as Kyri had given her word to behave herself.<br>
<br>
When they were done and Kyri had slithered into her dress. There was a knock on her door.<br>
<br>
“This, goes with the dress, neice.” Nystyre handed her a small box.<br>
<br>
Tentatively she opened it, inside was the most exquisite tiara. She had made a point of laughing at tiara wearing princesses wherever possible, and had stolen quite a few in her time, being amazed at the aftermarket interest in such ridiculous headgear.<br>
<br>
“Let me show you how it goes.” He took the platinum dream and gently placed it on her head.<br>
<br>
She wished, for the first time in a while, that she had a mirror in which to see what she looked like, part of her was terrified that the would break out in laughter, a smaller but increasingly vocal was curious to see if she could measure up to those snooty nobles. Still she had taken to avoiding mirrors after a particularly nasty experience in the Plane of Disease.<br>
<br>
“There is a mirror in the next room if you are interested in seeing what you look like Vynna.”<br>
<br>

She turned to look at an older Teir’Dal matron at her elbow. Mentally she chastised herself for letting her fascination with the platinum tiara impact her focus on the job at hand, observing Maelgroth.<br>
<br>
“Ah, Chath’elg’Caress,” Kyri smiled smartly, secretly glad of Vilkev’s truly boring monolog concerning the houses that would be attending. “I am most sincerely sorry for your daughter’s loss.” It was hard to say the last with a straight face, but it was not the nobles alone who made a lifetime career of deceit. She spoke in the singular as an un-married maiden.<br>
<br>
“You have not yet ascended?” the matron asked, smiling sweetly, yet barely able to hide the hunger behind her eyes. “We should talk, our house has several new bachelors now looking for mates, I am sure a woman of your position would be eager to join a house such as ours.”<br>
<br>
Kyri was amazed at this bald faced plea, the Fire Hags must truly be in desperate straits to make such an open offer. “Patron Nystyre handles my affairs, I am sure he would be eager to hear your proposal.” The smile she returned to this drowning matron was truly chilling, it was one of her favorite smiles, reserved for when she slipped her blade directly into the spine of her enemies. Despite the lack of blood on the floor, it was what she had done. As the matron scuttled off to speak with Maelgroth, she wondered if the Patron of the Chath’elg’Caress yet lived and if she would offer her withered self as a prize to an unknown house to save her family.<br>
<br>
“Jindrun’Belbol is it? I thought you were Jindurn’Plynnar?” the matron of the Chath’elg’Caress whispered a bit too testily, it had been a age since anyone dared to mock her at a public gathering, yet tonight she felt the wolves circling, the attitude of that cousin of the D’Vir’s was just the beginning of the humiliation that was coming, of that she was sure.<br>
<br>
“To some we give, to others we take.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
“Your attitude shows a certain lack of respect, and the mask you wear reveals your shame in your house.” The matron hissed back. She knew enough of the old days to know such words more often than not resulted in duels.<br>
<br>
“We may wear a mask, but it is out of respect to our host, before the end, you will know all there is to know of shame and lack of respect.” The eyes behind the mask were as cold as velium.<br>
<br>
“I have never…!” the matron began, but her cry of outrage was drowned by the cacophony of laughter that bubbled up around her like quicksand. Realizing the night, and probably the house war, was over for her, she collected what little pride she had left and stalked out of the manse.<br>
<br>
“Well said!” a new voice boomed. It belonged to Ayon’daro of the  Ragar’Golhyrr. This evening only served to underscore the power of his house. Sure it was costing them a pretty penny to destroy the fire hags, and there had been a number of assassinations on his side of the war, but it was obvious to all who was going to win.<br>
<br>
“I feel we owe you something of a debt.” He began cautiously. <br>
<br>
“Really?” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
“Well, without that nudge I fear that witch would still be here plotting against my house.” He stuck his hand out to initiate the gesture of peace.<br>
<br>
“Well, it was nothing, and we are sure we will be able to balance the scales between our houses soon.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed, that would be wonderful.” Ayon’daro chortled, the mask was giving him fits, he was almost sure he had met this person before, but without a face to put with a house name he was lost.<br>
<br>
“It will be a most notable day.” The young necromancer replied. He had noticed the stunning Teir’Dal stalking him earlier in the evening. She was a study in contradictions. She walked like a hunter yet had difficulty from time to time fending off the advances of some of the other houses. He felt he had seen her before, it was just the setting that was throwing him off, he was sure of that. As he looked of the Truth Finder’s shoulder at her he realized with a start, she was letting him see her. His eyes flicked over to Nystyre. <br>
<br>
The patron of D’Vir was looking at him with an amused expression. Could it be he was being set up for an alliance with this cousin? The thought terrified him. For all his life the family had concentrated on getting their revenge, and not enough time thinking about what would happen afterwards, he would have to speak with his mother about this. Suddenly he realized he had spent too long at this party.<br>
<br>
He turned his gaze back on the Ragar’Golhyrr, he was blathering on about how powerful his house was and how they were destroying the Chath’elg’Caress.<br>
<br>
“Has your house had any great moments like these? Ayon’daro muttered, he was eager to get as much information from this unknown house as possible.<br>
<br>
“No one has been foolish enough to move against our house for some time.” Maelgroth growled. “What do you think happened to the Vlos’Shannaal?” It was a topic of endless discussion.<br>
<br>
“We think they crossed the wrong house.” He laughed, and swallowed some more wine.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, they did.” Maelgroth laughed with him. “Pardon me, we must pay my respects to Athava.”<br>
<br>
Athava was no beauty, she was a knight of the lodge of the Dead, and Mael had seen her about the temple when he was a student. He was surprised to sense he had eclipsed her in power.<br>
<br>
He initiated the gesture of peace. “You would be more comfortable killing Feir’Dal I believe.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed, I would, I have little patience for such affairs.” She growled, looking scornfully over at her arranged mate, a wispy looking wizard, preening like a drunken aviak in front of a mirror.<br>
<br>
“Well, I am sure you will have him whipped into shape in no time.” Mael grinned. He had heard all about Athava’s appetites when he was at school.<br>
<br>
“I suppose you are right, I should be looking forward to this evening!” the guest of honor perked up. It would be a pleasure breaking this one to her will permanently. <br>
<br>
Maelgroth left the young and now eager ascendant to be with a smile on her face. It would be a brutal and efficient courtship, of that he was sure. With a bow of respect he headed towards the gate.<br>
<br>
“Do you require a carriage, sir?” Vilkev droned. There were several teak carriages in the courtyard waiting to return guests to their own manse. Each bore the mark of House D’Vir an assault on a guest returning from this affair would have to reckon with their anger.<br>
<br>
Tentatively, Maelgroth looked around, there nearby stood Vynna K’yari, Nystyre’s cousin. No one else seemed to notice her. That settled it for him. It must be a trap. Entering into a formal alliance with house D’Vir, attending an ascension of his own, suddenly scared him more than taking on four powerful houses in third gate. For a moment he considered taking a carriage, he knew she would be there, somehow. Where could he take her, certainly not home to the shack in the foreign quarter.<br>
<br>
He looked back at her, she was staring at him intently, she was about to say something, he was sure of it. <br>
<br>
He gated back to his quarters.<br>
