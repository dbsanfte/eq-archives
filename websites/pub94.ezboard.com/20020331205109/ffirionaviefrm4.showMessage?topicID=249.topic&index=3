The he you are refering to here is yourself. What stopped you from doing those things you listed above? Had a full group of role-playing characters been at the same spot as Dante and the bard, would they have affected your ability to do your above mentioned actions? Yes, a role playing group would have affected your ability to do your above mentioned actions. Boils down to eq limitation again:<br>
People fighting over mob spawns. This has nothing to do with<br>
Role playing. <br>

<br>
First off, mostly the party would of went after places where the Decaying pieces of armor are, or we would of just attacked the Maze for training. Their is no fighting over spawns here, they were Powerleveling off of Lower Tae, or as it is called here, the Temple thinggy.<br>
<br>
Also, where did I say that RPers didn't effect how I RP, they do too! Everyone in Everquests effects everyone elses character. Interaction, weither you like it or not.<br>
<br>
Nice try to get away from the point, that Powergamers do effect Roleplayers, cause if you missed it by chance, that was it.<br>

They would have their little friends over to play Barbie(c) Dolls.<br>
<br>
After 30 minutes or so one of the group would inevitable do something the other thought was inappropriate. Then would come the appeal to mom:<br>
<br>
MOM, make her play Barbies the right way.<br>
<br>
Shintou: There is no Mom here. VI doesn't care. There is also no right way to play with Barbies. So you play with your Barbie Doll your way and everyone else will play their way. Let's leave mom out of it and have fun.<br>

<br>
I'm going to find out a way to say this without being a Pervert..<br>
<br>
Okay, I think I got it clean now.<br>
<br>
These are Generic Boys and Girls.<br>
These Girls play with their barbie dolls one way. Thats okay.<br>
These Boys play with their Barbie Dolls in a .. different way.<br>
Girls are Offended. Why can't the Boys just play with the Barbie dolls in their own room alone?<br>
<br>
Another.<br>
<br>
Boys acually take the advice. These boys are up, playing with their barbie dolls as they see fit. The Girls know they are playing with the barbie dolls as they see fit, but they walk in the boys room, sit down on their bed, look down at the boys and just smile.<br>
<br>
You know dang well those Boys are NOT going to play with those Barbie dolls the same way they were playing with them before, espically with the Girls looking down on them like that?<br>
<br>
Alright, I'm done.<br>

QOUTE:<br>
Imagine, what could Shintou of done in the Temple of Cazic Thule had their not been Dante there, Powerleveling the Bard.<br>
<br>
Maybe he would of faught and trained fighting the Lizards.<br>
Maybe he could of called some of his Friends and Guild Brothers and Sisters and went Adventuring within the Temple.<br>
Or Maybe he could of just been bored and left the Temple, seeking another place to train his skills<br>
<br>
END QOUTE<br>
<br>
Would this not have been the same thing had thier been a role playing group at the Temple? Your ability to do these things you mention has NOTHING to do with role playing.<br>
You inability to do these things has EVERYTHING to do with mob spawn issues.<br>
<br>
1. Nothing preventing you from going elsewhere in CT and fighting lizards.<br>
2. Nothing preventing you from calling some friends/guildies to CT to fight besides the Temple in CT.<br>
<br>
 Some one was in a mob spawn spot you wanted, this has NOTHING to do with role playing. Your blaming your &quot;inability&quot; to do certain things on lack of role playing is bull honkey doodoo. You got upset cause someone was in a spot you wanted, and since they were &quot;not-roleplayers&quot; you find an easy venue to vent your frustation. I do understand your concern with lack of role playing response to your role playing statements to the 2 people at CT Temple, but they did not affect your ability to continue on and enjoy the game.  <br>
<br>
I will give you a REAL example of powergaming affecting someone in EQ: My second char on another server was at this same exact spot. A full group of level 26-30ish chars in the Temple. We were there for hours having fun when long comes a single 50+ necro and proceeds to steal the camp from us, killing the Tae before we can, etc. He wanted to twink his rogue, imagine that. <br>
<br>
Welcome to EQ Ronin,  the nature of mob spawn issues.  Nothing role play about it brother, boils down like this for all of us. Thankfully, there is for the most part a nice set of people on FV. Really be sad to see the bickering and fighting that goes on over mob spawns on other servers come to FV. Please stop blaming mob spawn issues on role-playing, has zero to do with role playing. <br>
