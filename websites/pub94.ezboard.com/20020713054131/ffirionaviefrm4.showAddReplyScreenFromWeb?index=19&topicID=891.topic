You asserted the game wouldn't have been as popular if they had followed my suggestion from the beginning.  I beg to differ.  If every server had a one-character rule from the get-go, no one would have noticed--no one would have known any different.  But since Verant didn't do that, everyone would notice the change.  And they'd all bitch about it incessantly and scream they're going to quit their accounts and play Dark Age of Camelot, NeverWinter Nights (which I bought yesterday, primarily because my partner, who DMs his own campaign, plans on using it), or Star Wars Galaxies (this &quot;threat&quot; puzzles me--why threaten to quit EQ to buy and subscribe to a different Verant/Sony product?) until VI decided that it isn't worth the bother. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

<br>
i still contest that it wouldn't have been as popular.  i think that in many people, the instinct to race to the finish line would've lessened their enjoyment because they wouldn't have soaked in all that there is to see along the way.  afterwards, they'd have to start over from scratch somewhere else without all of the people that they've relied upon.  <br>
<br>
even if they didn't know any different from day 1 of release, boredom would've set in at merely the thought of going to another server and starting all over again.  personally, i think many folks would go &quot;ok, i finished that game, next!&quot;  although a few die-hards (perhaps half of the eq population?) would try out all of the different races/classes and get their full money's worth out of it.<br>
<br>
to my thinking, at least a part of the success of EQ is due to the fact that when a player gets bored with their character, they can just fire another one up, gear them up like a holographic Pretty Woman, and go out to slaughter bats with one blow of their Sword of Uberness.  twinkage (and knowledge of the game somewhat) make levelling go twice as fast the second, third, and forth times around, at least until the character's level &amp; gear even out.<br>
<br>
now, the question of &quot;how much less popular?&quot; i can't determine with the feeble powers at my disposal.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uowump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Owump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 6:54:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: just random thoughts</span><hr size=1>  why do people come to a server,where they know that you can have only one char,and then adamantly bitch and moan because they can only have one char per server?this is like the idiots that build houses on the lake and bitch to the city that there basements flood or idiots that buy a house in town and bitch about the noise...<br>

The new people aren't what made the server, those of us who have been here since the start made the server, the economy, the guilds, everything that this place is.  New people like you come and say 'no alt, please , waa waa waa'.  Well guess what, everyone started like that, but after you've been here 9 month, it gets boring.  Once you'll have been here as long as the posters, then you can complain, but as it stands, there are perhaps 25% of us who are actually left that made the server what it is, we got to 50+ and once there, there is only so much you can do.  If people want to twink the living s*** out of a toon, they will have deserved it since they worked for everything they have.<br>
<br>
And guess what, no one as actually said 'I want an alt to twink' , people are saying, 'I want an alt to mule, to bank or to get a chance to have fun'.  You new people are going around equipped at 20 with what we had at 40, you shout, auction, act like doods and do whatever you want... we formed the economy, most of the guilds, the tight knit community as it stands for the raids and the battles which you can't do alone.  We dealt with no auction, limited shout, forced roleplay, lanquage restrictions, alignement restrictions, so if we want alts to further enjoy the server, why the hell should we not be allowed to have some.  <br>

<br>
Please recognize that there's room for reasonable people to disagree on this issue.<br>
<br>
While earlier I was stating the reality of the situation, I also prefer things to be one character, and I've been on the server, causing one ruckus or another, since the first week (started on day one, but went back to SZ for a week when I couldn't get a kill in edgewise due to the rampant KSing of orc pawns, bees, spiders, etc).  I'm not some &quot;newb&quot; who showed up 4-6 months later.<br>
<br>
However, I understand why people want alternates.  There are times I'd really like to reprise my AD&amp;D paladin Sarah, and FV would be the perfect place for her.<br>
<br>
I think Verant screwed up from the get-go by a) having so many servers and then b) also allowing 8 characters per server except on FV and SZ.  But what's done is done, and there's no use complaining about it now.<br>
<br>
I had 40 characters in my partner's AD&amp;D campaign, at last count, but he had a meta-rule in his campaign that forbade characters of the same player to meet one another--and a harsh rule, at that.  If they did, he (the DM) absorbed one of them as an NPC under his control--permanently.  Coupled with the fact that each magic item that wasn't a limited-charge item (wands, potions, etc) was unique (meaning only one Short Sword +1, one Holy Avenger, etc.), and what we know as &quot;twinking&quot; was just impossible.  Finding a magic item, any magic item, was an Event, capital &quot;E&quot;, no matter how piddly the item actually was.  Anyway, I guess I'm trying to say I understand the urge to create multiple characters and explore what they can do.  I've done it myself in other RPG settings, and there were times I just did not want to play my evil necromancer, and other times I didn't want to play her twin. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

I did more for FV than you ever will boyo, I was among the founders of a 7 guild roleplay alliance, I was an active member in the open raid community in the plans and leading 36-42 people to Nagafen on a few occasions and giving people a chance to do things they might not otherwise do.  <br>
<br>
No offense, but I deserved an alt for my work on FV, my alt was to have fun and be able to do more.  No matter what you do on the server, you will never surpass me, I was here at the beginning, saw the world form and change, was among those of us here who made it what it is.  I was the first to go to North Karana and East Karana, I was probably the first to get to Freeport on the server from Qeynos at level 5.  <br>
<br>
We are better than you, we don't need people like you coming now and assuming it's your right to tell us what to do.  We MADE Firiona Vie, if it was not for us, there would be no Firiona Vie, it would have died long ago.  But now we have a bunch like you who came after the May 8th patch which ruined the server and you dare tell us what we can and can't do? You have not lived till you've gone from 1-40 speaking only 1 tongue and using Emotes without knowing who is what, not understanding anyone, not being able to shout.<br>
<br>
As for not having an alt, just this week, a 52 friend quit the game like me as he was bored and a 55 in our guild decided to reroll himself as a rogue.  Tons and tons of friends have quit and more will follow.<br>
<br>
I can leave you all with this advice, have fun while you're under 50, but never reach over 50 because then you will find out why you need an alternate.<br>

When you get a character up to a certain level (say 55) you are granted the option to start a new character. But, hard code it so no equipment can go from the high level toon to a low level toon. Must be a neutral third party involved. That would make it more difficult to pass gear off, but not impossible. <br>
 I have a lot of time invested in Wiestrum-she's my first EQ character-I screwed up that starting stats for a rogue, wish I had put the bonus points into Dex, rather than charisma, but she is still my highest level character on ANY server. Sometimes I wish I could play a troll shaman on this server, but not really looking forward to rerolling. I would miss my Sisters too much. <br>

blue servers are the hell that *most* people ran from, to come here. They are filled with rude, arrogant, irritating, immature people, who speak a language called d00d.  Good for trying out new characters and classes, but not good for fun. (or my Idea of fun). They are overcrowded, noisy, and generally nasty. They are the standard production servers as apposed to the -Zeks, which are player vs. player, or red (correct me if I'm wrong) servers.<br>

I strive to improve my living conditions by hoarding gold, food, and sometimes keys and potions. I love adventure, fighting, and particularly winning - especially when there's a prize at stake. I occasionally get lost inside buildings and can't find the exit. I need food badly. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

<br>
on Torv, there is huge amounts of same person twinking, p/ling, the markets are rediculous.  I've seen Fine Plate BP's sometimes being sold for 10 PP in the Market.  There are people on Torv who would move to a brand new server in a heart beat, one where the market hasn't been saturated by people playing 2 characters at a time, p/ling themselves to 50 in 2 weeks, then farming crap without the use of other players.<br>
<br>
yeah, its going to be a bigger challenge on FV, but its going to be a nice break <p>http://members.cox.net/mtorgler/misc/psyanos.jpg

<br>
Adding one more character per account means one more character that needs equipment.  The total number of tunes that now are going to be in the market for equipment just doubled.<br>
<br>
Demand for lower level items increases as high level players bid of them for their twinks.  Equipment that would ordinarily be sold or given away is retained just in case the player wanted to start a new toon based around those items.  Etc.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, twinking can extend your enjoyment of the game for a time.  On the other hand, it negativly impacts the market as items are taken out of the market only to sit idle on a toon that isn't being played because the owner is on his/her &quot;alt&quot;.<br>

What do you want, chump, a fucking cookie? You are nothing more than a pretentious piece of drivel who needs to let Mommy give you the Prozac.  YOU DESERVE?!?!!?  You are exactly what is wrong with people in this world, you think somehow you're OWED something when, in fact, you are owed nothing.  No one owes you anything, least of all respect.  Obviously you are undeserving of any praise or respect for your actions in a fucking video game.  Pathetic.<br>

I thought that when Verant announced we could have three toons here there was an overwhelming letter campaign AGAINST it by you players here and that's why they changed their minds.<br>
<br>
I'm so torn between ranger and paladin, but with having an account for me and an account that my teens share, plus cable on a switcher out to four computers, I can't justify buying software and springing the $13 for another toon.<br>
<br>
I'd love to have one more toon for selfish reasons, but not sure if it would be good for the server or not.  I bow to those who understand the economy in that better. <p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/danykalla"><center><img src="http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL18/605666/942834/10971516.jpg"><BR>art by Luis Royo</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzeraziatainte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zerazia Tainte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/3/02 9:57:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  ...</span><hr size=1> One of the main reasons I came to Firiona Vie, was the 'one character per account' policy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
