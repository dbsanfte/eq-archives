<br>
All I am doing is running my guild.  I am having open raids.. and playing with friends... I invited Achsia into my guild because her RL boyfriend is in it... and then I get tells from Imasu.  Today alone I have gotten tells from Imasu AND Seb (who it turns out is Tae's RL roommate).<br>
<br>
JUST LEAVE HER AND US ALONE is what I am asking...<br>
<br>
Imasu already admitted to *actively policeing* people against her... you know that is with tells and stuff... he is not using mind control is he?  You can READ the screenshot on page one... DUH.<br>

I brought this here to embarass them into stopping.. but I guess they have no shame.<br>

<br>
Yes, I can and I did read the screenshots in your first post.  I can also make a convincing argument out of those that you're the one harassing Imasu.<br>
<br>
Looking at what's on the table, I don't see the substance of your complaint.  He tells his guild not to deal with this person--I'd think this would be what you wanted, since that would mean they wouldn't be speaking to her, much less &quot;harassing&quot; her.  Perhaps I'm confused.  Do you mean to imply that not talking to someone is also a form of harassment?<br>
<br>
Regardless (&quot;irregardless&quot; isn't a word, by the way), this seems to also offend you because he's &quot;policing&quot; his guild.  I'm not sure where you think you have standing to complain about that.  Instructions given to the guild are between the guild and its leader.  You're not a party to that, so it is really none of your business.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that you're complaining that your guildmember is being harassed because he told his guildmates not to speak to her, or even about her.<br>
<br>
Even still, at this stage, all of this is just accusation with no evidence, no proof, no substantiation.  If you didn't log it, that's really too bad for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zekspawn>Zekspawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 4:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stalking on EQ</span><hr size=1> If you and your guild ignore her anyway, why is there any need at all to post on your page to tell people not to group with her?

<br>
We aren't asking you to take sides, Robin.  This is just what happened because a private request was ignored and the tells and private messages started pouring into Syrienne.  <br>
<br>
This wasn't some politcal ploy to keep a 12 person guild down on the server.  It never had to go public, but Imasu and Seb made it so by taking it to tells. <br>
<br>
Just Keep Achsia on your ignore if she's on it and don't do anything that would cause her to get second hand tells about her character, and you'll avoid our comming to your public board...it's public because anyone can post there...<br>
<br>
Just be happy that Syr posted and told me not to...*grins* <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=653845" target="top">Holis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sebraei>Sebraei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 4:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stalking on EQ</span><hr size=1> The only person I have discussed this with is Achsia,  and SHE sent a tell I have never in my life even laid eyes on this Syrienne person.

Tells (and private messages, referenced earlier in your post) are essentially private.  This only went public when Syrienne brought it here, not when people sent private messages and tells.  If it had stayed in private messages and tells, it would not be public.  But for Syrienne posting this publicly to the Soapbox, it would have remained a private affair.<br>

<br>
After that, their message board was visited and they were asked (nicely or not) to, basically, not associate with Achsia and the guild and left it at that.  <br>
<br>
It was these people who decided to push the issue farther...not letting it go...for having unreliable friends that pass the information onto people who they like to discuss.<br>
<br>
Syrienne is not a quiet person...she doesn't pretend to be...but she tried to be because there was no actual proof of the situation other than a guildmember virtually crying... Since they didn't let the issue drop, she brought it here.<br>

Anyway..this is a done issue..just leave her alone and be careful who you trust with you insults and slander and something like this shouldn't come up again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=imasu>Imasu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=48>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stalking on EQ</span><hr size=1> Today alone would be the only friggin day you WOULD get a tell from me, since I havent been in FV for almost two weeks. In that same timeframe you came to my guildhouse, posted a im gonna report you threat, which got deleted before I read it.<br>
<br>
I was told my GL was getting pissed about something (that post you sent to our guildhouse) and thought to get to the roots of this and nip it in the bud.<br>
<br>
Seeing as I had once hunted with you and your lil gnomey alt, and raided hate with you one time, I figured we could talk. Maybe you could tell me what the problem was, so I could hear your side of the story, before I even asked my guild what was going on. (taedarian was sleeping or I would have asked him first)<br>
<br>
As for policeing people in my guild. Well, honestly, I had misinterpreted the message Taedarian posted, but regardless. We have rules, and we are alowed to enforce them. If that mind control, then posting lvl requirements to join a guild is one too.<br>
<br>
Had you came out and told me who was /telling you all this hatered and stalkerish crap (which should be fucking stomped out at all costs) then I would have said, thank you. I will see what can be done about this.<br>
<br>
I had NO ill will towards your guild. Infact, I had been trying to atttend raids with you all, so I can see some game content that my guild cant take yet.<br>
<br>
That has changed since you ruined my time here in FV.<br>
<br>
As for Acs, well I think ive talked to her like twice maybe. Once when she left our guild. She wanted to know something, but I dont really recall what it was. She instigated that /tell<br>
<br>
The other time, may have been back when our guild Orthae was first named..umm whatever it was, cause I cant remember now. It was ALONG time ago. Seeing as I was my guildleaders personal spy master, I took it upon myself to watch all the youngsters in the guild at that time. She was never a problem then, that I could tell.<br>
<br>
*sighs* I just wish you would have explained this /tell hell that was comeing to you, gave me a name so I could try to stop it, instead of opening the conversation with your attacking, offensive statements. My game is now basically ruined here on this friggin server, due to the fact I can LFG from 4-10 hours everytime I log on. Now with a subconscious thought on those people who have read this, that I am a friggin stalker, or part of a stalker guild, just upped that time from forever to forever.<br>
<br>
I cannot BEGIN to tell you how sad I am that someone actually dislikes me. IRL no less, let alone a game. Ive never really met a person that hated me. No even you Roose, when you commented on how nasty my /cackle was almost a year ago. I knew you were just being mean, RPwise.<br>
<br>
Bah, I've lost track of where I meant to go with this, and now its becomeing clear to me, that my time in FV is over.<br>
<br>
I hope to GOD no one has to deal withthis guild like I have. (which was only good times until today! I mean, even that ONE time when I found out Acs joined them I only sent a tell letting them know she had caused strife with LFB and us only recently, warning her that something like this ghost and goblin, he said she said crap might happen. Syr thanked me atthe time, polite as all hell, and said thank you but I dont think theres gonna be a problem. Thought we had a relationship that facilitated communication, instead of damned threats and allegations. /boggle) They will throw your shit in the dirt, stomp on it, and call their mob to convince people of your friggin 'crimes'.<br>
<br>
I would love to let everyone know whats on Asc's mind, but I dont think she has the nerve to come here and tell her side of the 'story'. Rest assured if I get a /tell from Asc I will make sure it ends up here, seeing as the lady has afew alts and is a known .....I dont even have the strength to continue this... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dashanvaliant>DashanValiant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 4:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> on /ignore</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am tired of dealing with these people...

<br>
That's a good point.  I actually had never really considered that disadvantage to having someone on /ignore.  I suppose it is really just a question of which is more valuable in the long run; never having to receive a harassing /tell, or missing a train to zone notification?  <br>
I can see degrees where it would be on either side.  But if it is really wearing you down that badly, the harm of a potential future train seems less than the strife of current conflict.<br>

Taedarian and Achsia were not, and to my knowledge, never were dating IC, or OOC. They had a best an icy friendship from where I am sitting. <br>
<br>
For that matter, she was not dating anyone in that was in the guild at the time of her leaving (which was right around the time I left, completely coincidental). <br>
<br>
As far as stalking? I don't know the details, but I can vouch for Taedarian. It doesn't sound to me like something he would do or condone doing. Indeed it would sound like grounds for banishment from The Family if one of his members were doing this. A great guild, if you give them a chance. I am still friends with many of the members that are in it. Some drama towards the end but it was worked out to everyones satisfaction.<br>
<br>
Cheers Taedarian<br>

I don't know any of the people involved in this so with an unbiased eye I look at this and say that Syrienne has produced nothing that can be construed as harrassment in any form.  She has totally slandered a guild and yet refuses to not only not provide any documentation to support it (the first post just looks like her shouting at a bemused and startled Imasu), but also refuses to produce the names of the people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>supposedly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> harrassing herself and her guildmates in tells.  <br>
<br>
From where I am sitting (on the outside knowing noone) it looks to me like Achsia caused huge problems in her old guild and was booted out.  She got into a new guild and befriended the guild leader and then sobbed her heart out to this guild leader complaining of harrassment from her old guild.  A couple of tells from the old guild warning the new Guild Leader of their new recruit (understandable, I'd want to be warned if a troublemaker had just joined my guild) was enough to quantify this for the Guild Leader and she decided to believe wholeheartedly that this new guildie was being harrassed (even without knowing or being told anything about her reason for leaving the old guild) and decided to take her on as a cause and ruin these so called harrassers.   Impressive manipulation from the troublemaker known as Achsia.  <br>
<br>
Okay... the above is total spectulation based on what I see not knowing the whole story and just seeing snippets of it posted here.  This said, Syrienne's whole argument and this entire thread is pure speculation as there is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NO EVIDENCE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ... <br>
<br>
If you can even produce <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>names</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of the people sending you tells we might be making progress.... but at the moment this looks from where I am sitting as Syrienne harrassing Qu`ellar d`Orthae`Chath and the lynch mob that are her friends jumping on the bandwagon.... /shrug <br>

Basically, I'm of the opinion that if you've got unwanted and agressive sexual advances in EQ, YOU probably have done something to attract or encourage it.  Yes, stalkers are revolting, but whining about it is almost as pathetic as those that are stalking you.  I swear moaning over being stalked is just femine bragging:<br>

Syrienne, you're sounding disturbingly irrational, and a more than a bit like a stalker yourself. Every other word out of your mouth is &quot;Quit stalking Achsia!&quot; when it certainly appears that the alleged stalkers seem to be under standing orders for quite some time, to say nothing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>to</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or have anything to do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>with</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> her. It sounds as if they want nothing more than to do exactly what you keep vehemently ranting at them to do, and it doesn't make a lick of sense. You claim that she's being slandered, but not a single person (yourself included) has come forward to declare what was said, who said it, or to whom it was said. You won't give a single specific name or instance of the alleged stalking, and unless you do, none of us have any reason to believe a word you're saying. Sorry.<br>
<br>
And as someone else already pointed out, always <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> check references when you guild people, or at least listen to what their former guild members have to say. Sometimes it's just bitter scapegoatery that you can ignore, but going off like a loose cannon without even asking your guildmember about the situation is just irresponsible. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://stathol.home.attbi.com/stathol/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
