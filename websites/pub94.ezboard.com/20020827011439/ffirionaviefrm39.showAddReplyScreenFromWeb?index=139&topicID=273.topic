<br>
Not sure if this is the proper place to be commenting on the aftermath of the raid or not, but here I am.<br>
<br>
I had seen the posts and such about not blocking the entranceway, and I myself avoided the bottleneck.<br>
<br>
I saw my share of noble things, and my share of base and vile things. There was a lot of talk about attackers that would not accept duels. I know for a fact one of them would not accept my duel challenge, preferring instead to beat up the clockworks.<br>
<br>
I did however see many that accepted challenges. I was in fact done in by one that accepted my challenge, after which I stayed out of matters from a roleplaying standpoint; I didn't think it was &quot;right&quot; for me to get geared up all over again and race into more battle.<br>
<br>
I admit that I rejoiced when Gore fell, though I only heard about it and did not see it. Now I find that he was trained to death...that diminishes my rejoicing drastically. I saw him snipe guards in Felwithe the night before, and fell in battle with him twice, so my character is building up a great hatred. However, from what I saw in the raid today Gore was staying IC. Asdyr may hate the iksar filth, but real RPing should be commended lol.<br>
<br>
It's a shame that so many people are bitter about the whole thing, as it was one of the high points of community spirit that I've seen on the server. Great in theory and in backstory/continuing RP, but hindered by a host of game mechanic problems and some unscrupulous types.<br>

I loved this event, the completely unorganized rampage on the first attack of the king was just nuts.  I didn't know where he was I just ran around witht he group.  Hehe, you defenders didn't even need to block us when we got to the king.  I couldn't stand up in those rooms at all.  Loved the event.  Everyone should drink tea tonight. =)<br>

And don't let people get the wrong impression by some of the ranting here, I know personally I'm posting alot just because it is fun to debate and argue.<br>

The event brought in alot of people, a majority of them had fun, lots of stuff died, it was fun.   Nuff said.   Back to rants!<br>

I was a bit stunned by the sight of these infamous names; Apep, Gore, and others.  I was even so fortunate enough as to wriggle my way passed the apparently transfixed zombie like defenders standing watch at the door.  Thereupon, I made my way into Ak'anon proper and followed the raiders right to the King's keep and did witness their defeat at the hand of the king and his guards.  <br>
<br>
There was little we could do in the face of this onslaught, but we have sworn vengence upon them for this twisted rampage.  My collegues and I made an immediate departure for Neriak!<br>
<br>
ooc: It was an amazing spectacle even if made somewhat frustrating.  I very much look forward to many more such events among those guilds with such strong RP themes.  Personally, I look forward to the day when The Emerald Family and our allies assail Neriak, Oggok, and Grobb.  We hone our skills in preparation of that day. <p><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=169421">Trevian</A><br>

<br>
/salute Apep<br>
<br>
With out a doubt the most spectacular event I have been too.<br>
<br>
A shame that all the different takes on the situation caused some to not enjoy it as much as I did.<br>
<br>
I know I got carried away in the action at the time it was incredibly drawing. I am sorry I was not a high enough level to even be a challenge to most of the attackers.<br>
<br>
Apep I did make IC comments to you in your battle with Mixxi, kudos sir you answered well and I am honored at your calm rational response.<br>
<br>
I am sorry Donavaan(sp) that we could never meet up so you could have kilt me good and proper. You were the only one that conned yellow and not red to me and I feel it was my loss not to have had the opportunity to battle with you (I normally would not be involved in PvP but this was an exception).<br>
<br>
I stood before the entrance as a symbolic gesture and fell back before the invading forces in what I thought was a RP manner.<br>
<br>
I truly thought it was an RP event that was just a little less set up than it could have been, again I am sorry if any of the invasion forces felt their fun was ruined by this.<br>
<br>
Again /cheer Apep and all those that came and had fun. please do not be disheartened because it did not go the way you wished it, it was spectacular.<br>
<br>
Please do it again but lets do it in a way that the RP can be used more fully.(If you do not want interference maybe it needs to be yelled very loudly that it is a raid not an open RP event)<br>
<br>
An attack on a city either given in advance or by surprise. Meet at the arena at a time designated by the attacker. Grand battle much carnage and mayhem, One death or fleeing only by each participant. win loss or draw claimed at the end. Then RP it out at the city the winner if invaders the defenders die beneath the sword (sit down) or flee and the city is ransacked with out interference. If the Defenders won in the Arena conflict the Attackers Die beneath the sword (sit down) or flee. This is a great opportunity for large scale fun.<br>
<br>
In closing /cheer Apep you were successful beyond what you imagined, please lets take what we have learned and do more of these. Many many more!<br>

Was everything perfect? No.  But that has been pretty well covered.  What was the price that I paid...?<br>
<br>
Did I die? Oh yes, I died and died and died... I gained and lost level 40, the minimum required to join, three times, I believe.  I spent 4 hours the night before trying to get the last 2 yellow of that level which I kept having taken just so I could see how this would all go down.  I dueled all who challeneged me, no matter how I thought I might lose.  I won.  I lost.  I was cut short by a clockwork. (in no particular order)<br>
<br>
But you know what?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I thoroughly enjoyed myself.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I got to be there when the POD fell and know that I helped.

Everything was a blur and his head felt like it was about to explode. Looking around, he quickly realized that he was still at the Steamfont windmills.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah ha! The big cat is awake.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kais recognized the voice of Nidbin, the gnome who had created his arm. &quot;What happened? How did the tiger end up here? The inva...&quot; Kais stopped short. Had the invasion already happened? What was going on here?<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, your friends have already ravaged Ak'Anon. Our master tinkers are making repairs to the King right now.&quot; The gnome looked sternly at Kais. &quot;You were going to join in the attack? After all that we've done for you and you for us?&quot;<br>
<br>
The tiger could not look Nidbin in the eye. &quot;The tiger can not explain why. You do not know the power of the darkness that I have sworn to obey.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I suppose you are stuck between the gear and the cog. Poor tiger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fortunately for us, your arm there has some nifty little gnomish safety built into it,&quot; Nidbin chuckled. &quot;If you ever raise your arm in anger towards a gnome or one of our clockworks, ya get a bit of a shock to put you out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kais growled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry, if a gnome or rogue clockwork attacks you, you'll be able to defend youself. At least it should work that way!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nidbin furrowed his brow. &quot;Now I think you best be on your way. The Gemchopper guard are still scouring the countryside for any remaining invaders, and irregardless of who you are, that Storm crest you wear will likely get you killed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kais picked himself up off the floor, nodded a farewell to Nidbin, and trotted out the door. <br>
<br>
Through forethought, the tinkers had saved themselves from the clockwork tiger. Now Kais would have to hope that his punishment at the keep would not be too severe.<br>
<br>

(( I was really hoping to be able to make it to this event, but work ended up keeping me very late. After reading through the aftermath, it is good to see that a lot of folks had fun. )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39>Renaissance Festival</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
