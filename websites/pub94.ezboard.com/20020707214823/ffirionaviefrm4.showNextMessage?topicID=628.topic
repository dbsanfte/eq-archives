Before the patch, I had no problem.  Now, I do.<br>
<br>
My problem is shadow knights.  I've met at least three non-RPing SKs.  Fair enough, they don't RP, doesn't bother me.  I've grouped with two of them.  That may sound strange, but bear in mind that I joined during downtime, and I have grouped with one of them twice (now refered to as X.)<br>
<br>
The first SK wasn't so bad, I didn't know he was an SK until he started fighting.  You don't tend to, mainly because non-RPing SKs simply see pallys as not the scum of Norrath (like I like it) but as cut down clerics.  I got invited because a friend of mine was in the group.  So, I'm in this group, and suddenly, RP sirens start going off.  I'm grouped with an SK, entirely by accident.  So, what do I do?  Do I abandon my friend (who was also duped) or just group and fight.  I stayed, and got a fair amount of exp.  My &quot;Ding&quot;-esque message, which was entirely IC was completely ignored, greeted with &quot;wot/?&quot;  I eventually got sick of it and left.  Fair enough, friend followed me.  We excused ourselves and left.<br>
<br>
Sooo...  Second incident, involving Mr. X.  I've grouped with X twice now, and I don't care to again.  The first time was in Paludal Caverns.  Another situation where you don't realize they are an SK until they start fighting.  My friend had to leave, and so I'm stuck in this group with an SK.  I'm trying my absolute bloody hardest to stay IC here.  Fair enough, eventually he gets bored and buggers off.  I leave shortly after.<br>
<br>
Second time, I'm with that friend again.  We're just about to join a group with a barbarian warrior and his little wood elf ranger friend.  My friend leaves shortly before joining, and a chanter (good aligned) wanders along and joins.  GREAT!  We're having a wail of a time, we're pretty IC and enjoying it.  Here comes Mr. X.  The ranger, who was neutral and the warrior who was neutral had no problem with it.  The chanter and I are grinding in our boots right now.  So, Mr X joins in.  He's a fair bit more powerful than I am, so he gets the haste instead, much to the chargrin of the chanter (obviously, if it were not for IC concerns, there wouldn't be a problem).  This time, I leave, hopefully getting away from this SK for the last time.<br>
<br>
He tracks me down.  Despite the fact that the chanter and I were making our selection to never group with SKs VERY CLEAR other than in circumstances outside of our control, SK wanders over, hails, get's a minimal response.<br>
<br>
Then comes the inevitable question:<br>
<br>
&quot;Want to group?&quot;<br>
<br>
I politely send him a /tell explaining my IC reasons for never grouping with SKs.  I'm apparently being childish and stubborn by holding this view.  He's a powerful ally, according to him, and I'm being ridiculous for not grouping with him.<br>
<br>
This is a roleplaying server.  A paladin is a holy knight, a shadowknight is an unholy knight.  Where does he get off claiming I'm being childish for refusing to group with a fricking SK for RP reasons?  I don't give a crap how useful he is, OOC I have no problem with the player, but IC, my character sees everything that is wrong with the world in that damned SK.  Why can people not understand that?  Why must I be made to feel like a pillock for passing up obvious grouping opportunities for RP reasons?  Why can people not respect the fact that I play this game as I see fit, and if it involves me, and if it involves a decision I have made about my character, they have NO RIGHT to tell me that I'm being childish, especially on the only server to actually cater for these needs.<br>
<br>
Mr X, for being abusive, annoying, and downright pissing me off, you've earned first place on my /ignore list.  Amazing, something I never thought I would ever have to use.  Kudos, you've broken a record. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=castinareleas>CastinarEleas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/14/02 10:15:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=644.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just amazed I even have to use here...</span><hr size=1> /comfort<br>

I accidently grouped with a paladin last night. A dwarven one at that.<br>
Thankfully, Captain Antoin and I had it out in order to settle the blemish that put upon the League.<br>
<br>
(It's difficult sometimes. I solo a lot, group with League members when I can. Sometimes you want to just be able to play the game. I dunno how tough it is for you lighties, but finding a satisfactory evil group is tough.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/14/02 11:03:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=644.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just amazed I even have to use here...</span><hr size=1> I left regular servers because my wood elf druid used to get shunned because she wouldn't group with dark elves---and I'm not about to let this server become like one of those. <br>
<br>
Stick to your guns.  People on this server are supposed to *at least* respect roleplay---however one chooses to do it. There are a lot more out there who support you than do not. And if someone becomes crabby or offended about your roleplay even after you explain yourself oocly to him/her, put them on /ignore. <br>
<br>
There are ooc situations where I step out of my roleplaying shoes for an incidence here or there. But otherwise, as far as grouping, etc, I do not.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with doing occasional ooc favors (or accepting them) for evil when someone is in a real bind. For instance, last night, my corpse was lost beyond recovery in Kael Drakkel behind a pack of angry red-con (to 42) giants that could SEE THROUGH invis. Don't ask how I ended up there *blush*. None of my fellow goody two-shoes companions had a chance of getting past them mean see-invis giants, and my corpse was *way* in there. Enter Zarsiss (I hope I spelled that right), vile, snarling Iksar monk. He and his shaman companion had been hunting somewhere else in Kael, and desperate, a guildmate of mine asked via ooc tells if he could possibly feign-death pull my corpse from the midst of the giants. He very kindly agreed and I had my corpse soon enough. After I got my corpse, then the animosity continued (vile, smelly, Iksar!). <br>
<br>
But I've also taken shit for refusing to rez a necromancer. Now, the guy asked me in character, and I refused in character. He got rather miffed that I wouldn't rez him, but he not once mentioned why it was so important to him. We were in Oasis, and he was probably only in his upper teens or so, so I didn't consider his situation dire.  I assumed he was bound in Freeport and just wanted to spare himself the run.  Later I found he was bound far off from his corpse. Now, if he had sent a quick OOC tell that he was bound in B.F.E. and rezzing him would be an act of kindness on my part, I, the player behind my character, would have rezzed him without a thought, where my character Isharra would not have. As a player, however, I know the mechanics of the game and how sometimes it is necessary to help a fellow player in times of need. After all, the player behind the evil avatar isn't evil... he or she just chose to play an evil character. <br>
<br>
I think it all comes down to whether people understand the difference between ooc and ic or not. Unfortunately, there are a lot of nonroleplayers on the server who just don't get it. Hopefully, the majority are roleplayers, though, and DO get it. So don't let those few instances get you down.  Keep ooc and ic separate, and you'll be fine.<br>

One of the things I liked when I moved to this server is I never had to have the alignment conversation when grouping.  Especially since the usual response when I asked if they fought for good or for evil was, &quot;Huh?&quot;.  But now I am having to get into it again.  Usually, I join the group if there isn't anyone obvious (like a DE), and then while in group start asking about class/level/alignment.  And if the alignment isn't one I can live with, I thank them and move on.<br>

High Elf doe, and a cleric (my favorite flavor) no less, with arctic mussels on the side, and everything smothered in a chunky black dung beetle sauce. Hate yes, I'll drag her corpse! So off I go, frozen drool clinking on the ground in my wake, up the ramp towards the arena. Mmmmmm there it, I mean there she is, marinating in creamy bloody sorrow at the feet of a few storm giant steaks. <br>
<br>
Now normally I like to prepare my meals where they fall. Unfortunately, storm giants don't like me very much and it was prudent that I drag the doe to a quiet place. So, I work that monk magic and drag the delicacy down the ramp a ways. That hurt quite a bit, but mmmmm it would be so worth it! So, mission accomplished and I'm just FD and getting some health back. It was then that I noticed, to my utter horror, that those stupid giants had completely and thoroughly rubbed her down with salt. Gah, a perfectly good high elf CLERIC doe ruined! I was so angry! This can't be!<br>
I licked her toes. gah salt! /spit <br>
I sniffed her ears. gah salt! /spit <br>
I tasted her throat. gah salt! /spit<br>
ruined, ruined, ruined!<br>
Saddened, I simply walked away, flicking off the ice that gathered beneath my eyes. I did notice her corpse skipping along the ground on its way towards Wakening Land. There's no accounting for taste I suppose, but at least someone apparently got fed. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49821">Zarsiss Razorscale</a><br>

Just tell me in advance I would love to watch the outcome.<br>
I play a oger Sk and have no problem rping with other people, The only time I do not is when I am in serious discussion or we are in the middle of a huge fight. Other then that I love rping my ogre. Sit back and relax and keep in mind that since the new patch there are going to be a lot more people that are not going to rp and if all of us stick to our rp habits who knows we may turn them in to rper's<br>

For example, those nasty minotaurs in Steamfont are a threat to the gnomish race - regardless of alignment. I can see a group dedicated to fighting off that menace, freeing the gnomish slaves, yadda yadda that has any and all alignments in it.<br>
<br>
I don't really see gnomish paladins and shadowknights grouping up to go bear hunting in the Karanas, however. And I can see much disdain being hurled at any who suggest that grouping should ignore roleplay for convenience.<br>
<br>
Now the real problem with 'invisible' alignments comes when you have a race/class combo that can be of any alignment. The NPCs can tell what sort of chap you are, why can't I? And how 'roleplay' is it, really, to run around asking everyone &quot;are you evil or good&quot;?<br>
