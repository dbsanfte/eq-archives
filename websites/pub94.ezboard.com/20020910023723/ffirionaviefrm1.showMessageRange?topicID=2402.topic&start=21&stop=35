It's that you'll almost certainly do that to yourself.  Raid-play for those classes differs drastically from xp-play.  Mages and necros make valuable raid contibutions.  Beastlords do what they can, but if they all vanished, no one would notice.  <br>
<br>
Mages aren't permitted to do more than CotH &amp; Rod.  This isn't some Draconian plot to keep mages down.  It's just that CotH/Rod are so much more valuable than anything else the mage can do that if the mage does do something else, it's obvious he's not pulling his weight even to him.  Also, if you take faction hits as a mage, you will have to lots of repair work after every raid or you won't be useful for CotH.  No CoTH means no raid for many spots due to the ridiculous time it takes slogging through junk spawns without it.  Do DD and you take faction hits again and you won't have mana for rods.  No rods often means raid wipe.  Summon pet and you just screwed up positioning (grat's on wipe again).<br>
<br>
Beastlords have even less utility on raids.  No pet permitted, pathetic damage output, only way to contibute is really via small 300hp patch heals, savagery, and spiritual purity.<br>
<br>
So, while pretty much any guild is happy to have mages, necros, and beastlords that like playing their class, most of those don't really like raid-play for their class.  It's vastly different from xp-play. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

Yes, we can't solo so well (though I knock off giants now and again when I want to).  But we can do a LOT if you're creative.  However, rogues are easy to play badly and hard to play well.  A bad rogue will sit there behind the mob poking and evading constantly and not much else.  A good one will manage their agro so they can take it quickly if the cleric gets it, sneak pull, scout, CR, tank sometimes, and more.  <br>
<br>

1) Absor said its 4 pets max (i know nitpicky sorry) and that seems to be agreed by the magecompendium<br>
<br>
2) Pets are essentially beta neutral if they are not attacking anything. On a bad pathing a pet could wander the entire plane of hate, get summoned back and no trains <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3) Summon Companion = hey you, get over here, no aggro problems<br>
<br>
4) /pet hold means you no follow monster as it leaves<br>
<br>
5) pets have owners resists = pets survive AoE encounters much better, also pets = immune to fear (EoT and mage spell) means fewer wandering pets<br>
<br>
6) upper level pets damage output has been increased significantly, and they are now summoned at max level<br>
<br>
7) some encounters (see shamans <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) NEED mage pets, for fights where 200 fire resist is not enough (yes, you can do that fight without them, but it is 10x + harder )<br>
<br>
Just playing Devil's advocate - I really do think Verant is trying to make all classes more raid friendly. <br>

<br>
BTW, my comments about pets being generally forbidden is even after the pet changes.  Those changes don't really address pets on raids.  They make pets a lot safer in xp zones, but don't help much with the major pet concerns on big MOB kills.  The issues there are facing, positioning, and door-opening -- all of which are screwed up by pets (sometimes a little, sometimes to the point of a wipe).  Pets still don't respond to commands promptly, too.  I can't count the number of times I see &quot;backing off master&quot; while a pet continues to chase and attack.<br>
<br>
Basically, the relatively miniscule gain from a few pets on a MOB just plain isn't worth the risks.  BLs are a great xp class.  I love xp'ing with 'em, but they're the least desired of any class for raids. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

I haven't found any of that on FV whatsoever.  Anyone who's actually played with one knows what wee can do, what we're good at, what we aren't.<br>
<br>
For soloing, there are good levels that you blow through like nothing, and there and level where you get the junk kicked out of you.  Just depends on how recent your pet buff is.  For grouping, I often find myself slowing, occasional debuff or dot, and meleeing.  Yes, we do melee, and with pet up do a significant amount of damage.  Not rogue or monk level, perhaps, but significant.  Minor CC is good too, flash of light in wide open areas, or &quot;pet mezzing&quot; indoors.  On raids, we melee, and that's usually it.  So you're not the most needed class for huge mobs, oh well, you're in there meleeing.  On some raids, I do preslows, which usually works well being as I can take the hits slightly better than someone wearing a robe :P and at the high high end there are a few class specific spells that make us useful.  But, mostly, you just add damage.<br>
<br>
Ignore preconceptions about the class, there are a LOT of them out there.  Thankfully, people on FV are much more open than I hear some other servers are, I personally have not ever been turned down for a group or raid because of class.  If you do choose this route, and have questions, shoot me or one of the other beastlords a tell and we'll sort you out.  If not, good luck in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Oh, and to the person above saying no pets on raids:  if you aren't being allowed to use a pet, there better be a very good reason why.  If resists get fixed, some aoe problems may be solved, but even without, high end beastlord on eqbeastlord.com have said, repeatedly, that in 90% of all raids you will have a pet up. <p>-----------------------------<BR><A HREF='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438' target=new>Rhatha Sha`Naya</A> and Swiftclaw &lt;Chosen of Vah&gt;<BR>

why you say ?<br>

Mage = great dd (mana expensive )<br>
            and pet ( melle )<br>
<br>
both have ok heal petential with the leather armor line/ water pet regen<br>
<br>
what does a chanter add ?<br>
crowd control mages don't get root so they generally  have to pull singles and if not gate<br>
<br>
clarity or more dd from the mage<br>
<br>
haste for the pet, slow for the attacker now the pet that  was ok at melee just got alot better and it will require less heals/beserk strengths etc<br>
<br>
also adds another pet so more damage<br>
<br>
and dots/dd <br>
<br>
and tash/malo for sticking spells<br>

anyway  the chanter  gets past all of he mage class weeknesses and greatly helps it's strenghts..<br>

If you have even a slight tendency to go LD, you won't be permitted a pet anywhere at all.  BTW, if you don't have cable or dsl and fast comp, you will go LD on raids.<br>
<br>
Beastlords are a fantastic xp class.  I love grouping with them.  They're inconsenquential on raids, though, even when they can use their pets.  This is not a preconception.  This is based on what I see raiding every day.  If I were to build a list of needed and desired classes for a raiding guild (ignoring friendships, etc), beastlords would be dead last.  I'd probably guild one or two out of pity, but that's about it.<br>
<br>
Please note that I'd never want to create a pure-raid guild that focused on raids to the complete exclusion of everything else, that's just an example.  My idea of an ideal guild has a good set of the core needed classes and lots of fun people playing whatever class works for them.  My current guild has a couple of great beastlords and I wouldn't trade them out.  I do pity them a bit for their class choice, though. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

    But of the 4 choices of wizard, paladin, rogue, or beastlord I'd probably have to say um....hrmmm....  rogue if you have a mage buddy would nice, I guess, because you could backstab at with while Jojobar smacks it around, though I would imagine that you would get aggro pretty fast.  I do like grouping with wizzys, as long as they don't go full burn at the start of an encounter, get aggro, then beg me to heal them when I've already gone out of mana doing so.  Paladins are a nice choice also...Lay on Hands can be useful, and being able to res will make you popular.  I have to admit, I've not played alot with beastlords, and don't really care if I group with one or not.<br>

If you can't hold it up your end in a reasoned discourse, don't whine about it when your opinions get smacked about.  Also, check my recomendation on class above.  If not gonna raid, BL makes a great choice to go with a mage.  They're one of the top xp classes.<br>
<br>
Just at a guess, is Dupe a BL?  Perhaps a bit touchy over never being needed for a raid?  Well, there are classes you can't do without, classes that you need but are fairly interchangable, and classes that no one notices.  Which you play is up to you.  BL's can contribute to a raid.  You'll just have to work a bit harder finding ways to contribute and you'll never see anyone say &quot;gee, if only we had more BLs&quot; or &quot;we can't do this without a BL&quot;.<br>
<br>
OTH, if you're a BL and raiding regularly, you can rest easy knowing that people like having you around and aren't just using you because you're a critical class. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>
