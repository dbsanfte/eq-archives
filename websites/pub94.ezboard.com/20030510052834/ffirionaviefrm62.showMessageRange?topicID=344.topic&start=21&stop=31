Large civilian aircraft leak like seives, at altitude they use compressers constantly running to keep the cabin pressure up.

<br>
There was a Lear that recently went down because of explosive decompression but the volume of air is so different form large and small aircraft that the hole required is almost exponential.<br>

There are also specialy fabricated gun rounds that work fine on people but will not puncture the aircraft. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bantos@firionavie>Bantos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/21/03 8:02:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Explosive Decompression.</span><hr size=1> It's a great idea to arm the pilots.  It acts more as a deterrent than anything else.  Hijackers would think twice about hijacking an airplane if they know there is a cockpit with armed men on board, not to mention the air marshalls that many flights now have.<br>
<br>
People carry guns for protection, and the same would go for pilots.  Yes, shooting out a window would be extremely bad, but I don't think that it is something that they are expecting to have to use at every flight.<br>
<br>
When a robber knows that a liquor store clerk has a shotgun behind the counter because he heard a robber got his head blown off last month for trying to rob the store, he is going to think twice.  Same for airline hijackers.<br>
<br>
If you ask me, they should go further than this by arming the flight attendants with pepper spray and the such. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krostgutshank>Krost Gutshank</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/21/03 8:15:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Explosive Decompression.</span><hr size=1> Also, I wanted to point this out.<br>
<br>
Other then the mental effect that a firearm has on someone they are less effective in actual use in an area of close quarters, such as a plane.<br>
<br>
Make shift weapons for stabbing and slashing are cheap, easily fashioned,  more likely to get past security measures and are more effective in the close quarters of a plane than a handgun would be.<br>
<br>
In my line of work I have to regulary take a class entitled, &quot;Surviving Piercing Weapons&quot;.<br>
<br>
In the class we are shown &quot;Man with Knife&quot; vs. &quot;Man with Gun&quot; we even participate in it.<br>
<br>
Contrary to what many may think the knife guy &quot;wins&quot; an unusually LARGE percentage of the time in close quarters situations. Mostly at distances that you would likely find in scenarios on a plane.<br>
<br>
My 1st time in the course I was skeptical as were many of us but we were given the opportunity to try to &quot;shoot&quot; the knife guy before he &quot;stabbed&quot; us.<br>
<br>
Most of us were &quot;stabbed&quot; multiple times before we could  unholster the weapon and get a &quot;shot&quot; off. And we recieve regular training.<br>
<br>
Considering such a weapon is a very likely weapon for a terrorist I'd hate to see the pilot come charging and be filled with holes before he knew what happened. <br>
<br>
Then we just have happy terrorist with gun and knife.<br>
<br>
I just think there are more sensible ways of going about trying to provide better security and safety for passengers.<br>

Unfortunately, the concept of deterring someone who is *INTENDING* to die is somewhat poorly thought out.  If nothing else, you may encourage them.  Now, there is no thought of smuggling weapons, only of being able to take the one that is already available.  Against someone who wants to live, and actively fears death, it may work as a superb deterrant.  But against someone who has resigned themselves to die, it will probably have very little effect.  See movie &quot;Ghost Dog&quot;, see &quot;A Book of Five Rings&quot;, see any location in the world with suicide bombers.  <br>
<br>
Not having a gun on board, having a gun on board; both have pros and cons.  I am of a very mixed mind on the subject.  I suspect it will ultimately end up being a non-issue.  I doubt there will be any attempts similar to 9/11.  After all; the big thing to do now is to top it, not repeat it.  And that is far scarier than a gun on a plane.<br>

But what I think you are missing out on is the fact that while they are resigned to die, they are resigned to die only if they can take people with them.<br>
<br>
If they feel that this will prevent them from completing their attack and just them dieing then it could possibly act as a deterrent. <p>David Strange<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Perhaps.  I would say though, you should concentrate on coming up with ways to defeat, not deter.  I have a respect for the power of monomania.  I do not believe you can scare someone who is willing to die by the simple thought that they might not succeed.  If you can practically guarantee failure, then you deter all but the most desperate.  But simply putting a gun on a plane does not do this.  Honestly, beyond the <br>
complete cut-off of the cockpit from rest of plane, I don't know how you could guarantee failure.  And that apparently has its own problems.<br>
<br>
Really, the most effective thing towards anti-hijacking of planes was the success.  Previously, when planes where hijacked, generally, it meant the passengers went somewhere they didn't want to go.  Spent a while somewhere else, and then eventually got back and were, except in rare cases, unharmed.  Now, however, anyone on a hijacked plane is going to assume they are going to die unless they do something.  The &quot;sit quietly in your seat until it is over&quot; days are gone.  <br>

Actually no. Let's just look at the muslim fanatic suicide bombers, those maidens in heaven will still be waiting for them if they die trying. To become a martyr you don't need to be succesfull, the attempt is good enough (as long as you die during the attempt). <br>
<br>
Anyway, rational reasoning doesn't apply to the brainwashed freaks like those suicide bombers. All of the reasonings apply to rather &quot;sane&quot; people, you cannot predict what the insane will. Your best guess will be to think what a normal person would do and and assume the insane will do the opposite. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taemien>Taemien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 2:16:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pilots and Guns</span><hr size=1> I think they should be able to carry guns.
