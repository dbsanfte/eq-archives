The community wanted to enforce integration and now that it is they segregate themselves.<br>
<br>
Here is an interesting parallel get ready to flame me for me because I am pretty sure you cannot handle it.  You want to believe the government is completely evil so I will give you their evil side.  They want to control and to do so they will make people dependent on them.  No I am not saying all blacks get aid but by opening it up for the majority of blacks the government can and will control everything they do.  If you need an example look at the native Americans.  They don't so much as breathe wrong because if they do good ole uncle Sam doesn't have their check for that month.  They are controlled by the system and how long will it be before the majority of the African Americans are controlled by the same system just in the name of giving them what they want.<br>

On a more somber note.   Colin Powell could not have been elected president.  If he ran some moron from my state would have went and killed him.

Their words, like all music &lt;especially political stuff&gt;, is exagerations and opinions.  If you are going to sight stuff to support your oppinion...use facts, not music. <br>
<br>
I'm all for music and such, but believing their stories and thinking that they are writing for anything OTHER than to make money is kinda silly if you ask me. VERY few bands are out there to try to change the world through music...it's all about profit..heck most rap music is written about the money they have made in the recording industry. <br>
<br>
*grins* I know that most of the poor sections of town are filled with minorities...but when i drive past em...during business hours...many of em are walking about not looking for jobs, perfectly content on where they are.  &lt;yup, there's white folks there too...I see them too&gt;<br>

Jobs/education do NOT find you... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukaeliic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaeliic</A> at: 11/21/01 3:26:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uclanmcstump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClanMcStump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/21/01 3:43:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How did Adolf Hitler get so much darn power?</span><hr size=1> First, I dont see the killing of immigrants as a &quot;minor&quot; issue.  I know you meant that sarcastically and I will assume you didnt mean that I would see it as minor issue.  I dont know what happened in that case to allow those people to get away with that, and though I think that mayor should feel free to express his sentiments (that whole freedom of speech thing can be a serious pain the ass sometimes) that doesnt mean I cant be sickened by them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Second, I cant tell you why demographics of major cities show predominately poor black/hispanic/cuban and rich white.  I could hypothesize some reasons, however:  <br>
     A)  Parenting.  A black woman working two jobs so she can keep her children sheltered, clothed, and fed would find it very difficult to keep tabs on those children.  Especially if she is a single mother.  That same mother with a husband would have a better chance, but most fathers allow their children more freedoms (especially male children) and so those children are allowed to wander the streets and come into contact with negative influences.  Also, because the parents are often unavailable to their children, this leaves those children with feelings of abandonment, homelessness, and apathy.  <br>
     B) Primary Education.  The school districts in areas of low-income housing are often under-funded and under-staffed.  The teachers find themselves swamped with more students and less (not to mention inferior) resources leading to an inability to properly teach their students.  Students who fall behind in their studies are unable to get the attention they need to catch up.  Many of those students will either stop coming to school or simply be passed regardless of grades to make room for the next years class.  Students who drop out of school are not pursued by agencies responsible for seeing they remain in school.  Parents are often unaware of their children’s absenteeism.  Those agencies responsible for locating absent students are often as overwhelmed as the schools.  And any student not easily returned to school is often allowed to slip through the cracks because one less student in class means those teachers have more time to spend with the students who are there.  Students who are simply passed along fail to reach minimum requirements for a secondary education.  They are, more often than not, unable to read at a 4th grade level, unable to complete basic math problems, and have virtually no comprehension of sciences (earth or social).<br>
C)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Secondary Education.  Focusing on scholarship students here.  Required ACT scores for blacks are lower than the ones for whites.  This causes a couple of problems.  White students (myself included) upset that they need higher scores than black students to obtain the same scholarship.  This also feeds an interesting issue of college readiness.  A certain ACT score is required to obtain Scholarship_001.  Lets say 27 for blacks and 30 for whites.  Black_student_004 qualifies for the scholarship as does white_student_009, both by making their minimum required score.  This scholarship allows both students to attend state_college_002.  Is black_student_004 as prepared for college as white_student_009?  Their test scores say no.  The black student is less prepared than the white student even though they will be attending the SAME classes.  This means that even though they are both able to attend the school, the black student is going to have to put more effort into each class than the white student because he is less prepared.  <br>
<br>
And that’s my brief (yeah, right… ha ha) hypothesis.  Put into simple terms, my belief is this:  you can only better yourself through education.  You have no choice but to use the tools of education that are available to you.  In poor areas, those tools tend to be outdated and in ill-repair.  In wealthy areas those same tools are in good repair and more up-to-date.  This is because of funding.  Schools can only buy what they have money for.  Poorer schools receive have less to spend on books, aids, and teachers.  Students from these schools are less prepared for higher education and entry into the business world.  If those ill-prepared students are actually able to graduate, they have a chance to improve their lives and the lives of their offspring.  However, most of those ill-prepared students fail to graduate, fail to better themselves, and fail to change their life.  This is through no fault of their own (well, usually) but because they were not given everything they needed to be ready for school, and thus for life.  Thus, the poor stay poor, and the rich stay rich.  The problem is the focus on race.  When someone says, “Most blacks are poor, and most whites are rich, so white are still oppressing blacks” they are actually incorrect.  Granted there are (and will continue to be) incidents of racial violence as long as people (black and white) continue to see each other as the “enemy.”  What people should be focusing on is the widening rift between poor and rich.  Though blacks may dominate the poor quarters of our cities and metropolitan areas, whites are the predominate poor throughout the rest of the nation.  We are returning to a time of feudalism.  Where the rich are the aristocracy and the poor and the serfs who work the land.  And the rich continue to control us because we allow them to separate us into black and white, yellow and red.<br>
<br>
As you have no doubt noted, I have turned from my original theme speaking against the “separate but equal” path we now tread and have spoken out against the class system which is forming in the United States right now.  However, I view these issues as linked.  As long as we continue to see ourselves as separate, we will continue to be so and thus unable to pull ourselves out of the poverty we find ourselves in.  <br>
<br>
And as for listening to those artists you’ve suggested, I am sorry to say I stopped listening to rap music long ago.  I grew tired of hearing nothing but men calling women bitches and hoes and smoke this and shoot that person.  The majority of rap music being produced today is doing nothing to help black people help themselves.  It simply glorifies the worst of the problems developing on the street.  Those “artists” (not necessarily the ones you mentioned) are doing nothing but propagating the very problems we’re talking about,<br>
<br>
Sorry this post ran so long.<br>

First of all, you can generalize rap all you want.<br>
However, my suggested listening was just that, suggested listening. I wasn't CITING them as a source. Also, if you would listen to those songs, you would realize your generalization is incorrect.<br>
<br>
dead prez are Socialists. Their one song dealing with women on the album Let's Get Free is called mind sex, suggesting getting to know a woman mentally before physically.<br>
The Coup are Communists. I have yet to hear a misogynistic song from them in a career spanning nearly 10 years. There's violence... toward the government though, they're communists after all.<br>
Mos Def doesn't glorify violence or call women b*tches. Mr. N*gga is a social commentary about how no matter what a black man achieves in life he is still &quot;Mr. N*gga.&quot;<br>
Public Enemy, yep, you oughta know them.<br>
Ras Kass is a delightful contradiction. You'd really have to hear him to understand.<br>
<br>
On top of that, you say they just put out product to make money. Well, the majority of those artists are on independent record labels, they aren't making lots of money. They're making songs with a message.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I suppose I could do the same and stereotype all rock by listening to Limp Bizkit... I'm just more intelligent than that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=95.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=95.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=55><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=95.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=95.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=95.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
