And I haven't played EQ1 for a while now so excuse me for going off-topic onto EQ2 for a moment, but having read what information there is on-line, this little tid-bit caught my attention...tradeskill raids?<br>
<br>
Supposedly the tradeskill content of EQ2 is going to be much more dynamic, so that crafting an item requires more than just a 'click.'  There are tradeskill maneuvers, and a concentration bar, and some such.  It's even been compared to combat.  Well, that's amusing, and I could even see myself doing it, and I can sort of envision what that would mean....  You also get xp for this, btw, and advance as a tradesperson.  But here is where it gets wierd and my imagination fails.  To perform major works of 'civil engineering' like raising a temple or something, many tradespeople can co-operate.  Not just in succession and stages, like producing an Earring of Solstice, but together, in something that's been refered to as a 'tradeskill raid.'<br>
<br>
Okay, here is where I want help.  Can some people share their idea of what this might look like exactly?  My imagination is completely unequal to the task.  Let's say I'm a tradeskill raid leader.  Umm, make that Project Manager.  Right.  Let's not even talk about 'Open' Tradeskill raids for now.<br>
<br>
So I get about 24 tradeskillers together, and I open up my 'raid' window.  And then I...um...form groups.  Yeah.  I make sure that each group has a smith to do the heavy lifting (tank) and a couple brewers and bakers to keep everyone motivated and sustained (healers) and...um...a jeweler or tailor or something to...okay, maybe we won't have groups.  Let me start over.<br>
<br>
So I divide everyone into tradeskill areas and appoint a lead member of each tradeskill to oversee their area.  And then they each have a channel to co-ordinate their tradeskill maneuvers.  So when all the carpenters have forgotten their positioning and the temple is beginning to lean to one side the lead carpenter can shout 'position!' and whoever is tanking the temple can move to reposition the structure...  I mean, um....<br>
<br>
Okay, so I have a raid, and a bunch of different people with various tradeskills that haven't even been invented yet in EQ1.  But I have to put a level restriction in place because only tradeskillers of a certain level can do any good.  That seems kinda mean though, and I hope there will be a job that lower level tradeskill raiders can do, like, umm, answer phones and go for coffee....  Umm, is there a place where people get together to do this?  Like a boardroom or something?  And is there a way of escaping, in case, like, the chief engineer overpulls and you all have to run because there are too many different things going on for the crowd control....  Hmm.<br>
<br>
Okay, so I get everyone together.  And then we zone in...I mean, start making stuff.  We complete the first few tasks with relative ease and start to move deeper.  Then my main group (don't have groups, I forgot) I mean my lead tailor goes link-dead, so we have to wait.  Then the puller...I mean, the site manager, umm, finds too many tasks at once, so he has to feign death, I mean...umm...he steps down.  Yeah.  So everything gets reassigned, and we engage smaller tasks seperately.  Then my raid gets into some big ass debate over whether smiths or brewers make better tanks for the next thing we have to do because smiths have more hp but brewers hold agro better.  And then my only jeweler goes afk because he's bored about a minute before I finally need something jewelcrafted in a hurry, and so the whole raid whipes in an awkward spot and I have to ask the big uber-tradeskill-raiding guild to come bail our asses out because our corpses are stuck in...um...got distracted there for a minute.<br>
<br>
Okay, so I have this raid.  And while we are trying to build our temple various things are going to go wrong and I'm going to have to co-ordinate everyone in order to get ready for it.  So I'll have a script or something &quot;Now, when we first run in to fight Lord Nagafen, first the core team of melees will engage, while the healers wait in the buffing room....&quot;  So I instruct everyone.  &quot;When we first engage the temple in combat....&quot;  Scrap that.  &quot;When we first begin to build the temple, there will be key moments when the whole frame might fall over.  So only the lead team of carpenters with their special carpentry AAs will engage, I mean start to build, the structure, while the support classes stand by in reserve.  When the carpenters fall below 40% stamina they will run back to the bakers to be refreshed.  When the temple is 50% finished the tailors will rush it and start erecting art as fast as they can manage.  When the temple is 80% finished it's going to frenzy so everyone will need to move behind the temple and the lead carpenters who are holding agro will need to stop meleeing from the front....&quot;  Sigh.<br>
<br>
Okay, that last attempt is as good as it gets.  I just don't get it.  I mean, I'm intrigued, but I just don't get it.  The only saving grace I can imagine about all of this is that I believe, on average, people who seriously practice tradeskills tend to be the more savy and with-it players of this game.  Not that people who hate tradeskilling can't be just as good, but there are a lot of people who try normal raiding and end up making a hash of it that would never know a tradeskill recipie if it chased them to a zoneline screaming &quot;phat lewt!&quot; whereas the average serious tradeskiller, in my opinion, comes equiped with a higher level of basic competence, even if he or she doesn't know jack about raiding.<br>
<br>
Anyway, please share your thoughts, because that's as good as mine get.<br>

But seriously, despite the tongue firmly in cheek, I really am interested in other thoughts here.  Are we going to end up with uber-trade-raiding guilds?  Tradeskillers speaking in l33t all of a sudden?  Massive flamewars on Eqtraders (the most civil boards in the EQ universe, atm) where competing tradeskill guilds flame each other and brag about their l33t blacksmithing skillz?  The mind boggles, really.  I mean, if you are going to organize a few dozen people who are sitting around on their computers to participate in a combined effort to make a building or something...I mean really, I begin to wonder if you shouldn't just go out and get a real job doing that somehow.  It pays better....<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again.<br>

<br>
Right now, at least on FV without NO Drop to contend with, there are combined efforts to make several things like the shawls and the solstice earrings.  The EQ2 method might be a bit more formalised.<br>
<br>
I am looking forward to seeing how tradeskills are handled as well as the rest of game play.  I have been impressed with the graphics (when they haven't crashed... like they did at Vegas Fan Faire *smirk*... so reminiscent of the W98 crash while Bill Gates was showing it at Comdex East), but preciouis little has been said about the actual game play aside from features added in.  Admittedly, some of the features added make me cringe from a roleplayer's point of view (canned phases to say to quest givers, and only being able to chose from the canned responses).<br>
