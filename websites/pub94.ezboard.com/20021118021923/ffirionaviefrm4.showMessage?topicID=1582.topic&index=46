I think bombiong pioeple is a bad thing.<br>
<br>
I am not a US citizen, nor are most people in the world.<br>
<br>
When wars happen people die.<br>
<br>
People like you and me.<br>
<br>
That's a bad thing.<br>
<br>
If peolple like saddam and osama die, hooray.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately its not often the case.<br>
<br>
In this country (UK) the vast majority of peopl e think (and polls have justifireed it) that any kind of preemptive action is unjustified and morally wrong (otherwise lets blow up the Saudis as thats where most ffo th the terrorists in 911 came from)<br>
<br>
I can hardly see at the momomet so apolofies if this is either irrelanvcent or accidentallty responding to a post in the Coffe sghop.<br>

A few points.<br>
<br>
First, it is impossible to be completely secure. Even a police state is not totally secure. Freedom and security are mutually exclusive. As a caveat, I should also mention that is also impossible to be completely free.<br>
<br>
Gnosis is correct in stating that the terrorists intentionally target civilians, while we *usually* try to prevent civilian casualties. About Israel targeting the apartment with the terrorist leader: all I know is if I was living anywhere near him, I would sure as hell do everything I can do move away from that area. Israel does kill civilians, sometimes intentionally, but in their view they see no other way to fight the war on terrorism.<br>
<br>
Despite the fact that North Korea presents a greater threat to the U.S. than Iraq, I think the reason they are not being subject to the same empty rhetoric from our administration that Iraq is are twofold: First, war with North Korea would be rather nightmarish compared to Afghanistan. Our 37,000 troops on the border would be immediately overwhelmed by the million strong army of the North Koreans. If we started sending troops there in preparation for an attack/defense, North Korea might be prompted to invade immediately before we could get much over there. Secondly, North Korea is fortunately for them not nearly as strategically placed as Iraq is. Note that primarily that means oil.<br>
<br>
Also of import here is that South Korea would likely be obliterated, if not by invasion, then by missile attacks with powerful conventional and/or biological attacks. They could also reach Japan with missiles, and inflict heavy damage on them as well.<br>
<br>
Our own CIA has stated publicly that they don't consider Iraq a threat to the U.S. Those of you backing an attack on Iraq I ask: why do you listen to the rhetoric of the government rather than your own Central Intelligence Agency? Think.<br>
<br>
It was a huge mistake by the Clinton administration to give North Korea $4 billion in exchange for stopping their nuclear weapons development. They used the money instead to help ADVANCE their nuclear program. Short-sighted ignorance at it's best on the part of our government.<br>
<br>
Also of note is that their nuclear development was also done with the aid of: China, Russia, and a Pakistani who originally developed their own nuclear program. In the case of Pakistan, they traded nuclear know-how with North Korea's long-range missile technology. They wanted it to make a credible threat to India's more powerful army.<br>
<br>
Pakistan and India basically have what we had with the Soviets all those years: the M.A.D. doctrine. That stands for Mutually Assured Destruction. The unfortunate fact with these two countries is that they share a contested border (Kashmir), which flares up on a fairly regular basis and has been the cause of 2 of their 3 wars. Fortunately both sides know they would have nukes raining down on their own cities if they decided to launch an attack of their own.<br>
<br>
Russia helped because after the breakup of the Soviet Union, they became severely strapped for cash, and that was a readily available means for them to make some. As for China, well I have no idea whey they did it. All it does is promote instability in the region, not something they generally care for.<br>
<br>
A note about SDI: the reason it was generally scrapped is that it FAILED almost every test it ever had. The primary reason is that the basic premise of SDI is flawed as our administration sees it. Missile defense *might* be possible if we were to target the actual missiles. The problem is that they tried to create a way to get them after separation, which is veritably impossible. A single missile can separate into many warheads. It's a simple task to confuse any anti-missile defense with fake warheads. AND, the missile defense tests couldn't even BEGIN to pass those tests. They failed even the basic concept of intercepting a single-missile warhead.<br>
<br>
The only way I could see SDI working is if we had subs stationed near potential nuclear threats (or had anti-missile bases in nearby countries) that could launch against the missiles *before* the warheads separate. That's also assuming we could ever actually get that part to work, of course.<br>
<br>
Now, about the Taliban. Sure they wanted the oil pipeline, and the Bush administration was hoping to cozy up to them to help get this done before 9-11. Note that there is a very tragic but almost entirely overlooked item in this. Early in the year last year, the chief of counter-terrorism at the FBI, responsible in general for tracking the various terrorist attacks around the world and specifically for keeping tabs on Osama bin Laden and his organization, *repeatedly* warned the Bush administration that Osama was in league with the Taliban government of Afghanistan and it should be addressed. The Bush administration ignored the warnings and, out of frustration and in a cruel sense of tragic irony, the counter-terrorism head of the FBI quit his job and went on to become the Chief of Security for the World Trade Center, where he died the day of the attacks.<br>
<br>
Another note about the Taliban- please remember that it is WE who put them in power in the first place. The USSR and US were playing with governments around the world, installing puppets, etc. Afghanistan happened to be a USSR puppet at the time. So, despite the fact that these guys stood against almost every freedom we believe in, we armed them to the teeth and send advisers to help them evict the Russians from Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
As for the statement that others in the world hate us because of &quot;opportunity&quot; that we have here, that is utterly without merit and overly prideful. Let me toss an analogy in here. Say Germany was having problems with Mexico, and we let them put a base in Texas, flying the German flag, with German trooops, etc. Wouldn't that be weird? Well, we do that all over the world to others. It has become part of the American psyche that this comes naturally to us now to do so.<br>
<br>
The reason others hate us is simple: whenever we help someone, there are always people on the other side who will hate us for it.<br>
<br>
Miltary spending: well, I should simply say here that our military often gets spending they DON'T WANT. That's right, they say they don't need something and it gets shoved down their throats anyway. Why? Well there's these folks in Congress called politicians. What they do is attach military spending bills to completely non-related legislation. &quot;Sure, let's pass this education bill. And oh by the way, here's a $50 million military item for my home district.&quot; The very definition of pork barrel politics. And who would speak up against spending on the military?<br>
<br>
If our politicians only listened to the military about what they want and need, we'd be better off. I'm much more apt to believe the military say they need something than a politican. That being said, we DO spend a lot of money in the right places.<br>
<br>
A final note about politics. Sure, the various morals and ethics of the presidents vary. I sure as hell would rather have Bush as a grandfather than Clinton. BUT, the actions of all administrations do very questionable things for what they considers reasons of national interest.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I've missed a few things and I am ignorant in a few areas but that's my take. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1582.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1582.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1582.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1582.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1582.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1582.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
