Serrik, you're in the wrong guild.<br>

No true RP-good guild would let dark elves join. Period. End of statement. Also, RP paladins who are tolerant of dark elves? Loadacrap, imho. Good and evil are both very very racist in Norrath, and if you're in a guild that doesn't subscribe to that fact, you're in a &quot;Politically Correct&quot; RP guild--heaven help you.<br>

On FV, a paladin CAN, in fact, be forever resentful of dark elves. Hell, most light guilds ENCOURAGE it!<br>

He might pity, dark elves, and he certainly wouldn't aid them if they were not converted, but refusing anything in need of help simply is not paladin-like.  Letting something die just because it's a different race is every bit as racist and as evil as..  *shrug*  a shadowknight.<br>
<br>
Does that mean should stand idly by as they rampage?  Hell no, he kicks their arses, BUT he gives them the chance to repent before he does...  Usually at the end of his sword.<br>
<br>
You can roleplay racist paladins of course, it's perfectly fine, but mercy is all part of being a knight.  If you don't have that you run into trouble. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=suometar>Suometar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/03 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4890.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The One Rule Needed</span><hr size=1> I play a Paladin. 65 levels and close to two years of RPing good, and not in the least tolerant of evil.

I love seeing all of them myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Knights/Protectors - the evil gods have no grip at all on them.  They can be taunted, riled, even brutally mauled and they'll always be grimly determined, but never hate.  Very adhering to a code of chivalry.  Has a deep seated urge to destroy the undead entirely and those who raise them.  Rarely ever engages a city in direct combat.  The gods most likely to produce them are Quellious, Mithaniel Marr and maybe Prexus.  They are more defenders than attackers, and enemies are something to be respected.  Vengeance is something to be dealt very sparingly, and when it is, dealt completely.  They tend to be very pious but interpret their god's will as best they can, not so much the word of it.<br>
<br>
Crusaders - very, very closely connected to what they think is their god's will.  Will charge into battle against hopeless odds if they think it serves the will of said god.  They feel the effects of the dark gods upon them but use that to their advantage (a paladin will use their hate of a dark elf, as wrong as it may be, to destroy that dark elf) and against what they perceive to be the aims of the dark gods.  Such a paladin can end up a partially unwitting servant of a dark god, but tends to just get more done than a knight would, and tends to be more vicious and willing in combat.  More often than not, they respect a good fight more than they respect the person fighting, and respect for the power of the enemy is easy to earn, if not for the enemy themselves.  The gods that I've seen produce these sorts of paladins IMO are Tunare, Erollsi Marr, and Karana, the gods and goddesses where there are usually deep seated principles at stake and long forged rivalries (such as Karanaite paladins and Bertoxxulites, Tunare and Innoruuk, and Erollsi Marr and Innoruuk/Cazic Thule).  They are attacker and defender in equal measure and will strike out at an opponent's city if need be.<br>
<br>
Cavaliers - they travel the world, not really staying in any one place or keeping to any particular loyalty, just generally taking company where they can.  You'll find them in bars and they tend to be the paladins with minor vices, but they are always good souls.  They can be very pious, or they can be less pious, but they'll always work towards their god's aims.  They are usually strict to a very clear code of chivalry and regard battles against the enemy as challenges which they must overcome.  They aren't required to be overly noble in anything, but they will always be good people, even if they can tend to be heart breakers.  The ones I've seen mostly are Brell, Bristlebane ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ) and Erollsi Marr and they tend to be the &quot;fun&quot; paladins.  They sometimes allow the effects of dark gods upon them, but are usually the ones with moral dilemmas about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Holy Warriors - you'll find these paladins roving around cities.  They tend to be loyal to god, race and country and will fight tooth and nail for it.  They again adhere to a code of honour, but they are not adverse to tearing up an enemy's home in an act of retribution.  They fiercely defend god, king and country and will die for any one of the three.  They are noble, steadfast people but will fight with all of their strength.  They rarely have mercy on an enemy, for if an enemy had mercy on them to begin with, they would not be fighting.  They can be very racist, but are the first to speak out if something in their own kingdom is amiss, and will turn their sword on anyone who defiles their sense of honour.  You tend to find them among Brell-ite and Tunarean paladins, with Karana as a lesser factor.  Mithaniel Marr has paladins that will be like this, but to a specific aligned city.  To them, anything that gives them greater power against their enemy, be it hate or fear, is good, as long as god, king and country remain safe.<br>
<br>
Fallen paladins - fallen paladins tend to revoke their god's will, or become agnostic.  They can also do terrible acts and their god will disown them until they prove themselves.  They don't tend to be paladins but due to EQ, they are.  A fallen paladin can usually be considered a warrior.  Very few paladins fall so far as becoming a virtual shadowknight.<br>
<br>
Before anyone says anything, no, I'm not trying to funnel people into specific examples of roleplay (someone's bound to try to tell me that I'm doing that).  I'm only pointing out what I think are the main types of paladin, and most paladins are a variation of them.  I personally think Baka is a knight myself but there you go.  They're all good paladins.  If EVERYONE was one type of paladin, what fun would it all be? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A> at: 9/25/03 10:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylfarin>Sylfarin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sylfarin/images/zlg-001_a.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/26/03 1:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4890.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The One Rule Needed</span><hr size=1> To all those that think your not &quot;role playing&quot; if your a good guild that tolarates evil races, I can only say....<br>

<br>
There are many reasons that one can use and as I and the guild I have created in the game grow, we will set examples for this, though the best example I can give is...<br>
<br>
Your out looking for a group in DSP, you want some acrylia ore and need to bash a few Tribals to get it.  You shout looking for group and a necro shouts back that you can join.<br>
<br>
Should the Paladin give up the quest to get the acrylia ore because he would have to group with a necro?  No.  The best quote for this is....<br>
<br>
&quot;The enemy of mine enemy is my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is a simple example, flame away and I will be more detailed...<br>

<br>
I have, in my rerolling career, played an Erudite Paladin that was very tolerant of Erudite Shadowknights, Clerics and Necromancers.   He was not a huge fan of any other races, especially those who were shorter than his kneecaps. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
He respected all Erudites as members of his race, because Erudites are the most scholarly of all peoples (he thought).<br>
<br>
It doesn't have to be good vs evil.  It can be a (in game) racial thing too.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it could be a class thing.  One could hate magic users ( a bit hard to do in Norrath).<br>
<br>
Anyways...there's my shovelful of dirt for the pile.<br>
