I thought it rather fitting to the debate however, and added the bit of the old man to the beginning.  Bear in mind that my original intent for this piece had nothing to do with EQ, and the term ‘warrior’ was intended to mean any fighting man or woman.))<br>
<br>
*The old man sat quietly in the shadows, listening to the words fly back and forth with such conviction.  He saw pieces of himself in his younger days in Shintou and the others, before the wisdom of age and the clarity of hindsight were bestowed upon him.  Finally, he rose to speak.*<br>
<br>
You are mistaken, dear Shintou.  In time, you will discover that which drives you to kill.  You will discover that which you love.  It may evade you until the moment of your own death….but in time, you will know.<br>
<br>
I am, indeed, a civilian now.  But any man, or woman, who has answered the calling within themselves to become a warrior, will be a warrior in their heart as long as they shall live.  Indeed they were born that way.  Such people are born destined to bear arms in defense of that which they hold dear.  Of course there are those people who enter the military profession for profit, for glory, or many other motives.  I speak not of these, but of true warriors.  Those who take up the warrior trade only to serve, asking not for riches or glory, or anything else in return.  They ask not even to return from the killing fields alive, but only to die well if they should fall.  These warriors are no better than others who take up the trade, nor do they hold themselves in any higher regard.  But these warriors do share a common trait among them, even though they may not even know it.<br>
<br>
What is the motivation for this warrior breed?  Do they fight and die in defense of homeland, countrymen, and loved ones?  Of course, but these things are only on the surface.  The true nature of their motivation lies much deeper.  From the first warrior to pick up a rock, to the warriors of present day, they fight for something lacking any substance, far more ethereal in nature than sacred soil or flesh and blood.  These warriors march to battle, ready to die, for nothing more than ideals, concepts, emotions, things that cannot be seen or held in the hand, but only in the heart.  In the end, it all comes down to one simple thing…love.<br>
<br>
Some would find this concept hard to understand, perhaps impossible.  For warriors must, and do, possess within themselves the ability to unleash extreme violence upon a fellow man.  To those looking in from the outside, who are not part of this warrior class, it is impossible to understand how such a thing can be called at will, focused on a specific target, then turned off again.  What could such a barbaric creature know of love?  How can those who wage war, brutally killing an enemy soldier without pause, even be capable of love?  <br>
<br>
As it always is with love, the answers are simple….yet quite complex.  No one ponders war with more fear than the warrior.  Not only for his own life, but also for what he will be called to do to another human being.  There is nothing glorious or romantic about killing to the warrior.  No one wishes for peace more than the warrior.  His greatest wish is that in standing prepared for war, those that would do evil things will be persuaded not to.  No conflict is ever started by the warrior.  But when the fight is engaged, he will answer the call to war.  And what can push a man in to battle against the enemy?  Hatred of his foe, anger, even blood boiling rage, cannot be sustained for long when steel and fire begin to fill the air around him.  These fuels are quickly expended in the face of ones own fragile mortality.  When a man sees his own blood on the ground, sees the shattered bodies of his comrades, when he feels his bowels constrict in fear, what else but love could sustain a man, give him the courage to press on in to the carnage and the face of death?  What else but love can persuade a man to disregard all notions of self preservation, to hold something else in higher regard than his own existence upon the earth?<br>
<br>
Be it love of country, of freedom, of his loved ones at home, or love of his fellow soldier, it is all love.  And though each love we feel may seem unique, they are truly all the same.  Each of these things we call love all come from a single source.  We cannot adequately define or understand this thing we call love.  We cannot control it or extinguish it.  We can not produce it or even mold it to our desires.  Love simply is.  All we can do is accept it within our hearts and let it guide us to greater achievements than we thought ourselves capable of.  And rather paradoxically, there is perhaps no one more accepting of, and guided by love than the seemingly savage, brutal being known as the warrior.<br>

Just as interested in wringing a few coins out of the pockets of the odd merchant as keeping the streets quiet at his post.  As he stands illuminated in the guttering smoking torchlight a quicksilver thin line slips down over his head and lifts him up so his toes barely scrape the cobbles.  He kicks and sputters, gasps, sags and finally dies and the shadow with her legs holding her form upside down from a roof top ledge hops down to rifle the dead guards pockets and purse.<br>
<br>
&quot;Love..&quot;  The wood elf girl begins.  &quot;I love the sound coins make when their swinging heavily in my purse and not yours.&quot;   She makes certain the fellow is finished by sliding a thin stilleto blade in through the guards eye socket with the brief sound of sharp metal scraping through bone and tissue.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love the sound of a lock when it clicks open to let me inside someplace I'm not allowed...&quot;<br>
<br>
She looks around a finds an old market crate to perch on, going through the dead guards belongings and sorting them in a pile in her lap.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love listening to secrets that I shouldn't know...&quot;  &quot;I love the stale air of an ancient tomb when I'm the first inside and nobody else has removed the best things.&quot;<br>
<br>
She pockets the best coins and leaves a little pile of coppers and silvers behind for the beggers and street urchins that work as her eyes and ears.  Firelight flickers off the dull gleam of metal as she pulls a rusty set of pliers out of her back pocket and gets to work on the dead guards gold fillings.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love being good at what i do...&quot;  &quot;I love taking the odd trophy and tacking it to the wall now and again as a reminder that I'm not to be trifled with.&quot;<br>
<br>
~crack..pop..spatter~ She wipes the pliers clean on the cloak of the dead and hefts the weight of the fellows gold teeth.  She leaves one behind with the coppers and silvers for the beggers and urchins to find as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love that there's more to be afraid of when your walking the streets of the cities alone at night besides ogres or trolls or tier dal or the odd undead...&quot;<br>
<br>
She reaches out and draws the very fabric of the shadows of the alley around herself...the sputtering torch hanging in it's iron rack on the wall going out.   Vanishing from view.<br>
<br>
&quot;...there's me.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=116.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showMessageRange?topicID=116.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=116.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=116.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=42><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=116.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=116.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=116.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
