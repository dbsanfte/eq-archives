After taking down Kirak Vil in Nek for a part of the paladin epic our 2 groups(fellowship of the wolf and crusaders reborn) decided to have some fun and raid Neriak. We were going to RP the raid as revenge for the attack on Akaanon and the attacks on Felwithe.  After spending 2 hours raiding and working our way past 3rd gate and into the mansion and more importantly the bar for a drink...we were getting ready to leave.  The raid had been fun and most rp'ed great. Lots of die lightbringers and then the you ruined our city comments made for a great time.<br>
We took care not to kill essentials such as bankers etc as we didn't want to grief the newbies there, we went only after guards and such with the exception of the bartender in the fancy who refused to serve us(how rude =/ <br>
We made our way back to the Foreign quater and were right by the zone line as our Wizard was tl'ing everyone out.<br>
There was only msyelf 52 paladin and him 51 wizard left when Mythrilia and another person(will go nameless as their officer apologized and so did he citing he was wrong) of the sisters of myth trained us. Luckily we made it out ok. After sending a tell to Vivienne the leaders of sisters of myth telling her the dishonor her guild member caused...she applauded her and said it was an okay thing to do.  I explained to Viv i had it logged and had no desire to post it or go to a gm, i just wanted an apology and that was it.  I basically got told she was happy it happened and that they rp evil so its okay to train(I'm sure other evil guilds like Ebon who are well respected will not agree with that). I didn't want to petiton to a gm but was forced too and have now sent them the logs so they can review them.  Several witnesses there who are DE's who also witnessed this have done the same.<br>
Then i get told that we were challenging noobs to duels which is just not true. As many witnesses there will attest. In fact most of the young ppl there loved us because we didn't loot a thing and let them loot all the bodies.  The one duel that was fought was when one of them challenged one of our clerics who procedded to then kill the challnger.  Now I will post the log so FV as a whole which is full of good people and great Roleplayers can judge for themselves if what happened was correct.<br>
I will start it from the point when we were porting out. At this point only myself and azindar my wiz friend were left<br>

Now I'll post these rude comments we made.<br>
A member of our raid shouted &quot;Well we've killed their guards and citizens, pillaged their city, drank their beer and zxcded<br>
in their fountains its time to come home.<br>
Another rude quote was <br>
Paying 50pp to anyone in zone who can beat Blizards pet in a duel.<br>
Or howabout when we shouted out &quot;this place is so inhospitable wouldn't even serve us a beer&quot;<br>
I will be more then happy to send the log of the entire nite to whoever would like to see it(didn't post whole thing because its 2hours worth).  <br>
What really irks me is that they didn't even have the courage to train the raid force but waited until only 2 of us were left.<br>
So I'll let FV's good ppl decide on this matter.<br>
And in the meantime beware Sisters of Myth and their leader Vivieene supposed roleplayers, they are among the most dishonrable ppl I ever met who encourage training others during raids.  <br>

<br>
And when you confronted an officer with what had happened, she brushes you off, saying that the training of mobs should be applauded because of RP issues.<br>
<br>
And then calls you a whinner to top it off.<br>
<br>
As stated before, and will be stated many times after, training is wrong - dont do it. And if you're gonna do it, have the balls to say you did to spite someone, and not hide behind a curtain of supposed &quot;Roleplay.&quot; Sure, you can claim to RP for reasons to train, but come on, who are you kidding?<br>
<br>

I wasn't there.  And I'm really too lazy to read that log.  But I am wondering why you were logging in the first place.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
In any case, I know Vivienne.  I am with Vivienne every day.  And she's a damn fine roleplayer.  Even people who hate Vivienne respect the person behind her.  You may not think she's good at RP, but oh well.  This coming from a guy who calls people &quot;bro.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't want to rag on your guilds.  The truth is I don't know them very well.  But if I think of good RPing guilds, I think of Saga, League of Shadows, Conclave of the Damned, (biased vote of Circle of Sisters and Clan of Brothers), and yes, the Sisters of Myth.  Among others.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that Fellowship of the Wolf and Crusaders Reborn aren't good RPing guilds, because I just don't know anyone in those guilds.  And my lack of experience with these guilds is the reason I won't call them bad roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Where do you get off calling someone and her guild bad roleplayers when the experience you've had with them equates to a /tell conversation with one and about two or three minutes with one on your screen?  have you spent any time actually RPing with any of the Sisters of Myth?  I have, and they're very good.  Your opinion of someone's RP style is based upon an almost totally OOC conversation.  That's all kinds of [messed] up.<br>
<br>
So, I'm not going to form an opinion about this matter before I hear both sides of this story.  Apparently Vivienne was fed with information that conflicts with yours.  She can only go on what she hears from her guild and those who were speaking with her about it.  If they say something different from what you do, who is she to believe?  Someone who sends her a tell accusing a member of her guild of some wrongdoing before becoming hostile and calling her a bad roleplayer?  Or should she believe the people she actually knows?<br>
<br>
I know who I'd go with.<br>
<br>
You are the kind of player I despise.  You're in your 50s.  Big [freakin'] whoop.  Does that give you the right to look down at people a few levels your junior by calling them bad roleplayers and telling them to &quot;go kill some bats&quot;?  I think not.  Take that chip off your shoulder before you piss off the wrong person and they take it off for you.  A little modesty is a good thing.  Remember that.<br>
<br>
I'm still trying to figure out why you had your log running in the first place.  I only log when I know something interesting is going to happen. <p><P>Jaranna<BR>

I just dont see the point of getting GMs involved if no one died and no exp was lost. Sure training is wrong and nasty and a low tactic. <br>
<br>
There are two sides to each story and I am sorry for passing judgment before I hear Viviennes. She prolly was being fed wrong information and was standing for her guild.But you are acting like some huge wrong has been done to you. I dont see Vivienne not appologizing for her guild mates actions as right. She should have. <br>
<br>
But no real wrong was commited. Training happens because of people. If people are at fault here, its the two Myth members that should have action taken against them. Vivienne just stood up for her Sisters. Period.<br>
<br>
Dont bring RP into this either. Its pointless. I agree that RPing is damn important on this server. But Viv does RP well. <br>
<br>
But hell, no one is perfect.

Idiots. Whether Vivienne is a good RPer or not is irrelevant. Her response to members of her guild violating EQ policies and CAUSING EXPERIENCE LOSS was pathetic. <br>
<br>
So, roleplay away, Vivienne, but at least hold your guild accountable for responsible behavior. Remember the raid on Ak'Anon? At least the trainers during that raid realized their error and apologized.<br>
<br>
Edit: I must add that  /shouting zonewide insults never helps a matter, so in the future, I would advise the victims of such behavior to keep their cool and handle it in private channels <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Training however is WRONG.  Deathly wrong.  While any OOC insults from either side are wrong, the raid essentially did nothing that was out of the ordinary.  They came in, killed a few non critical background NPCs, and did about the same that any other city raid would do.  Yelled a few shouted insults etc etc etc.  Sure, challenge it if you will, duel them.<br>

However, making excuses for training, and the act of training itself are indeed wrong.  Entirely.  Regardless of which party started it, the anvil is over the head of the Sisters of Myth here and rightly so.<br>

Absolutely nothing against Vivienne OOC.  She's a great roleplayer and a real joy to roleplay with and talk to.

<br>
But as for dismissing the complaint based on the fact a log was running?  Huh?<br>
<br>
I log the entire time I am online.  I started doing so shortly after starting up on FV.  I log so I can go back over stuff for my own amusement (trip down memory lane for some events), remember someone's name (I am absolutely horrid at names), work things into an IC story (using the log to get the dialog as it was.. mine &amp; whomever else's), or just to use up space on my drive.  Eventually, I might even start parsing the log for OOC information on damage dealt and other such.  Oh... and I will even occassionally use my log to remember some element of some quest that I have basically completely forgotten.  Logging does not mean you expect or intend bad things to happen.  Heck, it could be the good thing that was spontaneous that you just happened to catch.  Ever wish you had a camera to catch just that right pose that only happens for a brief moment?  Well, since EQ is mostly text, that's what a log is... <br>

However, even if the &quot;why were you logging&quot; question was relevant:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   I only log when I know something interesting is going to happen. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Umm... I think most would agree an epic encounter is interesting?<br>
<br>
Tip1: If you want to defend your friend, try sticking to the issues at hand. <br>
<br>
Tip2 for Jaranna: You look <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more intelligent</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> if you read the log first, then post.<br>

as for duels the SoM will turn you down if you're above them and flaunt the rules that bind them in your face.<br>
<br>
I suggest hunting them down in the Arena at such time as you need to resolve RP conflict issues.<br>
<br>
And on the last sidenote you need to ask viv to go OOC before you can resolve anything.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 506<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/02 10:27:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sister of Myth...dishonored and griefers</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And on the last sidenote you need to ask viv to go OOC before you can resolve anything. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Bullpoo. A seasoned, mature player should not have to be requested to respond to an OOC issue OOCly. I've led guilds, and issues of training are ALWAYS severe enough to warrant an OOC discussion. If Vivienne is so stuck in RP that she can't see the OOC implications of training enough to break RP for the sake of open discussion, then she might be a &quot;great roleplayer,&quot; as you all say, but she's a shitty &quot;player.&quot; A good player knows when it's time to RP and when it's time to go OOC.<br>
<br>
Edit: I really, really hate it when someone hides behind roleplay as a reason for being an asshole. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 9/4/02 10:29:04 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=19.topic&start=221&stop=231>12</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showPrevMessage?topicID=19.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showNextMessage?topicID=19.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.threadControl?topicID=19.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=19.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49>Apep's Dead Horse Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
