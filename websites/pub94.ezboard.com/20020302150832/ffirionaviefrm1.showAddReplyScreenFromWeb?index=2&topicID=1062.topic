<br>
I have one or two people I really don't want to have much to do with.  I haven't even /ignored them, so far.  I have encountered one guild which seems to have a bizarre mix of folks - My encounters with folk from that guild have both high positive and high negative ratings, very dynamic.<br>
<br>
There is a tendancy to be wary after a bad experience with someone.  We all have it to one degree or another.   But if other folk in a guild, including the officers of course, at least *try* to deal with a specific case, then a good faith effort can go far to alleviating any long term considerations of dealing with that group of folk, even if an individual there becomes a no-no.<br>
<br>
But it's impossible to screen out all the loonies, no matter how hard you try.  And if you try too hard, you won't ever recruit to begin with.<br>

<br>
Some, like F&amp;F and Clan Were, have level restrictions on them and so limit their applicants, but most of the others that I am familiar with do not.  In the 20-30 level range, there are a fair number of unguilded folks out there.  <br>
<br>
My regular hunting partner and I have been looking for a guild to call home for a while, especially since finding groups is becoming less easy.  Surprisingly, this has not been a simple task – many of the guilds we are interested in (won’t mention names) are insular enough that it’s tough to get to know the members.<br>

Aye, we have hard times finding people to join, but we don't want to be a large guild, either.

<br>
I see it like this, if you apply for a guild and they say 'your too low' and you stop searching and wait to re-apply, then if I was an officer, I wouldn't recruit you.  But if you are a level 3-4 and a guild says your too low but you keep looking, many guilds will take you in.<br>

It is my opinion that even if one of us were given Kudos for something that we find no big deal, we pass it up. This person did not, but gave reason why Kudos werent necessary for my actions. I personally appreciated the fact the the Kudos Bearer would post his appreciation as he did because it was way out of my way. Did i expect Kudos?...No, but being i recieved them felt good and i enjoyed it. And the other poster lessened it by his post...so i thought id make a post here to explain that. My post main reason seems to be lost in the text...which is simply the guild leaders are not required to fix their guildmembers screwups. and if one goes out of his way to correct a wrong...it would be wise to give him respect.

I can’t seem to understand that statement.  May I ask why you would be unwilling to recruit him?<br>
<br>
It seems to me that if someone really likes your guild, asks to join, is told that they are too low, levels up and asks again, they would be the perfect addition.  Wouldn’t they be a better choice than someone who joins another guild until they are the appropriate level and then jumps ship?  And what is the difference between that person and the guy who IS the appropriate level and asks to join for the first time?<br>
<br>
&gt;Check out the Guilds and Associations thread at the bottom<br>
&gt; of this site's homepage. You may find some good<br>
&gt; information about guilds, and which one would be good for<br>
&gt; you. <br>
<br>
That and Firiona-Via.com were my first stops when I started looking a few weeks back.  Great resources.  I’m pretty clear on where I want to be, which is why I didn’t want to name names.  I didn’t mean my post above to be a cry for help (re-reading it, it seems that way though), just a statement on how surprisingly difficult it has been to contact the guild in question, find officers, etc.<br>
<br>
I was just struck by one of the points in this thread which seemed to indicate that recruiting was an issue – again, it seems to me that about 50% of the 20-30 crowd (prime guilding age, I reckon) are unaffiliated, so I found that to be a bit strange.<br>

Damage control is vital to reputation, reputation is vital to well a whole lotta stuff expecially if you're leading a guild. Your responce to the incident that I watched was quick and the resolution was fair. I'd assume the same of whatever Imm posted Kudo's for. It's nice to see that you've respect for your guild, and are willing to deal with the hastles of haveing folk that don't bring respect to your guilds name. <br>
<br>
You're quick and to the point, do you have to be ? No. <br>
<br>
Do you have to be if you don't want your guild's name sullied ? Yes <br>
<br>
Do you know this and act promptly to correct problems that arrise ? Yes <br>
<br>
Is that something that is commendable ? Yes <br>
<br>
Do I in any way mean to demean you ? No<br>

If you feel that in some way I've wronged you by noting that you were quick to damage control and you seemed to have your hands full with it.<br>

As to recruiting, our clan is looking for melle types, warriors, rangers, paladins, monks, rouges and I suppose shadow knights as well.  We have opened our doors to include ANY alighnmet, our clan is one of order and balance, to have that orderly balance you need light and dark.  Our leader added the level limit after much consideration on the matter.<br>
<br>
At any rate I know what you mean Helmgest about being insular.  I know a number of people that are friends out side the clan, but they are guilded and i rarely if ever group with anyone out side Clan Werre.  I hadn't thought of it much before but I need to get out and group with people I don't know for the fun of it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
