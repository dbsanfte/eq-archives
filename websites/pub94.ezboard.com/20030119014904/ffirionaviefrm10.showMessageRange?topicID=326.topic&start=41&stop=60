I got the following story in my e-mail today and my decision was made. This tale just fits too perfectly with the direction I was taking Isharra  to pass up (I had already been farming Iksar faction for Isharra to study in Cabilis), and I already knew Voskor from previous positive RP experiences. Thank you to all of you who responded with such wonderful tales. I'm so proud to be on a server with all of you. So, without further ado, I present the winner:<br>
 <br>
~~~~~~~Voskor Oth's Bid~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Voskor strolled unconcernedly down the cobbled street, his cloak thrown back to prominently display the hilt of his sword in easy reach. One hand dangled near it in idle, automatic precaution; the other was occupied with a skewer of elf kabobs he'd purchased for a few copper after terrifying the meat merchant into more &quot;reasonable prices.&quot; It was hot, but that was about all that could be said for it. Needed more spice.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're sure you don't want one, Crow?&quot; he smirked without looking back. He knew perfectly well what the answer was; his squire had some irrational difficulty thinking of his enemies as meat. Which was fine; as long as he realized they were at least enemies, he was reliable enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;No thank you sir,&quot; the smallish young Vah Shir panther drawled with his peculiar accent but perfectly enunciated Iksar, and reshouldered his load. Sacks of various supplies and smithing materials, and a basket full of pottery clay for himself. Skaska needed some new mixing bowls back home.<br>
<br>
Voskor barely afforded the slave pens a second glance as they walked by; Cabilis had plenty of Froglok slaves to do menial work, and he had . . . well, Crow. But for whatever reason, something caught his eye as he'd almost passed the last set of pens, and he stopped abruptly. Crow stumbled and almost ran over him. Shooting him an exasperated 'pay more attention' sideways glance, the Iksar warrior sauntered over to the pen, snicking another piece of elf off the skewer with his teeth.<br>
<br>
&quot;How much?&quot; he asked bluntly, awkwardly working his throat around the hyuman words. He spat a bit of fat on the ground and wiped his mouth with the back of his free hand before reaching out to grab the elf woman by the chin so he could see her face. As the slaver rambled on his sales pitch, he paid him only half attention, narrowing his eyes as he examined the wares.<br>
<br>
It looked familiar, that was it, but he couldn't seem to immediately place where he'd seen it before. No, she, not it, he reminded himself. It had those mounds of flesh on its chest, so it must be a she. He'd seen a few males with similar mounds but they were invariably overweight. This one wasn't. He chewed on the elf kabob noisily and released her, interrupting the slaver abruptly to ask, &quot;Where did you get her?&quot;<br>
<br>
When Warslik's Woods was the response, his eyes went first wide then narrow with anger, and a sibiliant warning hiss escaped his throat. He reached for his sword. Krowen hastily dumped his packs on the ground and tugged a dagger from his boot, palming it so the blade lay flat against his forearm, and watched his master carefully for the first move.<br>
<br>
But Voskor didn't draw. He kept his hand on the hilt, the blade loosed and ready within its scabbard, but he refrained from the actual spilling of blood. Yet. Instead, he leaned in close, having to turn his head slightly to get the desired distance without letting his snout actually touch the creature. &quot;Poaching slaves within sight of the gates of Cabilis?Brave, Softskin, very brave... or stupid.&quot; He touched the sharp end point of the skewer against the slaver's throat, applying just enough pressure to see the pulse hammering against it, but not enough to break the skin. &quot;And how many Iksar hatchlings,&quot; he jabbed a little harder, drawing a single drop of blood, &quot;have you similarly 'single-handedly captured,' hnnnn?&quot; He rotated the skewer between his fingers, drilling against the<br>
slaver's neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;What's going on, Voskor?&quot; Crow hissed nervously in Iksar. He only spoke the barest smattering of hyuman, as Voskor had had opportunity to teach him while travelling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet,&quot; Voskor snapped shortly in the same tongue. &quot;I'll explain later.&quot;<br>
<br>
Back to the slaver, as he stood back and withdrew the skewer, drawing the last piece of meat from it with his teeth and taking a moment to lick the man's blood from the end of the rod. &quot;Well?&quot; he demanded.<br>
<br>
Upon the slaver's assurance that no no, none at all I swear, sire, I wouldn't take Iksar, the warrior smirked and turned briefly to dig a pouch out of one of Krowen's packs. It was a display of utter disregard, showing his back after threatening another's life; he trusted Fear to guard him.<br>
<br>
He rose, coins jangling lightly in the pouch and not nearly as many as he was sure the man wanted for his wares, and dangled it by the drawstring on one claw in front of his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll give you this,&quot; he stated, jerking the pouch away abruptly as grubby hands tried to grab for it, &quot;in exchange for the elf wench, AND your word that you will never defile Iksar land again with your stench. If I find otherwise - and I have my sources, oh yess,&quot; he allowed the slight hiss out; it seemed to unsettle the ape creatures when he did that, &quot;...if I find otherwise, I'll make a point of tracking you down and gutting you.&quot;<br>
<br>
He traced the end of the skewer from the man's crotch to his chin, and made a show of licking the remnants of elf meat from his scaly lips. &quot;And then perhaps I'll give your remains to the Nihilists to play with. They like experimenting with fresh bodies.&quot;<br>
<br>
The notion of being perpetually skewered and then reanimated was apparently too much for the man, and he gibbered agreement, snatching the offered coins as the best offer he was going to get, and dropping the bracelet at the Iksar's feet with a clatter. Voskor cast aside the skewer and stooped to pick it up, regarding it with a somewhat disdainful sniff.<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't have to use this now, will I?&quot; he asked the elf, smirking. &quot;Get my irons ready, Crow, this will need to be branded.&quot;<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
He marked her on the neck, the simple five-tined circular insignia of the Iksar Empire, with the small rune of the Skathris Ven'Sho contained within, after binding her securely and removing the collar to get at the pale scaleless skin. The operation was painful but professionally quick, a sudden touch of hot iron to searing flesh and then nothing, as the wound was instantly cauterized. He let her get on with whatever screaming she needed to get out of her system, then knelt beside her as Krowen put the smithing tools away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now listen here, elf,&quot; he started. &quot;I remember you. Had a little attitude on you, didn't you, that night in Karnor's Keep.&quot; He nodded, almost to himself. &quot;But you did good work. I'd hate to see you relegated to playing concubine to some fat merchant. Waste of perfectly good talent.&quot;<br>
<br>
He touched one claw to her neck, not directly on the fresh brand - he wasn't that much a sadist - but near it. &quot;I saved you from any one of a thousand worse fates than that,&quot; he noted. &quot;You owe me. You belong to the Empire now, that's what that mark means. You don't cover it. Any citizen who sees that will know you belong to us. You cover it up, he'll just kill you. And then the Nihilists get to play with YOUR body.&quot;<br>
<br>
He glanced at the slave collar, picked it up and dangled it from his fingers. &quot;I'm not going to use this. Don't trust it.&quot; To make that point, he tossed it into the still-burning forge, along with the controller, then raised one pale eyeridge at his captive. &quot;I shouldn't HAVE to use it.&quot; He drew his sword and cut the bonds that held her down. The naked blade dared<br>
her to defy him and run.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your first duty,&quot; he intoned, pointing at Krowen, &quot;is to teach him how to speak hyuman. And your elf tongue, while you're at it. He's good with words. He'll teach you Iksar if you don't know it already - you'll need to.<br>
<br>
&quot;After that,&quot; he shrugged, sheathing his sword, &quot;you are free to do as you like. But you will treat any Cabilisian with the respect due him, and you will assist him as he requires of you. If your status as property of the Empire is questioned, you will tell them that you owe your continued existance to Voskor Oth and you wear his brand. If I require you personally, you'll know.<br>
<br>
&quot;And if you betray me... I'll know.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/25/02 2:52:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Home Sweet Home</span><hr size=1> The chipped adobe walls of the slave quarters were oppressive as Isharra neatly folded a scrap of blanket and placed it on the tattered straw mattress that was now her bed. Her hair was pulled back with a piece of twine to ensure that the mark on her neck was visible to all she encountered. Around her frogluks hurried about their various duties, speaking occasionally in their strange tongue.  The *flap flap* of their webbed feet thudding against the dirt floor filled her ears. <br>
<br>
Not one had stopped to notice the strange creature in their midst, so preoccupied were they with serving their Iksar masters. The smell of fear mingled with her own body odor, and she placed her hands on her hips, longing for a bath. Voskor had not returned to see her since brusquely dumping her off at the slave quarters, and her eyebrow twitched in irritation. The warrior obviously didn't know a thing about &quot;softskin&quot; hygiene. He probably didn't care. <br>
<br>
&quot;I can't live like this!&quot; she grumbled under her breath, her emerald eyes scanning the dim interior of the room. The frogs ignored her, hopping past as if she didn't exist. She glanced back at the mattress on the floor with a grimace; it was designed for a froglok--about four spans too short to support her long, lithe frame.  And she was nearly naked, too. Voskor had taken her gear and belongings with him when he left, leaving only her shift to cover the &quot;mounds of flesh&quot; on her chest.  Softskin, indeed! He had her armor! Sighing, she settled back on her haunches to think. <br>
<br>
She was no longer her own. Voskor had indeed saved her from worse fates---at least as far as she could reason---and she was not about to give him reason to believe that Koada'Dal were without honor. So fleeing was not an option (nor was it likely possible).  But she also could not stand to remain enclosed in this midden pile of slave housing without going completely insane. What to do? <br>
<br>
An anguished croak caught her attention, and the healer in her responded immediately as a frogluk keeled over across the room. The rest of the slaves simply walked around or over the fallen form. None stopped to help. Isharra scrambled to kneel beside it, her magic probing the creature, locking onto its irregular, fading heartbeat. There was nothing she could do for this one, she realized sadly, as it blinked bulbous, terrified eyes at her. Swallowing back the sudden swelling in her throat, she lifted the limp frogluk with a grunt and carried it to her mattress. She lowered it onto the it carefully and did what she could to numb the pain as the life faded from its eyes. Her powers could knit wounds and even revive death, but the creature's spirit had to have the will to live, even an ounce, for her powers to work. This one had nothing to live for; it shuddered once and lay still. <br>
<br>
The room seemed suddenly quiet. She looked up from the corpse to see the frogluks stopped, watching her. Their expressions were unreadable, and the moment only lasted an instant before they continued on their way, but something had gotten their attention. Then, two small frogluks hopped forward, retrieved the corpse from her mattress, and bounced away. <br>
<br>
Isharra sat for a moment, her brow knitted in solemn contemplation. She would have to retain her worth if she were to remain alive among the Iksar, or else die an anonymous, lonely death. Something bit her scalp and she scratched her head, cursing softly. She would also have to find a way to convince Voskor that she could not function efficiently living in these conditions, with frogluks as bed mates. She would not make demands of her master; that would end badly, but she had to find a way to persuade him.  After all, if she were going to be a pet, then she'd prefer being a favorite pet, and for now, that was her goal.<br>
<br>
For now, she would just bide her time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 7/25/02 3:13:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/28/02 9:01:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flight from Felwithe</span><hr size=1> <br>

For a while now, I've felt like my muse has left me and I've been writing on pure will alone. You writers will understand what I mean. Sometimes the words just flow out of you easily, and I call that writing with my muse, but that hasn't been the case for about a year now. I wish she'd come back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So, your compliments are encouraging to me, since every word I type is sort of a struggle.

It had been too long since I had seen my father, and for all I knew, he believed me dead. So, the Lord of Dreams used his powers to restore me to the flesh with one final warning that he knew not what sort of side effects could result from being restored to life from the world of Dreams.<br>
<br>
So, my eyes flutter open to see a room, apparently in an inn, and hopefully an inn in Felwithe. I rise, unsure of how I will appear in physical form, since in Lord Thule's realm I could wear whatever I conjured in my mind. I look down at myself and chuckle, shaking my head and rolling my eyes. &quot;Very funny, my lord,&quot; I grumble, patting down the multi-colored fabric of my new jester's tunic.<br>
<br>
Looking around the room, I find a small pack of essentials: food and drink and, har dee har har, a jester's cap. A groan escapes my lips, but I can't help but smile. <br>
<br>
A short walk to the bank and back to the inn and I'm clothed more appropriately for a day in court, dressed in dark green silk with a dropped waist and a belt of pearls. I dress before the mirror, thinking I don't look so bad for a dead woman,  when my eyes slip down to the black stain on my neck--the brand of the Iksar Empire. A chill flowing through me, I lift my hand and knock twice on the wooden washstand. <br>
<br>
Presently, out of the corner of my eye I glimpse something moving in the mirror. Startled, I swing about, but nothing seems to be there. My imagination, of course, or at least that's what I tell myself. <br>
<br>
Strapping a dainty purse to my belt and draping my shoulders in a burgundy shawl, I realize how late it is getting. Nightfall will soon arrive, and I haven't even begun the walk for my father's manse. It will be a late night, I realize, but after dreaming for such a long time, it will be nice to be awake and gaze upon the real stars once more.<br>
<br>
I pay the innkeep on my way out, and he greets me with surprise. He had not known I was staying at the inn, and the room I claim to have rented had been out of order for quite a while. But he'll take my coin anyway, if I insist, and he thanks his Lady with great humility, and I leave, uncomfortable with his bowing and scraping.  I'd forgotten what it was like to be treated like a Lady of the court.<br>
<br>
My steps carry me down the lane and toward the grander estates of Felwithe. I am about to turn up the cobbled roadway that leads to my father's estate when I spy a nude elf, walking along with some scrolls under his arm, as if nothing were extraordinary about his garb---or lack thereof. I feel my cheeks pinken and I try not to stare, but he catches my eye and nods to me cheerfully, then continues on his way. This is when I notice that there are others walking past him, not even glancing his way. I pause in my journey and stare in earnest now, for some sign that someone else finds a nude elf walking down the center of the street a bit odd. But no one else seems to notice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What has happened to my fair city?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I wonder, stunned, as I tear my eyes from the elf. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> I've been away much too long, </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I muse as I hurry up to the doorway of my father's----and my---home.<br>
