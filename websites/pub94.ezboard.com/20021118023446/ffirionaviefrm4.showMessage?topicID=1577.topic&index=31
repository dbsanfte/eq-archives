&quot;For those who have decided to stop RPing &quot;by the book&quot;... In EQ, we do not have a GM. We only have a book. It tells us what is possible and what the history of the world is. Just as in a PnP RP game, if you ignore it the game gets VERY ridiculous, VERY quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
(steppin totally ooc here)<br>
<br>
If there is anythying I cannot abide, it is a RP *PLAYER* telling another player what is and is not possible,based on 'the book'. We are creating a world and not following some script.  That is the primary reason I would re-tool all of my NPCs and monsters years ago when I used to DM D&amp;D. I hate the jerks who would tell me (the gm) that &quot;this monster isn't that strong, isnt says so right here in  my copy of Fiend Folio!&quot; THE driving force behind good Rp is imagination. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Bert is not the god of naturally paced decomposition. Bertox is not the god of compost, for chrissake.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you are so hung up on playing the book, perhaps you should trot on over to Allakhazam and read the opening text for the Gnome Sk newbie quests. It pretty clearly indicates that from the Gnomish POV Bertox is indeed the God of Compost.  (I would paste in the relevant tex, however it appears AllaK is down at the moment.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Bertox will only be happy when the entire world is a diseased, decaying heap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course he will, so will Poxy. From her POV the entire  world of Norrath is obsolete and imperfect. The time has come for the entire thing to decay away into compost What grows out of it is not her concern, though I am sure she feels that watever does replace it will also quickly become obsolete and in need of removal.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no WAY a druid would consent to that, unless he in some way lost his mind and started fighting against his own kind.&quot;<br>
<br>
:shrug: depends on the attitude of the particular Druid I imagine.. I am certainly not going to force other players to RP the way *I* think the script should be written... getting surprised is what makes MPG RPing fun. I would think that at least a few Druids could feel that Bertox is necessary as the God of ALL disease and decay, natural AND unnatural. It is feasible that while I am sure they all agree he needs to be kept in check and under control, some also feel he is a necessary aspect of their world view, and should not be obliterated.<br>
<br>
Get your nose out of the 'book'. It is a guideline not a script.  There is tons of text in-game even that amends and contradicts the common held 'official view of the history of Norrath.&quot; If some players choose to have their characters believe that information instead of what is in the Prima Guides, that is their business, not yours. You might find some of their roleplay uncovering aspects of the world that you were previously unaware of.<br>
<br>
Your attitude reminds me of the Brian character from the Knights of the Dinner Table comic series.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
The Player of Poxy<br>

<br>
SO DO I, Poxy! Please see my comment about the GM always being right.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that in the case of EQ, there IS no GM. So you are forced to either take the background that EQ gives you as fact, or make up your own. If everyone made up their own background, they would no longer be roleplaying WITH each other: they would start roleplaying AT each other.<br>
<br>
Without a consistent worldview, it's absurd to even try to roleplay with others. <p>Jebbar Godsbane<BR>

<br>
&quot;Without a consistent worldview, it's absurd to even try to roleplay with others.&quot;<br>
<br>
*shrugs blithely*  That's one kind of roleplay.  I suppose it could be said that I RP a freak - I've never run into any other Neutrals who view the world as a Balance like I do.  I've run into only one other Druid Halfling who regards the connections between the Halfling and Troll/Ogre/Teir'Dal communities as perhaps tense but accepted - it does indeed say in The Book that the only racial tensions Halflings have are with Iksar, due to the extensive trading community the Halflings have built.<br>
<br>
But simply because I'm unique, that doesn't mean my roleplay is any less than that of those who follow The Book.  I got snarled at when I jokingly threatened to throw fruit at Master Apep to keep him entertained.  I've been held up by my throat, nearly killed on several accounts, sneered at and mocked, proven myself and garnered respect by Dark and Light communities alike, been overly proud and bit off a piece of a Teir'Dal's ear (much to his fury, especially when I refused to heal it back on), told my Good former friends that I was no longer a friend of theirs but a foe....  what is this, if not roleplay?  It's coherant - it works.<br>
<br>
You have a good point about roleplaying at each other - if one were to wander around looking for pick-up groups, this certainly would be the case.  Having a completely different and even freakish character would be extremally confusing.<br>
<br>
If one were to stick with a certain community, however, different roleplay is cherished and makes perfect sense.  The Light communities I once fought and played with know that I walk the Dark path.  The Dark communities know my character's beliefs and faith, and so her turning to the Darkness makes sense.  Just using my character as an example, as there are many others who use the same tactics that I do in terms of who they hunt with, associate themselves with, et cetera.<br>
<br>
It all depends on what kind of game you want to play, I would think.<br>

<br>
Ok, now here  is the intersesting point: there are multiple backrounds that EQ provides, it seems to me like you are deciding only one of them is 'official&quot;. I have already commmented on how your statement that Bertox is not the God of Compost is contradicted in-game.. lets deal with your two other examples.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can roleplay the captain of a starship who just happened to crashland on Norrath and is apalled at the level of technology here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, this one I am unsure of, but I seem to recall some bit of in-game lore that indicated that the first visitors to Luclin from Norrath were on-board a gnomish ship built to carry them there.  One could certainly play a returned/shipwrwecked member of such a ship... of course I would expect such a PC to be Gnomish, and to be a master tinkerer as soon as possible.  I could be wrong here though, I might be misremembering a bit of player fiction I stumbled across sometime in the past.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can roleplay a happy bunny Teir'Dal who wouldn't hurt a soul. Problem is, all that roleplay is in my head.&quot;<br>
<br>
This I do know... In Neriak Third Gate, inside the Villa Tragic, there is a well maintained chapel of Tunare (and I bet 99 out of 100 players who go through Neriak never even notice it).  Who maintains it? Happy bunny Tier'Dal I expect, though for obvious reasons I am sure they try to keep well hidden.<br>
<br>
So, two out of three of your &quot;impossibities according to the book&quot; are contradicted by in-game lore, and the chances are pretty good that the third one is as well.<br>
<br>
What your are regarding as the 'official' EQ backround is really only the stereotyped history that the general population of Norrath believes in.  If you want your character to toe that line and think that all PCs who deviate from it are insane, that is your choice, but as a Player, you really have no grounds to be making judgements on another player's RP based on those stereotypes<br>
<br>
Again, Respectfully..<br>

For one thing, working within the guidelines allows a significant number of us to work in the same direction, which creates a true community RP feeling - something that's not possible if we all decide to make up whatever the heck we want to do.  But mainly, I feel it's a greater test of our skills and originality, to be original and interesting while still limiting oneself to the racial guidelines.<br>
<br>
That said, I have great respect for someone like Cronadan, who has learned the dark elf culture VERY well, and THEN decided to rebel against it, and has put a hell of a lot of work into doing so - I shudder to think how many hours he spent doing faction quests to convince the light races to trust him.  I have very little respect for a_necromancer_01 who wakes up one morning in Neriak and decides to giggle and hand out rat kebabs to passing paladins for no apparent reason, with no story to explain it and no faction work or similar effort to back up the persona.  And I consider this the greatest success of Zildrax and the Skathris Ven'Sho - they learned about the Iksar culture, and built their RP society on that framework, which has been elaborated and enhanced by all of them, resulting in an amazing benefit to our community here.  How terrible it would have been for all of us if the Skathris had never existed, and Iksar went around randomly deciding they would be 'good' today.<br>
