a catholic, I think that many things they do are warped and disgusting, Like this once I was in school and they made us watch this gorey video about abortion.. I have watched some gorey things in my time have not even cringed (Hannibal, night of the living dead and Evil Dead) but this was by far the *MOST* disgusting thing I have seen in my life. And I actually considered going over to the person that brought the film in and kick their ass for showing kids 7-18 that video.. I dont like it when people try to scare others into beliveing their own beliefs..<br>
<br>
Also I am disgusted by the untrue sterotypes that some peoples are shown, such as the muslims.. I have quite a few muslim friends (being Scotish/turkish) at birth, And know of them thought &quot;Oh, im glad the americans died on 9/11&quot; they were as freaked about it as anyone else, even to the point of angered how he tried to use the religion as a sheild for his insanity.. And I am sick to my stomache when I hear people say things like &quot;Stupid turban wearing muslim fudgepackers&quot; or &quot;The muslims are planning to wage war on us&quot; Well that is as crazy as saying that the catholic church paints their face blue and howls at the moon.. (no offence to religions that follow that)<br>
<br>
If you ask me, I think that their should be no churches at all and they should be banned, no &quot;named&quot; religions and that everyone does their beliefs in private.. That way no one will get in fights.. Why cant people all just live in peace? like that John lenan song? ... *sighs* people make me mad..<br>
<br>
Finnaly.. As for myself, I have started my own religion called Gavenism.. (hehe named it after my toon) And I belive that their might be a being or someone like that, or even other kinds of magic, or magic creatures inhabiting the earth.. (vampires, demons ect) Also to be a good Gavenist you must be tollerant to everyone and try to be nice to everyone. And what do you ask is my belief in heaven and hell? Well if their is a god, dont you think he would pick a nice guy that never wanted to hurt anyone and belives in love, or a fanatic that blows themselfs up into buildings and killing people? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Commoner's Chevalier</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/7/02 3:22:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=745.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Personally I think..</span><hr size=1> hehe...gotta applaud Kaileena for standing up when many would crap on ya for it, and i feel for ya Siokitty( hehe...i remember similar things my parents did.) <br>
<br>
Raised LDS and proud of it. Think it made me into an honorable individual and i am thankful for that. Although i think i still hold many similar beliefs to that church, I would not consider myself one of their flock.  <br>
<br>
I think when it comes down to it, if one follows his/her heart and truly trys to do right and not wrong, then religion doesn't matter.<br>

Just my  2cp.<br>

<br>
i think that religions are made by humans to control humans.<br>
No other way. I dont speak about faith but about religions.<br>
Who wrote the Bible, the Torah, the Coran. Humans, only humans.<br>
<br>
You believe in a god, you are happy with that, so it's good.<br>
But it's a great pain when faith makes humans hurting other humans. Dont tell me about Muslims. They are not alone, catholics and anglicans in Ireland, and many other countries, with religions nobody knows. All wars began in the same ways : religions. Who can seriously believe that there is heaven and hell. Please look at the TV, hell is on earth and it's not the fault of Satan, Lucifer or other demons, it's only our fault.<br>
<br>
Humans can do the greatest but also the worse. It's up to you only you to choose your path, be responsible, dont blame a god or a demon for what happened to you.<br>
<br>
Last thing, there is no need of religions to make good choices in your life.<br>
<br>
Personnaly i dont believe in anything. But if you have a true faith i respect that, but please we are free minds, think by yourselves. <br>
<br>
(if only i speak english better, i hope you will understand my real thought) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1445<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/7/02 9:47:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=745.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Personally I think..</span><hr size=1> Sorry, gonna get a little ranty for a minute.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Damn you guys have some funny stuff in America. What the hell is a lutheran? is a mormon those guys who have no fun? loads of RC i see.

<br>
Please tell me you don't live in England.  It would be a poor commentary on the British education system if you did, but don't know what protestants are.<br>
<br>
The Lutheran church is one of many protestant Christian religions.  Martin Luther essentially started the reformation movement when he hammered 95 theses to the door of a Roman Catholic church.  It was basically some flaws / errors he saw in the religion (stuff like, you know, being able to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   buy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tickets into heaven from the church at the time).  Anyways, the Lutheran church is one of many Christian faiths.<br>
<br>
Mormons belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  To over-simplify things, they believe that during the pioneer days a prophet (Joseph Smith) was visited by Jesus <br>
and several angels, and translated the book of mormon, which is essentially the 3rd testament.  (Jews use 1 testament, the other Christian religions use two).  And yes, they're allowed to have fun.<br>
<br>
How secure are you in your atheism, when you have to follow up your mentioning of it with immediate defenses?  (Prove me wrong!  etc)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I find it funny when Christians believe in the whole adam and eve crap, when Darwin proved that wrong over 100 years ago.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Darwin didn't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> prove</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> anything.  He Theorized.  Hence the reason it's called Darwinian <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Theory</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  The guy was also a devout Christian.  One of many scientists who made discoveries or theories about the universe and didn't lose any of their faith (even when the church was beating them over the head for heresy).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Oh and someone mentioned healings by the church. That is not so much the power of God as much as the faith and belief of the person being healed that it would work. Much of the time I could imagine the problem would be in their brain in the first place(being to scared to start walking or whatever), or they just believe they are better when they arent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Good to know that you, with your incredible powers of deduction, have single-handedly determined the exact nature of what's otherwised called &quot;faith healing&quot;.  Such detailed scientific study as &quot;I could imagine the problem...&quot; is extremely compelling, and I'm sure will put an end to any doubt in people's minds that faith healing (or even the placebo effect) exist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I also dont like it when I am told I will go to hell for my &quot;beliefs&quot;. My politically correct christian friend says I will go to hell, but not muslims and jews who have followed their own religion even if they would be sent to hell under christian rules. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So tell the friend to shutup or you won't hang out with him/her anymore?  Do you see anyone here telling you that you're going to hell?<br>
