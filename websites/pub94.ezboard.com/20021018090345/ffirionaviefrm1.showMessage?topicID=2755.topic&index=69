Tank implies heavy damage output. We should really be called Fortresses. We exist only to absorb large amounts of damage. Properly buffed we can have 2x the HP and 25% better AC than the average group member. If you have a warrior that has fast weapons and knows how to taunt and has some decent armor then your healers will be much more effective because they only have to heal one target. If you put a warrior in a group with a cleric who is past level 39 then the cleric has a very mana efficient spell called complete heal. I have over 3000hp as a level 52 warrior and have been healed for 3002hp in one heal. This cost the cleric slightly more mana then her normal superior heal spell. This can significantly reduce the down time in a group. Good warriors know how to taunt mobs before breaking mez and will call out target changes so the party can assist him to kill only one target at a time. A good warrior will keep track of the mana situation and will not pull while the party is not ready. A good warrior will take a death for the team realizing that a nice res is incoming. At younger levels we are deamage dealers, and if we do not understand the maturation of our responsibilities in the low 40 range we do not make good team members. I no longer brag about my great critical hits, I am content to try and keep aggro away from those pesky rangers (I got aggro off you warrior boy, I got aggro - get it off , get it off - dead ranger).<br>

While I am probably not anything resembling an expert on the subject, I do have some insight with regards to my experience in grouping with various Shamen.<br>
<br>
  In general, we Enchanters are usually considered better at Haste, while Shaman are usually considered better at the Slow line of spells.  That being said, note that the Enchanter will generally have obtained a higher version of Slow before a Shaman does -- for example, Tepid Deeds (Enchanter) is a 24th, and generally slows from about 32-50%, while Tagars (Shaman) is level 29 and generally slows from 35-50%.  The aforementioned comments about the Slow line being a fairly significant taunt are also appropriate.<br>
<br>
  One thing that has not been mentioned (unless I have misread a post somewhere) is the Enchanter's ability to control aggro (to a certain extent) with Memory Blur.  In groups, I'll almost always have this spell up in case, for example, a wizard draws a critter, or said critter becomes very angry with the party cleric.  Once their hate list has been wiped, usually the main tank can regain aggro fairly easily.  I'll also use this on a MOB that I have been mesmerizing for some time (consecutive mesmerizes are a *huge* taunt).<br>
<br>
  Darch said that he might consider Enchanters masters of charm, but I think that distinction may belong to his own class (Bards).  While Enchanters tend to be better at Charm (possibly due to higher Charisma scores) than some of the other classes with similar abilities (such as Druids), the Bard's charm song seems far more versatile.  The Enchanter does not know when the spell will break, and any form of Charm is an enormous taunt:  I have had a 40th-level SK barely able to get a (formerly) charmed MOB off of me.  My main tactic for Charm is Root/Charm -- but perhaps a more skilled Enchanter might weigh in on this subject.<br>

Since I'm at work I don't have time to research all of the spells and compare them so I thought I would ask some higher-up chanters:<br>
<br>
In a raid type situation, from what I can tell, the pull goes like this from the Shaman/Chanter standpoint - <br>
Monk/SK pulls &lt;someMOB&gt; to the party, Chanter casts some type of resistance debuff spell on &lt;someMOB&gt; (this is the spell I am wondering about) - Shaman has already started casting a stronger resistance debuffer which lands shortly after the Chanter version - Shaman begins casting and hopefully lands the best Slow spell they have - then &lt;someMOB&gt; gets a beat down, in the process maybe eating the Shaman as a snack on its way to the afterlife.<br>
<br>
Is this the correct system or is the Chanter debuff at the beginning an un-necessary step?<br>
<br>
Also a quick addition - I must mention that Shamans get a couple different types of resistance debuffs that are used in different situations. Shamans get their largest resistance debuff at 57 - Malosini, which is a magic based spell. However, at 60, Shamans get another debuff that is less powerful called Malo which is UNRESISTABLE. Different situations warrent each spell's use.<br>

Of course, the fact I was a always a few levels behind my friends, and continualy pulling yellows/reds contributed heavily to that prejudice. When you're 5 levels below everyone else in the group, and pulling a red mob, you don't necessarily know if it's blue/white/yellow/red to the party as a whole. And if you think people get impatient with single pulls, Imagine targetting a creature, and running back to the group everytime to have someone else con it. Everyone gets tired of that very quickly. And of course the group preffered the highest conning mobs we could take, so single pulls were generally necessary<br>
<br>
But given a group I trust, I am now confident enough to &quot;pull like a warrior&quot;.<br>
<br>
One other thing about monk pulling, If I do over pull, and things go bad, I can generally get/keep enough aggro of a few of the mobs to peel them off and kite them around for a while.<br>

<br>
How do you feel about someone other than the main tank pulling?<br>
<br>
If I'm pulling I generally do it in one of two ways.<br>
<br>
1. Pulling Singles<br>
<br>
Lament all the mobs in the immediate vicinity that I don't want (quickly one by one), and then bellow at the one I do, and bring it back to the party.<br>
<br>
2. Pulling Multiples<br>
<br>
I tend to think of this as proximity pulling.  I run to where I know two to four mobs are and spit in the face of which ever one is furthest away. Then I just make sure I pass close enough to the others that I want on the way back to the group.<br>
<br>
(given that these procedures don't work everywhere)<br>
<br>
Now, techniques aside, Yeah I'm pulling, but about 30% of the time there's at least one other person in the group, who isn't pulling for whatever reason, that I'd rather take the brunt of the critters attention. Don't get me wrong, if I'm the main tank then I'll stand toe to toe as long as I can.<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned the phrase 'pulling like a tank' and that along with the absolutely awful (imho) state of Unrest yesterday is what has me wondering about it.<br>

<br>
Volcanogod brings up a good point -- one which I forgot to mention.  The entire Enchanter Tash-line is basically unresistable -- if it can be affected by spells, pretty much, you can Tash it.<br>
<br>
As Jarkell mentions, it does stack with the Shaman debuff, but the Enchanter line has a couple of other differences:  at high levels, he gets AOE Tash spells, and the Tash line is very, very, cheap to cast.  A big Shaman debuff will cost 200 mana, while a high-level Tash runs about 40.<br>
<br>
Note that I'm not sure how useful an AOE Tash is, as I would think that's usually guaranteed to make a lot of MOBs very angry very quickly. <br>
<br>
In a group with Shaman, the only debuff I usually throw is the Tash.  That way they're not resisted as much. :-)  <br>

<br>
One important thing is to not fix an image of what a certain classes role and abilities are.  These are dynamic, they change subtley by level and by leaps at certain levels.<br>
<br>
The MOST important factor is that any class played by a superior player will simply astound you with what they can do.  The same class played by an inexperienced or poor player will astonish you with how inept the class can be.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that most classess are reasonably balanced, for PvE, the same is not true for PvP.  The biggest differences will be in the quality of the players.  Aside from roleplay where all of the following means jack.... I strongly encourage all players to frequent their main class site....<br>
<br>
The Safe house<br>
The Rangers Glade<br>
The Shaman's Crucible<br>
Monkley-Business<br>
EQ Diva<br>
<br>
To name a few.  These are vast  storehouses of information,a nd you will get a much better idea of how your class evolves and how to maximize its skills. <br>
<br>
Jarkell, I think you said SK's are better pullers than monks... I disagree. I think better players make better pullers.  Also depending on circumstance your optimal puller class may be a ranger or druid (outdoor zone's).  Ever seen Maestro single pulled from amongst ten cronies?  Harmony can do it.  Other time's it will be a monk, many monks don't use all their tricks.  They figure once they can reliably feign that thats all there is too it.  My partner Saera is an excellent puller.  One trick that she (and indeed any class with the skill can) is sneaking and long range javelins (225 range -- fairly close to max bow/arrow range).  With sneak you reduce the range of your agro, as most rogues know, and when you throw in sneak mode this applies.  She can single pull very well using just this one trick, by no means the only one in her book,  including things like single pulling all the Black reavers at lvl 53, a feat most guides say requires a 58 monk. She is a good puller, she would be a good puller even if she was a cleric.......  Sk's, rogues, both also make excellent pullers depending on circumstances.<br>
<br>
The most limiting thing you can do is believe anyones propaganda about your or any classes ability.  <br>

<br>
That said, a shadowknight has more general use tricks up their sleave for difficult splits than any other class.  In specific situations, such as outdoors for harmony classes, or with a lot of heights where Safe Fall helps, or a place where sneak pulling is helpful, another class may be better for pulling, given equal player skill.<br>

BTW, the MT should never pull in an xp group.  If the MT pulls, you can't stack up the pulls.  I'll typically fetch the second MOB while the group kills the first.  Ideally, I'll land the 2nd on the group just as the first on dies for continual non-stop xp.  If there's an enchanter or other crowd control, I might stack them 3 or 4 deep and then add some monk damage to them.  Better still, the enchanter can pull.

Basically you wander neer a mob and they agro you from miles away, can pull in 2-4's depending on how slop you are, plenty of single....but this is around 5x faster than bard pulling, because mobs agro as soon as they are on your clip range, so you can strongly dictate what comes to you... as you dont have to go and whack it.<br>
Very fast way of pulling, never seen anything so fast!  <p><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Braellarth/sig_02.jpg"><br></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2755.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2755.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2755.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=2755.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2755.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2755.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
