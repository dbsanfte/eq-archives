Better be gettin' down to business, barely over a week to go!  <br>
<br>
I see a bunch of great ideas on the Saga boards so here is a verbatim quote:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Friday = starting day of Tinkerfest 3-day festival, and all gnomes in Norrath are encouraged to kick off the holiday by greeting fellow gnomes (or non-gnomes?) with the greeting Happy Tinkerfest! <br>
<br>
Even if a gnome has no idea about Tinkerfest, greet them anyways. Even if a gnome player does not RP, greet them anyways. <br>
<br>
The most likely outcome will be a look in their face like &quot;Huh?? What are you talking about? What the hell is Tinkerfest? This sounds like a fun event of some kind? Am I missing out on some kind of secret here? Can you please tell me more?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On Friday, I will see about setting up minor events in Akanon to start off the holiday. As an idea, I might hold random raffles.... as an incentive for players just being back home in Akanon during the 'holidays'. This is one day where we can brainstorm more events if desired. <br>
<br>
<br>
Saturday = 2nd Day, the big day for Tinkerfest. This is the day where we throw all the punches, all the fireworks are let loose, rowdy celebration, and hopefully as many gnomes and guests we can pack in Steamfont and Akanon for most of the day. Events should be ongoing for most of the day. <br>
<br>
If there is a day when our GMs and Guides can attend to help out, this would be the day I would like to see them show up. This would also be the day we would hold some of the larger events, especially those that give out the largest incentives (awards, prizes) for attendance. <br>
<br>
Someone also suggested a choreographed fireworks display when it gets dark outside in Steamfont. <br>
<br>
Most likely the biggest events may take place sometime around mid-afternoon or early evening time (Pacific Time). But for those people on CET or EST or other time zones, dont worry, because I would like to see the events still sporadically spread out for most of the day. <br>
<br>
Think of it like one giant open-house party where guests come and go, but the flow of beer never stops, and the party lights itself never go out all day long. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunday = last day of Tinkerfest, winding down the holiday. This is still considered part of the holiday, even if not as rowdy and cheery as the Tinkerfest Saturday. I would still greet other gnomes with a Happy Tinkerfest. And time and volunteers allowing, we can still hold some minor events for some part of Sunday..... especially for those players who missed out (or could not attend) events from the previous two days. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Now here are my specific thoughts:<br>
<br>
Friday: everybody everywhere wish everybody happy Tinkerfest and hand out alcohol - preferably gnomish spirits, I would think!<br>
<br>
Friday event in Steamfont - 10pm EST / 7pm PST - drunken opening celebrations.  Possibly involving:<br>
<br>
- story telling in the throne room of King Ak'Anon: Mal can recite the history of Tinkerfest (hehe happy hotkeying) in /shout.  Someone outside to shout regular announcements and direct people inside.<br>
<br>
- appointment of Prince and Princess Ak'Anon for the holiday.  I suggest all interested contestants are paired up in dice rolls, e.g. if 8 women interested, 4 pairs roll off, then the 4 winners roll in 2 pairs, then the 2 winners roll off.  (Odd numbers can roll against a judge, if the judge wins, nobody procedes to next round.)  Winners are then awarded something or other, announced in Ak'Anon, Steamfont, the Bazaar, and possibly the market channel.<br>
<br>
- following the story and crowning, drunken race to the PoD.  Gnomes must consume 1 stack of gnomish spirits, and run from King to PoD without falling in the water.  Any who do, receive a prize (platinum, a geerlok device, something like that.)  The newly appointed Prince and Princess can start the races off and/or announce the winners (maybe Prince starts, Princess names winners for example).<br>
<br>
- clockwork pinatas (Sabbik's idea): is it still possible to give items to monsters?  If so, I suggest 'spiking' all the clockworks in Steamfont with some low level but decent item - tinkered fireworks, purity belts, recondite bandit armour, maybe a couple of platinum coins. Party can then drunkenly spill outside for drunken clockwork slaying and general festivity.  Those who wish to continue drinking, I suggest an all-out assault on the minotaur slavers to clear and set up base camp at the pavilion,  free the slaves, which gives an excellent excuse for further drinking.  Pinatas and drinking can continue as long as there is alcohol, and someone walking straight enough to continue spiking the clockworks.<br>
<br>
Saturday:  main day.  Starting 1pm PST (9pm London, which means Euro players can join) and continuing for 4 hours (probably as long as we can stand).  We'll have to find out how exactly the GMs can participate - can they make non-gnome celebrants into gnome form, for example?  Whatever they can do, their help would be great.  Players can continue the clockwork pinatas, and we could set up one or more player quests.  For this we would need some volunteers to essentially be a player NPC, with scripted hotkeys acting just like a quest NPC.  We can send players around to recite bits of the Tinkerquest legend to other NPC-players, and receive something (e.g. a tinkered firework, some gnomish spirits, etc.) in return.  They could also collect a number of items and hand them in for a larger award, like a minor geerlok device - hopefully up and coming tinkers would be willing to donate their extras.  Whoever accepts the final turn-ins would have to be near a bank, or we'd have to have some runners assigned to keep refilling their supplies.  Whatever they turn in would need to stack, too!  =)  Maybe clockwork bits, spiderling silks, things like that.  Or alcohol from Luclin - which they can all get to fairly easily via the G Fay spire even if they don't have PoP - the alcohol could then be recycled for minor quest rewards or clockwork pinatas.<br>
<br>
- in the evening, after we're all sick of running the questing: gather all the gnomes we can find and invade key areas en masse shouting Tinkerfest carols.  Areas like the Nexus and Bazaar, but also more unexpected areas like Velketors (for higher level gnomes - could just zone in quickly), Paw, Paludal Caverns, Queynos (for PoP enabled gnomes), Dawnshroud Peaks.  More populated zones where you wouldn't expect mass gnomishness.<br>
<br>
Sunday (and possibly Saturday evening): quiet Tinkerfest gift exchange.  Small &lt;5pp gifts and tokens between friends, or perhaps just gifts of food/alcohol.  Wish everybody you meet a happy Tinkerfest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whew... that's my thoughts.<br>
<br>
We need to set up a private area for scripting the player quests, the announcements, and the carols.  And to assign responsibilities and duties.  There'll need to be a tinkerfest coordination channel for those helping organize, so that any quest person can shout for help if they run out of quest supplies, or need to go AFK someone can go stand with them and take over if necessary, stuff like that.  Time's a running short and there's lots of planning to be done!<br>

Kudos for everyone involved if it does get off the ground. Though the last large RP event that was player-driven that I recall was the attack on Ak'Anon, so I wonder if we should start calling it the entertainment capital of FV.<br>
<br>
Thought I'd bring up a few rough ideas for the festival, to try to lend a hand in my own way at getting more support and excitement for the potential roleplaying experience.<br>
<br>
It hasn't escaped me that this could be a sort of collective &quot;up yours&quot; from the Ak'Anon citizenry for those who attacked them during Apep's raid. After all this time they've healed up and such, and now can look to strengthening their culture and having a bit of fun while they're at it.<br>
<br>
Most of the ideas I've had concerning the event were in the form of games/mini-events themselves. They were:<br>
<br>
1) Tinkyard Wars (Tinkheap Challenge for you UK folks). Alright, I couldn't resist an homage to Junkyard Wars, given the obvious parallels with gnomish culture. Aside from my shockingly bad attempt at levity with the title of this event though (and let me assure you an homage it was intended to be, not outright plagiarism), it might be fun. Gather a couple of teams, have them strip down to team uniforms (creating a uniform themselves could be an event too), give them a set of tools, and a time limit during which to build the most tinkered items they can.<br>
<br>
The trick to this would be that they had to salvage or win all of their components. No banking them beforehand. Buying might be allowed, but only with money gathered from the field (Steamfont). That seems to be against the spirit of the contest though.<br>
<br>
Teams would be given a set of BASIC tools, preferably in a handmade toolbox or handcrafted belt, and set to work.<br>
<br>
Components would have to be scrounged/salvaged in Steamfont, though an option might also be to have rare components or those not normally available to Steamfont tied into other contests held throughout the day. For instance, someone might offer up a sensate reishi lens as part of another contest they're holding (NOT for sale), and the team could try to win that contest to secure that needed bit of equipment.<br>
<br>
In the end, the prize would be given to the team that managed to make the most tinkered items, with possible additional prizes for truly difficult items, as well as team fashion sense.<br>
<br>
2) Sacrifices. I've read the fiction that was created to be the RP background for this celebration, and I'll be adding some comments later, but the theme I wanted to touch on here was one of personal sacrifice. Throughout the three days of the holiday, gnomes might be encouraged to offer up something they've created or prize dearly, so that they can reflect on the sacrifices made by their forebearers during the dragon attack, especially the sacrifice of the Princess.<br>
<br>
One area might be designated as a sacrificial &quot;altar&quot;, though it could even be the lake in town. Gnomes would come here, give a little speech about their thanks for the sacrifices of their forebearers, and drop one of their handmade items, or something personally valuable to them, with No hope of recompense. The more it hurts to give up an item, or the harder it was to create, the more auspicious it would be. There would be no reward for such acts obviously, other than the acknowledgement of your peers and the start of a tradition.<br>
<br>
Now, gnomes being gnomes, the sacrificial items might not be left fully to rot. It would be accepted that other gnomes could gather up a sacrificed item to use as they would, in the name of resourcefulness. Also however, it would promote community growth by possibly giving a fellow citizen a needed component or a nice item.<br>
<br>
Those greedy gnomes who sought only to profit by taking the sacrifices of others and making none of their own would be frowned upon, for they have not learned the lessons of the holiday.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
In addition to the random ideas I had for the events above, I also got to thinking about what could be done to make this an ongoing, three-day long thing, and what might show the spirit of the celebration. One or two major events is fine, but Tinkerfest (at least from what I've read so far) should be about all things gnomish, as well as engender the themes of the Princess legend.<br>
<br>
In the spirit of innovation, gnomes might be encouraged to create their own games or events. These could happen in a free-for-all fashion, and might give rise to popular pastimes or traditions in the years to come. In an OOC perspective though, it lets the momentum of the festival keep going when it's not being propped up by this or that major scheduled event. During downtime, people might create their own mini-events and celebrate that way.<br>
<br>
I believe Saturday was set aside for the thick of celebration, and that seems like a good time for everyone to participate in, or organize their own shindigs.<br>
<br>
Just for fun, I've created a set of random tables, if anyone is stuck for inspiration on events they might hold. Random tables are no substitute for creativity, but they do give people cause to ponder or go off on tangents.<br>
<br>
I wanted to do a few things with the tables. First, I wanted to incorporate the backstory and themes presented in the fictional legend of the holiday. Second, I wanted to make them simple and generalized, so that people COULD go off on those tangents. My last concern was that it provided a few avenues for interesting twists and variations.<br>
<br>
It's not scripture certainly, but it might give people ideas. And isn't that the most true gnomish theme of all?<br>
<br>
The charts are broken down into Element, Goal, and Reward. A final chart lists aspects of the Princess Legend that should show through in the overall event, thus making it into a Tinkerfest Event rather than just some barmy gnome idea (let's be flattering and assume there is a difference).<br>
<br>
Elements are the backbone of the event. They're the raw foundation of what you're doing. Be it a race, a combat, whatever, you need to know what you're going to have people doing.<br>
<br>
Goals are just that...a list of goals or objectives, even potential enemies, to which the basic element of your event is applied.<br>
<br>
Rewards should be pretty self-explanatory. The prizes or what have you that are given to the winner of the event.<br>
<br>
Aspect shows the element of the Princess Legend that you're trying to invoke with your event. You could be struggling against one of the sadder parts of the legend, celebrating the ideals it espouses, or maybe just holding the event in the name of one of the main characters. In any case, by the very fact that you're thinking about the Aspect of the legend, it helps gnomes to recall their lore.<br>
<br>
CHARTS:<br>
You can choose, or use a gnomish dice-throwing device to come up with the necessary components of your event. For ease, all the charts are based on a roll of percentage dice (1-100).<br>
<br>
:: Element ::<br>
(01-10) = Race<br>
(11-20) = Relay Race<br>
(21-30) = Non-Deadly Combat<br>
(31-40) = Deadly Combat<br>
(41-50) = Basic Stat (Strength, Wisdom, etc)...this takes much thought.<br>
(51-60) = Tradeskill<br>
(61-70) = Team Sport<br>
(71-80) = Sacrifice<br>
(81-90) = Scrounging/Scavenging<br>
(91-100) = Combination of 2 (or more, if you've been dipping into the gnomish spirits) of the above.<br>
<br>
:: Goal ::<br>
(01-10) = Location in Ak'Anon/Steamfont area<br>
(11-20) = Player Character<br>
(21-30) = Non-Player Character<br>
(31-40) = Time itself<br>
(41-50) = Particular type of monster<br>
(51-60) = Named monster<br>
(61-70) = Item/Component<br>
(71-80) = Tinkered Device<br>
(81-90) = Location/Character outside of Ak'Anon/Steamfont<br>
(91-100) = Combination of 2 or more of the above<br>
<br>
:: Reward ::<br>
(01-10) = Tinkered device<br>
(11-20) = Tinkering component<br>
(21-30) = Handmade tradeskill item (low-level)<br>
(31-40) = Handmade tradeskill item (high-level)<br>
(41-50) = Money<br>
(51-60) = Gems<br>
(61-70) = Loot Item (inl. drops, foraged, quested, etc) low-level<br>
(71-80) = Loot Item (medium level)<br>
(81-90) = Loot Item (high level)<br>
(91-100) = Combination of 2 or more above<br>
<br>
:: Aspect ::<br>
(01-10) = The Tinker Princess<br>
(11-20) = The Dragon<br>
(21-30) = Combat (The Warrior Prince's Folly)<br>
(31-40) = Magic (The Sorceror Prince's Folly)<br>
(41-50) = Sacrifice/Loss<br>
(51-60) = Courage<br>
(61-70) = Innovation/Imagination<br>
(71-80) = Clockwork(s)<br>
(81-90) = Ak'Anon<br>
(91-100) = The Gnomish race itself<br>
<br>
A FEW EXAMPLES:<br>
<br>
I'll give a few examples of events to show how the charts can be used to give inspiration. As I said, I don't want to rely on random charts for roleplaying, just as a source of ideas. I certainly want to avoid downplaying the importance of the themes in the gnomes' legend, while still making sure that those themes are present for the younger folks in that society. (i.e., this is not &quot;Wheel of Morality turn turn turn...&quot;)<br>
<br>
1) Wee Dragon Roundup. This stems from an idea I had a long time ago, but can be applied here. The Element would be deadly combat, the goal would be a particular type of monster, the reward could be anything, but let's say 1pp in this case, and the aspect of the legend would be the Dragon itself.<br>
<br>
In this event, a bounty could be put on bile sacs from the scattered drakes of Steamfont, because wee little dragons can grow up to be giant , slavering, steam-belching white ones that eat your town.<br>
<br>
A variation of this might involve someone charming drakes and drawing them to a viewing area, where stalwart gnomes face off in unarmed combat against the creatures, thus mimicking the difficulty of fighting a real dragon, and proving their might in the process. could even go to elimination matches form a series of initial competitors.<br>
<br>
2) (Tradeskill/Local Location/low-level handmade tradeskill item/combat): Martial Folly. In this event, gnomes that practice a certain tradeskill (you can determine that randomly, or choose) seek to show the folly of focusing on matters of combat to the detriment of all else, by going to a dangerous location in Steamfont, picking a fight with one monster per combatant, then ignoring the creature while trying to use their tradeskill effectively. Obviously smithing would probably be out, since it requires a forge nearby, but others might work as well. This both shows how difficult it is to pursue matters like tinkering when you're engaged in war, as well as showing defiance of the Warrior Prince's foolish reliance on combat alone.<br>
<br>
The first combatant to complete say 3 tradeskill items, THEN slay its attacker, wins. Anyone who dies is reminded of the dangers of focusing only on tradeskills and not looking to your own safety, while anyone who kills their opponent before completing their tradeskill items is reminded of the stories of the Warrior Prince...after all, the point is to pursue the tradeskill in addition to saving your hide.<br>
<br>
The winner waits until the remainder of the players destroy their opponents or are lost, at which point all of the tradeskill items are handed to that winner.<br>
<br>
One variation of this game some 15 years ago saw five gnomish jewelcrafters squaring off on the hills overlooking the windmills. Each had provoked a harpy, and then had to complete three silver pieces of jewellery set with stones while the shrieking bird-creatures tore at their shoulders and scalps viciously. The winner was the gnome that managed to smack the harpy into retreat three times, once after each piece was complete, then strike it down for good. She received the completed silver pieces of her opponents, as well as their nodding accolades.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
I'm sorry for the length of this post, but I hope it has given pause for thought. I truly would like to see Tinkerfest become yet another great player-initiated roleplaying event on the server, to stem the tide of d00d content. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maladominus>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ak'Anon Sex Symbol</span><br>  Posts: 978<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/02 4:08:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Wow, very good ideas. <br>
<br>
I will comment on the rest later. For now some brief thoughts. <br>
<br>
Saturday = should indeed be the thick of the celebration, because the day seems optimal in attracting the largest number of players. Early Saturday afternoon Pacific Time (around 1 or 2 pm PST is optimal for starting some of the events).  Starting roughly from this time, events will start.... and the events and festivities will likely go into the evening hours of Saturday. Players will come and go. We will host a special chat channel for the whole day, which will most likely scroll like a lively zoo. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I received an email from GM Daleynn.  So it is confirmed that the GM and Guides of Firiona Vie are planning to send some of theirs to attend the Tinkerfest on Saturday, and said they would be happy to provide endless supplies of beverages such as Valtron's Finest Brew, etc. <br>
<br>
I was told that since this is a Player Event and not a GM Event, the SOE staff cannot actually advertise the event via GM Broadcast.  We the players will have to announce it ourselves. <br>
<br>
One other thing suggested to me is that we should encrouage ALL of the server's Master and Grandmaster Tinkers to come during Saturday and to hawk their wares.... and in doing so provide &quot;holiday bargain prices&quot; during the weekend.  This accomplishes 2 things:<br>
<br>
1) it attracts all players to come to Akanon and to buy some tinkered devices they have been wanting, and to afford them at the best deals possible<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
2) to provide some brisk business for the Master Tinkers during this weekend<br>
<br>
I don't have a headcount of how many gnomes are now at the Master and Grandmaster tinker level. But definitely let me know if you are one of them and are interested in attending for this purpose. <br>
<br>
The idea of crowing a Tinker Princess is a cute idea, I like it!  Only thing is, I'm kinda skeptical about holding some last minute beauty pageant sort of thing.... because making one succeed is a lot of effort.  Instead, I like the proposal that the selection of a &quot;Princess&quot; (or prince) would be by random dice roll?  It would be a completely random and non-serious fun kinda of thing, so that there are no real 'winners' or 'losers'. And of course, the crowned 'royalty' will receive some token prizes. <br>
<br>
Asdyr has some very good ideas, still need to review some of them.  The Tinkyard contest seems a possibility, but that hinges on having enough actual tinkers there who are interested in the event. <br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to see during Saturday at least ONE major Fireworks Spectacular Show.... where several dozen players, each holding several fireworks, we all light them up into the dark NIGHT TIME SKY in Steamfont.  Possibility is that this &quot;event&quot; can happen more than once.  Remember that the daily/night cycle on Norrath happens once every 80 player minutes.  So if players did not log on to Tinkerfest and missed the first Fireworks Show, they have a chance to see the second one. <br>
<br>
About 2 days before Tinkerfest Saturday, I will ask a few gnomes to volunteer to tinker several dozen (perhaps hundreds) of assorted fireworks.... to be handed out for Saturday's choreographed fireworks displays. So we will have a GIGANTIC stockpile of fireworks available before Saturday. I wonder if they are stackable now? <br>

Two people (both from the top 2 uber guilds on the server) have spoken to me and said they will help pitch in some donations for Tinkerfest prizes. <br>
<br>
While I wasn't even expecting anything ambitious in this regards, it's an AWESOME gesture that a couple of the ubers on this server are volunteering as donors/sponsors for an RP event.   So yes, they might donate a couple of items that is simply cluttering up their bank space..... but for the most part these items will be used as either contest award prizes or raffle prizes during Tinkerfest celebrations.   And they are very much appreciated. <br>
<br>
Since Tinkerfest is an RP event that is open to anyone and everyone, including the young newbie gnomes in Steamfont..... those nice token prizes will make some people very happy they attended and participated in such an event. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>
If anyone else is interested in being a donor for Tinkerfest, please let me know.   The only thing I can promise you is that donors/sponsors (and their guilds) will be recognized in one of our post-event banners. <br>

Also - I only posted to guilds with which I am familiar, and as such the<br>
&quot;uber&quot; and/or &quot;evil&quot; guilds have not been adequately covered!<br>
<br>
I'll continue to post around, and hope all will spread the word as well!<br>
<br>
(I'm still hoping to be able to make it for at least an hour or two that<br>
  weekend, for a song or two at least!) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gneen>Gneen</A> at: 12/5/02 11:40:54 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/6/02 12:18:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=344.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/didi/a_didisig.gif height=120 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Donors for Tinkerfest! </span><hr size=1> Posted to the EQ forums, unfortunately they aren't ezboards and won't accept images so I had to modify it a bit.<br>

If you are still in search of prizes, I would be glad to craft some enchanted silver, electrum, and gold jewelry for it and donate it to the cause.  It doesn't stack so there would have to be some place to put it for storage, or I could be on hand occationally (I am a PST player) to award it if need be.  I'll even come as a Gnome!  But you'll have to teach me how to bounce. *giggles*<br>
