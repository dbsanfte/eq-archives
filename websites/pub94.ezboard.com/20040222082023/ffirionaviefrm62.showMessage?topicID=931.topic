<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Police recently dubbed British paedophile, Douglas Lindsell the 'most prolific sex predator' on the internet. Lindsell, 64, was jailed for 5 years in October when police raided his home and found the names and profiles of 73 girls, some as young as 12 years old, on his PC.<br>
Lindsell had pretended to be a young boy in chat room conversations and sent an old picture of his son, which he claimed was him, to the girls he targeted. After he had gained their confidence and the contact details he required, he would then harass the victims via e-mail and telephone - he even met with some.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
this is the bit of the article that made me go hmm though:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;A majority of Lindsell's 'Grooming' (where paedophiles gathers children’s contact details via deception) happened in Microsoft’s MSN chat rooms - so it was no surprise when Microsoft closed down its 10,000+ chat rooms...&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now... this is what niggles me a lot, after reading more articles on this it appears a lot of you praise Microsoft for this &quot;swift&quot; decision which is &quot;protecting our children” but I cant help but wonder if its anything to do with the financial burden they would face.<br>
It's fair to say that maintaining MSN free chat rooms returned NO substantial gains. It’s also true that Microsoft would find it almost impossible to continue to provide un-monitored chat rooms following this Lindsell case... so the way I see it they were left with two options... pay for moderation of these chat rooms or close them all together.<br>
<br>
Most critics of Microsoft are really annoyed with they way they spun it too, advertising it as &quot;MSN takes action on chat&quot; (read the press release they sent out on day the day of its closure) - it went on to state that the decision was being taken as part of a &quot;global effort to provide consumers with safer, more secure and positive online experiences. These changes will help protect MSN users from SPAM and inappropriate communication.&quot; At no point has anyone from MSN said &quot;Paying for moderators is out of the question so were just going to close all the rooms&quot;.<br>
<br>
Statistics show today that, of the one in five children who have regularly used chat rooms, more than half have engaged in sex chat so there is no doubt in my mind that children’s chat rooms should be moderated (if not all chat rooms).... so is Microsoft’s move a responsible one? Microsoft may have covered its back but doesn’t this kind of decision just force children to find different more seedy chat rooms where they will continue to be targeted - with more ease I should imagine.<br>
<br>
With a 7year old brother who often chats online, this worries me a lot, and I was wondering everybody else’s position on this.<br>

<br>
If Parents are concerned their children will find seedier chat rooms, maybe they should unplug the PC.<br>
<br>
The rest of of it all boils down to whether you like Microsoft or not.  They are just a Company, the same as Ford, or Exxon, or SONY, or somebody who manufactures Tin Cans, and they have no more 'social responsibility' than those other companies.  Did they choose the easiest solution?  Most likely.  Rather than throw money to fix broken chat rooms, they closed them.  Since they are so popular maybe they will work on a better solution, by programming a better interface than classic 'chat' that is easier to adminsitrate safely.<br>
<br>

Chat rooms are in essence, freedom of speech zones. While I don't particularly care for big business as a whole, I would hold parents responsible for monitoring the activities of their children and not MSN or any other internet company. I think the parents that have the biggest gripes against these chat rooms are the same people that expect society to expend the energy in raising their children. <br>
<br>
Once you start limiting freedoms under the guise of protecting children, you begin a journey that will lead to those freedoms being taken away. The same argument could be made for outlawing adult pornography (some kid may see it), alcohol prohibition (some kid may drink some), and it goes on and on. If a person doesn't have the time and energy to spend in monitoring and nurturing their child, then they have no business spawning children. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ermok>Ermok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 792<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/17/03 1:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=931.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;OH-NO!&quot; - say's Bill Gates</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Statistics show today that, of the one in five children who have regularly used chat rooms, more than half have engaged in sex chat<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

A company making tin cans needs to ensure that they take reasonable steps to prevent those tin cans causing harm, such as providing safe opening devices, using the correct non toxic material and solder etc.   <br>
<br>
Microsoft also needs to ensure that its service is relatively safe and if they can't ensure that then they leave themselves open to possible retaliatory action by consumers who get burned.  They can't feasibly provide the moderation so they shut it down.  Makes sense to me.<br>

<br>
There are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hundreds</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of possible ways in which online chat rooms could be used for criminal or morally corrupt practices, and there are a thousand other minor potential risks.

It's impractical. More than that, it's bloody stupid. A company making tin cans doesn't say:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Do not eat this tin can&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Do not attempt to insert this tin can into bodily orifices&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, or<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Do not throw yourself from the top of the Empire State Building clutching this upturned tin can in the hope that it will act as an adequate parachute&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
All companies assume that customers will employ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>some</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> degree of common sense and responsibility in the application of their products or services. Sadly, such cases as the suing of McDonalds for failing to mark their hot coffee as &quot;hot&quot; highlight the current trend towards crediting the average consumer with an IQ less than that of a raspberry pop-tart.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Microsoft also needs to ensure that its service is relatively safe<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm sure they do. I'm sure they put in place all the appropriate procedures and safeguards to protect their customers' computers from getting viruses, from IP traces and DoS attacks, from release of sensitive real-life information. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is Microsoft's responsibility, if anything. I'm Microsoft <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>does</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have a disclaimer in place, and I'm sure it requires chat room users to accept, amongst other rules, that users may not conduct illegal or improper practises via the chatrooms, and that minors must have the consent or supervision of a parent or guardian. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is MS doing their part. The chatrooms are offered &quot;as-is&quot; - as a medium for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>unmoderated</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> chat. If MS customers choose to abuse the regulations that MS put in place - by 'grooming' small children or, in the case of parents/guardians, by allowing the minor in their care to use the chatroom unsupervised - then MS cannot be held responsible.<br>
<br>
It's solely the lack of care and attention on the part of the parent that is responsible for putting children at risk of paedophile attention. Why should Microsoft be responsible for supervising other people's children? That's the parents' job!!<br>
<br>
As far as the pro-Microsoft spin on the topic goes -- why not? Good for them. It puts a positive angle on what is otherwise an entirely negative subject. Let's face it, if people are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> concerned that MS chatrooms are a source of paedophile action, then they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> doing the general public a favour by closing them down. If MS had wanted to be absolutely truthful, their press release would simply have said: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;We've decided to close down all our chatrooms, as we cannot afford the expense of adding moderators simply because a bunch of lazy parents can't be bothered to supervise their own kids.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> And if they had added moderators to the chatrooms, you just know it would have turned into an 'Big Brother/invasion of privacy' and 'restricting freedom of speech' issue.<br>
