It's the folks that are grossly exagerating how hard the easy skills are and then whining about price that are annoying.  Yes, even the easier ones cost plat and are dull, but nowhere near as bad as a few up there are making out.<br>
<br>
BTW, Jarkell, on the subject of the velium fire opal rings, 1500 was the price you were selling them for in the bazaar.  I didn't hear it.  I saw it myself.  I was in the market for a pair for my druid.  No big deal, I bought from another for 450.  I'm just amused at your price whining.<br>
<br>
FV has more GM traders and more active ones than the other servers I've played on.  It's not just a small margin, either.  There are tons of them here and more working it up every day.  FV may be young and a bit behind on MOBs killed compared to old servers, but it's very precocious on trades.  IMHO, that's because trades can be done solo at any time.  FV has a more mature population that can't devote 24x7 to xp'ing and raiding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1373<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/02 6:55:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Twig, I don't think ..</span><hr size=1> Bjond.. 1500pp is the price I sell golden idols at.  It's the only thing I sell at that price.  And If you mean the 6 ac 65 hp rings... I have never sold those.  Only the 6 dex 6 str ring I had before I upgraded.  Which someone bought, in trader mode, for about 400pp.  I dunno, maybe you were confused, maybe there was some bug.<br>
<br>
And no, I'm not whining.  I'm pissed off.  Not just for pottery, but for other professions... brewing, baking, tinkering.  No one's intentionally killed brewing or baking yet, but it looks like it will happen soon enough, someone's gonna crack.  I already know someone skilling up with the purpose of killing the fishing pole market... that's the only reason he wants to sell poles.  Doesn't need the money, just wants to trash the market and leave.  He got tied up doing other things though, might not do it now.<br>

There were serveral with prices varying from 1000 up to 1500 for 6/65s.  Not only does a lowball price bring the market down, but an inflated price can bring it up with the public pricing in bazaar.  I remember it so well because I was expecting to find the common 450-500 pre-bazaar price for them all over.  I checked back in the evening and found a real JC'er selling at 450.<br>
<br>
BTW, I had the search settings setup to show only the rings I was interested in (rings, hp).  It wasn't a confusion on the item or name.  I remembered it precisely because you're always harping on how pricing is so unfair to poor potters.  Perhaps it's because you have a natural bent to charge 3x the going rates and find it frustrating when that doesn't work.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with charging high, I do it myself when I don't care how soon things sell.  But, it gets real old hearing people whine about it, though.  If you aren't making enough plat from your trade, do something else.  Tradeskill proffits always go down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1375<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/15/02 3:15:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It was you, Jar</span><hr size=1> Bjond... I've never sold those rings.  I only recently bought one, it's the only one I've ever had, and I wear it.  After you said that I took my ring and put it in trader mode to see if I'd already had an assigned cost... I didn't.  Never sold that ring before in my life.  So get your facts straight.  There's a few folks with names like Jakrall and such, maybe one of them wanted that price, but again, I'm not a Jewelcrafter.  I know exactly how my rings went... I had two 6 dex 6 str rings I bought from Coriolis for about 400 pp.  I upgraded one to a coldain ring and sold it before the new bazaar.  Then I bought a 6/65 ring and sold the other 6 dex 6 str in the bazaar for what Coriolis charged me to make it.  That's my current set up.  So check your facts.<br>
<br>
And I'm not harping on unfair prices to potters... I'm harping on people who say some arbitrary mark up (usually 50% to 100%) is always appropriate in tradeskills and they're getting ripped off if they don't get that exact amount, dispite the fact that they sure don't complain when the mark up is 10% or less!  And I'll defend any tradeskill, regardless of wether or not I'm in it, because it's an alternative way of playing the game... some fight monsters for exp, leveling up till they can kill bigger monsters.  Some, however, can make items for money, using that money to level up their skill till they can make better items.  This is why it really hurts to see massive price cuts and such... imagine seeing you're suddenly getting 50% less exp per mob when you fight.  <br>
