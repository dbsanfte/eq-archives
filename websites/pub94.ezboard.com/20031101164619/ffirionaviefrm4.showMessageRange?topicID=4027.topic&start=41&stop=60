<br>
As one of these DPS classes, I wholeheartedly disagree with you.  DPS classes ARE required.  <br>
<br>
Last night's trip to Rujarkian Hills was a wizard (me), necro, SK, enchanter, cleric and beastlord.  Failure on killing 56 mobs.  We were constantly pulling, too.<br>
<br>
Of course, we had a few deaths.  But, still, I felt rushed.  It's hard to maintain a high DPS when you're running low on mana.  For much of the time, I was hovering around 20% mana.  I'd cast Xuzl just so I could feel like I was contributing something.  And, yes, I was casting my most efficient nukes.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see the time limits done away with on everything except resuce missions.  I'd also like to see assassination missions spawn a boss at the start and not only after 60% of the dungeon is dead.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you one thing I'm sick of, and that is people assuming I want to go wait for (and pay for) a KEI.  Had I not had KEI in all my attempts so far, there's no way we would have even come close to finishing on time.  These time limits are set up to where i MUST have a KEI if I even hope to accomplish the goal.  Apparently the devs think everyone has a pet enchanter to cast KEI at their every whim.  This is hardly the case.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, even two hours isn't long enough.  Just get rid of the time limit on all missions and make it a choice.  If a time limit is necessary to keep server load down, make it four hours.  But give a higher reward for those who choose to have a time limit.  This &quot;lesser reward&quot; thing is pretty crappy.  Taking my point award from 30+ to 7 because I was unable to kill that 56th mob before 90 minutes was up is incredibly dumb. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/thewok/jarasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I have done 7 dungeons so far most have been the collection or kill mob type. With one rescue mission. 4 success and 3 fails. Only 2 have been done with what I would consider high DPS groups. <br>
<br>
FIrst Fail was eveyones first time in an LDON dungeon and we wasted a lot of time at the beginning just goofing around.We also had a bit of bad luck on drops with a fairly prolonged dry spell. Completed about 3 minutes after 90 minute timer ran out<br>
<br>
<br>
Second Fail. Our SK and Cleric (two boxer) had to go akf for a RL issue about 10 minutes in for 6 or 7 minutes. on a resuce mission. We failed with NPC 2/3 of the way back to zone line. And probably would have made it if  a roaming mob had not come along at an inoportune time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Third Fail (collection mission)l. Had a couple bad breaks with charm and we got a bit too reckless toward the end. Had to evac three times. would have made it had we been just a bit more cautious at the end or not had as much problems with charm. This was getting late for most of us in the group and we were probably not all at our best levels of performance.<br>
<br>
<br>
A high DPS group will chew through the dungeon with lots of time to spare. With a low DPS or well balanced group the dungeons are still doable just you don't have as much room for that bit of bad luck or mistakes.<br>
<br>
So far I have found that if all the players in the group know their stuff, have good aggro management, Have good mana management and can work well as a team then you can do the dungeon usually with 5 to 10 minutes to spare. Being impatient and too aggressive is just as bad as not killing fast enough. Finding the right balance for your group is probably the hardes part.<br>
<br>
If you get grouped with one or more people who don't know their class well, cant control their aggro or manage their mana you will have difficulties, unless your in that high dps group where the sheer killling power makes up for the lack of skill. <br>
<br>
A lot of the KEI/AEgo addict crowd seems to have problems in LDON. Not all but most it seems. And I must say even fails are a blast. I enjoy EQ from top to bottom playing a level 1 smooshing bats and rats is just as much fun to me as Raiding or tradeskilling or questing. Yet I must say LDON by far has been the most fun I have had in EQ to date. The risk vs reward is very very good in my opinion. And I look forward to spending lots of time doing dungeon crawling.<br>
<br>
Point is all three fails were due to a combination of bad luck and our group mismanaging our time and progression through the dungeon. They were not failed becuase the dugeons were too difficult to do in the time allotted. All 3 could have and probably should have been won.<br>

It is a scale.<br>
-------------------------<br>
Top DPS classes: Rogue, wizard, monk<br>
<br>

<br>
Classes with medium DPS: Shaman, enchanter, bard, warrior, shadowknight<br>
<br>
Classes with low DPS: Paladin, cleric<br>
-------------------------<br>
However, enchanter and bard add so much to the dps as others that I'm going to move them up a bit.<br>
--------------------------<br>
Top DPS classes: Rogue, wizard, monk<br>
<br>
Classes with good DPS: Mage, ranger, necromancer, druid, beastlord, enchanter, bard<br>
<br>
Classes with medium DPS: Shaman, warrior, shadowknight<br>
<br>
Classes with low DPS: Paladin, cleric<br>
----------------------------<br>
Can't get a top dps class? Get someone with good dps instead. Very likely you will hardly notice the difference. What's more, if you can't get high dps classes, just balance it out by not getting low dps classes. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Medium DPS + good DPS = Low DPS + top DPS.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
And don't tell me you have problems finding enough dps. Look at how many classes provide a lot of dps. And even Paladins do good dps versus undead.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The top DPS classes are not required. DPS is required but a lot of classes can contribute enough DPS.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Compare this to healers. How many classes can heal adequetly? Druid, cleric and shaman. Now, I know I can find a healer without too much trouble, and I have only three classes to choose from. You seriously saying you can't find enough dps? I'm sorry if your regular xp group consists of 6 clerics. Maybe its time to invite some of those people that spend hours upon hours LFG because until now nobody wanted them that much.<br>

I completely Hate this expansion sooo much. I have been so miserable the past several days since it came out and my guild took a break from raiding to check it out. I've done 5 adventures and only lost one. Dps was not the problem in the one failure however but it was lack of slower/cc. <br>
<br>
Group was:<br>
<br>
65 druid, 65 pally, 65 mage, 65 necro, 63 ranger and 65 wiz. <br>
Ton of dps, pally tanking, druid healing. Problem was no way to get single pulls and we had a few deaths twice and then ended up wiping completely. <br>
<br>
all my successful missions we had around 30min to spare. Had a slower, tank, healer and assorted dps. <br>
<br>
My biggest complaint here has to do with the fact that it's all about groups and really full groups. Yes you can get in with 4 people but you better be freakin uber and a cleric, tank, chanter and dps if you wanna shot at winning. There is nothing, absolutly nothing for the people who only have one or two friends online that are not busy and you can't do anythin with 3 people. I am in a pretty large guild and I spent over 5 hours in a row tryin to find a dungeon group with guildies or friends with no success. Reason being you have to have the key classes for each group to work and most of them were already taken so there'd just be maybe 2 clerics and a wiz lfg. <br>
<br>
You may say well just use the LFG tool but personally I find it to be an evil thing. I really hate grouping with people that I don't know, if it's one person it's not that big of a deal cause usually if they happen to not know what they are doing or how to play their class it doesn't wipe the whole group but sometimes it does. Being higher level I expect the other higher level people to be skilled in thier class and know what the hell they are doing but a ton of them don't anymore. Reason being would lead to another rant but I think it's time for me to shutup now. <br>

Sorta surprises them.<br>
<br>
As for all these DPS rantings, the place PoP needs DPS is trials.  Yep.  TRIALS, and that's really what matters.  I remeber being excited to hear about them being serious DPS testers.  Mages were creaming their pants I remember, finally being needed.<br>
<br>
Now we have tradeable keys and relaxed entry areas.  PoP trials are only used when you want to progress.<br>

<br>
Getting fast pulls is just as important as dps.<br>
<br>
With a bard pulling I have completed my last 6 crawls with 30-45 minutes to spare (various types of missions).<br>
<br>
Bard slowing is more than suitable for ldon, they can slow the mob on the pull and their slow lasts long enough as the mobs die pretty fast (average about 55 seconds per kill.. including pull time)<br>
<br>
My favourite group is: bard, 2 x dps (necro, ranger, mage, rogue), 1 healer (cleric, druid, shaman), and whoever else wants to come along (warrior preferable).<br>

I've never had a mission fail when we had a bard pulling.  They are scarey-good in dungeons when you need to chainpull on the clock.<br>
<br>
That said, I've also had good luck with a cleric + one other healer.  Let a cleric pull with pacify, and you get singles.  If there's another healer, they can chainpull, too.   It works really well!  Just make sure you pack some good DPS into the other slots.<br>

<br>
When I started playing all we did was crawl, everyone in the group had to know how to play their class, push themselves and pull off what was &quot;unheard of&quot;.<br>
<br>
So.. IMHO its not *just* well ballanced groups, not *just* your DPS factor its also player ability. if even 1 person is not as coordinated, quick, or able to make split seccond decisions it can slip you up as a group.<br>
<br>
no one wants to think.. &quot;hey is it me? am I 'off my game' tonight?&quot;  Most people would rather lay blame elsewhere.<br>
<br>
My skills are being honed and sharpened again like hasnt happened since the first year I played and I LOVE it. I see some areas where I have gotten slow in my old age or lax about somthing. (time to correct those!)<br>
 Newer players may not ever get that perspective I dont know but unless they give up because &quot;its too hard&quot; they Will get better, they Will learn and hopefully they won't hate doing it.<br>
<br>
for me this expansion has brought the enjoyment back to EQ.<br>

<br>
I love pulling in the new dungeons, you can sense traps, disarm traps, pacify pull, pull mez / charm or just plain old mass pull. With a twist of mana, flamesong, haste and chants you can help the killing go faster.<br>
<br>
Groups had success with include bard ranger druid shaman rogue druid..... bard ranger druid enchanter rogue druid....bard paladin druid ranger cleric.. druid druid wizard bard paladin ranger etc.  <br>
<br>
To be honest classes seem to matter less than having a group that can work well together. And a little bit to luck, some missions just seem harder than others.<br>
<br>
Also, you have to remember folk get tired doing these. The focus must be there, afks are not easy to do. The successful groups did not always have KEI, but they did have people focused on the task.  The unsuccessful groups had people who were tired and being distracted in the other realm.<br>
<br>
My prediction however is that those who LD  a lot will get the short end of the grouping stick <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   One of our failures was due to my ISP going poof at  3am, a maintenance time of theirs I had not realized had crept up on me. I realized how badly it sucks to be committed to a dungeon and not able to help. )<br>

<br>
It would behoove you to take 10 minutes before you enter a dungeon to see who you have in the group and discuss the tactics you want to use. You can come up with some pretty interested ways to deal with things if you use your noodle. <br>
<br>
For example, Druids and Ranger can be used to CC, and quite effectively.<br>
<br>
It really just depends on your group make up...however, don't expect to just jump in a dugeon with 5 strangers and expect to win without talking to them a little first.<br>

Success in groups with no chanter. Success in groups with no cleric or chanter. All my fails except one were in what most people would consider a well balanced group.<br>
<br>
Are there some odball group configurations that prolly won't succeed no matter what in LDON? Probably. Does the further a group is from the ideal balnaced group mean a more difficult time than a balanced group? Usually. <br>
<br>
Ldon is all about Team work, player skill and the ability to plan ahead and then adapt as needed. Good Gear, High DPS, Holy trinity groups do have a bit more room for error and can be done with people not quite as skilled. Even the most perfect group will fail if everyone is unskilled in playing their class.<br>
<br>
Every single adventure I have done was winable by the group that took it on without exception. The fails came due to bad luck, I.E. unexpected AFK's or LD's fell to the whim of the RNG, A poor decision on the groups part. I. E. using an inappropriate tacitic for a particular set of mobs, or a combination of the two.<br>
