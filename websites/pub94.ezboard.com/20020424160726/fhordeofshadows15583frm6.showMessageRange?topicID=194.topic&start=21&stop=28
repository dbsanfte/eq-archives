<br>
And anyone who supports the people who do, are even more stupid than the person who blames the games.<br>
<br>
People have problems in RL. Each and everyday, we are faced with either reoccurring problems, or new problems, both of which can take its toll on a person. <br>
<br>
People need &quot;Escapes&quot; to help give themselves &quot;alone time&quot; so that they can collect their thoughts, or set aside their stress, so that that may be able to enjoy themselves for a short time.<br>
<br>
These &quot;Escapes&quot; can be 1 of a number of things. Having a few drinks. Going to the movies. Working out. Restoring old cars. Painting a picture. Playing Everquest.<br>
<br>
People know, that &quot;Escapes&quot; are just a temporary way to feel good until they can resolve their RL issues. Just like you need a break at work, at times, you need a break from life. Life is hard work. Trust me. I know how tough life can be. And I have needed many breaks. And without those breaks, I would have surely gone insane. Too much of anything can be overbearing, and push people to new emotions, and actions that are not normal for them.<br>
<br>
You are in control of your own life. No one holds a gun to your head and demands that you play Everquest. There is no pusher standing next to you, telling you &quot;Just one more hit, you will feel better, I promise you&quot;.<br>
<br>
You bought the game of your own free will. You subscribed to the game at your own free will. Everquest was placed (Alphabetically in most places) among a vast number of other computer software titles. So its not like anyone forced it upon you to pick that game up and take it home. Nope. You did all that on your own.<br>
<br>
If problems arise because you play too much Everquest (or any other game for that matter) its your own damn fault. <br>
<br>
On a different note, people can become attached to their characters, or to other people who play the game. Critics say that, that kind of attachment is not healthy. Hmm. I know a lot of people who are attached to their cars, a comic book collection, sports trading card collections, autographed photos or a teddy bear they got when they were 3 years old. <br>
<br>
We attach ourselves, to things that mean something to us. Our characters that we play, have real time invested in them. And through those characters, we have forged friendships, some that stay in the realm of Everquest, and others that move into real life. I myself have both of those. <br>
<br>
Can we become too attached? Sure. But it's up to you to recognize that, and to rectify that problem before it gets too far out of control. When people start depending on their characters, for all of lifes needs, then sure, it has gone too far. But I myself have yet to run into anyone who relies entirely on Everquest to fulfill all areas of their life. <br>
<br>
Out of the 400,000+ who play this game, they found 1 of the 50 people who struggle with determining Everquest from Real Life. <br>
<br>
I am sorry he felt the need to take his own life.<br>
I am sorry his family lost a loved one.<br>
<br>
Did Everquest play a role in his death? No. His state of mind was already on the brink before he started playing Everquest. <br>
<br>
I could go on for days about this kind of thing. But the bottom line is that nothing, in this world, is to blame for the course your life takes, except yourself.<br>
<br>
You control yourself, and all your actions and emotions. Take responsibility for your actions.<br>
<br>
Don't blame others.<br>

While obviously not a perfect analogy, if we were to compare smoking, and its addictive aspects we might be able to extend that line of reasoning.  The &quot;addiction&quot; to smoking is not in and of itself the killer, it is the side effects that ensue from that addiction that create problems.  Trying to create this cause and effect spin might be damaging to some extent.  The way in which we frame the concept of &quot;addiction&quot; and its role in the casuation of a &quot;specific injury&quot; would be for me, the crux of the plaintiff's argument, and the grounds by which Sony could be viewed negilgent in its duty to product the consumer.<br>
<br>
I look forward to the next round ).  I ain't no stinkin lawyer so I may have a simpler view of how the law works, but the way in which the the terminology is established must have some bearing on all this.<br>

You bought the cigarettes of your own free will.  You went to the convenience store at your own Free Will.  Your brand of choice was placed (Alphabetically in most places) among a vast number of other cigarette brands.  So it's not like anyone forced it upon you to pick up that cigarette and smoke it.  Nope.  You did all that on your own.<br>
<br>
Same arguement stands, cigarette companies (admittedly evil) are getting ravaged by law suits.<br>
<br>
I don't think the case has any merit.  However, just because something is legal and you don't *have* to buy it doesn't mean it isn't harmful.  And if you are the maker of the item in question, you better have your ducks in a row, because the second someone burns themselves on a hot iron and feels like it, the jackals will come running.<br>

<br>
Cigarette companies now know their products are harmful. They now know they are addictive. They said they did not know this &quot;back when&quot;. But, of course they did.  They were caught lying, and are being made to pay for it.<br>
<br>
The question is, did/do Sony know EQ is harmful ? Did/do they purposefully manufacture (code), package and sell EQ so that it's addictive ? (As opposed to just marketing their product).<br>
