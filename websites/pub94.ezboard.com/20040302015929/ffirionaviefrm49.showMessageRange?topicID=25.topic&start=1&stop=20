 I joined with my friend and in game brother Aailin for his epic final stage in Plane of Fear! Dying and going LD due ISP problems I wasn’t able to log immediately. He petitioned because he knew I was having serious RL issues that might (and it turned out that it did ) prevent me from logging back for awhile. After 3 weeks things settled down in RL and I logged back to find out that I lost all my items due to corpse decay. Aailin told me that he petitioned and got the reply from a guid that everything will be ok once I came back and petitioned. I I did that everyday for a month now! Guide after Guide gave the “don’t worry about it, we are waiting for gm will look into it and we put it on the fast track panel) NOTHING happened. I never saw a GM and when I send them an email they replied with “policy number whatever blah blah …… tough luck, live with it)! <br>
I can’t believe this, shit happens and I understand but to be so inconsiderate to players is just not right. If you can’t (or won’t) do it why tell me and my friends that they will fix it. I am very disappointed with all this carp. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/azindar/sign.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

The GMs showed their true colors when they essentially refused to help anybody with problems during Fan Faire.  <br>

If you really want your stuff back keep petitioning and email Contact your GM through the link on the EQ homepage, but besides no drop items I doubt you will get anything back.<br>

Send 1 email and only one by the Contact your gm thing on the Sony site. You always check /who all GM if a GM is on you send them a tell , this lets you talk to them directly , Sadly if the GM doesnt do anything then nothing can be done , my suggestion although i am not sure if it will work if you were on EQ for more than 1 second after your corpse was gone , would be a request to go back to your previous save , if that doesnt work , you need to give the GM a no Bullshit list of what you have , if you dont lie and say you had stuff you didnt have (yes they can tell) then they will most likely return your items. Keep trying , contact GMs have guilds petition etc etc. and keep petitioning to be heard. I hope everything turns out ok , and look foward to you gettting you things back. <p>Jaehun Leifong<br>

That means on whatever date and time you died in PoF, the GM has to physically search the log file for you name and any events that related to your name.<br>
Once they do that, they will then have to go back and check your character saves, to see what equipment you had.<br>
<br>
Now two things will cause this to have problems. 1) its too old and the logs are gone, or 2) You've gotten a bazzilion levels since then and restoring to last save would be rediculous.<br>
<br>
Like they said above, send one email to contact your gm, but dont sent a direct tell to a gm, they have to go in petition order, and because you &quot;cut in the line&quot; they cant do anything for you right away, and if they have to log, suddenly there's no one pleading your case 'cause ya didnt petition. Just petition every day and include ALL the details in your petition, where what when how and why and what you want. Dont get mad a the guides, even if they want to help you, they cant because they dont have access to the log files.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> In Perfect Hate, and Perfect Faith</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

You want me to feel sorry that someone lost thier parents, fine, i feel for them. It happens to all of our parents, you learn to deal with it. But, you want me to feel sorry because you lost all your items..nope, not today, not ever. You want me to help you to get some new 1's and 0's, fine, i'll be there.<br>
<br>
The only reason that i'm a jerk is becuase someone claims to have lost their parents? how fucking gulible are you? You send money to help the poor children..don't you..fucking sap. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kuladen@firionavie>Kuladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/19/02 8:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> (*buh-link*) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

How.. can.. what... <br>

That is the single worst thing I think I have ever read on any of the boards. Holy  cow.<br>
<br>
To the person who lost their parents: I'm very sorry.<br>
<br>
to Korzax: So what if I'm gullable. It's better to give too much love than not enough. I hope whatever it is in your life that makes you such a horrible person goes away. And then I hope you read what you have wrote and it makes devistates you as much as you have devistated others. <br>

She would sit on the corner and shake and shiver in her old clothes and look pathetic with a sign around her neck that read &quot;please help, I will pray for you&quot;.<br>
<br>
and people would throw $50's at her because they all felt so sorry that an old lady had to live on the streets.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, so went home every night and sat on her leather couch and watch her 54&quot; tv with her family..boy, glad i wasn't one of the saps that threw money into her hand.<br>
<br>
And you know why people believed her shit...becuase they, like you..are gulible. I have one persons word about someone else's pain...someone I don't know, someone I have never met. <br>
<br>
And, it's not like I read about him losing his folks and then making my comments, oh no, we have someone else telling me AFTER the comments that i should know that facts and not make judgements..right, you mean like AAILIN did. and then after making his judgement, he then calls me a piece of shit? and you all expect me to react how? Fuck ya all. that's how i'm gonna react. <br>
<br>
When someone claims to have lost everything because they couldn't log on, that could mean many different thing..one of them being..he didn't have the fucking money to pay for his account because he hasn't had a job in 2 years cuz he's too busy playing EQ, or, something equally bad..or, maybe his parents really did die..I don't know, and neither do any of you.<br>
i don't give people the benefit of the doubt, that's for chumps.<br>

You know that part of the other thread where you lamented how easy it is for people to use computers these days, so that even folks as ignorant as I am can get on-line?  Well, I lament the fact that computers provide a degree of distance and protection that regular society doesn't allow, and people as completely ass-wad ignorant as you are get to suffer the painful and often physical consequences of their ignorance.<br>
<br>
Not that this is a threat, or anything, but if we ever happened to be in the same room and you went on about how someone's parent's dying is a lame and possibly fake excuse, you'd get more than a flame.  You'd get someone's foot up your ass, for tame starters.<br>
