Here are some must to see's and must not see's:<br>
<br>
Alexander: Colin Farrell, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie 9/22<br>
- something to note here: the movie is being directed by Oliver &quot;Fucking&quot; Stone, which is a bloody good thing. Stone won't pull punches and will delve into themes that only someone who has injested South American tribal mind-alterants and run through the jungle like a raving lunatic for weeks, could come up with. In short, if it doesn't rock, I'll be shocked.<br>
<br>
Also note, that another Alexander the Great movie is in/entering production starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman, with Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge) directing. Again, this could be interesting given Luhrmann's arresting visuals, however pound for pound, I would defer to Stone as the &quot;better director&quot; in terms of style, story and sheer guts. Also, Alexander better not fucking sing in Luhrmann's version.<br>
<br>
Since we're talking about epics, how about:<br>
<br>
Troy: starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana (Hulk), Orlando Bloom (Legolas, in case you've been under a rock), Brian Cox (the bad dude in X-men 2) and Sean Bean (Boromir in LoTR). What's better, Wolfgang Petersen is directing (the Perfect Storm and the Neverending StoooOOOOOryyyyy, dee-doo-deeeeeee, dee-doooo-deeeee, dee-doo-deeeeeee *cough*)<br>
<br>
Blade: Trinity: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson 9/23<br>
- hopefully they'll attach Billy Bob Thornton to this project and have him reprise the Karl character from Slingblade...<br>
<br>
The Bourne Supremacy: Matt Damon 12/03<br>
- The Bourne Identity distinguished itself as a relatively intelligent and &quot;small story&quot; (i.e. compared to a Bond movie) action-thriller. The Ludlum books are great and something in Damon's portrayal of Bourne makes the first movie worthy of repeat views. I'm looking forward to this bigtime.<br>
<br>
Catwoman: Halie Berry 9/03 (Disb WB)<br>
- lol...at least we won't have to put up with her and another nauseating Oscar speech over this one...<br>
<br>
Collateral: Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, Val Kilmer 10/03 <br>
- holy shit! This movie should be retitled: EGO!!!! But for the fact that the words &quot;Jamie Foxx&quot; interposes between Cruise and Kilmer's names, our monitors would explode from the clash of egos. Kilmer HAS talent (doubt me, please refer to Tombstone) however he is notoriously difficult to work with: I've never heard of a director, let alone anyone else for that matter, publicly badmouth another member of Hollywood like Joel Shumacker badmouthed Kilmer after doing Batman with him. Also, for those who endured watching Red Planet...the movie might have been better if Kilmer and Sizemore hadn't crippled production with mutual restraining orders on each other forcing the film to overcome ridiculous hurdles just to be completed.<br>
<br>
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson 4/04<br>
- okay fine.<br>
<br>
MI 3: Tom Cruise 1/04<br>
- please refer to &quot;Collateral&quot; above. Also, MI 2 netted Cruise an estimated 60 million dollars (he produced it). Stop the madness...okay fine, I like him too.<br>
<br>
The Phantom of the Opera: Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, Minne Driver 9/15 (prod. Joel Schumacher)<br>
- from the man who destroyed the Batman franchise comes the complete and utter rape of a timeless classic...<br>
<br>
Terminal: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride 9/29<br>
- sounds interesting. Tucci is magnificent and woefully underused. Hopefully Michael Douglas is cutting back on his Viagra intake so that the film doesn't have to depict, yet again, a pregnant Zeta-Jones.<br>
<br>
The Punisher: Thomas Jane, John Travolta, Rebecca Romijn Stamos 8/2<br>
- please, PLEASE, fuck no. Aside from preaching Scientology like a manic Robert Tilton on meth and wiping out the craft service table like a roving pack of hyienas, Travolta carries with him such a vicious case of &quot;teh suckage&quot; that virtually noone who has been in a movie with him has escaped unscathed. And I also heard that Busta Rhymes is attached...<br>
<br>
Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson 2/24<br>
- I said fine.<br>
<br>
Resident Evil: Apocalypse 8/11<br>
- get outta here. Well... fuck...just call her Lee-Loo, slap on the pink hair and have J.P. Gaultier design her skimpy attire and we have an agreement.<br>
<br>
...and you forgot some of the following:<br>
<br>
Van Helsing, May 7, 2004: Hugh Jackman, some other folks and Kate &quot;Yummy&quot; Beckinsale. Jackman = Mob Slayer Van Helsing and he hunteth Dracula, da Wolf Man and Frankenshtein. All I can say is that they better suit up Jackman with a HUGE hat, funky gloves and a big-ass revolver with runes on it and have reaaaaaaalllllly dramatic stand-offs or we'll find Searyx on a rooftop with a high powered rifle.<br>
<br>
21 Jump Street! No I'm not lying! No, I don't think Depp will be in it!<br>
<br>
Alien 5, supposedly, sometime in 2004: allegedly starring Sigorny Weaver and rumored to have Shwartzenegger attached, the producers are said to be &quot;in talks&quot; with James Cameron. Yeah...sure...<br>
<br>
Alien vs. Predator, 2005 sometime: to be written and directed by Paul Anderson, this convoluted character-piece will examine the many layers and complexities of the Alien and the Predator as they come to grips with their co-dependent relationship. While the cast hasn't yet been &quot;nailed-down&quot;, this sure to be festival darling will UNDOUBTABLY feature performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Juliane Moore, that short Mexican guy that does about 90% of all the Mexican roles in big budget movies, John C. Reilly, and...errr...whatafuckingminute...it's Paul W. S. Anderson, who directed &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, not Paul Thomas Anderson, who owes me $4.48 because I rented &quot;Punch Drunk Love&quot;...<br>
<br>
Alone in the Dark, 2004: starring Christian Slater, yet another attempt to deliver the magnificence of H.P. Lovecraft's stories to visual medium will end in a horror greater than mighty Cthulhu.<br>
<br>
The Amazing Spiderman, July, 2004: in an attempt to liven up the role of Peter Parker and better connect the character to the audience, Sam Raimi has replaced Tobey McGuire with a board that has a smile drawn on it with magic marker.<br>
<br>
The A-Team, and it better come out soon: starring Jack Black, Owen Wilson, Brendan Fraiser and Mr. Fucking-T. That's right, don't even *think* about making a rude comment about this. You'll go, you'll go again, and then you'll go yet again...PUNK!<br>
<br>
Avenging Angelo...hah...it's on video!: starring Sly Stallone, I just threw this in here to rub in the fact that Sly is done.<br>
<br>
Starsky &amp; Hutch, March 5, 2004: Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Wil Farrell (who will probably be naked). Pure own.<br>
<br>
Star Wars Episode III, May 25, 2004: unless the first 5 minutes, you know, where the big Star Wars text rolls by, is a very detailed and heartfelt apology by George Lucas for absolutely destroying the best trilogy of all time, he can go fuck himself and his billion dollars.<br>
<br>
Battlefield Earth 2: no...I'm not lying. Fine, don't believe me: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/b/battlefieldearth2.shtm">www.thezreview.co.uk/comi...arth2.shtm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Blair Witch 3: the Prequel: unless the producers can promise that Michael J. Fox will show up in a Delorian and take me back in time to just before I bought the ticket to this movie, I won't go see this.<br>
<br>
The Book of Skulls, 2004/2005: from the director of the Exorcist, William Freidkin will direct this supernatural sci-fi fantasy about a group of four '70s college students who discover a mysterious manuscript (the translation from Latin is Book of Skulls) that promises immortality for those willing to search for it. Here's the catch: Only two people out of the required group of four will live forever; two others must die along the way. How? One must be sacrificed, and the other has to commit suicide. Actually sounds great.<br>
<br>
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, 2004: director - Tim Burton, starring - Johnny Depp. But who will play the Ooompa-Looompas?<br>
<br>
Dr. Seuss' the Cat in the Hat, November, 2003: Mike Meyers. I honestly don't know.<br>
<br>
The Dukes of Hazzard, 2004: Asthon Kutcher, Paul Walker and Britanny Spears. I think this is one time we'll hope the good ol' General Lee doesn't quite make that jump.<br>
<br>
Elf, November 7, 2004: Will Ferrell has been raised at the North Pole by elves, in the employ of Santa. After inadvertently causing much harm, he's shipped off to live with his biological father, played by James Caan (TOTALLY out of his element in this role...what a stretch) in New York City, where he turns his dad's life upside down. <br>
<br>
Envy, April 2, 2004: Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken. That's enough to get me in the door.<br>
<br>
The Exorcist IV: the Beginning, February 6, 2004: while the cast is kinda weak, the fact that it's being directed by Paul Schrader, who has written such legendary pieces as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, and directed interesting pieces such as &quot;Auto Focus&quot; and &quot;Affliction&quot;, lends the possibility that this might be handled with the tight, cohesiveness and alternating subtlety/grotesqueness that made the Exorcist what is was, and still is.<br>
<br>
...well...that's enough to chew on for a while.<br>

I'm going to see Underworld for her and her alone. I'm just hoping the movie doesnt bring forth teh sux. <br>
<br>
But man. I cant belive that some of these movies are being made. <br>

I've been itching for this movie since Predator came out and the Pred vs Alien comics started being made. I hope they dont screw this up. I'll go see it if it actually comes out. <br>

/agree<br>
<br>
I agree with alot of your reviews for these films. If they mess up the movies I want to see, I'll be pissed. I saw ALOT of similar names. They need to go find unknowns and kick these big names to the curb or limit thier movies. I think Tom Cruise is in like 4 or 5 of those movies. <br>
<br>

I must be the only one who likes the Blair Witch movies.  Oh well.  But, still... a prequel?  What's it going to cover?  Rustin Parr?  Been done.  Coffin Rock?  Yep.  It's been done, too.  The actual ousting of Elly Kedward?  Yet again, it's been done.  What's left?  granted these were the Blair Witch video games, but they were pretty much considered canon.<br>
<br>
And a new Resident Evil?  Excellent.  I thought the first one was a pretty good waste of 90 minutes.<br>
<br>
Alien 5 = no thanks.  Alien 3 and Resurrection sucked hard.  Is it possible to make another good Alien movie?  Maybe.  But I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Alone in the Dark is most likely based on the video game, which is a pre-Resident Evil &quot;survival horror&quot; game.  If it weren't for AITD, we'd have no RE or Silent Hill.  It's like Wolfenstein 3D to Resident Evil's Doom.<br>
<br>
Blade 3?  Why not give me a proper Blade 2 first, thanks.<br>
<br>
The Punisher - Can't be any worse than Dolph Lundgren's portrayal of Frank Castle.  I'm actually looking forward to this.  All we need is big guns and A SHIRT WITH A FREAKING SKULL ON IT!!!<br>
<br>
Mission Impossible 3 - As a stand-alone flick, M:I2 was alright.  As a Mission: Impossible movie, it blew.  Make it more like the first one, and I'll see it.<br>
<br>
Catwoman: Where's Michelle Pfeiffer, damn it?<br>
<br>
The Phantom of the Opera - Joel Schumaker?  God, no.<br>
<br>
21 Jump Street: Put in Holly Robinson, and I'll go see it.  I loved that show.<br>
<br>
New Spiderman good.  New Bourne movie good, but will Franka Potente make it in again?  I haven't seen or read any Harry Potter.  The rest?  We'll see.<br>

One movie that I'm looking forward to is Kill Bill by Quentin Taratino.  Sure, it's all hype and a short movie trailer, but damn, that's an awesome looking trailer.  It's apparently a two-parter as well.  Hopefully, he'll hit the right combination of Kung Fu and Pulp Fiction cool.<br>
<br>
Anyone notice the new Desperado sequel coming out?  It's called Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  Might be worth checking out too. Mr. 21 Jump Street himself is starring in the movie. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Episode I and II weren't that bad.  What Lucas was really going for was a kind of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; atmosphere.  See through excruciating trial and error I have found the true beauty of at least one of the episodes.<br>
<br>
If you own Episode II on DVD, simply skip every single scene in the movie that has Anakin (excluding all scenes that also have yoda).  Your movie viewing time will be cut dramatically and you'll leave your entertainment room alot more satisfied with the flick.<br>
<br>
Kurley, I think I agree with just about every you had to say about all the movies.  That would have to be one hell of an apology that Lucas makes... <br>

Why are they taking Toby McGuire out of the Spiderman movies?  The movie made like 400 million domestically and they think they need a more &quot;appealing&quot; lead?  Toby was perfect for the part.  The spiderman -vs- goblin parts of the movie were the least interesting, Toby running around a wrestling cage in underoos... that's the stuff I shelled out 8 bucks for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If they try and take Spiderman the way of the Batman movies I certainly won't be there.  I stayed away from Batman 3/4.  I stayed away from Phantom menace.  I can certainly stay away from Spiderman II.  That's what the video store &amp; 99 cent Tuesday rentals is for.<br>
