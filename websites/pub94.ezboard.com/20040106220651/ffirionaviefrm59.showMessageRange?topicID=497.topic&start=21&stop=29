Jaranna knows that I will help her on any endeavour she wishes. Even if it involves &lt;shudders&gt; raiding...<br>
<br>
Personally, I am halfway through my own epic, but I doubt highly that I will continue it for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1) I hate raiding... I abhor sitting there for hours, kill, kill, kill... cast, cast, cast. I don't mind it in moderation, like those Seb raids I participated in with Jaya ( I think, too many names in my little head ).<br>
<br>
2) Have you seen the necromancer epic? What the heck is it? A twig with a duck head stuck on the end? It is so goofy looking and Vivienne is all about fashion<br>
and style, not the stats the item gives. She'll keep her Harvester, thank you very much, that at least looks halfway decent.<br>
<br>
Jaranna and I know several high seasons, and making a go of critter Jaranna needs should be possible, but your offer is most appreciated, Vicaire, and your aid would be wonderful &lt;smiles&gt;. The main thing is neither of us are experienced in leading raids. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/baddog117/vivirose.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
It is funny how twards the end of the string it drifted away from the subject of reserving vs. FCFSbut it's all relevent.<br>
<br>
First: <br>
There comes a point where FCFS isn't right. such as twice now where I have gather up in an open raid that was posted here. only to find out as we readied to move in that the Plane/Mob was dead. The first time with Hate the guild that was up there made a nice gester and gave us all the armor drops from the raid. Yes it was nice. Except alot of us were along for possible epic drops which we never got a shot at. all in all though it was Honorible for then to do so.. and will remain so in my eyes. <br>
<br>
The second time was with VS. as we gathered we were stopped well short of even starting due to news that a guild had moved in and taken him down already. &lt; shakes her head &gt; VS, Trak, FCFS? Why? Who says? the people that had been planning the raid for atleast a little while watched thier chance at getting a part of thier epic out of the way due to a bigger stronger guild moved in first. <br>
<br>
FCFS is not fair to thoes who are not in a big raiding guild and have to reley on open raids to do so. Like me. Sure FCFS is prefered... by thoes same big guilds. Not by thoes who have to hope and pray they will get into an open raid and win a roll against who knows how many others of the same class looking for the same thing. Then to lose that chance because some &quot; Uber &quot; guild decides they want it and move first? Yes, I know most guilds are honorible.... but not all and not always, Espically where pride comes into play. <br>
<br>
For example. An up and comming Trak raid mostly open. posted for the last peice of an epic. Yet, if a guild or powerful enough group got it in mind they could move in and take it with the FCFS rule as thier shiled from wrong doing. <br>
<br>
I know I might seem I am rambling a little but there are thoes out there that understand what I am saying I think. and it basically boils down to what a friend told me &quot; There is the letter of the law and the Spirit of the law &quot; Like camping normal mobs. Someone sits and waits for a mob to spawn.. they have put in the time and the effort sometimes days waiting for this mob to spawn.... then as it does spawn someone higher lvl comes in and kills it right before your eyes.. I'm sure you old time Wisdom caster can identify with this with a certian mob in HHP called Dylian Starshine? Was one of the heavest camped mobs for a +10 wisdom book long before even Kunark was discovered. 8 hour spawn time... and people use to sit for thoes long 8 hours... and have him KSed by someone more powerful.... then telling you &quot; Varent/Sony/EQ whatever says there is no such thing as camping &quot;  Or even closer to home we all know by now The Geo's I have watched people Complain about the group that is there needs to share the spawns cause there is no camping.. yet I see thoes same people a week later duoing with someone and yelling that it's their camp. Yet MOST of us know that if someone was thier trying for a long time... then give them the respect of it being theirs. Same with posted raids.. someone puts in the time and effort to gather up the needed people for the raid... then don't over shoot them just cause the letter of the law says you can. <br>
<br>
Finally as for epics. Yes.. there are alot of weapons out there that make epics less then needed if we of non uber guilds ever see them. Epics are more then that I have to agree with am eairler post. It's not the weapon, it's the feeling of accomplishment that you took a very difficult and drawn out quest to then end.. and earned the reward. I have to go to the Plane of the Air for part of my epic.. ohh wonderful... I have a better shot at the shattered emerald in hate then getting a raid in the PoA.... I have yet to even see an open raid for PoA. Does that mean I should give up? I think not. Even if I have to research the PoA, Pay for it out of my own Plat. and find someone to run it for me.. I will get my epics. &lt; sighs &gt; if you can read through the meandering... I think there are things in what I said that make sense <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

And neither side is wrong<br>
<br>
Folks in small guilds, or who are guildless, have a hard time organizing raids.  They tend to have a more limited number of targets as well (the first floor of Plane of Hate is a fair raid for a green group of high 40's/low 50's.  The higher Planes in PoP, or even places like the Halls of Testing, are simply out of their range.)  These are the folks who benifit from a reservation system.  It gives them a chance to plan their events, and in a guild/alliance/open raid that lacks expereince with organization, this can be vital.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, folks in raiding guilds and higher-end alliances pay the same money each month to gain access to the same content as the little guys.  They want their epics to, and have just as much right to hunt in Plane of Hate as the small guild who needs a week to prepare.  From their point of view, there is nothing stopping the small guild folks from building up their alliances, or even joining a stronger guild, just as they did.<br>
<br>
Now personally, I think the fairest path is somewhere in the middle.  The general consensus on open raids seems to be that guilds will give them special consideration, allowing them a shot at a zone or a mob without a race to gather raid forces.  I think this is a good thing, and the right approach.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the number of closed raids posted here in recent weeks vastly outnumbers the amount of open raids.  And I do not think a closed raid from an up and coming alliance should be treated any differently than a closed raid from an established guild.<br>
<br>
This is where I part company with the majority of folks who post here, I expect.  If Resolution (not to pick on anyone, or to even suggest they would ever do this) posted here that they planned on going to PoH next Thursday in a closed raid for epic mobs, should other guilds capable of doing Hate, who also need epic drops, honor this?  Why does a guild posting here have more right to the content than a guild that does not read these boards at all?<br>
<br>
Now narrow this down to the smaller picture.  An alliance that is quite capable of raiding the Halls of Testing, Kael, Kunark dragons, etc... posts here that they intend to go to Hate next Thursday in a closed raid for epic drops.  Should other guilds honor their intention, when they have players who need those drops to?  <br>
<br>
This is where reservation systems start to break down--when guilds and alliances outgrow the open-raid stage, but continue to try and take advantage of the system.  The more established guilds view this as gaming the system, and after a while simply start to ignore reservations.  The up and coming guys feel they are doing nothing wrong, this is how it has always been done, and this kind of reservation system keeps the server from degenerating into chaos.  Which side is right?  Hard to say.  But I hope folks on both sides of this issue will consider the other's position, and not simply label them as greedy for disagreeing with your own.<br>

Alas...<br>
<br>
Truly the majority of those who play on this server, are, in the best sense of the word, honorable.  Again, with that said, where is the honor in not respecting this type of system?  I have full intention of building (and am making fabulous progress) a guild capable of performing planer raids or large game hunts in a closed raid fashion with relative ease.  With that said, I can assure everyone that while I am at the helm of Chivalrous Valor, we will continue to respect the system that has been established by the *majority* of the playing guilds on this server.  It would be dishonorable, in my opinion, to not do so.<br>
<br>
This entire discussion seems bullish to me.  It seems that the top 10 guilds in terms of raw power prefer the FCFS system while the rest of us are screaming for mercy.  I admire those of you in the power guilds that have posted on this thread and stated explicitly that you left raid targets up for reasonable intent.  That is honorable. And for those of you who continue to wipe zones despite intents posted on this thread...  it speaks volumes of your integrity...<br>
<br>
I'm sure that a compromise can be reached... and from what I have seen on this server (relatively new to FV), a compromise is desperately needed.  And why not?  I have raised many characters across many servers and reservation systems are *preferred* for the very reasons the majority of us are stating...  Us &quot;little guys&quot; like to have fun too. :/<br>

I have been on both sides of this issue, in a medium-end raiding guild (at least for 2 years ago) on another server, and now guildess here.  But let me make a few points.<br>
<br>
Certainly, first come first served is in the self-interest of established raiding guilds.  But I don't think it is fair to malign their honor for it.  While it may well end up preventing some lower level guilds or alliances from getting the mob or zone they want from time to time, a reservation system has the same effect on the raiding guilds.  Both are driven by self interest, so I do not feel it is fair to charetorize one as honorable and the other as not.<br>
<br>
Further, I think the reservation systems have a tendency to collapse under their own weight after a while.  Let's say a guild alliance uses the reservation system here.  They use it quite often, so often in fact that nearly every weekend they are in either Plane of Hate or Plane of Fear.  Now, is it fair to other guilds who would also like to do those planes that the system is used thus?  <br>
<br>
And what if the guilds who comprise the allainces also &quot;book&quot; dates individually?  With the result that some folks are effectively enjoying one or other old-world plane each weekend, while the rest of the server are left twiddling their thumbs and complaining about their lack of access to epic mobs?   I am *not* arguing that this is happening here, but it did happen on my old server (Innoruuk) and it wrecked the reservation system we enjoyed for several years.<br>
<br>
And is their a limit on what can be booked?  I've seen the level 52 dragons, chardok royals, Planes of Hate, Fear, and Sky, the Junk Beast in plane of Innovation, various Luclin mobs, etc... all be &quot;reserved&quot; here.  Should the reservation system apply to everything?  Should raiding guilds ignore the dragon that is up for 4 days so that they might honor the booking of a guild that can only kill it on weekends?<br>
<br>
And the booking system sets up a situation where it is implied that small guilds or alliances somehow have more right to a reservable-mob or epic drop than the raiding guilds.  Obviously, this does not sit very well with the bigger guilds.  Everyone pays the same amount per month to play the game, and many would argue that everyone, regardless of their willingness to peruse message boards, deserves the same access to content.  <br>
<br>
I am enormously sympathetic to the plight of small guilds.  I prefer them, they are less headache and more fun.  Heck, I've been guildless on this server for 55 levels, so I obviously have no need to take the side of raiding guilds out of my own self interest.  I simply think the reservation system is getting out of hand, and if folks do not become a bit more reasonable in their expectations of it, it is going to collapse under its own weight.<br>
<br>
If you are organizing an open, or even semi-open raid, and post here, I think nearly everyone would honor it.  That is the way it should be.  But I do not think that any private guild raid, closed alliance raid, etc... deserves any special treatment, whether it is posted here or not.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirdo>Sirdo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Self-proclaimed defender of <br>the little guys

<br>
And that, my friend.. is exactly my point.  As long as everyone stays fair, I have seen reservation systems flourish.  But indeed, you are correct when you say that some do take advantage of the system... for that, they must live with the ridicule of their peers and the disrespect of their reservations.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to bash the power guilds.  In fact, most of them are incredibly sympathetic to our pleese.  However, there is always one that falls off the honor wagon.. and for that, their progress as a guild will do one of two things: 1) annoy all of their potential future recruits, or, 2) entice people to join them as they are the guild that sets the pace.  Why do they set the pace you ask, because there is absolutely nothing that we can do about it.<br>

<br>
I was originally from an uber crowded blue server with off-hours guilds (Asian and the like who are awake when we sleep).  And no mob was EVER up.<br>
<br>
The larger more competitive guilds abandoned the reservation system that the small guilds and pick-up raids used.<br>
<br>
This meant that when a raid was scheduled.. not only was there a 50% chance that the zone had been cleared by an off-time guild... as they never bothered checking any board, but then you had the larger guilds who would go up and clear JUST the minis in Hate, or the revenants.. or JUST the Shissar in Fear... leaving just the junk mobs behind.  Some being as rude as jumping a plane when we had already been fighting in it.<br>
<br>
We do not want to go here.<br>
<br>
Currently this is a nice undercrowed server.. but for bigger guilds to feel *inconvenienced* by checkin one board, it snobby and rude.<br>
<br>
As smaller guilds we do get constantly inconvienced by mob-ganking.  It is hard planning a raid three weeks in advance, and arriving to find another guild just cleared the plane to get to the mob boss.<br>
<br>
Personally.. I think the larger guilds should have to plan as well.. since smaller groups cannot kill gods, and such without wipeouts.. why not let them do the work.. and schedule you expedition after they have done what they have done.<br>
<br>
Only thinking you are better than your peers leads to the *inconvenience* idea of checking a board.<br>
<br>
I have never been a member of an uber guild.  I had a 62 cleric on another server who turned down 4 invites from several high teir guilds.. just to stay with friends.<br>
<br>
I pay the same $12 a month that you do.  How is your experience worth any more than mine is?<br>

The only reason I read it at all was I actually came here today to see if there was an Open raid that could use my help. Most  of the people posting on this are relativly new to the discussion. (or at least the EZBoard Account names are new to me) So I shall recap the highlights of the previous threads as such:<br>
<br>
1-Almost every guild will respect an Open Raid attempting to do something.<br>
There is NO such thing as a Semi-Open Raid. It isn't open to all, then it's limited, and you roll your dice and move your mice like everybody else.<br>
<br>
2-It has happened, but it is very rare, where one guild will leapfrog another about to hit a mob. (F&amp;F and Reso ganking each other does not count) See the Turtle thread, circa 14 months ago or so. Most will even give you another shot if you wipe the first time. Two strikes and you are out though. This ain't baseball and not your Aunt Peggy's....you don't get three strikes, or as much as you want. One wipe might happen because of luck, after that, it's seen as a lack of power, tactics, leadership, you name it. Nobody is obligated to watch an underpowered, poorly lead, can't get it's act together force die 20 times against a mob that it is ready and able to take out. Go back to Double AA, learn what you are doing, then come back. And don't whine about it either.<br>
<br>
3-Not everybody knows every frigging spawn time or rate of every mob in the game. Sometimes people kill things, not knowing that it is a 72 hour spawn or what have you.....which<br>
leads to reason 4.<br>
<br>
4-Not everybody reads the board. Not everybody KNOWS about this board. If there is an official board, I would guess it would be Sony's FV Board, and not this one. I am almost certain that my entire guild does not read this particular section after getting ganked twice. (I posted and helped organize the Infamous Fear Raid that Vulrath and Shabba speak of) We are an Iksar orientated guild. Goodies don't want us, Evil's can't handle our neutrals. If it isn't a raid we plan or are specificly invited too, we just don't go, so why should we bother reading this section?<br>
<br>
5-Grow up. Learn to  have Alternate plans. Have some ideas of what ya'd like to do, and then back ups for them too. My guild might be the second worst travelling guild on FV (Wave to the Ven Sho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Go Team!! You're #1!!). We have one wizard and one druid on with any regularity. That means we run and PoK and run some more. If we can do it, and I can run raids with Team A.D.D. then so can every single guild on this server.<br>
<br>
6- Talk to the &quot;High End&quot; guilds. For the most part if you need help with &quot;an&quot; item, one or two of the members might be bored and can come around to help, and this will assure that they know that Epic_Mob_02 is being hunted on Tuesday, so please, Clan Resolute Storms of Demented Twisted Fury, don't have one of your single group Kill Teams go and stomp on it. (However this sometimes involves curious bargains such as &quot;Um sure Milow, you can tank if you want&quot; )<br>

<br>
Yethuy says: &quot;Sure we have healers, got Jhary right here.&quot;<br>
Other Guild Raider 01 says : &quot;Most four group raids have more than one person who can heal.&quot;<br>
Setral says: &quot;You go on wimpy raids...and anyway, rangers can heal too...and Xethux has his bandaging up to 80% now.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showMessageRange?topicID=497.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showPrevMessage?topicID=497.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showNextMessage?topicID=497.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=497.topic&index=29><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.threadControl?topicID=497.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=497.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=497.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59>The Battlefield</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
