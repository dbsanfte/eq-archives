This place lacked proper security, the sooner he could convince his mother to relocate somewhere else the better. No matter the chest had remained undiscovered for his entire life time, with the family becoming active again the risks of discovery were too high.<br>
<br>
He had to admit though, that no one would think to look for them here, and a cover so laboriously created would perhaps last a bit longer.<br>
<br>
“So was it the wind or something else?” Maelgroth asked the face drying on the rack before him.<br>
<br>
It only fluttered a bit in the last dregs of the wind gust. To the young necromancer it seemed the mask was winking at him.<br>
<br>
The journey to the temple was not one that was enjoyable to Naelaelayle, first there was the pool of vomit, nearly on the family doorstep, then the long hobble through the troll infested foreign quarter, the second gate and finally the temple precinct. When she was a child, she had strode these passageways with pride, the Waes’Harventhar crest proudly displayed on her cloak. Now she shuffled along, careful not to catch the eye of the temple guards, afraid that she would be denied access to the temple.<br>
<br>
Her only real difficulty came when her daughter kept her waiting.<br>
<br>
“Is this a safe place to talk?” Naelaelayle asked, looking around carefully.<br>
<br>
“When will you realize no one cares about your stupid crusade mother!” Blisshadow barked. She hated being reminded of the low status her family had. Her mother coming here and pretending to have real news or knowledge of events worth her notice was tiring. She only saw her mother now because she knew the crone would wait until she was seen. That was worse than seeing the old bat and sending her on her way.<br>
<br>
“You would not say such a thing if you visited your mother more often.”<br>
<br>
“This room is as safe as any in the temple.” Bliss replied. It was true, all rooms were open to the spells of the high priests, but it was rare that they bothered to look. They were too busy spying on each other than to waste time on some mid level church functionary. Bliss had been successful in the church because she was efficient, and not connected to any one family. Sure others had rocketed up the church hierarchy, but few had attained her position from the lower rungs of Teir’Dal society.<br>
<br>
Naelaelayle hissed disdainfully, she recalled the shrine the Waes’Harventhars had raised to Innoruk. The fawning of the priests when house members came calling. To take pride in this bureaucratic position was to be foolish.<br>
<br>
“Your brother went to a party last night.”<br>
<br>
“Good for him, I hope he got lucky.”<br>
<br>
“Your other brother.”<br>
<br>
“And this is of interest to me?” Bliss whined. She had better things to do than listen to this poor information.<br>
<br>
“The party was at the Chath’elg’Caress mansion.”<br>
<br>
Now Blisshadow was paying attention. Several high ranking members of the clergy had attended that affair, it was the talk of the temple.<br>
<br>
“Really, did they hire him to clean up the mess?”<br>
<br>
“He caused the mess.”<br>
<br>
It was as if Cazic himself came down and caressed Bliss’ spine so intense was the fear. Her position, everything she had worked for had been put at risk by her ‘brother’ and her crazy mother. What would happen if word got out that it was her family that was responsible for this war. For a moment she considered killing her mother.<br>
<br>
“Are you crazy! People will find out, we will be punished. How can you be so stupid!”<br>
<br>
Naelaelayle slapped her daughter hard. She had always been the passionate one, the most animated and excitable. Good qualities for a priest of the hate god. She possessed a certain animal cunning as well, but she lacked vision.<br>
<br>
“You will listen to me. You will come when I call. You will obey Maelgroth as if your life depends on it, because it does. If you fail your family in this, I will kill you myself.”<br>
<br>
Never in her entire life had her mother spoken to her in this way. She slapped her in return, the mailed gauntlet striking much harder. The blow knocked her mother to the ground.<br>
<br>
“You will listen to me hag. You will not come here again, you will not play games with other houses because you have no right to. I am going to deal with my ‘brother’.” She cast a quick spell, rooting Naelaelayle to the spot and stormed out of her quarters.<br>
<br>
Bliss marched across the drawbridge that separated the temple from the main road. She thought about kicking the fisherwoman she saw into the moat, but decided it would be too much trouble. She might get her boots dirty.<br>
<br>
It did not take her long to reach her old home. The shack was as she remembered it, the pitiful skeleton crouched in the doorway looked like he had been cleaned recently, white bone glowed dully in the subdued light, really a slap in the face to everyone, it was as if her family attempted to put on airs in a slum by having the most interesting pieces of garbage in the front yard.<br>
<br>
She ripped the rotten curtain off the doorframe and confronted her brother.<br>
<br>
“I hope mother is ok.” Maelgroth greeted his sister.<br>
<br>
“That better not be what I think it is!” Bliss hissed, pointing at the rack on the ramshackle table.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth turned the rack so his sister could see the face. “I still have a way to go before I can match my parent’s in skill.”<br>
<br>
Bliss kicked the table hard, it had never been the most sturdy of furniture but it weighed enough to knock her little brother to the ground. It shattered before it reached him.<br>
<br>
“This is not the time or the place for such behavior.” Maelgroth said calmly, standing up and brushing bits of broken table off his robe.<br>
<br>
Bliss began to cast the same spell she had used on her mother. She was nearly done when she was knocked to the ground from behind. The door warden was attacking her, with more strength and skill than she had thought possible. As a child she had taken delight in kicking the pitiful construct as she left for temple each day. She had nearly destroyed it practicing her earliest spells, it was a joke.<br>
<br>
“Return to your post!” The angry priestess barked.<br>
<br>
The skeleton continued to bludgeon her. Its blows dented her shield, a quick bash of its arm disrupted another spell. Somehow her brother had gotten control of the warden, it should obey her orders.<br>
<br>
“Maelgroth! Call off the warden!”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so. I think you need to learn a lesson in humility sister.” He was enjoying this moment utterly. Bliss had always been mean to him, but in subtle cutting ways, at least with his brother Malingrad you knew when the fight was over. With Bliss the knife was always there.<br>
<br>
“So be it!” The priestess swung her mace wildly at her brother. To be frank she was amazed she connected, combat and spell practice had always taken second place to polishing boots and writing reports for her superiors. The blow caught him in the shoulder and staggered him a bit as his personal wards were dispelled.<br>
<br>
“You hurt me sister. Let me show you what that feels like.” Bliss watched in awe, his hands were a blur so quick was the spell. Her chest blossomed in sudden pain, it was as if  one of the temple wardens had broken  her shoulder. She tried to move her arm, it was broken. The skeleton behind her landed a series of blows, knocking her to her knees. She needed to heal herself before she got hurt too much more.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth waited paitently as his sister began to croak out a desperate prayer for healing. As she neared its conclusion he kicked her in the face. He cast another spell.<br>
<br>
Bliss felt her heart start to beat wildly and irregularly in her chest, her blood burned as if it was on fire, she could not concentrate. She was dying.<br>
<br>
“Will you obey?” Maelgroth asked calmly.<br>
<br>
“Your killing me.” Bliss gasped, she was on her hands and knees now trying to breathe. At some point the skeleton had stopped beating on her, it stood at attention its hands purple with her blood. <br>
<br>
“I don’t believe you have much time.” Maelgroth smiled. It was a cold smile.<br>
<br>
“I am your sister!” <br>
<br>
“No, you are my servant, you will serve the will of the Waes’Harventhars or your face will join my collection.”<br>
<br>
She looked into his eyes. It was as if a mask had been removed. The little brother she had tormented was gone, replaced by the stern face of a stranger. There was no fear or mercy to be found there. She had always believed the tales her mother told were just that stories to pass the time, tales to make the small family feel that they belonged to something more than the shack in the foreign quarter. Now she knew better.<br>
<br>
“I will serve. I understand and I will obey. Master.” Blisshadow gasped, sagging forward to kiss her brother’s foot. Her loyalty to Innoruk had always been one based on convenience. Now she had a new loyalty, one based on necessity. She believed the tales now, all of them, and she was eager to prove her usefulness, after all to fail was to die, either at the hands of her brother or their enemies.<br>
<br>
At a gesture from Maelgroth, the pain stopped.<br>
<br>
“You will apologize to mother, you will show up for dinner and you will do as I say.”<br>
<br>
Bliss began a healing chant.<br>
<br>
“You will not ask Innoruk to heal you of the wounds you suffered today.”<br>
<br>
She stopped the chant, “I understand.” She stood up to go. “Will there be anything else master?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, get a new table, nothing fancy, do it before Mom gets home.”<br>
<br>
She left her old home with a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
Nystyre was not smiling. A servant had brought in the note some time ago. It had taken little effort to figure out the rest of the riddle. The thought of the Waes’Harventhar’s returning was more than a little scary. All the houses had breathed a collective sigh of relief when that house fell. They had shown pity to none in the pursuit of their craft, it was something that Nystyre respected, despite the fact that nearly all the noble houses, including his, had felt their knives at one time or other.<br>
<br>
“I wonder what she knows,” the scion of house D’Vir mused aloud. He was more than a bit annoyed at the brevity of the note, no doubt Kyri had much more information, he would simply have to pay for it.<br>
<br>
He wondered if the talented assassin was aware how valuable this information was. Blackmail had a certain appeal but without knowledge of the strength of the Waes’Harventhars it might be too dangerous. This would be information of interest to the other great houses, but now was not the time to share.<br>
<br>
He looked at the invitation on his desk. He had been wondering how to get the invitation to the Jindurn’Plynnar, now he knew who to send the invitation to, he just didn’t know how. Sending an invitation directly to the Waes’Harventhar’s would be tantamount to revealing his knowledge of their existence. Perhaps there was a way to get the letter delivered without tipping his hand… <br>
