<br>
If you were a kid nowadays you'd understand. When your flame goes out, you become an adult. Simple as.<br>
<br>
And beating your kid is a seriously bad idea. 30% of the time, the kid will grow up to respect you through some weird fear built love, but the other 70% of the time the kid will hate your guts and want you to die. When that happens, your kid grows up into a complete arsehole, who beats his kids, and so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
Now I was not beaten. I knew when *not* to do something severely wrong. Flaming a bunch of uptight *adults* on a message board doesn't fit into the wrong category to me, so don't start that if you're intending to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
While I have grown up without much fear for my parents, I respect them for treating me well, and I understand that I've had a lucky childhood with my parents, save for one or two minor circumstances which sparked a change of heart.<br>
<br>
Beating your kid is kinda primitive. I believe in the whole family love thing, and the family bonding. If you just smack the shit out of your kid until he /she is old enough to leave home then your home is as logical as a bird's nest.<br>
<br>

<br>
Most people equate the word 'beat' with 'abuse'.<br>
<br>
I think that until you've been a severely abused child that you really can't know how it feels to see someone say that someone's parents should beat them.<br>
<br>
I can tell you how it feels.<br>
<br>
It feels horrible and shocking that anyone might even hint around about condoning that kind of behavior.<br>
<br>
How would you like to live in fear of going home each day from school, worried that you're going to get beat within an inch of your life for whatever it is you did this time? That no matter what you do, you cannot appease the person who is beating you? That they do not listen to you. That they do not hear you when you say: please don't hit me like that.<br>
<br>
Lets not forget the words that often accompany shit like this. The comments about how worthless you are. How you're never up to any good. That this hurts them more than it hurts you. That they wished you had never been born?<br>
<br>
To you, those of you, any of you, who condone beating, I tell you ever so politely -- bugger off.<br>
<br>
I see nothing wrong with discipline, and maybe even a spanking done with the hand and a swat on the rump a few times, but better not to do it at all if you can help it. Too many people cannot control their anger and let it get out of hand, and the next thing you know, your step father is kicking you down the hallway to your room because you didn't clean it.<br>

Kids do understand, ive spent a great deal of time working with kids as a daycare worker, a summer camp counsellor, a family photographer... If you are intelligent enough to know how to communicate with a child over the age of 6 in a way they understand you shouldnt have to raise your hand against them. <br>
<br>
Oh, and discipline is all well and good, discipline using physical force isnt.<br>
<br>
And i do have a sense of humour, which can be very morbid at times, but there are certain things i will never find amusing.

<br>
Do you think its wrong to give a kid a tap on the bottom if they wont respond to being told no, or are acting up severely?  I think something like that is very situational, and different children need to be raised in different ways.<br>
<br>
Certainly, I think any reasonable person can agree that its wrong to smack your kids around... but generations upon generations were brought up spanked, and it hardly brought about the end of the world.<br>
<br>
I myself am not a parent, but if/when I do have children, I would absolutely use a spanking as a last deterrent.  I think though, that children need to be taught a very clear lesson about responsibility for their actions... and need to learn that if you don't do the adult and mature thing (listen when told to stop, continue to do something after a &quot;softer&quot; punishment like time out or loss of privileges,) then you suffer immediate and shocking circumstances.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I'm wording this right, as its a hard stance to take, but I don't feel that spanking is synonymous with beating, nor would I say spanking your child immediately marks you as a poor parent.<br>

But if anyone hits me (be it my mother, step-father some kid who happens to be 5 years younger than me) I will hit them back. Of course I exclude children from this, and old people.<br>
<br>
You say you were smacked &quot;a few times&quot; and hit with a belt once.. Before you go on about how it's your right to hit your child, maybe you should look at it how people who WERE abused by their parents, it may not have done anything to you, but from the sound of it.. yours were only mild punishment, other parents who thikn the same way you do no doubt (the whole &quot;I brought you into this world, I can take you out&quot; train of thought) don't stop there.. they'll throw kids into furniture, slam them into walls while smacking them and/or punching them, kick them around while they're lying on the ground crying.<br>
So if you have a kid.. or if you plan on having kids, how about you do this...<br>
Take the things they enjoy away from them, Television, computer, EQ, etc.. instead of  beating them, and making them bitter towards you, and the rest of the adult world.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=buttsmellgood>Buttsmellgood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/9/03 8:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3824.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Idiots in chat rooms, This is just plain bull.. sh... </span><hr size=1> &quot;(the whole &quot;I brought you into this world, I can take you out&quot; train of thought)&quot; is bullshit.

<br>
I do believe you missed the line where I said there is a difference between discipline (ie, the occasional spanking) and abuse (which many of you are eluding to).  <br>
<br>
What I object to is the &quot;Oh, I can't EVER smack my child on the bottom, that's abuse.&quot;  No, it's not.  And I guarentee if more children these days had occasionally had their britches warmed by mom or dad, they wouldn't be nearly the handful they are.  <br>
<br>
Case in point:  I used to have a neighbor.  His mom was very much the PC, I'll just take away his toys, his nintendo, his playtime, and he'll learn.  Yeah, he learned.  To punch her in the eye, giving her a nice raccoon look for about a week.  He got his lovely toys back too.  Now, if she'd taken him over her knee before he was big enough to beat on her, he might have respected her just a bit more.  <br>
I know he certainly respected my mother, after she caught him in our barn trying to start a nice lil fire.  She had him up against a fence faster than he could scream for grandpa, and all the time he was telling her he'd tell his grandpa and she'd be sorry, she just nodded.  When he was done she said &quot;Well, your grandpa isn't here right now, and I am.  And you may go and tell him, and go and tell the cops, but just remember son, I'll get a piece of you first.&quot;  She let him go, without a scratch, but he never again set foot on our property without being invited.  In fact, he was sweet as punch to me for the rest of the time I lived there as well.  Was quite the change from the boy who tried to choke me to death in the middle of a wheat field.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
Some kids need that physical discipline.  Or they keep pushing the line, and become complete and total horrors.  I'm not saying all kids do, or that abuse of any sort is to be tolerated.  But the occasional spanking is NOT going to harm a child psychologically, or physically.  I will stand by my assertion that it will do them more good in the end.  <br>
<br>
Again, so no one misses my point.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>There is a difference between DISCIPLINE and ABUSE.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  One can be a good thing, the other is never good.  I know, I've been subject to both.  There is a difference, and it's in the parent.  Some parents wish only to show a strong consequence to their child, and often do not need to do so again.  Others...well, they should never have been allowed to breed in the first place.  However, the political correctness revolving around parenting today seriously hinders the one, while not even putting a stop to the other.  It makes me sad to see it.<br>

If you don't have the skills to learn how to discipline a child without abuse (spanking, using a belt, etc.) you shouldn't have children.  <br>
<br>
There is a lot of talk in this thread about &quot;spanking&quot; and &quot;teaching a child respect&quot; .  Well, respect is the last thing you are going to get if you resort to violence to get your point across.   <br>
<br>
I was never spanked as a child and I totally respected my parents.  Violence begets violence.  Disrespect begets disrespect.  If you disrespect your children by spanking them, don't be surprised when your children disrespect you.<br>

I doubt spanking him a few times would have made him respect her. Maybe being firm in her punishments without resorting to violence would have.. but I agree with the person above me.. Hitting me is not going to win my respect.. Even if it's my parents. Parent's aren't always right, though they think they are.. and if you fight constantly with your kid maybe it's not just HIS fault.. maybe you have something to do with it too? Hell, my psychologist will tell you that.. it takes two people too argue, just because you raise a child doesn't mean he needs to be eternally grateful.. especially if you did a shit job.<br>
<br>
Anyway.. when you hit your kids, just remember who will probably be taking care of you in your old age. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowdreyk>Shadow Dreyk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/9/03 6:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3824.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/lithiah/dagger.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Idiots in chat rooms, This is just plain bull.. sh... </span><hr size=1> Bottom line -&gt; Violence of any kind as a parent towards a child is unnacceptable. <br>
<br>
<br>
We are supposed to be civilised people, resorting to physical abuse as a form of discipline shows a lack of control and also a lack of intelligence. A good parent will find a different way of disciplining their child, there are plenty.<br>
<br>
If a child is raised with violence it will usually see violence as an answer, you yourself are living proof kerridwynn, did you not say that as a kid you got the belt and got spanked? Now you condone it as a form of punishment... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/filespace/images/Dreyk2_copy.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coslinroguebarbarian>CoslinRogueBarbarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 404<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/10/03 1:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3824.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Idiots in chat rooms, This is just plain bull.. sh... </span><hr size=1> Kerridwyn is wise.<br>
<br>
All the PC wacko's have seriously put fear in the minds of our parents when it comes to parents discipline activities. For example, I found my cat on my kitchen table trying to grab a piece of my ham that I left on my table for a whole 30 seconds as I turned my back a couple on months back. I was able to catch him, gave him a smack on his ass, and wouldn't you know it - he hasn't been on my kitchen table since. <br>
<br>
Association is the key. If a kid does something to deserve a spanking (in your opinion, because noone elses opinion matters), then by all means parents, spank away. I can just about guarantee that that kid is not going to do whatever caused him to get in trouble again. And , again, if you're doing your job right as a parent, he's going to know what respect is even if he/she can't spell the word correctly.<br>
<br>
Bottom Line -&gt; Spanking = Discipline. <br>
<br>
My Proof, ask millions of people across this nation and others if they thought that spanking was abuse and I bet about 99 percent of them are going to say no way.                       <p>Coslin Freelander<br>

I'd like to thank you for pointing out that I'm a horrible parent. I'll be taking my kids to the adoption office in the morning.  God knows what may have happened if someone who had never met me or my children hadn't let me know what an ineffective parent I am. I appreciate your input.<br>

It depends on the children and the situation.<br>
<br>
To those that say you should never spank your children or use physical punishment, I would say history and experience say you are most definately wrong.<br>
<br>
To those who claim that all forms of physical correction are abuse, it is unfortunate if you were abused but using extreme examples as empirical proof isnt very accutrate or productive.<br>
<br>
I have seen parents that raised there children with displine and ones that used the softer none physical approach. From what I have seen the ones raised with disipline tend to have better lives as adults.<br>
<br>
My wife and I raised our children with discipline and spankings when required. Our children did not grow up to hate us. Instead now that they are adults we have mutual respect and we are the closest of friends.<br>
<br>
When my sons decided they wanted to return to colledge they came back home. They could have afforded to live somewhere else or in dorms but they felt comfortable in our house and knew they were welcome.<br>
<br>
I can't say what is best for everyone but I can say what I have seen that works and what doesn't. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=406740" target="&quot;web&quot;">&lt;<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Baron Siffo Corpsestalker</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
