It was the Weekend of Love when she saw him again.  All kinds of people -- human, barbarian, iksar, half-elf and all kinds of elves -- were gathered to help save the Nektulos guards and the young they defended from persecution.  It was fitting that the majority of prizes for their rally were Validus Custodus arms from the service of Katta Castellum.<br>
<br>
He appeared on the edge of the tunnel overlooking the east common plains.  Though he still held his back stiffly, the joy of seeing him again overwhelmed the pain she felt him still suffering.  But before they could speak much, there was a griffin to be defeated so the games may safely begin.<br>
<br>
A long while later, after the games were over and the rally had subsided into festivities, she sent her mind outward to find him again.  She asked if maybe he’d have a minute for her to give him a shield to go with the axe he’d won.  She wasn’t sure if he’d like it, but she wanted him to have it.  He finally agreed to meet in Lavastorm, and she was there soon after.  <br>
<br>
He studied the shield when she presented it, amazed at its durable construction despite the lightweight design.  She said it was a Combine shield, and when asked she said that she supported what the Combine Empire once tried to be, rather than the silly sham folks were trying to remake it into.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shiden says, 'I must say I was surprised to see such a number of races gathered in friendship.  Perhaps you can achieve what was failed by the Empire.'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She smiled with hope at his words while he slipped the shield onto his arm.  He then reached behind to unclasp he axe from his back and wield it.  Kimaya clapped, cooing over how fierce he looked!  Then she sighed, and when asked again, said it was because she SO wanted to kiss him but she knew he wouldn’t let her.  <br>
<br>
He suddenly sped off without a word, leaving tracks for her to follow into a hidden corner of the mountains.  <br>

<br>
Their swords drawn, their tongues flicking forth every impure language on Norrath, their armor shiny and polished, all left no doubt in his mind that this small group of lightbringers were going to assault Neriak.  He swore that he saw a few rogue Teir'dal as well, but he wasn't surprised; many a youth of Neriak falls under the sway of goodness.<br>
<br>
Shiden sent word back to the lodge and prepared to meet them.  They greatly outnumbered him and were easily more powerful, but that does not matter in the life of a knight; he went out alone to meet them, his sword drawn and his helmet in his hand.<br>
<br>
It was a shock to find they were there to help defend Nektulos and stop those who would slaughter the fine guardsmen who patrol those bleak woods.  Throughout the rally, Shiden's mood lifted.  He let down his guard, put away his weapon.  He watched in humor as they all tried to run to the border of Nektulos from the tunnel which connects the commonlands to the desert of Ro.  That particular event he could have won, since he had ran it so often, but enjoyed watching the others stumble drunkenly too much to take first.  His prize, although second, had been a most impressive looking axe, and it had come at such an opportune time, saving him the trouble of looking for a worthy weapon to wield along with a shield.<br>
<br>
His guard went back up though when the elf who organized the event wished to meet him in Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what is the catch, Wood Elf?  Are you attempting to bribe me to forget the wrongs your kind has suffered upon my people?&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid stammered over her words, babbling some nonsense about pixies.  Shiden weighed her words carefully - if it were a trap he would not leave Lavastorm.  It was a sacrifice Shiden decided he would take if he could strike down one of his city's enemies.<br>
<br>
In the bright red of Lavastorm, Shiden called out for the druid to meet him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well here you go, cutie!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shiden spun, not familiar with the tricks of Wood Elves and Druids.  How she had crept up on him he did not know, but he imagined it was with the use of odd magic.  Nevertheless, she stood before him, a huge shield held out in her hands.  Shiden eyed her warily, and after she assured him that the shield was not cursed, he took it.<br>
<br>
The design was unfamiliar, but this shield was better than anything he could buy in Neriak.  Despite its huge size and strong build, it was half as light as the sword he was used to swinging.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooh, it's a Combine shield!&quot; explained the wood elf.  Shiden looked at her bright smile and happy eyes and sighed inwardly.  So that is what she wants me here for, he mused.  To try and pull me from my duty at Neriak like so many other young Teir'dal.<br>
<br>
While he asked her about the shield and tried to find out if she did indeed mean to make him 'good,' he strapped on the shield and grabbed the axe from his back.  The balance was a nice one, which pleased him.  He would have to venture to the Isle of the Sisters to bathe the two properly.<br>
<br>
Shiden looked up to find the druid pouting melodramatically.  Cocking an eye, he asked her what was the matter.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh goodness, I don't even know HOW to lie!&quot; she said with a laugh.  The sound made Shiden's ears hurt. &quot;Um, well...well, cause I kinda wanna kiss you, but I don't think you'll let me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shiden blinked.  How can she be so forward!  To think I would bed a pale and forget the pride of my people!<br>
<br>
He looked at her for a second more and decided that there wasn't a chance of him killing her.  The only other option was to run.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for Shiden, the bleak stone of Lavastorm makes it easy to lose your way.  When he started running, it was in the wrong direction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/Thumbnails/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/29/02 3:20:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Joy</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Part II</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
She caught up with him easily, giggling at him as he leaned up against a rock and said something about her scent.  She told him it was roses and leaned in, sweeping her hair away so her bare neck was close to his face.  As she did so, he backed away nervously and tried to recompose himself.<br>
<br>
She laughed excitedly as he changed the subject to training and food, until he finally he turned away, apparently annoyed.  She tried tickling the back of his neck, and he only sputtered in frustration.  She blushed, certain she said something wrong.  He insisted she hadn’t, simply that she confused him.  She blushed even harder, since she did THAT a lot too.  He just looked at her a moment, then sighed again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shiden says, 'I...I don't know how to do what I must.'<br>
Kimaya says, 'And what must you do?', looking at him curiously.<br>
Shiden looks Kimaya in the eyes.<br>
Shiden says, 'Hate you.'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She laughed, and when he said it was Innoruuk who said he had to, she just laughed even harder and called the god a Hatey Liar who would smear him across the rocks and say he hated the stain he made.  <br>
<br>
She tried to explain to him how people made themselves, using their own power from within, regardless of what any god ever says.  She said he had dreams of wives and children in the Karanas, and it wouldn’t be easy, but finding them would be as simple as walking away.  He wouldn’t be the first, or even the second to do so.  <br>
<br>
He shook his head and swore she just didn’t understand, she couldn’t...  Though he felt he belonged howhere, Nektulos and Lavastorm were his home.  He told her he had tried to walk a different path, and then he decided to show her the price he paid for it.<br>
<br>
He tore off his armor and bore his midsection to her, exposing a multitude of scars that circled around his abdomen and back.  She bit her lip, inadvertently reaching out her hand as it started to almost glow... then caught herself before she touched him.  She remembered what had happened with Kallee, and didn’t want to get yelled at again.<br>
<br>
Holding her hand back, she shyly looked down.  She then glanced back up at him to admit that she could heal his scars, if he would let her touch them.  He forbade her from doing so, calling them a hideous badge of honor.  They were signs that he had gone through pain that the whelps of Neriak could not imagine and he lived, crawling himself up from the dirt.<br>
<br>
She nodded, puzzled again at people’s ideas about something nebulous like “honor”. But as he talked, she saw the strength he had gained from overcoming those horrors, and imagined what he may have been like someday if he were able to overcome all the torments that faced him.  If he was strong enough to pursue his dreams...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shiden says, 'You are only the second person to see my scars.'<br>

<br>
&quot;Caught ya!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shiden fell against a large monolithic stone, completely winded.  Running had been hard on him since he had joined the Lodge of the Dead again, and running with armor on was even harder.  How she had managed to follow him, to constantly find him despite his best attempts at hiding, was beyond him.  He was sure this would end badly.  Let the witch kill me, he thought to himself.  Rather dead than a lightlover.<br>
<br>
Suddenly an idea formed in his head.  He turned to face her, leaning still against the rock.  His eyes squinted as he spoke.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can smell you, you know.  I smell the same glistening scent that clings to the purity belts I take from the Sisters of Erollisi Marr.&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid giggled.  &quot;Oh boy, they SAY they don't do that, but...&quot; She leaned in to whisper conspiratorially, &quot;...some of them know how ta pick locks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shiden sighed and tried again.  &quot;I...I'm sorry I'm not a better cook.  I'd have brought you Wood Elf steaks.&quot;  He peered at her, gauging her reaction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooh, but I can cook!&quot; she replied helpfully.<br>
<br>
Shiden groaned.  Her happiness disgusted him.  Noone can be this happy and amiable.  Her gift for mirth apalled and scared him.  Very well.  If she can't be angered to leave, perhaps I can scare her away.<br>
<br>
Shiden explained that he must hate her because Innoruuk demands it.<br>
<br>
Still not understanding, he ripped his breastplate loose and exposed her bare chest to him.  Surely the scars would disgust her.  The ugly, long, jagged lines of bruised purple snaked their way around his belly and back.  They'd served to frighten away even experienced whores.  Go away, here be dragons.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate your kind, Elf.  I hate them for making us what we are.&quot;<br>
<br>
They argued then, over Innoruuk and Tunare, over the humans and high elves and dark elves, over Freeport and Neriak.  They argued over honor.  Furious, Shiden yelled at her, tried to make her understand, but still she talked back calmly, as if happy to try and bring turmoil into his life.<br>
<br>
Exhausted and out of breath, Shiden sank against the rock and slid to the ground beneath him.  If anger and fire and brimstone would not work, perhaps the truth could be found in calm.<br>
<br>
So yet again he changed his tactics.  He told her how he despised Neriak's politics and how he knew that his dream of having a family would never be realized within that city and while his kind was still persecuted by the lightbringers.  He spoke of Lavastorm, and how fond he was of it.<br>
<br>
When she mentioned that Lavastorm brims with life, fostering even weeds that will grow nowhere else, he argued that to her people all Teir'dal were just weeds - easy to overlook when you don't see them, but once you want a pretty garden the only route is to kill it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not my kind. No one is a weed to MY kind,&quot; she replied with a level of seriousness she had not shown before.<br>
<br>
Shiden looked at her and did his best to conceal his fury.  &quot;Then your kind must be very rare.&quot;<br>
<br>
He noticed how hard she was gripping her hammer and he fancied she would suddenly hit him with it, kill him like the weed that he was.  She'd go back to her friends and tell them to admire her new pretty garden now that one more weed is gone from it.  He would almost welcome the release from his responsibility as a knight.<br>
<br>
His responsibility.<br>
<br>
No!  Damn her, she will succumb to Hate! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/Thumbnails/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/29/02 4:58:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The... ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Part III</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Rather than answer, he looked down at the large hammer she was absently toying with.  He mused that perhaps he was already strong enough that she considered him a threat and was waiting to smash his face in. She giggled, insisting she was more likely waiting to SMOOCH his face in, then she playfully kissed his nose.<br>
<br>
He caught her before she could sit back and kissed her softly, catching a taste of Nepeta Cataria mint.  Surprised, she inhaled with a soft Mmmm that was muffled by his lips pressed against hers.  He then pulled back and looked at her, as if unsure what to say.  She looked down, biting her lip shyly with a hint of blush on her cheeks.  Perhaps it was her reactions he found irresistable, for it was his faint smile at her blushing that drew her in.<br>
<br>
He reached out, hesitant, then slowly let his fingers glide through her soft, silvery hair.  Though before he had said that only swinging a sword brought him pleasure, he said her hair was soft and pleasurable to the touch.  She beamed a smile, then started launching into a flurry of words about of how pleased she was since she had actually brushed her hair earlier and was SO afraid a pixie would put knots in it…<br>
<br>
He then caught the back of her head and kissed her suddenly before she could talk any more. She giggled softly then kissed him back, playfully nipping at his lip.  Closing his eyes, he ran his lips down her jaw and neck, nibbling just below her ear.  She shivered, giggling softly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Kimaya says, 'Tickles...'<br>
Shiden repeats, &quot;Tickles,&quot; softly into her ear, using the sultry voice he learned at The Maiden's Fancy.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
From there, she fell into an almost hypnotic haze.  She giggled, they joked, he laughed.  Throughout it all she could feel she had brought him joy, which made her even happier to be near him.  He leaned her back against a rock, tracing Elder Teir'dal characters with his fingertips on the topmost inner part of her leg.  <br>
<br>
Giggling even harder at the tickling, she Kimaya moved her head, trying to see what he's drawing.  He admitted it was Elder Teir’Dal, though he only knew a little bit of it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Shiden says, 'Here.  Hold still, I'll trace my name on you,'  He starts with Shiden on her right thigh and goes through each character carefully until he ends Kaidan on her other leg.<br>
Kimaya beams with a bright smile, saying, 'And now you'll be close to me there forever!'<br>
Smiling back at her, Shiden says, 'I could be even closer...'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Though the details of the next few hours were lost to her in a haze of joy and pleasure, the laughter and the closeness they shared were unforgettable.  He had become an inescapable part of her, in a hidden part of her soul.<br>
<br>
After a while it began to rain, and it was time for them to each move on.  He re-equipped her gifts, then put his helmet back on to snarl at her, making her laugh and clap at the funny echo.  He joked that sometimes he forgot to remove his helmet before shouting, and his ears would ring for hours.  And though she couldn’t see it through the helm, she could feel that somewhere inside, he was smiling.<br>
<br>
When they parted, there was no awkwardness as to whether they would see each other again.  She knew they would, and she would see him happy.  She wouldn't wait again for a passing glimpse either, hiding shyly and camouflaged behind a rock.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it was better not to be shy.<br>

She <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> succumb to Hate.<br>
<br>
Shiden was lost.  This was a puzzle too great for him.  The Nobles of Neriak would know just what to do, but during his lifetime he had been taught the ways of war, not of words and political maneuvering.  He now wished he could have guidance from some of the stronger knights he had met, knights like Kallee or Shintou or Velve.  Those knights were gone, lost to him then as he sat in Lavastorm, trapped and afraid for his soul.<br>
<br>
The hammer he had thought would leap towards his head at any moment was apparently just out to comfort her.  She smiled and joked with him about it.  Thankfully she hadn't seen the thin sweat break out on his forehead.<br>
<br>
While she put it away his mind flickered over what she had just said.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> More a chance to SMOOCH your head in!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She'd said it when he asked if she was waiting for a chance to smash his head in.  Smooch his head in.<br>
<br>
She leaned in and kissed his nose, which he thought must have been some sort of weird Fier'dal custom.  An idea sparked.<br>
<br>
Quickly he grabbed her, forced her lips to his.  If she will not hate me for my race, she will hate me for this.  Innoruuk, guide me.  I'm afraid.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mm,&quot; she breathed softly.  Perhaps the masters of the Lodge knew he could gain some use from those skills he learned as a lad at The Maiden's Fancy.  He'd never understood why he could go there and nowhere else, even in the Third Gate.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mm as in Mm-inty?&quot; Shiden asked, trying not to vomit.  The wood elf had been chewing something horrible.  It burned his mouth and lips.<br>
<br>
Soon enough she was under his control.  She hung on each of his words, listening in rapture, laughing at his jokes.  He grabbed and poked and caressed what he pleased without restraint.  He toyed with her the same way he toyed with the whores of the Fancy.  He flirted, made her melt.  Made her feel like he was hers, when in reality it was the other way around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, hold still,&quot; he said to her as he spread her legs wide.  He slid his hands up her leather armor slowly, letting the sensations tantalize her while he prayed to his God.<br>
<br>
Put power in these words.  Let her know Hate.<br>
<br>
Slowly he traced his name over her loins in Elder Teir'dal, the most powerful tongue he knew.  He'd been taught by the necromancers that language and words are the most powerful tools, but he'd been taught by the whores that sex is the great equalizer.  He prayed to Innoruuk for strength as he wrote his name on her.<br>
<br>
As he finished the word &quot;Kaidan&quot; he felt a cool breeze slip across the back of his neck.  Suddenly he was very cold and very alone.  He looked around at the darkness and screamed, but his mouth made no sound.  Instead he could see himself flirting with her, playing still.  He forced his way back into control long enough to try and sing a battle chant that his friend Ratraz had taught him, but his Hate was lost in this battle.  It fell from his body faster than his clothes.<br>
<br>
He fought it.  He fought with all that he could, but he was not enough by himself.  He prayed for Shintou to come, to strike him down for his sins, but there was no balm for him.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk!  Father!<br>
<br>
He found himself struggling to unleash a Harm Touch, but even that was failed to him.<br>
<br>
Some time later the bite of sulfuric rain on his back snapped him out of the daze he was in.  The silly wood elf was dancing in the rain.  Let her die, he thought bitterly as he drug his clothes back on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, are you Crazy!  It's hot!  There's sulfur in that rain!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shiden nearly fainted.  That was his voice!  He had called out to help her despite his wish for her dead!<br>
<br>
She giggled and came over to him as he picked up the shield and axe.  The smile on her face was bright and cheery.  The happiness melted off of Shiden's skin and he gripped the axe with all his might.<br>
<br>
With a snarl he lifted the axe, ready to bury it in her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;It echoes in that helmet!&quot; she cried happily and laughed.  Tears flooded to Shiden's eyes as he struggled to kill her, but try as he might he could not.  He was glad that the helmet hid his tears as he slung the axe over his back and forced out a weak laugh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, his voice weary.  He struggled to stand against the weakness in his knees.  &quot;I know.  Sometimes if I forget and shout I can't hear for hours afterwards.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, she laughed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueqkarizma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQKarizma</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Sexy Gnomish</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/30/02 8:11:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Binding</span><hr size=1> (sorry to interrupt, but I'm really enjoying this story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  good job guys)<br>
