<br>
From the early beginings of server 2 guild emerged in the forefront...Fire n Fury and Resolution.  A competitive atmosphere emerged.  A subconscious race started.<br>
<br>
The Ruleset allowed dropable keys.  Both guilds worked very hard to grow, build and position themselves to enter ST.  FnF won the race to get inside first and farmed the first primals.  Were they nice about it after....hardly.  Did they rub everyones noses in it....you be the judge.  Did they want to play nice after Resolution was able to get into ST....not at first but eventually an agreement formed for a short time until keys were made undroppable.<br>
<br>
Then over a period of time the &quot;Race&quot; really kicked into high gear.  First Broods were hunted very seriously.  Both guilds accumulated Keys.  There was ugliness at times but for the most part one guild or the other bowed out when beaten to a target.  <br>
<br>
At the end of this long, determined &quot;Race&quot; was the 4rth Warder and the ability to Wake the Sleeper.  Though FnF accompished many things, accomplished many server firsts (as did Resolution), they did not win the &quot;Race&quot; to the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
Almost a year later, one full of hardships, political turmoil at times, long CR's, taunting on the boards(see any number of FnF/Reso posts), as well as many long grueling weekends of 14-16 hour 3-day raids, Resolution stands 1 step from crossing the finishline in ST, ready to break the tape, experience The Wakening, and move on to the Planes of Power.<br>
<br>
You ask them to stop though.  To not break the tape and walk away?  To give up the moment that they have worked hard to reach and just walk away?  To walk away and in all liklihood give up waking the sleeper???  Because you know if Resolution doesnt do it....someone is going to.  AS or FnF will to set themselves apart from the other 6-8 guilds on their heels.  <br>
<br>
Everyone says its just about blocking.  I say its more about experiencing a part of the game that 50 people have stayed focussed on for 10 months.  Where were you all at when we were on the 100+ 1-3 hour CRs?  How about any number of grueling activities it takes to build a guild to this point.  Yet you want to tell someone that they cant do something that the game is bascially designed for them to do.  <br>
<br>
ST is a reward for hardwork and determination.  The Sleeper is a reward for a guild to do because they reached the point where thru hard work and determination they are able to kill all 4 warders.<br>
<br>
You would tell Resolution that they cant do it because you want yours???  Ask yourself who is being selfish now. <br>
<br>
If this was something important to people they would have positioned themselves loooong ago to be part of it.  I could go into how but I think that is obvious.<br>
<br>
If its woken...I hope everyone can get to Velious to experience it.  I hope our guild does it.  These people have earned it.  I know.  Ive seen the hard work and BS they have suffered to get here.<br>
<br>
Once again these are my views and not those of the guilds.  I am not an Officer.<br>

FYI.<br>
<br>
The 4th warder is the finish line.  Warders 1-3 are easy to kill compared to the 4th warder.  Killing the 4th warder garners your reward.<br>
<br>
**Killing the 4th warder is the reward for the race.**<br>
<br>
**Waking the Sleeper gives you no reward other than denying other people the chance to kill the 4th.**<br>
<br>
It's like crossing the finish line and then wanting to deny anyone else the chance to cross it after you.<br>
<br>
Saying you are waking it because FnF or AS will when they have the chance is just using them as a scapegoat.  If you wake it, you wake it because of YOUR guild.  Don't try and say you are serving the community by denying those *evil* people in FnF or AS a chance at the 4th warder.<br>
<br>
Awaking the Sleeper is no accomplishment.  All it is the failure of this server to do what others could not.  My god, a Zek server still has the Sleeper on it.<br>
<br>
&quot;You would tell Resolution that they cant do it because you want yours??? Ask yourself who is being selfish now. &quot;<br>
<br>
I have mine, thanks.<br>
<br>
I may not be Mr. RP, but this is the only server I want to play on.  People here are more intelligent and nice than any other server I've ever been on.  That is why I'm here.  And now I'm going to watch any uniqueness FV had fade away.  That is why I'm doing this, because waking the sleeper is a failure for a server, and I don't want to see FV fail.<br>

If they got this far they're certainly entitled to wake it.  Someone is going to do it sooner or later, as I see it, there are 2 options... wake him now, of farm unique items and then wake him.  But hell, they got that far, it's part of the game, and they're perfectly entitled to wake him if they so please.  Without everyone else on the server b*tching at them for it.  And that goes for anyone who reaches that level.<br>
<br>
Best solution is to make a mass petition over all servers that the unique items drop again, as I see it that would be the only real reason not to wake him.<br>

Ill comment on what was written and then go to the soapbox and finnish off those comments as a rebuttle.<br>
<br>
There are a few reasons to wake the sleeper. And some of them where touched on here, and some where not.<br>
<br>
When the time comes we will make it a server event.  Some of us dont RP on a regular basis but you can be assured that all in Reso will RP if you initiate it.  The guild is very outgoing and generous to the community not only with guilds needing tanks to kill KD in Cobalt Scar and Ragefire in Sky Fire but also with tactics on killing luclin Boss mobs.  We dont hide behind false walls and tell you things that we discuss on our guild forum in the opposite.<br>
<br>
Resolution cant be called greedy as we have held open raids for epic drops for server members.  We have contributed to the server in many ways and we have not flaunted the high end.<br>
<br>
Fact is.  99% of everyone who plays EQ will NEVER see ST.  They will never get a key.  However if they played 5 years thier chances are increased.  This isnt about denying the server gear or even the mid level guilds.  This is about progression and sadly some minor paybacks as was mentioned earlier and ill touch on in a few paragraphs.<br>
<br>
As a fact I have discussed trades with 1 guild and waiting to talk to the leader of another for Primals for thier primary tanks providing the tanks agree the weapon stays with the guild.  You could ask why doesnt everyone deserve a primal or the experience.. Well they do and that is the fault of VI for creating a 99th level warder that is unkillable so they dont have to finnish a storyline.  FV will always get new members and each new member is entitled to this experience.  When does the sleeper awake?  <br>
<br>
Now to the posts.<br>
<br>
Which other server other than test has the warder sleeping on it?<br>
<br>
Jarkell.  The new tomb is every reason to awaken him.. We are at a end with the tomb. Should we hang up out accounts for a year and let everyone else who dreams of getting a key work to one just to find out they needed to take 3 months off and need 3 more months?   We have raced to the end with a guild that has all but collapsed in on itself (fire and fury).  They are now months out from killing 4th warder.  Someone is going to wake the sleeper. The new weapons process Avatar as well so they will be the same with exception of the AC and by time you are killing warders youll be at 1450 like me so it wont mean anything.<br>
<br>
Viren. Greed is based on wanting more not denying others unless its getting more through denying and we wouldnt be getting more of anything from ST. If you think RPing is KSing then you are on the wrong server.  RPing that would be killing the paladin then the mob or waiting till the mob wore the paladin down then you get both of thier gear. And giving up gear is rediculous as everyone who has these items was there and 'earned' them.  Warder loot can be 0 to many per warder.. We were shafted our first trip down but it was made up by the last raid there, and if waking the sleeper makes the zone harder to get stuff then everyoen should go to Ebay and buy thier stuff its alot easier there and even easier than joining a raid much less joining a raid that is a little harder.   Being punished by us is laughable.  If we wanted to wake the sleeper we had him dead to rights last time.  I only heard of BoW when i came here and knew of various people in that guild.  Basically FnF has no say in what we do.  If they want a robe for thier monk i suggest getting one.  Uh yeah and before Karayfym (sp) takes off with the stock.  Your last post.  If you honstly feel that FV is only unique cause of the sleeper then you should sell your account as well.  There are 100 more reasons why it is and if you can only think of one then thats plain sad.<br>
<br>
For the community. Take note of who is argueing the points here.  There are about 45 posts.  A few from people outside Resolution, AS and FnF.  The ones against are the two guilds other than resolution.  AS is against it cause they havent had the opportunity to do warders.. FnF is against it cause they are in a Heavy recruitment / restructureing process which would mean getting more gear for new recruits and how to justifty no primal for the newmembers.  <br>
<br>
Fact is AS never wanted to be part of the community based on thier posts prior.  They bought characters  which some of you opposed (mourn Benth who was in resolution until he had to pay for college so he sold his toon for tuition /cheer, and im glad someone bought it).  Thier site condoned swearing and if you were offended they were not for you.  All this was good as they were honest about it.  <br>
<br>
FnF plowed over many of your raids.  They posted self stroking grats on the kudos forums to appear the head guild in charge while all along they were suffering a competition for mobs by a guild who would not let them walk on them.  <br>
<br>
And ill post more on them in the soapbox.<br>
<br>
Reasons? Yes we have many many reasons.. Will FnF or AS wake sleeper when they are done and if they are able to? YES.. without a doubt they will so you are wasting your time petitioning this.  They will wake him no doubt and if they say otherwise just scroll back in time and read thier posts on the subject and others to get a feel for what thier goals are.<br>
<br>
BTW I heard there is a better tunic in VT.  Though im not sure never having been there yet.<br>

<br>
Sorry, all of this goes right out the window if you wake the sleeper.  Like I said, if you think AS FCFSing Ragefire was bad, waking sleeper is analogous to killing Ragefire everytime he spawned just so other guilds can't get epics.  If it's done out of greed it's uninformed, though I think that may be the case.  It gives a limited edge, like I've said, over other guilds.  What it does do is make the zone a HUGE TIMESINK and not much fun for anyone who does it.  League of Shadows, Ebon Storm, Dreadstorm, etc., etc. I'm sure would love to have the zone be decent when they get there, and if you want to punish AS, well, we'll be done with ST either way eventually, and then you can take credit for making the gaming experience of 200-300 other players that much worse.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

False, a lot more than 1% of Torv has seen ST, closer to 20-25%, and that number grows everyday.  If you plan on playing on FV for awhile, there is a VERY good chance you will see ST.  Again, wouldn't you like it to be decent?<br>

Ah, great, so you're trying to justify screwing over the server by making the chief opponents of waking the sleeper look bad....<br>

Like I said, waking the sleeper would be the paramount of disregard for the server, the script is BROKEN.  Hello, as in it doesn't work?<br>

<br>
AS would never wake the Sleeper, you can check through any posts I've made on this topic, and you won't find anything otherwise.  After I saw what it did to the Torv server, I realized that it was just a plain shitty and vindictive thing to do.  Ask Stabbington in-game how fun the broken script is....  Would FnF wake the Sleeper?  I don't know..but none of their members, to my knowledge, have woken the sleeper, like Reso, so I don't think they really understand the consequences.  It doesn't slow down competition, it just makes them, and all following guilds have a lot less fun in the zone that they are forced to use to progress.  And if you think you can do end-game encounters (AoW, Emperor, etc.) without a ton of primal, you're clueless.<br>
<br>
<br>

Also, warders are farmed primarily for primal. The new version of primal drops off the normal MOBs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> (a lot more than priceless does pre-awakening)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, so getting to warders doesn't really matter, if you have primal farming in mind. <br>

Why are you saying it will be rare now to see primal drop?  When only a month ago you were saying it would be common?  Most are talking about farming primals and you are saying its common as summoned water.  Only a few are even thinking remotley at a chance to get a shroud &lt;/points at Lactus&gt; this is a personal argument and not very valid since you are claiming to champion the server after months of pulling yourself and your guild away from it with RP this /rude.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sorry, all of this goes right out the window if you wake the sleeper.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Suppose the real positive thing here is we are not appealing to you.  And a try to break up the post into single sentences is pretty lame and shows you have no real argument unelss you are going to break it into single words.<br>
<br>
If your so positive with the upgrades then why are you even investing time now in ST?  You speak of luclin like there is no reason to do it so why are you concerned?<br>
<br>
Im not sure I understand your position now and maybe you can clarify it for me as well.  Over a month ago when AS was growing you were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> opposed</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to RPing you basically said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FU</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to the server and everyone you are claiming to represent.  You come from a guild that released the sleeper.  You claim the new ST has more primal available but now you say it doesnt. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This last part sounds like monk greed, with no shrouds and all.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->There were many who disliked the actions of AS and you think you will be able to use this as a catapult into popular redemption?  and not to mention keeping the sleeper sleeping. Doubtful.  There is alot more hard work ahead that agreeing with someone if you want to have respect on this server.<br>
<br>
Heres your answer to your question and when you reply take a look at your post in quotes above.<br>
<br>
How do I justify ruining a zone? I ask you how will it be ruined except for your shroud?  <br>
<br>
All this harder or not is hearsay.  Or at least it comes from you and as you can see by the quote up top you change you mind to fit your need at the time.  So with that said your quote of my sentence stating you all will wake the sleeper still stands.  <br>
<br>
Give me proof of your good nature.<br>

Catacombs, Dreadlands, and Overthere all have those little spots dont they FnF.   Lets not forget who was the 1st to hit 60 on our server, it was Ulec!!!  <br>

** An Ancient Arises **<br>
<br>
Deep within the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large, a dark, menacing figure parts with the slumber that has kept him silent for ages. The eyes of a magnificently ominous beast pierce through the darkness, his memories flowing freely once more. In the depths of this beast's mind sparks the knowledge that his prophetic savior has been released from the ancient magiks of time, let loose upon an unsuspecting world where the kin shall once again reign supreme.<br>
<br>
&quot;My master's shackles have been trounced, and so it is written that in this world that has been so deftly overrun by pitiful mortals, he shall bring power back to those of the scale.&quot; The deep rumbling voice of the beast lingers throughout the cavernous hideaway, the barely distinguishable figure of a mighty lizard moves through the stone and dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy surroundings and find his place once again upon Norrath proper.<br>
<br>
&quot;For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might that kept me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I been victim to the ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at bay. Now I awaken and bring life back to the disciples; now shall the lifeblood of the Four once again spread the word of prophecy!&quot; The footsteps of this great beast are slow but sure, moving through the depths of the gaping mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the walls, pebbles and stones that have remained dormant for years crumble and crack, falling to the ground as the immense beast walks past.<br>
<br>
A maze of dead ends and broken paths twists and turns in the expanse beyond the figure's resting place. The skeletons of those who had tried - and failed - to make their way to him in the years he spent in forced slumber remain, tumbled landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly he moves, his reptilian eyes darting back and forth looking for any meager meals that may still be available. As he proceeds, he steps atop a mighty echelon, overlooking the bodies that could not defy the magical properties of the cave; fools of mortal thought, incapable of fathoming the power that lay beyond them. &quot;Time has been good to you, my faithful warren... let us both pray that I no longer need you. The time for the revival is at hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

&quot;Will FnF or AS wake sleeper when they are done and if they are able to? YES.. without a doubt they will so you are wasting your time petitioning this. They will wake him no doubt and if they say otherwise just scroll back in time and read thier posts on the subject and others to get a feel for what thier goals are.&quot;<br>
<br>
You were also quoted as stating you would not, in any way, wake the Sleeper.  However that was clearly another time and another place given your stance now. <br>
<br>
The FnF &quot;dirty laundry&quot; quote that folks hammer on was also at another time and place, where waking the Sleeper was an idea that was batted around - don't confuse someone putting a quote on a message board as &quot;the truth&quot; and guild policy.  I can guarantee that if someone who didn't like you or Reso had access to your message board, they could find all kinds of implicating quotes to post.<br>
<br>
Ichi stated that waking the Sleeper is the equivalent to &quot;crossing the finish line&quot;, and that the rest of the server shouldn't try to prevent you guys from acheiving this goal that &quot;Reso has worked very long and hard for.&quot;  I wasn't aware that waking the Sleeper was a long-time Reso goal, and if it was, refer to the statement above about you agreeing that you wouldn't wake the Sleeper when the rotation was setup.<br>
<br>
So either that was duplicitous of you OR your goals have changed...and if it's the latter, then maybe accept that AS and FnF have different goals, and furthermore that FnF's goals are subject to change as well.<br>
<br>
This whole issue is like the psych experiment revolving around a big red button with a &quot;DO NOT TOUCH&quot; sign near it...<br>

Personally, it has never been my goal to wake the sleeper. That said, it would be kind of cool. My fear is that the new patch may override it; thus I'd have missed out on the chance of seeing the sleeper.<br>

Reading the patch message, it looks like it may be too late. It's a shame, because I know that some special things were planned.<br>

FnF has hardly &quot;collapsed in on itself&quot;. FnF is still a guild that is capable of doing some of the same mobs your folks do Coin, with alot less people. You may say that is irrelvant, but once FnF is past its current &quot;growing pains&quot; then what will you say?<br>
<br>
Is FnF months away from the 4th warder? I dunno, how many 60th rangers do they have now? Seems to me they had 3 on a recent raid. How many DB wizards do they have? Seems to me they have 6 on the rooster. I think the only thing that they need to be worried about is will there BE a 4th warder up for them to try? <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

I love the fact that the Sleepers Tomb as been revamped!  First off this is more then likely the best way this could have happened.   Everyone who wanted to see the sleeper stay got screwed by VI ,and everyone who wanted to see him die got the same.   So by everyone complaining and bickering about it no one will ever see it on FV.   I was looking forward to Coinfist leading a raid to wake all the warders and hoped it would have been a combined effort of Reso and FnF.   Either way this could have been better resolved and I think people should RELAX!  I mean its just a video game if someone wants to do something let them.   They have worked a long time to do this and people hold them back for no apparent reason other then their own greed over virtual items.

I wandered in, and sat down next to the Sleeper, hoping to get some cheesy ass screenshots of me standing by him. <br>
<br>
Then, the alarm clock I carry in my bag went off. <br>
<br>
Turned around, to see an extremely groggy prismatic dragon complaining about &quot;turning that noise off.&quot; He was in a fairly decent mood, since there hadn't been a major battle to wake him up, just a alarm. I shared two stacks of frost giant steaks with him, and spotted him some Fizzlecutter that I'd bought from Jhary.<br>
<br>
We chatted for a bit, and he said he had to go, something about business with Veeshan. Then he flew off. As I waved goodbye to him, I thought to myself, &quot;y'know, for the alleged destroyer of Norrath, he's not a bad guy.&quot; Then I collected the uber loot underneath him: 2 cp and a rusty rapier.<br>
