  </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Post number 1,343,823,498.44273 on TLC and Quests</span><hr size=1> **I posted this on the Dev board for Everquest as well.  I'm sure a few of you are going to go ape sh*t and flame my hair off, but I think it's fairly well thought out and speaks for a lot of people here**<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to start off saying that I do like FV better then the other servers.  They are mostly full of kids and or jerks with fairly selfish motives for playing.  FV does have a nice RP feeling and is generally more mature.  The language barrier, everyone being /anon and lack of zone wide shouts or communication do make the server very hard to play on and find groups, but I think that most people like how they add to the ambiance of FV.  Those rules alone make things hard enough and are probably one of the main reasons that people are not staying on FV.  That being said, I think the biggest problem on FV and your biggest oversight is the TLC for quest items.  I understand the need for TLC.  And in general it is a good idea and most folks like it.  It is needed for item drops to keep out farmers, campers and doodz.  I think it does.  But what it also does is make your already poorly thought out and designed quests even harder.  Not many people that I know on the server, and I do know quite a few people, have stopped doing their class specific guild quests.  Your quests were not designed with TLC in mind and adding to the fact that the server is so low in population it is hard to get people who have the item or to get help getting a quest component that has TLC’ed to you.  <br>
<br>
This to me is EverQUEST, I want to be able to quest and interact with PC’s and NPC’s.  To role-play and start events that all levels of my friends can join in on.  What unfortunately happens is now if I really want to do a quest I have to learn the levels of the mobs and plan it out step by step.  I need to make sure I don’t miss out on something I need to do before it TLC’s and schedule it.  This means spoiler sights and nights of preplanned play.  That to me is not role-playing or happening across a chance encounter.  People really do want to start and finish quests.  FV is hard enough with the other rules and is keeping people away, adding to that the TLC for quests and it explains why the server population is low and getting lower.  <br>
<br>
People here just want to play, RP, quest and have fun.  And questing means being able to start and reasonably have a chance at finishing a quest.  I’ll give you a few examples:<br>
<br>
I started a Vah Shir Beastlord and tried to do the claw quests.  By the time I got to level 7 most of the mobs I needed for the quest were green.  Now the only mobs I hunted for these 7 levels were the ones I needed for the quest.  I out leveled the quest just by performing it.  I had to actually de-level to finish.<br>
<br>
Another example of this is the Iksar Shaman, Necro and Monk quests.  They are poorly designed anyway, never mind that some mobs you need to kill for the Shaman quest are close to level 20 to get a level 10-12 mob to spawn.  Or the Monk quests, some of the mobs for the Shackle of Rock are level 12 and others are level 21.  That takes planning and spoiler sights.  Especially when you don’t get the quest until around level 17.  I hunted for the Sarnak Courier for over 8 levels and never once saw it spawn.  It greened out to me just trying to find it.<br>
<br>
The last example I will give happened just last week.  A young level 8 Monk was asking me about the Monk armor quests in Cabilis.  He was trying to find out about the escaped Frogloks because he just found the quest.  Well I had to inform him that the Frogs were now TLC and he would have to find another way to get the shackles he needed for the granite pebbles.  Needless to say he was a bit put off and I have not seen him on since then.<br>
<br>
All this does for most people is frustrate them.  And with such low populations and people frustrated with their own quests it is often hard to get help.  Even if someone does find your quest item the lack of auction and language prevent you from finding that person.<br>
<br>
At any rate I do like the server, but I think you really need to reconsider TLC for quest items at least.  It will really make the server a bit more enjoyable and less frustrating for people starting out and hopefully it will keep a lot of the good RP’ers that are frustrated with all the road blocks from leaving.  It may even get some of the people we have lost back and help some of the fresh promising faces that try the server to stay.<br>
<br>
I’ve left my other characters on Tarew Marr of 2 years, a level 54 Troll SK a level 48 Druid and a 35 Warrior, all with outstanding gear and achievements, because I’m just tired of the immaturity of the majority of the people that play on your blue servers and PvP.  FV is the last stop for people like myself who are tired of EQ and want to get a little bit back out of the old RP and adventure that was available when the game first started.  If I get tired or to frustrated on FV I will not go back to another server, I’ll just move on from the game.<br>

I have outleveled a few quests myself and then discovered, hey I do not need that item, because now I can get a better one.<br>
    Learn to roleplay.<br>
Picture this: You wake up one day in a town. with food, weapons, maybe spells and a note saying to seek a person who will train you. You have background knowledge of where you are etc... You go out hunting and start fighting a mob, as you advance within your class you notice that certain mobs dropped magic items when they were challenging, but now that they are easy to kill, there treasure is nowhere to be seen. Hmm, must just be the way the world works, or the mobs that have the treasure run as soon as they see you, so you cannot get it from them.<br>
     If you are truly roleplaying, you would have no knowledge that things could be different.<br>

If the Temple gives me an order to go do some mission, then it's not very in character for me to say &quot;Oops, sorry Prime Heirophant, it seems I outleveled my quest and can't do the assignment anymore, I'm gonna go camp sarnaks now, bye!&quot;. <br>
<br>
When a character says he's going to do a quest, typically they don't just give up and go do somthing else when they encounter an obstacle. Now your half forced too, or you have to get lower levels to stand there and kill somthing for you. I had a hard time roleplaying the scene where I had to agro a goblin, pull it over to Cabilis, and stand there with it hitting me while my friend ran around the city offering ten platnium to any newbie who'd come whack the thing and give me the item it dropped. <br>
<br>
The TLC, at least to me, doesn't encourage roleplaying at all. While I've managed to avoid any really nasty encounters with it, I do think it's kinda dumb. Espicially when you encounter quests with level 20 placeholders for level 10 mobs. It's just badly designed. <br>
<br>
Well that's my opinian, anyway. If I offended anyone I apologize in advance, not my intention.<br>

Nothing vulgar or rude about this post, but it's definitely a rant of sorts.  Into the Soapbox it goes.  Heck, Soapbox gets more traffic these days anyway.<br>
