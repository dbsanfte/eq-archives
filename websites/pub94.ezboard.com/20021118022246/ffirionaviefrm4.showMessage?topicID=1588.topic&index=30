People who are depressed need to find an outlet, and how they deal with things through that outlet is what people see, I suppose.  I've had some bad problems with depression myself (which I don't want to get into here), and I know at times EQ has been my outlet, and at other times, it's been reading... and other times, it has been other outlets.  I would say I was a lot more depressed before I got Everquest... now it's helped moderate that a bit, because I'm having more fun... and I also have a much healthier way of getting out some of my frustration and anxiety than taking it all out on myself (just like some other people play sports, exercise, take a walk, or read).. <p><center>

I was unable to edit there and I'm too lazy to do so now =b.  I did this as a sort of just a stream of thoughts and really made no effort to pay attention to grammer or spelling.<br>
<br>
I remember very well when AD&amp;D was blamed for a murder/suicide here in Houston. <br>
<br>
Anyway: A Sakharra ramble, Acropolis is sort of used to these but this is my first Tholuxe one. I may be right, I may be wrong and I claim to make no sense at all... please feel free to stop reading &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
My ex and I used to refer to the masses of people who just do the 8 hour a day job, go home, eat, watch television and breed, yet make no effort to think as &quot;the sheep&quot;. Anyway the flock looks for something convienient that they dont quite understand and have never experienced to blame all of lifes woes on. In reality though, they live a very dull, unimaginative day to day existance and I think many at least on a subconscious level are bitter about it and wish to condemn all of us to the same existance.<br>
<br>
There are some very common themes... <br>
<br>
Music is a common target, most of the great classical composers were accused of writing the &quot;devil's music&quot; at one time or another much as modern artists are condemed as as bad influences.<br>
<br>
Alternative religions are a nice, easy target for the sheep because if you trash another religion then God is on YOUR side of course. <br>
<br>
Dancing in general is still a target among many religious groups, all that touching and moving MUST be a sin... The combination of dancing and music almost always lead to alchohol and drugs and I dont think I need to go further. <br>
<br>
Throw alchol and drugs together with music and dancing and OMG you have the potential for... Sex. Well sex is a nice target because alot of the major religions say its evil unless used for the purpose of breeding.<br>
<br>
Gaming has been a target for some time as well, gambling, pinball, AD&amp;D and for the last 10 years or so video games.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the sheep feel a need to attack anything that &quot;we&quot; use to escape the mundane day to day boredom that they seem to relish. We're not allowed to have any fun and lord forbid we enjoy our lives when they can not. These are the people who sit happily on their couches tuned in to the television from 6:00PM to 11:00PM every night. The sheep are the ones who buy the products that keep the advertising money flowing in to the television stations.<br>
<br>
Ok Sakharra is going to go WAY off the deep end here, if you have read this far, you probabily want to stop because I'm going to make no sense at all while spouting out a sort of paranoid theory.<br>
<br>
So here we are, nearly half of a million people spanning from early baby boomers to post generation X young teens and we're spending 5 or more hours a night or so playing a game and not watching television. Our numbers grow daily as do the number of games we can play. If we're not watching television, we're not being force fed the advertising that drives the income of the networks. <br>
<br>
So is it any surprise that the network news would attack Everquest ?<br>
<br>
The really sad thing is, they view us as isolated in front of our computers yet never realize that we are FAR less isolated than they are sitting glued to their television sets. We meet and experience a multitude of people in our world, we have real conversations, we agree, disagree, make friends and enemies all with real people who just happen to be sitting on the next block or on the other half of the world. All they have are two dimensional talking heads acting out scripts written by people paid to capture their attention. I feel just a bit sorry for them. <br>

<br>
As a child, when you are frightened that the monster who lives in your closet is going to burst out of there and eat you while you're sleeping, you latch onto your teddy, pull the covers up over your head and close your eyes because if you can't see it, it sure can't see you!  When that doesn't work you scream for your parents.  Lights come on, fill the room, you're encircled by loving arms and feel safe, loved.<br>
<br>
As you get older, you follow the cattle because you feel wanted, accepted and loved.  You laugh, you smile, you have a good time.  Must follow the cattle, the cattle love you.<br>
<br>
You go to a boring school, listening to boring teachers, conforming yourself to what is accepted by society.  You look at the kids who show their individuality and stick your nose in the air, tease them, pick at them, fight with them.  Gotta love the Mickey Mouse High School Drama Trauma Soaps.<br>
<br>
Your parents expect one thing, religion expects one thing, society expects one thing, your friends expect one thing and the only way to be accepted is to try to please them all.<br>
<br>
Oh... whats this... Everquest?  Oh cool, that looks neat, think I'll buy it.<br>
<br>
WOW... now here is a place that I can be true to myself...<br>
<br>
You quit going to church, you only went because it was expected of you.  You quit your job, not going anywhere in it, dead end, you can't stand it.  Your significant other leaves you because you are no longer conforming yourself to his/her standards.  You are start to be true to yourself and for a while, you are happy.<br>

Who gives a rats ass?  You know what?  When I go take a dump EQ is on my computer screen.  When I'm doing my homework its on my computer screen.  When I'm thinking about the girl I love its on the computer screen.  Hell I can't think of a time when the log in fuckin screen isn't on the goddamn computer screen.  It wasn't even in game!  What the hell.  I'm sorry but this guy coulda been thinkin about just about anything and killed himself.  The fact that the game was on the screen only means he played.  He was &quot;mentally challenged&quot;, which means that he probably had real life problems...maybe he didn't quit his job but they told him to resign cuz he screwed up...I highly doubt that his reason for quiting a job was to play more EQ...do we have any statements from friends about his obsessive behavior?  No, that whole part of the documentary was fuckin ridiculous just cuz its on the screen don't mean jack<br>
<br>
As for an earlier post about escapism...yes...I'll admit it I'm the first one to find escape in real life.  I get shat on in real life so much that my friends tend to think of me as &quot;unlucky&quot; in all things pertaining to life...and so I like doing other things I have so many hobbies it isn't funny.  But when it comes down to it my friends have always been there to support me and pull me away from the game to go work out or party or whatever...and honestly...not always do even these things compare to the pure fun I have when playing EQ...I'm proud of my dorf and I'm happy to know the people in my guild and others in the game.  &quot;Its just a game&quot; I don't think is true and VI is full of shit but they always are so no diff there.  It IS more than a game...Will you commit suicide over it? Hell no! Will things in game affect you IRL?  YES.  Will they cause you to be depressed?  I sure hope not.  IF they do then find a new game to play...anyone doing something for entertainment...even escaping should take responsibility for playing something that affects them negatively.<br>
<br>
My advice: EQ is an amazing game.  Is it truly addictive? NO.  I played it more when I first started when the game first came out and played it for many months hours on end.  Then I decided that I'd stop and spend more time with my, at the time, girlfriend and eventually I didn't miss it.  I came back 3 years later because I remembered how great this game really is.  If I decided to stop playing now I'd miss it but I wouldn't say no to change.  If you are that addicted then maybe they have a point about it being like &quot;crack&quot;.  I kinda think of it more like &quot;Everweed&quot; in that weed is good shit and you wanna have it when you can.  You'll spend a monthly budget on it, but the fact is that you are never truly addicted to the stuff and if you wanted to you can stop smoking it forever after. <p>Rundo Nundodundo

You must be accountable for your own actions.  people blaming things, whether it is EQ or whatever for making them do anything is a cop out.  We make our own choices.  <br>
<br>
When we make bad choices, some of us, or those close to us, sometimes try to place the blame as far away as possible.<br>
<br>
That song made my son kill himself.<br>
<br>
That game made my son kill himself.<br>
<br>
That (insert anything here) made my son (insert any bad behavior here).<br>
<br>
I have had personal experience with real addiction.  And I was to blame.  Thats right, me.  Not the drug, not my mom, not TV, not popular music, I was at fault.<br>
<br>
It is true that only certain things are actually physically addictive.  But almost anything can be psychologically addictive.  I've known potheads who were every bit as bad as heroin junkies when they didn't have weed.  I've seen people who honestly would not leave there house to go out because they had to watch TV.  I've seen people completely blow off all there real world friends to sit in chat rooms.<br>
<br>
Yes, EQ can be truely addictive.  But then again so can anything.  And if someone gets addicted to EQ and makes stupid decisions regarding their life because of it, it is not EQ's fault, anymore than it is TV's fault, or internet chat rooms fault.  It is the persons fault for not controling their own life.<br>
<br>
People blame the substance, and ignore the underlying problem.  Everyone needs an escape, but when the escape we choose takes over and becomes more important than the real world, we need to look at why we seek escape so much, not blame the escape we choose.<br>
