I met two ladies who knocked a hole in my cynicism, at least temporarily. They have given me new hope, and I wish to give them their due here.<br>
<br>
/salute Eldratu<br>
/salute Kallisia<br>
<br>
Here is a not so short story about what happened. I tend to get gabby, but please bear with me. I WILL get to the point eventually heheh.<br>
<br>
I died to a DOT after gating to my bind point in the bank in FV. Felt dumb about it, and pretty sure I wasn't going to get a cleric to come res me. I hardly ever ask for a res, but I just hit 43 a few days ago (after 40 days played, I am not a powerleveler heh). Being one level from 44, I am now currently trying to grind out experience to get there. I hate doing that, and losing the experience on such a worthless sort of death was depressing.   <br>
<br>
I checked with Saga, and the highest cleric was 30. I never scoff at a res, but less than a 50 percent really wasn't worth the bother to the cleric to come all the way to my adopted home town. So I did what the truly desparate do. /who all cleric 34 60. Came up with too many names, so I cut it back to 39 60. Running down the list of names I looked for two things: race (I am a high elf), and location. There are many places on Norrath that I can return someone to very easily. <br>
<br>
I saw Eldratu in Great Divide. High elf, in a zone I can port to directly. Gave it a try, telling her I was dead in the bank in FV, not expecting anything but a &quot;sorry, busy&quot; even if she replied at all. She did reply, and said she was about to start a hunt. I think she was at a camp and set up. I was a little surprised that she explained so much of what she was doing, so I sent her a reply thanking her for replying and wishing her luck in her hunt. I started to peruse the list again and Eldratu said she was on the way to Firiona Vie to res me, coming via Butcherblock. I was surprised, and very happy. I sat and whined over /gu about my bad luck in dying so cheesily and forgot completely about offering her any money or whatever for coming to res me. <br>
<br>
She showed up with a druidess named Kallisia. As an amusing side note, Eldratu was wearing a robe and I, a wizard, was in chain mail. It really sort of made me chuckle. The game has evolved, eh? She res'd me, and I suddenly realized I better give her some money. Like I said, I hardly ever get a res and forget things like that. I gave her 100 platinum, all I had except for 2 gold 6 silver that I kept for beer money, and I would have given her alot more. The game is to the point for me where money and items mean diddly-squat, but I know clerics have to buy gems. I apologized for not having more and she said it was fine and thanked me for it. She and Kallisia left then and never once asked an embarassing question of how I happened to die in the bank *chuckle*.<br>
<br>
I still can't get over it. Call me cynical and pessimistic. These two took time out of their game play, with no promise of money or anything, and traveled clear across the world to help me. I have never met either, as far as I know, though Kallisia's name looks sorta familiar, and what they did was over and above the call of duty to a stranger. I never expected it, and it was a pleasant surprise in this dog-eat-dog phat lewt world. <br>
<br>
They are the kind of folks this server needs more of. Please, let us all try to emulate their example a bit more. It truly doesn't have to interfere with roleplay. I have scoffed at evil beings who ask me for aid and stomped off after giving them a stern warning, then sneakily OOC returned to assist (ack now my secret is out). I see no purpose in making the game harder for someone if I can aid them. I know the roleplay-heavy folks are going to throw rotten fruits at me for THAT one. <br>
<br>
At any rate, the kindness of Eldratu and Kallisia is a shining example to us, and I beg you to give them a kind word of greeting and perhaps a helping hand if they are in need someday. I would like to see reputation have a positive effect for once (points to the soapbox and shakes his head in disgust).<br>

It is sorta in the past now, so not quite as glaringly embarassing. <br>
<br>
Picture a wizard at about 60 percent health but about 90m and too dang impatient to wait any longer before taking on a, um... I think 35ish troll shaman and pet (npc). Anyway said wizard fries shaman in about 30 seconds. Hahaha. Gloats. Shaman did land a spell, one of those diseasy things, and other than that didn't even touch him weee! <br>
<br>
Wizard then has the pet to deal with, had him rooted out of the way till now. Pet comes at him, wizard gets bit a few times, not too hard though, maybe 30s to 50s, couple of them, probly not even 100 damage total.  He is casually leading the pet around, shooting him with lightning and stuff, about one shot to go to kill it and then he realizes HOLY CRAP! under a bubble health left! And that scourge whatever thing aint even blinkin yet!!. No time to waste killing the pet, the wizard needs to bandage RIGHT NOW to live. (Scourge takes about 24 per tick and bandaging heals 25 per bandage. Anyone who has ever bandaged knows one tick is much much faster. Heheh you see where this is going)<br>
<br>
The wizard gates (bind point = Firiona Bank). Scrambles with bandages, flinging them all around while desperately trying to apply first aid to the festering icky crud creeping all over him. The bank is a mess, Wella is screamin at him to clean the place up, Wellford is grabbin a club, scourge is blinking, probably one or two blinks to go and... the wizard drops over dead. Wellford puts the club down.  <br>
<br>
Cheesy way to go. I am not sure if it is more worthless than diving headlong off the cliff in Warsilks 'cause you are running and talking on the winds, but it has to be darn close. Killing something then dying 2 minutes later because of a spell it cast on you and no way you can stop it... Ugh.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, finding my corpse was easy. I just looked down at my feet and there it was. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for making a potential bad night turn into a good night, i.e. I got to meet you and Eldratu <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Hmm... I think I will die more often...<br>

<br>
I guess it is unusual for other to go out of their way to aid another. I like to look at it as a &quot;what if I &quot; type of thing. i aid many and I never ask what someone will pay. You see I have no idea what type of bank shape a person may be in and that is it. You may be the richest player or poor i will give aid. I do role play and I have a no aid to dark races. I am sorry that some are bothered by that but it has been a long standing policy. I will revive is someone is miles away from their corpse or show them the way out of a zone, but my no aid policy will not enhance the movement forward. Who know maybe I am wrong, but it the way I have chosen to live. I will add i never ask for a dark race to aid me either. So fair is fair.<br>
<br>
Do be well and thank you for the complement<br>
