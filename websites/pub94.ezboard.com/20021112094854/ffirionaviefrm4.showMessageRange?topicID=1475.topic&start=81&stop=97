It's part of the game silly. Its exciting and fun to be part of a random roll. As it is I rarely roll unless it is just a sell it item. This was a special case because I thought I might have a good use for the item.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  What you say matters a lot less than what you do.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You rolled on it because rolling on loot is exciting?  You didn't even think about using a shield as a rogue until the shield dropped and you saw the stats?  Basically you saw the shield as a shiney new toy that you wanted to try out.  To me, that's greed.<br>
<br>
For some classes, a shield is a part of their overall equipment package.  They have worn shields since their earlies levels and have spent time and effort upgrading that slot.  The opportunity to roll on a shield of this caliber doesn't come along often.  For you, it was an experiment that you wanted to try out having never thought about it before until you saw the link in your text box.  To me, you having an equal chance at that item as someone who has made shield use an integral part of their character goes against the spirit of NBG.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to give it a try, buy or borrow a shield from someone and see what it does to your damage output, tanking ability, etc.  If you don't have the money or access to a shield, then just keep the thought on the back burner and perhaps in the future the opportunity will present itself for you to try out your ideas without making it more difficult for shield users to get the upgrades they need.<br>
<br>
If you don't care, then please don't roll.  There are people out there who actually do care and your rolling against them just because you get a kick out of it is rather thoughtless.<br>
<br>
Again, these are all just my opinions.  I absolutly am not saying that Siffo is a bad person, but in this particular instance, I belive his motivations for rolling on that shield had more to do with greed than need given his posts from the last few days.<br>

<br>
I did not roll on this item because it was exciting. I rolled on it because I thought I had a good use for it. I rarely roll on things, I will roll on sell it things. I do think rolling is exciting and fun and part of the game.<br>
<br>
By your measurement no one but rogues should roll on piercers because they would use them more and only druids should try for all of the Wis items cause they will use them more. Or no one should roll on an item if they have some thing better than another person who is there that wants it. NBG is an easy way of saying &quot;Some thing you will use and just not go off and sell&quot; I had every intention of using it a lot.<br>
<br>
As to it getting carried on by Bjond's greed fixation, I asked about the shield because I was concerned if it would have been as useful as I thought it would be. So in essence it was just the opposite of what you and Bjorn are saying. I do not want to roll on some thing that I can not make good use of.<br>
<br>
The only one who has ever accused me of being greedy is Bjond and people parroting him. I follow the rules and none of the Raid Leaders has had a complaint about me. I do what I believe is right and I have earned the respect of those I adventure with. And yes it is a game and some times I do things just because they are fun. And in this game you are going to find people that have or get better stuff than others that could use the stuff. I will let you in on a secret It is a game and they will not starve or get killed RL by an Ork Pawn because they didn't have a certain item from a random roll.<br>
<br>
I go to raids, I follow the Raid Leaders rules on who can roll for what. If you don't like their rules you are welcome to run your own raids. <br>
<br>
But please do keep on about this I am sure Knor and Clan Twisted loves to see it at the top of the board with his name because you don't agree with the way raid leaders run raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugegblix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gegblix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/02 12:43:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Knor the loot whore</span><hr size=1> &quot;By your measurement no one but rogues should roll on piercers because they would use them more &quot;<br>
<br>
I've never rolled on a piercer when a rogue was in the group.  IMO, rogues should always get first consideration on piercing weapons.  I guess that's the difference, I've always been a &quot;best use&quot; kind of guy.  As for Wis items, Clerics have always gotten first crack at them because the length of time we can survive on a raid depends on the cleric's mana pool and the warrior's hitpoint pool.  Druids and shaman would typically get second shot at +Wis items.<br>
<br>
At this point, I really don't see anything that either one of us can say to change eachother's minds.  If the raid leader wants a very loose definition of the term Need, then that's fine.  I'm still gonna think that rogues who roll on shields and wizards who roll on +AC items are being greedy.<br>
<br>
Will I think they are horrible people and refuse to ever group/raid with them again?  Na, but it is one reason why I burn out at the high end game and am often found rerolling.  Alot of people become selfish when they hit raid level and there's a point where you stop feeling good for people when they get gear.<br>
<br>
And by the way, I did read all the words, every  single one of them.  Not agreeing with you is not the same as skimming posts.  I really don't care how raid leaders run their raids, or the rules they put forth.  Bottom line is, I feel rolling for things on a raid that don't upgrade your primary strengths and rolling against others who's primary strengths are upgraded for any reason is being greedy, no matter what the rules say.  Just because you can roll for it, doesn't mean you should.<br>
