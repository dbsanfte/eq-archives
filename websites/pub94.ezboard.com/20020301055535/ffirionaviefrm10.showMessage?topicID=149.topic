To this day, I have not yet found another Vah Shir with the scar, and I keep it under my armor, now, so that none will ask me about it. Since I have left Shar Vahl, I have not asked any of my companions if they have heard of such a thing... it seems my quest is hopeless... yet some day I shall find another with the mark, and perhaps learn of my true family, and why I have never known them.<br>
<br>
And now I look back on the past again. The memories are still fresh; full of sorrow, and indecision, and hopelessness. I remember running out of the house we shared, into the Thicket. The guards tried to stop me, but I ran past them, and hid until they had gone. Those who had cared for me (for I could no longer call them my parents) came out of the city themselves, looking for me. But I was not ready to be found. I did not want to go back.<br>
<br>
I found little solitude in the Thicket, but I did not go back. I had nothing when I left... no supplies, no weapons, no protection. I lived off of the land, for a time, picking the payala fruit under the trees, and drinking what little I could find. But hopper eggs and berries are little sustenance for a Vah Shir. It was at this time that I felt a stirring in my soul, in a way I can not describe to anyone who has not felt it, save by saying, I knew I was not alone. It was not frightening, despite the fact that I'd not felt anything like it before. It carried a.. reassurance, that I would survive, that -we- would survive, though I knew not who -we- were.<br>
<br>
And so I lived for some years. I could not bring myself to go into the city, though I did not avoid all travelers. The bards that passed on their way to Shadow Haven often stopped, wondering why I was outdoors and alone, and they often had a flask of water of crust of bread to share while I told them my tale. The Khala Dun I avoided, for they would have taken me to the city, and the Dar Khura for the same reason. The Taruun, however.. they saw me, but left me alone. And I did not see a Khati Sha, for they walked not on the roads, but across the country.<br>
<br>
As time passed, I began to catch a glimpse of a tiger, following me from afar, staying hidden. He was only seen when he meant to be, and it scared me to have such a beast tracking me down, for though we are alike, they would see me as food. But every time I turned to run, I was reassured by the odd feeling, and when I turned and looked again, the tiger was gone. This happened for many passings of Norrath through the sky.<br>
<br>
As time went on, I began to find hoppers lying near the places where I slept, killed and stripped of their hide. I was wary at first, but hunger overcame me, and I began to eat the meat, thinking a Jharin was leaving me food. I saw the tiger again, coming closer and closer while I ate, until he stood right next to me. I dared not move. He looking into my eyes, and I into his, and that was when I understood, for the first time, that this was no mere beast. I still remember my first look into those golden pools, deep and dark and the caverns within Luclin, yet having a spirit and vigour that heartened me. From that time, the tiger ran at my side as I snuck around the Thicket, and we had fresh meat every night, for he hunted for us both, small though he was. And yet, at times he would disappear, for an hour, or a day at a time, and I could not find him, though I searched high and low.<br>
<br>
Life then was good, or at least it felt so: I was well-fed, and had little to fear in the Thicket. My clothes, though weathered and torn, kept off the elements, and my tiger-friend kept me company in the times I thought of home. But all good things must come to an end. One day, I saw something I'd not imagined... the Saurek Claw Beast, strongest of the Saurek until far out in the thicket, and taller than some of the Khala Dun. It came toward the city, moving along the hills that encompass the Thicket, sniffing under the rocks to find food. It drew ever nearer to Shar Vahl, until it was in the place where the needle-clawed hoppers breed, where new Vah Shir citizens often hunt. There was only one trainee there this day... I wonder, sometimes, what would have happened if there were more. It crept closer and closer to the young warrior, but he did not see it until it was too close to run from. He let out a scream, a cry for help, but he was too far from the tents surrounding the city for it to be heard. The hopper toyed with its prey, slashing first his legs, so he could not run, and then leering over him while he feebly tried to hit it with his sword. I watched all this, paralyzed with fear... and I whispered to myself, &quot;I must help.... but what can I do, save perish myself?&quot; And then I felt movement at my side, and saw my tiger-friend charge and jump on the back of the beast, holding for dear life with claw and fang. And I knew what I must do, though I was afraid. I ran forward, watching the Saurek shake it mighty head, trying to fling my friend loose.. but he was too fast, jumping off and clawing at the beast. Many marks he made in the rough, gray hide, but none penetrated to the flesh beneath. I grabbed the warrior and began to drag him toward the tents while the battle went on. I had almost made it to the closest one, when I looked back at the Saurek, and saw it pierce my friend's side with its claws. I screamed and ran back, but it was too late. The warriors under the tent, alerted by my cries, ran out and saw the beast and its prey. Within moments there were five Vah Shir chasing the beast, fighting it with dagger, sword, and claw, bringing it to the ground. But I had eyes only for my tiger... I ran to him, and cradled him in my arms, blood seeping down into my lap, and I watched his eyes grow dim. I closed my eyes for a moment, and sobbed there on the ground... and then I felt a lightness in my arms, and looked up, and lo and behold! The body of my friend was gone.<br>
<br>
One of the Vah Shir came up to me then, clad in hopperhide and bearing a scimitar. He said he was a captain of the Khati Sha, and wondered what had happened. I told him, tears running down my face, for now the only companion I had known for many years was gone. He took my face in his hands, and looked me in the eye, then said, &quot;I think you should come with me. Sadhi will surely want to hear of this.&quot; And though I protested, I had no will to resist as I was taken into the city for the first time in many years.<br>
