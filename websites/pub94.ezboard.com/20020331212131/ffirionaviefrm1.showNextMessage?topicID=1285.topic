I think it will be doodesque beyond the pale, and is even appealing to them on many levels, and this will frustrate and destroy much of the dynamic server content.  I also think there will be a huge war, among a small population, to control the atmosphere of the server.  Remind anyone of FV, in some ways?  Thing is, the poor GMs responsible for providing this &quot;dynamic content&quot; will be caught in the middle, and I think things are going to go rapidly downhill.  Might be wrong, but this is my prediction.  If Legends is no more successful than FV, but requires all the support they are lumping into it, I think it may die a premature death.<br><br>Now, if Legends does fail as a premium service, Verant will be left with all their coding for such neat things as personal webpages, maps of Norrath, etc., and will have nothing to do with it.  This stuff doesn't require dynamic support, it's just coding.  And if the premium service dies they'll end up rolling it into their general service because there will be nothing else to do with it.  So that's why boycotting Legends is good not only on general principle, but in order for us all to get what they are trying to sell only to a priviledged few.  I wouldn't leave FV anyway, not for any premium service, not even if it was free, but give this all some time to iron out and it might be right in the end.  Even if Verant doesn't have a clue beforehand, sometimes, they can feel the landslide of player opinion building.<br><br>Valquiss <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A> at: 2/2/02 5:15:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 404<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 5:19:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Alright...</span><hr size=1> Since we are talking about &quot;what if's?&quot;<br><br><br>What if it succeeds? <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umelmell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melmell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theorderofthedragon.com/docs/fanart/cross.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A_Idiot_666</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 5:38:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/ozzy.gif height=102 width=74></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> /agree... this damn thing could become the biggest server on the damn game. maybe even 50%+ will join it. maybe 6000 will be online at a average every day during american-europe day time hours.. anything can happen. no, not all of the people on the 'normal servers' are poor. nuh uh. i know a billionaire who plays the game.... whoodeefrickindoo. i mean, even *I* could afford it if i didn't shop so much, go out to party every day, ya know? do so much shit.... my income relies on a teenager job and my parents. heh. but.. thing is. i don't want all that junk downloaded on my computer. it's gonna take up space. for a 63 ram computer it would not survive. maybe not even my 128 ram computer...

However what we are seeing is a couple of things.  <br><br>First, EQ IS on the decline.  The game is past its growth stage and is now entering the &quot;cash-cow&quot; stage.  What that means is, Sony can no longer count on additional players to increase its revenues from EQ and thus must find ways of increasing the amount of revenue per customer.  Expansions are a relatively costly venture when you consider development time, marketting, distribution, and post release &quot;debugging&quot;.  What Legends does is provide a new product for Sony without all the costs associated with physically releasing a product.<br><br>Second, I believe that Sony is simply capitalizing upon the stealth marketting they have conducted in the last three years.  Based on the level of &quot;addiction&quot; they know EQ exudes as well as the polls they have conducted, Sony is attempting to maximize their revenue from this product.  For example, Big Tobacco knows (though they'll never admit) that tobacco is addictive.  They have worked out the attrition levels at which people quit smoking in the face of price increases.  EQ is no different.  If they quadruple the price for the hard-core addicts, and only 10% leave, they enjoy a 360% increase in revenue.  Not bad.<br><br>Third, Sony is feeling out the market for their upcomming products (i.e. Star Wars Galaxies).  If the Legends servers max out right away, and there is demand for yet more, Sony knows it can come out with a fairly hefty monthy fee subscription for their new products.<br><br>The thing to consider is this.  Should Legends succeed, we may all be facing higher subscription fees for basic EQ as well for new products.  Furthermore, it would catapult Sony farther ahead of any other developer (with the increased revenue they will enjoy), increasing the barriers to entry for the MMORPG market.<br><br>My final comment is this - even though it has been stated before.  If you think the Legends server is going to be any sort of RP paradise...think again.  It will be the very essence and distillation of powergaming/loot-hunting.  And for the roleplayers, the double-damning thing will be that it will work and future products may be geared accordingly.<br><br>Rexfelix<br>Agent of the Balance <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 6:16:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright...</span><hr size=1> I'm ambivalent to this thing right now. <br><br>My instinct says that financially, the Legends servers will do OK for Verant. There will be enough people who will jump at the opportunity to want to play this sort of server. <br><br>Think about it. <br><br>Statistically, over 400,000 EQ subscribers. I was quoted that this figure is now around 430,000 after the recent Christmas season and all the first-time players that SoL brought in. I also don't buy into the &quot;decline phase&quot; theory. At least the statistics do not show any decline at this moment. Tho I admit that EQ does have a surge of new competition (DAoC, etc) that will make customer growth slower for Verant in the coming year. They know that. We know that. Everyone knows that. <br><br>Verant is targeting around 8,000 players for the Legends servers to meet their goal, right? <br><br>8,000 players out of 400,000 is a mere tiny 2% <br><br>Two percent of the total. They only need 2% of Everquest players to try out the Legends server....and Verant will have already achieved their goal. This goal is very much attainable for them. <br><br>The Pros: <br><br>If Verant meets their goal, then the Legends server is simply a revenue stream. End result is that Verant will have extra pocket money to upgrade and improve all existing EQ projects. They will also have extra money to hire more developers and programmers. They may even have enough money to actually upgrade their existing hardware, servers and connections too. That's a long term benefit for everyone. <br><br>The Cons: <br><br>Short term, the investment needed to make the Legends server work means that staffing and funding normally allocated for NORMAL servers (including FV) may possibly be underfunded, understaffed, or put by the wayside.... and thus diverted into the Legends servers. <br><br>Right now, it's not necessarily a doom and gloom scenario. Personally I doubt I will join it simply because I dont have that kind of money to throw away. $40 a month buys me better things in life than a premium service game. <br><br>It's too hard to predict if this Legends idea will succeed or not. Hang tight people. I think everyone is in mass hysteria mode right now. <br><br>P.S. -- I do agree with Rexfelix on one point. The EQ Legends server is partially a trial run phase (economic model) for what may be incorporated into Verant's upcoming Star Wars Galaxies. <br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A> at: 2/2/02 6:20:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usoneldarblackrose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soneldar Blackrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 6:21:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright...</span><hr size=1> &quot;I also don't buy into the &quot;decline phase&quot; theory&quot;<br><br>You can't: they revoked the server pop numbers, remember? <p>Soneldar Blackrose<br><b>1 of 9 of the Council of Fate, 1st Fist of Light</b><br><i>"All gold does not glitter<br>     Not all who wander are lost"</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 367<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 7:03:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright...</span><hr size=1> Mel, your sig becomes more and more Gothic everytime you post.<br><br><br>Cool!<br><br>If Legends sucks, EQ might as well die with it.<br>If it succeded, well, define success?<br><br>What is Success to Verant?<br><br>Making Money.

Verant gave us FV to bring back players who left because the game sucked as it was.  We came back, and now FV is empty most of the time for whatever reasons.  Legends is the next attempt at making money by charging 4 times the price a month to offer minimal changes.  They know that the only people who will hit legends are the ubers who seem to all have 10-15 hours a day to play so that they wont even need to do any events, these people will always be raiding, and even so, when there ist an event, I sure as hell hope that they use that new unable to target system they have or every GM trying to make an event will be attacked as is normally the case. Even there, can you blame the players who try to kill a GM, the events normally end in the players being killed.  There hasn't been an original dynamic event in EQ since it started!  The closest was the plague during which I stopped playing for 6 months and when I returned, nothing had changed!  If Verant were smarter, they would have looked at Asheron's Call, it's not much of a game, but damn did they have dynamic events... every few months, they changed the land, added dungeons, destroyed cities, added new mobs to do with the story, now that was dynamic.  I can't recall Verant doing any permanent change to any of the maps except for adding green mist to a few zones and some bugs to kill off low players trying to gain experience.  Or better yet, the wave after wave of mobs coming while a bunch of people get killed for nothing.  They might be planning to make an extra 240,000$ a month, but we all know that maybe 24,000$ will go to the server and the rest will only go in their pockets.<br><br>If you ask me, there is no reason to boycott Legends as I wouldn't go even if it was free.  It'll be the prime Everquest twink and uber server, the equivalent of taking the 2 busiest servers and merging them but with some extras (wow, my own character page, now everyone can see that I play 15 hours a day and my wife left me!)<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/3/02 12:18:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boycotting Legends, and why</span><hr size=1> I wont be signing up for Legends eiter Valquiss.

What is your definition of &quot;success?&quot;<br><br>Valquiss seems to be determining &quot;failure&quot; as &quot;not enough people will play there and continue to play there enough to sustain the cost of running the server.&quot;  I doubt that it will fail in this regard.  With over 350,000+ subscribers, many of them avid enough about the game to buy another PC, another copy of the game and expansions, and pay for a second account, I think it's clear that there are definitely going to be a lot of people who are willing to pay $40/month to play on a &quot;premium&quot; special services server, providing Verant even kind of lives up to their end of the bargain.  They're capping the server at 10,000 subscribers to begin with, so obviously in their accounting they've determined they can turn a profit with that many subscribers.  I think they will be able to get about that many, or nearly that many people interested without much trouble.<br><br>Sure, the majority of us AREN'T willing to pay that much, but if even 1 in 10, or 1 in 20 people are willing to pay that much, it will be a success for Verant.<br><br>Now, it's an entirely different question if you're asking PLAYERS to determine success.  For Verant, success is determined easily: if it makes money, it's a success, if it doesn't, it's a failure.<br><br>For players, whether or not the server is a success will be determined by whether or not they're satisified with the play on the server.  Some people are satisified with FV, and for them (for me) the server has been a huge success.  Some people have been dissatisfied with the way the server has turned out, and for them, it represents a failure.<br><br>I think that from a roleplaying point of view, the &quot;Legends&quot; server is going to be little better than a &quot;blue&quot; server for roleplaying, and in fact probably worse for roleplaying.  Roleplaying is done between <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  people</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Dynamic content only provides a backdrop.  A good backdrop is nice, but if the roleplayers aren't there, the roleplaying won't happen.<br><br>I think that the Legends server may very possibly succeed in satisfying very goal-oriented players (&quot;powergamers&quot;, &quot;achievers&quot;) because the dynamic content may very well mean a dynamic challenge, which should satisfy such players... as will the pride associated with being the first person to obtain &quot;Uber Item X&quot; and having it named after them.<br><br>For &quot;casual gamers&quot;... well, I think it might very well be an entertaining server for your average/casual EQ gamer, if the average/casual EQ gamer were willing to spend $30 extra a month on the game.<br><br>So, if it succeeds for you?  That's great.  If it doesn't?  Sorry.  If it is a failure for Verant, I can see Valquiss's point that this might be a good thing for the ~390,000 of us who aren't willing to pay $30/month for the extras, but would welcome some of the extra web based features that might trickle down to us for free, or at a discounted price.<br><br>Heck, for the web based features, I might be willing to spend $5-10 extra per month.  For more responsive tech support/customer service (if I could be assured of a response to my petition within 45 minutes, for example) I think I'd definitely be willing to spend $10 extra per month for the web based features and the better service, without the dynamic content, new server or any of the other jazz.<br><br>So if it succeeds?  It means nothing to us happy FVers, except that maybe we lose a few of our RPers and PGers to legends.<br><br>If it fails?  Well, if it fails, maybe we have some neat new features to look forward to. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>Player of Velsor Secarne (on Firiona Vie)<BR>Shadow Knight of Cazic-Thule<BR>Seeker of the Dark Truth<BR>Officer of the <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/theindigovoid">Indigo Void</A><BR>Fluent in Human, Erudite, Teir'Dal, Elvish, Halfling, Ogre and Lizardman</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A> at: 2/3/02 4:40:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usomberlainwayfaerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Somberlain Wayfaerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/4/02 10:47:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boycotting Legends, and why</span><hr size=1> I don't see the point of &quot;boycotting&quot; the Legends server.  If you are already happy on your current server(s), and can meet your own EQ goals, then you aren't part of the target audience Verant is catering to with the Legends service.  Some of it sounds very appealing, and $40/month is really not a lot for the hours that most people spend playing.  You can look at it as a $30 increase, or you can do the dollars-per-hour math and tack on the added services, and decide if it's worth the expense.  For me, it's not, but I know plenty of &quot;diehard&quot; players who will probably love Legends.  Does that make them powergamers or uber or BAD?  Nope, it means that they see Legends as something that will add to their EQing experience and worth every penny.<br><br>For those who are saying that Verant should be fixing existing bugs, you are assuming that they are drawing from the existing EQ staff to fill the required Legends positions.  Alan's post indicated that these are new posistions, not tapping into the current support/programming pool.  Whether that is true or not remains to be seen, but if they are adding servers and services, I guarantee that they are adding staff.  He says that Legends won't detract from the work on the existing servers, and while some folks are very much into the &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; stance, I think you all are getting a bit too worked up over nothing.  If the quality levels of existing servers do decline, you can either 1) move to a Legends server, 2) quit playing EQ or 3) live with it and keep playing with your friends despite some imperfections.<br><br>Verant and every other entertainment-oriented company bases success on profit.  Most people who complain about such issues aren't likely to quit playing over it, so their bark is worse than their bite.  Whether or not Verant cares about their customers, it still comes down to cash.

It will cater almost exclusively to High End people, almost guaranteed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1265.topic&start=21&stop=39>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1265.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1265.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1265.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=1265.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1265.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1265.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
