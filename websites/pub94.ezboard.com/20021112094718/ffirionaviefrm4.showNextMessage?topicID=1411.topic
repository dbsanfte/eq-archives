I am going to make a list of things I like about Firiona Vie and things that irk me.  I encourage everyone to contribute theirs as well.  Hopefully, if we can all find one thing to do to make others play experience more enjoyable (either by adding something they like to our play style or toning down something they don't like) it might work to make the server a more enjoyable place for everyone on it.<br>
<br>
So:<br>
<br>
LIKE, this server seems to have a more mature (in terms of conduct rather than age) atmosphere than most other online game environments I have encountered that were not closely moderated.  <br>
<br>
DISLIKE, the changes brought about May 8th have created some deep divisions between those who are fighting to maintain the old rules (shout, auctions, /alignment as a meaningful measure of something) and those who embrace the changes or never even saw the old system.<br>
<br>
LIKE, it is possible to find areas that are not crowded to play.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, it can be hard to find groups particulary when one must try to balance RP styles (or lack of), race and class issues and low population in general.<br>
<br>
LIKE, there are a wide variety of guilds which appeal to a wide variety of people.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, some guilds seem to take their conflicts to an Out Of Character level.<br>
<br>
LIKE, d00dish typing style is less prevalent here.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, Some terms that I would not consider IC such as DING!  or Gratz seem to have become accepted by many as IC terms.  This is something I cannot find a justification for.<br>
<br>
LIKE, FV has a message board dominated by intelligent, reasoned debates on topics that matter.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, that board is also full of strong personalities and can become nasty, repetitive and even personal when it doesn't seem to need to be.<br>
<br>
LIKE, this server was set-up for people who prefer to role-play and it is possible to find role-play at any level in almost any location.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, a lack of coherent narrative world around which to role-play makes it hard for RPed characters to acheive a cohesive world view.  That makes casual interaction confusing and even annoying.<br>
<br>
LIKE Trade skilling is very popular here making discussions of the subject worthwhile and common.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, the tradeskill market has been hurt by a number of factors that reduse the viability of tradeskilling as a primary focus for a character.<br>
<br>
LIKE, one character per account adds greatly to the importance of reputation.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, it can become too easy to resort to reputation attacks on public forums rather than trying to sort out problems between the affected individuals first. Lack of customer service only adds to this problem.<br>
<br>
LIKE, it is possible for a character to continue to advance without ever sacrificing strict grouping policies.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE, largely due to problems of game design it grows increasingly difficult to maintain any form of RP based grouping policies as one gains in experience and hopes to encounter high end areas and events.<br>
<br>
LIKE, most people who joined FV for reasons other than role-playing are polite, wellmannered and non-objectionable in going about their own business.<br>
<br>
DISLIKE,  a minority of people who joined FV for reasons other than role-playing seem to feel a need to attack role-playing.  Ironically, if EITHER the RPers or the non-RPers left FV it could well be enough of a population drop to close the server entirely.<br>
<br>
Well, that's the best list I can come up with at 4:30 a.m.  I'm sure I'll think of more but better to get this posted and see what people think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubraellarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braellarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/20/02 4:23:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1429.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Like/Dislike</span><hr size=1> Like<br>

<br>
DISLIKE: People who take EQ seriously aka the whining, self-pitying, self absorbed, &quot;victims&quot; who play EQ. The type of people who will suck the life out of you with their negativity and bitching. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The ones who think they are raped daily. The people who act like they're superior to other players based on their self style of RP. But they all pale in comparison to the &quot;VICTIMS&quot;. I really hate &quot;victims&quot;. <br>
<br>
(Can't wait for Saiba's terribly biting:  &quot;oh, you piece of rat liver! YOU (her trade mark &quot;you&quot;) hate VICTIMS! So I guess that means you hate people raped, killed, tortured, blah blah blah LOL -- so to clear it up before the mental midget gets her grubby three fingered paws on it: I am talking about people who believe they have been persecuted (when they haven't) and then whine like a speared pig for sympathy. )<br>

limited access to trade skill supplies like hides/leather padding. Fewer and fewer people are playing at the lower levels now and I don't think a smith should have to harvest his own materials. If you have the cash somebody NPC or otherwise would sell to you.<br>
<br>
Bad roleplayers. I have run into many sadly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Lack of roleplaying events. I would have thought that GMs and guides would come to visit to get their roleplaying fix on our server more, but every single GM run event that involves roleplaying has had feeble effort in doing so by the GMs involved.<br>
<br>
Things I liked but were screwed up by the May 8th patch.<br>
<br>
Limited range of shout. I hate shouts being zone wide and so do many people not part of a Reso raid, but in the same zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have to say my biggest gripe with May 8th, besides the general increase of d00dz that all the changes combined has led to, has been zonewide shout.<br>
<br>
It used to be such a useful tool and has now become another OOC channel.  If I could choose one rule to reinstate...this would come first, before grouping restrictions or alignment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthraallfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ThraallFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 4:07:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1429.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What I like...........</span><hr size=1> o o o, i got a dislike just for rollen<br>

<br>
i like my guild<br>
<br>
i like TLC ~ no one is gonna KS you for loot just because they can and will out damage you<br>
<br>
i like most of the people i know / small population<br>
<br>
i like AE groups in Sebilis~<br>
<br>
i like the way most of the players uphold their convictions ~ whether i agree with them or not<br>
<br>
i like the smaller farmer population.  i don't see a fungi tunic for 25k flying across the market every 10 seconds.  <br>
<br>
i don't like low ambition ~ i'm one to level up and play the game.  RP or not why play to stay level 10?<br>
<br>
i don't like double standards ~ the person who denounces end game, heckles raiding, yet wants to reap the rewards by buying the &quot;uber&quot; items.  you want it? go get it. or at least TRY.<br>
<br>
i don't like ass kissers ~ don't pretend to be my friend just because you want clarity just ask for it please, i'll give it to you np ~ but spare the hi how ya doin and cut to the chase, much quicker and cuts down on chat spam ^_^(that's every server ~ but still FYI)<br>
<br>
I don't like drama, the soapbox, or the fact that most of it is generated, instigated, and carried on by the same handfull of names in this forum ~ trolling is lame, and most of the time the drama is egged on by people who had NOTHING to do with it.  GET A LIFE~<br>
<br>
I don't like the &quot;open raid community&quot; because from what i can tell, people run these open raids till they get what they wanted and suddenly *poof* they vanish from the open raid forums.  <br>
<br>
i don't like having a body in Sebilis while the login server is down leaving me nothing to do but read boards waiting for it to come back up =(<br>
<br>

<br>
Having played eq since it was unleashed on the population at large, I came to Vie to actually try my hand at RP, you know that stuff most of us did when we were LVL 1 back in '99 before we realized we were grossly out numbered and people were sort of looking at us funny.<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>
Likes: <br>
*I like the lack of OOC<br>
*I like the TLC for the most part it means you have to work on quests through out the &quot;lifetime&quot; of your avatar and not just do it in a weekend when you reach lvl 60. (exagerated but you get the idea)<br>
*I like those of my friends who like me stay true to their characters morals despite the May 8th changes. Meaning that just because they took away the lines that were drawn, they still don't cross them.<br>
*I like that I can wander around speaking Dark Elf and not care if some dwarf or wood elf can or can't understand me<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Dislikes:<br>
*I dislike that it is often hard to find someone to hunt with let alone a group?<br>
*I dislike idiots who play on vie like any other blue server and condemn the rest of us who stay in character.<br>
*I seriously dislike that the population has driven most of the evil only guilds to now accept Neutral classes/races.  While I can accept it was a choice to do this or have the guild die, I feel it is a further deterioration of the once clear lines between Light and dark races.  A druid is not neutral, a High elf cleric is not neutral.  I mean unless these people want to trash their homeland factions and be able to meet me for a light supper in Neriak, I can not accept them as evil. Oppositely I have no intention of meeting them in say..Felwithe for a shopping trip.<br>
*I dislike !!!!!(this means Thrall mostly) Being refered to as an &quot;inky&quot;Call us drow, call us dark elves, call us Teir'dal, but i loathe this terminology in referance to the dark elf race.<br>

<br>
1)  Empty server.  I can actually hunt freely and often get a few mobs I desire.<br>
2)  TLC.  I love it.  The challenge of HAVING to kill a mob while it is still a danger to you to complete quests, to have to plan in advance.  On blue servers, you find most people completing quests when the mobs are green and easy.  I'm currently completing my iceforged shackles quest at level 40 ... the danger is there .. so is the thrill of victory.<br>
3)  Starting untwinked.  Characters have earnt all gear.  No random people handing out 'junk' drops from level 50 mobs.   I feel proud of my Gatorscale leggings, my sentry gaunts, my crystal belt .. all earnt.  My Saryrn Ranger has very nice gear, I do not feel proud about any item but the 'ice forged shackles' he has (soloed at 51).<br>
4)  My guild.  Started in a small guild that raids once a week and has fun doing it.  We are able to chose a destination and we normally find it uncamped.  We raid locations way above our level and have a lot of fun doing so.  This cannot be done anywhere else.<br>
5)  Roleplay.  I sometimes roleplay when I get into a pickup group.<br>
6)  A lack of annoying tells to my druid for ports (well, in comparison to Saryrn anyhow).<br>
7)  I have made a few good friends on the server.  Nice people, some are even roleplayers! (To Roleplay police - God forbid they know someone called 'Baldisking' who does not use 'thees' or 'thous' - ban them now, and me for that matter!).<br>
<br>
Dislike:<br>
<br>
1) Lack of groups.<br>
2) Lack of common sense in many players.  Often an ability to run to zone at the sight of ..... 2 mobs being pulled to a group of 6 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   'BraveSirRobin' should be many peoples surnames on this server.  A guildy has once asked jokingly if the Ranger in his group who ran on the sight of ..... ONE gnoll! ... was roleplaying a coward.<br>
3) Roleplay Police.  Sorry, I dont use thees and thous.  you dont like it. Well, do not presume to announce across /shout and other mediums that I should obey your way of playing.  /shout can be ignored by yourself (I rarely use it anyhow).  Basically get a life and play your own game and do not interfere with mine. I do roleplay and in many ways better than yourselves. I have 2 characters both with follical impediments and their own traits.  This is a roleplay 'Preferred Server' anyhow and also where in gods name does it state 'use olde english'?. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1429.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1429.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1429.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1429.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1429.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1429.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1429.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
