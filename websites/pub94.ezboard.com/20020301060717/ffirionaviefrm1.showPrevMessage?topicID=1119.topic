Before I bring up the main point I would like to say I love eq, have enjoyed playing it for well over 4000 hours. I think the VI staff do well.<br>
<br>
To the point, one of the big problems for me in EQ is individuality.<br>
<br>
Lets take 10 lvl 50 wizards. How much do they vary in power, and what they can do? Probably nothing. The variety comes only from the wet wear in their heads.<br>
<br>
It is frustrating that the spell experience for all enchanters is the same, all wizards go through the ice commet age, the lure age etc etc. Its all the same. Appart from how you play your char all characters of a casting class are basicaly equivalent.<br>
<br>
Now of course there is specialization but this does so little . . .<br>
<br>
My first thought was at least this is not true for melee characters, but of course it is. You cannot specialize in a weapon type, there are different fashion statements you can make but in the end most warriors are similar to most other warriors for example.<br>
<br>
Hell a halfling warrior is almost identical in function to a ogre warrior (ignoring slam without shield). There is not even any choice to be a defensive or offensive tank.<br>
<br>
About the only class that has difference is monks. You can choose that nice 10 pound 2hb <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and forgoe alot of ya armor but even that is not a massive difference.<br>
<br>
It would be so wonderful if a wizard could focus on a spell line or type of magic, if a mage could pick a type of pet to be good at, if a warrior could pick a skill and improve in it dramaticaly.<br>
<br>
Oh well idle thoughts. Oh darn, I wonder how much the post 50 specialize options change this argument. Have not gone back to any servers where I am post 50 since fv came out.<br>
<br>
Oh well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just a thought<br>

For instance, what if a druid had to choose between improved SOW and Porting?  I think most would choose SOW, but I don't know.<br>
<br>
Maybe a better example is Wizards choosing between Ports or better Nukes..<br>
<br>
I don't have Luclin - but I think the whole alternate advancement thing is tring to hit on the idea.  It's a good idea.<br>

I also like the alternate advancement, but I think it doesn't matter too much later on.<br>
<br>
I'd like it if spell schools branched off in neat ways.  If you started down a path and then you were stuck that way.  2 or 3 wizards may stand side by side and be totally different, have different ways of fighting, etc.<br>
<br>
I wish that there were more to becoming a melee too.  I don't think it's very fair that with a little practice a warrior can fight just as well with a piercer as a rogue, who has been using the piercing weapons his whole life.  I think that they should change the way weapon advancement works, so that you can get really high in one weapon but never really high in all weapons.  In that you could learn all weapons equally but you would never be as good with a 2hs as the one that has used that all his life.  In that if you specialize with a 2hs then it becomes nearly (or just) impossible to learn a 1hb more than what you did earlier in life. <p><center><font size=+2><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bmaidensfancy">Shiden Kaidan</a></font>

<br>
I totally agree.  In EQ, there is very little individuality that distinguishes people of the same class or race. <br>
<br>
In fact there is proof that Verant acknowledges this!! <br>
<br>
Look at Shadows of Luclin. They added abilities for higher level (post 50) characters.... this provides a small amount of individuality, as it amounts to some kind of specializations.  <br>
<br>
IMHO..... not enough. And also, why didn't they do this in the first place with characters from the very start at the low levels?  Don't they realize that post-50 characters are a small fraction of their player base? <br>

<br>
Well, this is the role playing server, right?  The how you play your character part can be as big a difference as you want it to be.  Develop a fondness for a certain type of spell, and try to stick to it, even if you aren't always using your best one.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is not even any choice to be a defensive or offensive tank.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure there is!  Be one of the few warriors that use a shield, instead of dual wielding.  Another choice between offensive and defensive tank would be a shadow knight and a paladin, right?  I haven't researched them much, but do the new alternate advancement options give you any choices for customization like this?<br>
<br>
That said, I completely understand your point.  I just hate to walk away with the feeling that someone was underplaying the power that acting their character could lend to being distinctive.  ^_^  If I didn't say anything worthwhile in here, just ignore me! <p>Titaisia<BR>

My advice, if you're looking for customization, is MUDs (*cough* Against the Grain is looking for test players *sneeze*). Even then, some MUD codes are limited, but some allow you to get pretty well customized with levels, such as SW Reality. You just need to find your niche. I like MUDs because it's easier to play a character on them, immortals (imms for short...consider them to be the GMs of the game) actually do provide support and so on. If you're looking for a tight-knit community, play on a MUD. If you're looking for pure roleplaying, MUDs and MUSHs are your best bets, too.  <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

<br>
UO has/had many choices..... problem is some are so much more powerful then others you lose out in game if you dont follow the several power paths.<br>
<br>
Now with more amd more games being thought up and possibly becoming fact, this could change.  But just look at the screams of complaint with only ... what 14 classes. Everyone thinks they got slighted in someway and some other class is better.<br>
<br>
In a game that lives or dies by the money it pulls in (meaning attracting people) few will risk going to far astray from what is known to work.  I would say EQ learned from UO to limit class choices.<br>
<br>
Even with just 14 classes you still see the rants about this class is the best, this is the worst. When you depend on others to group with you dont want to many unknowns (or so the process goes in the minds of the money men and the dimbulbs that let prejuidice rule their lives)<br>

On Lake Superior, I was the guild treasure hunter. The guild was one of the more powerful anti guilds, House al Nasir (HaN), but everyone knew I was available to locate buried treasure for anyone as long as they cut me in for a share. I was highly specialized and extremely individual but I made people lots of gold and magic items. I was dead meat if even one mob from a level 2 chest got hold of me, but the rest of the group knew that and I had ways of making sure they didn't get me. I treasure hunted for some of the best pk's on the shard and when I quit, I had millions of gold, a couple of houses, and tons of good magic loot (I lost count how many silver heavy xbows vanquishing I had). My point is, as Alpha Khan (my treasure hunter) I could not pvp or pvm at all, but I had a blast and did quite well. That kind of choice just does not exist in EQ and I miss it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 12:22:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1122.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The good, the bad, and UO</span><hr size=1> They pass Everquest off as a game where you can take a trade skills and make a living from it, but you would get bored within minutes of trying to do this, you can only hawke banded so long before you get bored...<br>
<br>
Other than player indivuality, I would like to see Skill individuality (and not cultural armor).  I would like the skills to be a lot more varied so that someone might discovver how to make an item that others would never be able to do.  Doesn't Horizons plan on having something like this?  <br>
<br>
As it is now, we all start off with a template, get to 60 and become a higher level template but that's all everyone is, just a template, some might do a bit more damage, but others might have more defense, other than that, everyone in a class is playing a clone of someone else.<br>
<br>
From my point of view , Everquest doesn't even have room for changing this... to add more skills and such would just imbalance the game... there are no npc's asking you to make items for them, there are no dynamic quest to yeild items that no one else has (except the ubers), there are no difference whatsoever in skills, so really no way that they could implement individuality short of completely revamping the skills and making it so that only hardcore people could actually master one and that all masters would be different, like some in armor, common weapons or magic items... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwyntercrystalbow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wynter Crystalbow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 4:34:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1122.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmm...</span><hr size=1> Well, I suppose I have to agree.  The only way to be individual in EQ is a player's play style.  Any enchanter can tell you that if they've made it past 20.  Though I've noticed some of the newer games trying to implement it.  DAoC seems from what I've seen of it a skill system, though I don't know of any general utility skills so if you don't max a skill out you pretty much get screwed later on.  Shadowbane has been in development for years and with it's large number of class/discipline combinations it seems to follow a pseudo EQ/pseudo UO line.  However balancing is going to be a pain in the rear.  It's why EQ is the way it is.  EQ was developed so that one class or another was any more powerful than another in theory, that even if you made a bad choice you could correct it.

Developing (and ruining) factions is a big part of defining my character, for me at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umoandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moandor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 7:25:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1122.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmm...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> One thing that EverQuest has that the other graphical MMORPGs lack is the faction system.

Same for me. I love the EQ faction idea. It's not perfect, but it's better than playing a game that has ZERO concept of faction whatsoever. <br>
<br>
I think that the worst thing with faction in EQ is that Verant got really lazy with a lot of faction related quests.... many of them are either broken, or they don't make sense whatsoever.<br>
<br>
If Verant only cleaned up their act and fixed a LOT of these broken faction related quests, then the EQ faction system would actually be something that enhances the game as well as enhances role playing. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that's not the case  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
