I would like some input on where to group and solo (more important than grouping as I have never been greedy and my 200pp in the bank shows it)<br>
<br>
I have some decent gear, I can get my INT up 210, and by trading out INT ltems for CHA items I can get my CHA up to 230.<br>
So should I be concentrating on Charm soloing? <br>
Is it worth it for EXP?<br>
How do we make money? ( I share my comp. with my wife so trader mode is not a option, if I can use the comp. I would rather be playing)<br>
<br>
I feel that I am at that point where I can't really get into the good dungeons with the good drops all the time, yet the more open areas to hunt DSP and OT I just keep the clarity on the casters and haste on the melees and sit and handle the few adds here and there (sometimes I wish for the big pull mistake<br>
so I can get some crowd control action, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. I love being a Enchanter, it works well for me IG most the time while leveling and is great for my RP self, so I am not going to <br>
re-roll ever but could use some serious advice especially in the soloing department.<br>
<br>
(Oh and like I said I have no plat, and no J-boots, so soloing in<br>
really far from zone line areas is not a good idea yet. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>

If you get really lucky, you might be able to do so while camping Stormfeather.  SoW potions sell for 70-80pp in the Bazaar for 10 Doses.  They might seem expensive, but it is really worth it.  <br>
<br>
If you want money, you might want to duo with a druid, ranger, necro, or shadowknight who can snare in some way and fear kite some hill giants in Rathe.  You might barely be able to charm kite them solo, but it would be very very risky.  <br>
<br>
You could do the same with the giant camp in Firiona Vie.  Three Giants, fast spawn, can drop an item which sells for 200+ pp.  Drops items worth 10-60pp a bit more often.  No wanderers if you camp on the hill behind them.  Very good xp at 36.  I would duo with a druid and just root rot them (I was there to tash, slow, dot, and root.  If I had extra mana, I would nuke)  Or you can charm them and have them beat each other up.<br>
<br>
Or there are the Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes.  This is where I learned to charm kite solo.  Start with the ones between the prison and the ocean (hunters and warriors) and eventually more onto the Man o Wars to the south of the entrance to Kael.  The Man o Wars are good xp into your 50's (they are still blue to me, but were blue to me at 40 as well), but are less common (I did have 6 spawn on me at once though).  Xp is wonderful solo, you can sell the Ulthork hide items for 10 or so pp in the bazaar, you can get level 39 spells to drop off them(very rare), and you can get Ulthork tusks which you can turn into the Othmirs in Cobalt Scar for very good gems.  I got three diamonds, one blue diamond, and a black sapphire this way.  <br>
<br>
Just a few options. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/Oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Koada'dal Illusionist of the 53rd Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iumunorn>IumunoRN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/1/03 4:29:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters help needed.</span><hr size=1> As a general rule, grouping is generally more fun than soloing... except when you're a slow and buff slave in places like OT and dreadlands (or the planes for that matter really). <br>
<br>
I would bite the bullet and spend some cash on sow potions, and try to get the hang of playing with charm. I know you said you had very little cash, but they are going to pay for themselves really fast.<br>
<br>
The basics of soloing with charm, or duoing or just plain using it is to avoid getting hit. Sow is the first start and knowing that you have it you should never stay in a situation where you get hit for a long time. <br>
<br>
Also hotkey the following commands: /pet attack, /pet back off, /pet guard here, /pet follow me.<br>
<br>
To keep a charmed pet, tash it first from a long range, run while the spell recycle (2 seconds or so), stop, do a half turn on yourself so the server register that you have stopped and cast charm from the maximum casting range.<br>
<br>
Now at this point your pet is going toward you. You need a /pet guard here hotkey to make sure that you can get the pet to stop where you want him to be, and try to keep a distance between him and you. If charm break, run a bit to put distance between him and you, and recharm from far. It's very important to never intentionally get hit, because you will get hit unintentionally often enough as it is. <br>
<br>
Now pull another monster, send your pet in and make sure you do 1 point of damage to get the full experience - you get 100% of the xp if you do at least 1 pt of damage, and 25% if you do no damage. A blue ceramic band (pottery made) can cast the level 1 DD, and it can save you a spell slot.<br>
<br>
Now you do want your pet to win, so in order to do that either get a stronger pet than the mob you're trying to kill, or use an attack slow spell to reduce it's damage output.<br>
<br>
It's very very important to keep the other mob rooted at all time, so that when charm break (it will), you only have your ex pet to deal with.<br>
<br>
Keep your pet targetted at all time, or save it as a target using &lt;tab&gt;. This way you can react quickly in a case of a charm break.<br>
<br>
Always stay far away as much as possible. Always be in a position where you can recover safely from a charm break.<br>
<br>
At your level the spell beguile should be enough to recharm from far, but later on the new charm spells will take longer to cast and you may want to use the level 4 mesmerise spell (short mez) before re-charming. You lose a few seconds, but it's very safe.<br>
<br>
All of this is much safer and faster with a snaring druid or ranger partner. A snared pet isn't too dangerous and re charming is pretty easy. Another enchanter isn't bad either to mesmerise (level 4 spell) in case of a charm break, and he can add a charmed pet as well.<br>
<br>
Once again did I mention that you should stay far from your pet as much as possible? If things look dicey just run and take the time it takes to get control of the situation again.<br>
<br>
I may repeat myself, but the basics of soloing with charm is to use distance and run speed advantage to minimize the risk. As you get more experienced at managing that risk, you can start hasting your pets for faster kills. <br>
<br>
Things you may look into when you have the funds: spell haste 2 item, mana preservation 2 item if you don't have them already.<br>

<br>
Just a few additions to that, I always keep one of the Berserker Strength line loaded and cast on me.  It is basically a reagent free mini rune for what I use it for.  The recast is long so you can't rely on it for more than one or two hits (the one I use now only can absorb 200hp worth of damage), but that is one or two hits you don't have to your base hp.  Rune itself is for the rich. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also, an extended range focus item would be great for you as well.  It means you can be even farther away as you cast on your pet and target.<br>
<br>
Last, in a hilly or mountainous place, you'll want to stay levitated.  When running to evade your ex-pet as you try to gain enough room to recharm it, you often won't be taking the safe route anywhere. <br>
<br>

<br>
Also among the possible partners - how could I forget a cleric.<br>
<br>
the cleric can stun your pet (and grab aggro at the same time), allowing you to recharm. They can also heal your pet if you have a good one that is hard to replace - or if you want to save on charm and haste mana. You can also do a few interesting things with a cleric partner as charmed pets have a lot of hit points... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
One other quick question I have noticed that many classes get quest at lower levels for a item similar to what their epic will be, warriors swords, necros a scyth, rangers bows, wizards get a staff, those kind of things, but I have not yet been able to find a quest for a enchanter 1HB in my level range, is there one? or do I have to rely on the bazaar or higher level dungeon drops until I am old enough to start my epic? It seems that for our epic being 1HB there is not many items we can use that have any good stats until then. Why are we so limited with this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oligith>Oligith</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/untitled.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elf of Many Faces</span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/2/03 2:22:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/10869.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters help needed.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=43" target="top">Incandescent Wand.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

(I am joking of course)<br>
<br>
I rely basicly on my spells and my pets to do damage.  Though the free Color Shift can be rather useful when chain stunning as you wait for your stuns to pop up.  <br>
<br>
The Incandescant Mask, however, is a quest I recommend.

Those are some decent mid level quests, they are a bit dated and perhaps you could get better things from the Bazaar, but  they're from the same quest set as the items you were talking about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rebellemorte>Rebelle Morte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/11/03 10:41:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters help needed.</span><hr size=1> Thanks everyone, I hit 38 last night, and am getting ready to do the tash quest, it is pretty easy, I already have half the coins and with the illusion nerf I don't have to worry about my freeport faction I hope, I haven't checked it out yet, but before even in Human form I was kos there, to many attacks on the guards I guess. As if I wasn't leary of doing crazy Charm Kiting before I really am now, and with the exp nerf for pets, I think I will get faster exp grouping, which makes me mad i was looking forward to learning the art of charm kiting, nice rewards with high risk, but I tried playing with it in CB the other night charming Dvinn and he broke Beguile real easy and dang near got me killed by pulling CB on me hehehe.<br>
I need to experiment some more with it and adjust to the new way, but I have a few new places that I have scouted that will be good exp solo wise, thanks for the advice adn keep it coming if you want, I am always interested in learning more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=trump13>Trump13</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/11/03 12:11:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Enchanters help needed.</span><hr size=1> First thing you need to learn about charming... get an idea for how resistant things are, and only charm the less resistant things unless absolutely necessary.<br>
<br>
Dvinn is more resistant than most I think hehe.<br>
<br>
I'd still recommend learning how to do it since it becomes VERY important to know how charm works.  And the only way you can really figure it out is to charm lots of things (both in groups and soloing).<br>

I forgot to collaborate with her and handed in the coin only to get a nasty message back from her and nothing else the first time.  Illusion: Erudite and Benevolance should be enough though.<br>

Charm is for damage, and used to also be for tanking, though it's no longer possible in groups of 4+ individuals.<br>
