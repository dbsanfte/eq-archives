Most people are just tired of the topic.  So am I, a little, but you are right, it is a good observation and a valid question.<br><br>The only guild I know of that states right out that RP is optional is Fire and Fury.  Perhaps others do also, I'm not sure.  Well, god forbid this should turn into another F&amp;F thread.  But they are basicly good people, as has been my observation anyway, and aren't out to ruin anyone's good time.  They are power-gamers, sure, but don't lord it over anyone.  And it's always been my feeling that if it bothers you, while you are RPing slaying orcs in Crushbone, that someone else is off in the Plane of Hate power-gaming, then it is probably the little power-gamer in you piping up to make you care.  Why else would it matter?<br><br>My opinion on this has always been reduced to RP vs. Atmosphere.  I can't and won't try to make them RP.  I'll never pidgeon-hole Bako into a corner and say &quot;So, when in your lizard childhood did you first becide to become a monk?&quot; but I know he'll never directly interfere with my rp either by under-mining the world atmosphere for me.  He doesn't say &quot;dood, woot, and phat lewt&quot; constantly, none of them do that I've seen, and whatever may go over their guild channel is certainly no concern of mine.<br><br>If you want an RP guild consider either the 1st Fist of Light or Clan Werre, which spun off the 1st Fist.  They are the most serious, consistent RPers that I know of.  But please, for the sake of harmony around the server, don't become one of those people who gets all bothered if someone, somewhere, on the other side of Norath doesn't know their character's mother's maiden name.  They are staying out of our way (sometimes I wonder if I am even one of the RPers anymore, try it consistently before you complain about them, because EQ still isn't the best venue for consistent RP) so the least we can do is stay out of theirs.<br><br>Valquiss Silverpalm <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A> at: 12/16/01 1:42:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usliver123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/01 10:20:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=173.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: No Quarter</span><hr size=1> As for us hogging all the post 50 camps, buddy, lets work something out when you get post 50, ok? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uasotus007.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asotus007</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/17/01 2:44:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=173.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No Quarter</span><hr size=1> I would guess less competition. It is not like &lt;insert FV powergamer here&gt; could go to an older existing server and 'get in on' any of the high end game as mobs like Tormax, Dain, VP, ST, North Temple Veeshan are killed instantaneously upon spawn. So EVERY new server presents itself as an opportunity for the 'new kids on the block' with tons o play time to have a shot at it if you will. RP Server or no, this is a characteristic of ALL servers. I know on my home server there are easily 300+ 60th level characters now ( 2+ year old server ) and the one or two guilds that do all the high end encounters, well, we simply don't recruit anymore more or less. Is that a hospitable environment for an aspiring 'uber' ? Knowing they will NEVER have a chance to release Kerrafym or fight Vulakk ? Of course not. So you simply move to the next open server. In this case it just so happened to be the role play server. I seriously doubt whether it was RP or not had anything to do with that decision, just simple timing. hardly anything to rant about IMO. We all have different reasons for coming to FV ( an EQ vacation-land of quests etc. for me ) and all pay our $10 so live and let live I say.<br><br>One side note : Some encounters, especially NToV,will in all likelyhood require a LOT of cross guild cooperation to overcome as I have noticed the relative guild sizes to be small. Ample opportunity for community...... or player Hijacking/recruitment among the higher end guilds ( guard your clerics &amp; enchanters from free-agency ! ). Will be interesting to see how the 'power' guilds work these issues out.

Any time there's a raid, there's a level of pride involved in killing the boss mob.  It might be Trak, or it might be Lady Vox, or any one of the many multigroup raid zones.  It carries over to solo play.  Sure, you can bash high-end guilds, but in the end you get a feeling of accomplishment and pride in your achievement when you complete your ghoulbane quest or finally complete your Tarton's Staff, or get the staff of Temperate Flux or Testament of Vaneer or finally whack Emperor Crush and loot the DRT.

I cancelled my accounts almost a year ago and am coming back.  RP is fun for me, but secondary.  I RP'd one of my previous characters every single moment I played him.  I think this might have been both a bit amusing and sometimes irksome to my guildmates, but the only flak I got from it was done in RP, too (from people that never RP'd).  So, I think they mostly liked it.  I know I did.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I like low populations; knowing everyone makes for a great comunity feel on a sever.  I like that I keep meeting real bona-fide EQ newbies here.  I like that &quot;uber twink&quot; here means &quot;full banded&quot;.

Play of the game itself is fun and I've got enough munchkin in me to like optimizing my character (items, xp gain, etc.).  That's powergaming, but it has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not I also RP; they're completely orthogonal.  That RP-char I had, for instance, was a warrior -- 51 in 17 days all by grouping with other skilled players, no xp-twinking.  Being a skilled player has nothing to do with whether you RP or not.<br><br>Actually, IMHO, being a skilled player is the top criteria on whether or not you are fun to have around.  RP is lots of fun, but it's icing, not cake.  You have to be a truly amazing personality for people to like you even when you keep getting them killed.  BTW, I knew a guy like that.  He was so much fun to have around you (almost) didn't mind the xp loss.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/27/01 11:30:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=173.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I'm here ..</span><hr size=1> Hail<br><br>As a random aside, I would like to indicate a certain viewpoint I have when it comes to RP and fighting in our fantasy setting of Norrath.<br><br>We are all adventures, soldiers, mercenaries, or what have you.  For one reason or another, we all portray characters who go out and kill things, putting our own lives on the line to do it.  That's serious stuff and often does not allow time for long expository speaches!  Simply because people step into shorthand and stop talking about their long lost cousin who holds the answer to some mystery in their past does not mean people aren't role-playing anymore, if they happen to be at a dangerous camp or in the middle of a dungeon.  It's only bloody natural, in RL or otherwise.<br><br>I am not a major fan of game appreviations, and I've never said &quot;woot&quot; and likely never will in my entire career as my current character.  But shorthand is reasonable in a battle, even annoying stuff like &quot;woot&quot; and, if appropriate to a character's vocab, &quot;wtf.&quot;  Well, it can't really be pronounced, but other than that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   In fact, people who are fighting often could easily find battlefield slang slipping into more relaxed conversation.  My example to prove this is Vietnam.  More bloody shorthand was invented by soldiers in that environment....  Partially convenience, I think, partially long exposure to strange situations for which they didn't have words for before, and partially out of a desire to distinguish Us from Them on any basis available.  I don't know, I'm not an expert.<br><br>Point is, catch me in a city and I'll be happy to role-play in detail, assuming I have the time.  Catch me fighting in a group and my RP is reduced to a few key emotes, some catch phrases, and a general attitude.  Why?  Because it's natural.  And anyone who wants to tell me I'm not a role-player can line up right now and throw the first stone.<br><br>Valquiss Silverpalm<br><br>P.S. The nice thing about this attitude is it makes it far easier to tolerate people who never role-play in a group, because I can always imagine that in safer situations they would.  And if I never see them outside of a dungeon, who's to know? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=173.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=173.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=173.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=173.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=173.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=173.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=173.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
