While the rhetoric is designed to be inflammatory, and the case frivolous, and even the need to put warning labels seemingly ludicrous, I have been witness to people's absolute loss of reason while playing EQ.  I have played stretches that have undoubtedly been longer than normal, been a part of the high end game, with all its high and lows, and been through the everquest emotional spectrum, and found an emotional balance.  <br>
<br>
Yet, to this day, I still see daily outbursts in game that make me wonder about the people behind the toons.  I compare it to road rage, instances where normally rational people lose control of their emotions, and break the codes of conduct that have been culturally established to promote civil behavior between citizens.  In my book, those with a predisposition to lose control of themselves in RL, will do the same in VR, they have a weakness in character that will surface in whatever community they are a part of.  Dysfunctional people exist, and while EQ may enhance, or provide an environment with fewer repercussions for inappropriate behaviour, which further fuels their break from normalcy, I strongly feel that some people have a predisposition for addiction, and it will take root in any number of activities they engage in, and to make Sony put labels on their products will unfairly cast their product in a negative manner.  Personal Responsibility needs to be taken, and while I respect some people's needs to grieve and blame others when dealing with something as tragic as suicide, knee jerk reactions and petty lawsuits only demean the premise of free will, and the right to freely make choices in our life.  I pity the family of the deceased, I recognize how EQ provide an negative outlet for a troubled man, and how EQ can become all consuming, but others should be free to choose what entertainments they want without the taint and prejudicial connotations warning labels would illicit.<br>

<br>
Putting a warning label on a video game does not &quot;demean the premise of free will.&quot;  In fact, it has no bearing on free will whatsoever.  Any individual still has just as much of a right to purchase that game as he did before the label.  There have been warning labels on records for some time now, and on movies for a long long time.  I doubt they have affected anyone's free will.<br>
<br>
The sentiment here, though understandable, misses an important aspect of the law in cases like this.  The law does not look to whether or not someone had problems, or someone was &quot;not normal,&quot; or someone is predisposed to addiction -- in negligence cases, it is an objective standard, not subjective.  The only question to be answered is whether SONY knew or should have known that a reasonable person would have reacted the way this kid did.  And the answer to that, I think we would all agree, is NO.<br>
<br>
As for the labels, such a requirement would likely come from the legislative branch, not the judiciary (in the form of injunctive relief).  Without a doubt, such labels would NOT be limited to EQ -- they would apply across the board to any video game that could conceivably involve hours and hours of game play.  So don't worry kids, your EQ would be safe from the &quot;stigma&quot; of a warning label -- it would be commonplace on all video games, just like movies.<br>
<br>
In all honesty, it surprised me greatly that anyone would take this woman's case, especially given the fact that the causal chain may have been broken by several intervening causes.  However, it did not surprise me to discover that the sap who took the case is from Miami.<br>

<br>
To further this debate with Anowin, I would ask, is not the addiction of EQ a forseeable consequence?  I wager verant has the stats of the average number of hours of game play per player, and what percent of people play more than 40 hrs a week.  Is it not forseeable that some people may get in to deep, and as such they have a responsibility to protect the consumer to some extent?  I know this is a reversal from my previous position, but Anowin got me in the spirit of the debate.<br>
<br>
As I understand negilgence, the plaintiff alleges the defendent failed to exercise due care towards persons who could reasonably be forseen to be affected by the conduct.  Can we honestly say that Sony is unaware how much people play EQ, and that for some it becomes a way of life?  Off the top of my head, I also believe that the plaintiff has to show a duty owed, that there has been a breach of that duty and that the resultant injury is due to that breach of duty.  To break it down...did verant have a duty to the deceased?, do they breach that duty by not explaining the addictive nature of EQ, and was the mans suicide a result of his addicition to EQ.<br>
<br>
In some ways, I think a jury might be swayed by the emotional arguments, and a loose legal argument can be made that might make Sony blink and settle.  That Sony knows people become addicted to EQ is without question.  The game is designed to take hours of your time, and they have the statistics and polls to determine what keeps us coming back for more.  The hardest part they will have is to make the case that EQ lead him to suicide, and not some other outside factors.  But if, EQ can be made to be a major contributing factor, things might get interesting, and with today's current witchhunts for video games, and the twisted effects of the media on our psyche's, I would be somewhat worried if I was Sony.<br>

The elements of a cause of action for negligence (which is a function of state law, so it may vary from state to state) are as follows (disclaimer: this is not legal advice in any way, shape or form, or given to further the representation of any individual.  It is just information <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  :<br>
<br>
1.  Duty - the defendant must have a legal duty to prevent harm to the Plaintiff.  With no duty, there can be no negligence.  However, the law imposes upon manufacturers a duty to exercise reasonable care so that their products in the marketplace will not harm persons or property.  SONY clearly had a duty to this young man.<br>
<br>
2.  Breach - the defendant failed to comply with the duty.  The breach here would be a failure to properly warn players that the game could cause them harm.<br>
<br>
3.  Harm - the plaintiff was harmed by the breach.  The specific harm in this case would be death, by suicide.<br>
<br>
4.  Causation - here lies the rub.  There are two types of causation in negligence cases, &quot;but for&quot; causation and proximate causation.  &quot;But for&quot; or actual causation means that &quot;but for&quot; SONY's conduct in failing to warn, the harm would not have occurred.  Obviously there is a problem here, as it would be difficult if not impossible to prove that SONY was the cause of this man acutally taking his own life.  It would be different if the packaging on the box was defective, causing someone to get a cut and bleed to death...The second prong is where foreseeability comes in.  The plaintiff must also prove proximate cause - which is concerned with whether and to what extent the defendant's conduct foreseeably and substantially caused the specific injury that actually occurred.  Once again, there is a problem, as the &quot;specific injury&quot; is not the addiction Bara, the specific injury is the death.  So the question is not whether SONY should foresee or know that EQ is addictive, it is whether SONY knew or should have known that someone could take their own life over it.<br>
<br>
The last element is damages, which is clearly satisfied.  The point is that questions of causation and breach are left to the fact finder...the jury.  So Bara has a point...if certain persons were to find causation to be satisfied, it is quite possible that SONY may be justified in being concerned.  Taking Bara's argument further, do you think that the addiction itself is &quot;bad enough&quot; to be considered an injury standing alone?<br>
<br>

People have problems in RL. Each and everyday, we are faced with either reoccurring problems, or new problems, both of which can take its toll on a person. <br>
<br>
People need &quot;Escapes&quot; to help give themselves &quot;alone time&quot; so that they can collect their thoughts, or set aside their stress, so that that may be able to enjoy themselves for a short time.<br>
<br>
These &quot;Escapes&quot; can be 1 of a number of things. Having a few drinks. Going to the movies. Working out. Restoring old cars. Painting a picture. Playing Everquest.<br>
<br>
People know, that &quot;Escapes&quot; are just a temporary way to feel good until they can resolve their RL issues. Just like you need a break at work, at times, you need a break from life. Life is hard work. Trust me. I know how tough life can be. And I have needed many breaks. And without those breaks, I would have surely gone insane. Too much of anything can be overbearing, and push people to new emotions, and actions that are not normal for them.<br>

You are in control of your own life. No one holds a gun to your head and demands that you play Everquest. There is no pusher standing next to you, telling you &quot;Just one more hit, you will feel better, I promise you&quot;.<br>
<br>
You bought the game of your own free will. You subscribed to the game at your own free will. Everquest was placed (Alphabetically in most places) among a vast number of other computer software titles. So its not like anyone forced it upon you to pick that game up and take it home. Nope. You did all that on your own.<br>
<br>
If problems arise because you play too much Everquest (or any other game for that matter) its your own damn fault. <br>
<br>
On a different note, people can become attached to their characters, or to other people who play the game. Critics say that, that kind of attachment is not healthy. Hmm. I know a lot of people who are attached to their cars, a comic book collection, sports trading card collections, autographed photos or a teddy bear they got when they were 3 years old. <br>
<br>
We attach ourselves, to things that mean something to us. Our characters that we play, have real time invested in them. And through those characters, we have forged friendships, some that stay in the realm of Everquest, and others that move into real life. I myself have both of those. <br>
<br>
Can we become too attached? Sure. But it's up to you to recognize that, and to rectify that problem before it gets too far out of control. When people start depending on their characters, for all of lifes needs, then sure, it has gone too far. But I myself have yet to run into anyone who relies entirely on Everquest to fulfill all areas of their life. <br>
<br>
Out of the 400,000+ who play this game, they found 1 of the 50 people who struggle with determining Everquest from Real Life. <br>
<br>
I am sorry he felt the need to take his own life.<br>
I am sorry his family lost a loved one.<br>
<br>
Did Everquest play a role in his death? No. His state of mind was already on the brink before he started playing Everquest. <br>
<br>
I could go on for days about this kind of thing. But the bottom line is that nothing, in this world, is to blame for the course your life takes, except yourself.<br>
<br>
You control yourself, and all your actions and emotions. Take responsibility for your actions.<br>
<br>
Don't blame others.<br>

While obviously not a perfect analogy, if we were to compare smoking, and its addictive aspects we might be able to extend that line of reasoning.  The &quot;addiction&quot; to smoking is not in and of itself the killer, it is the side effects that ensue from that addiction that create problems.  Trying to create this cause and effect spin might be damaging to some extent.  The way in which we frame the concept of &quot;addiction&quot; and its role in the casuation of a &quot;specific injury&quot; would be for me, the crux of the plaintiff's argument, and the grounds by which Sony could be viewed negilgent in its duty to product the consumer.<br>
<br>
I look forward to the next round ).  I ain't no stinkin lawyer so I may have a simpler view of how the law works, but the way in which the the terminology is established must have some bearing on all this.<br>

You bought the cigarettes of your own free will.  You went to the convenience store at your own Free Will.  Your brand of choice was placed (Alphabetically in most places) among a vast number of other cigarette brands.  So it's not like anyone forced it upon you to pick up that cigarette and smoke it.  Nope.  You did all that on your own.<br>
<br>
Same arguement stands, cigarette companies (admittedly evil) are getting ravaged by law suits.<br>
<br>
I don't think the case has any merit.  However, just because something is legal and you don't *have* to buy it doesn't mean it isn't harmful.  And if you are the maker of the item in question, you better have your ducks in a row, because the second someone burns themselves on a hot iron and feels like it, the jackals will come running.<br>

They hid the results. The knew they were addictive. They not only hid the results, they made them even more addictive.<br>
<br>
Cigarette companies now know their products are harmful. They now know they are addictive. They said they did not know this &quot;back when&quot;. But, of course they did.  They were caught lying, and are being made to pay for it.<br>
<br>
The question is, did/do Sony know EQ is harmful ? Did/do they purposefully manufacture (code), package and sell EQ so that it's addictive ? (As opposed to just marketing their product).<br>
