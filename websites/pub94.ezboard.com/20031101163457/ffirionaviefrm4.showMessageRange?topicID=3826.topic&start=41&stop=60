Did it come out that it is EXPECTED from a cleric to rez left and right? This is not what I had I had in mind. But you already commented on what I intended to say:<br>

Yes, I have gone with groups/raids with my friends and sometimes with people I don't like so much to unlock doors for them because I wasn't busy and they couldn't find anyone else to help them.

<br>
There are valid points on both sides of this argument.  Here’s my take on this…<br>
<br>
If you are going to play role reversal (i.e., a “good” race/class playing “evil” or vice versa), you should consider this carefully <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>before</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you roll that character.  My point being that it’s not sufficient to just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>say</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> your dark character is good (or lighty is evil) and make up a good story as to why.  You’re going to have to prove it IG and that’s gonna mean a whole heckuva lot of faction work.  Furthermore, I don’t see how a player can expect to accomplish this if he/she selects a character that worships an evil (or good) deity.  It seems to me that one would have to select a character that can be agnostic.  This, then, would open the door to the possibility that you could at least RP a “conversion” to a contra religion.<br>
<br>
From Caemus’ perspective, if you are KOS in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>any</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> good city or zone, he’s gonna assume that there’s a good reason and that your character is evil.  In a high fantasy setting, roughly equivalent to medieval times, where good and evil are starkly contrasted and clearly manifested in the various races and classes and where superstition and suspicion run high, there is going to be a very high prejudice between races/classes.  Is it racist?  You betcha!  That’s obviously the social setting SOE intended.  So, Caemus is going to be extremely wary of any “dark” race/class and will probably refuse aid and association unless there is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>very</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> good reason to do otherwise.  But I would stop short of saying he would never do it.<br>
<br>
Is it impossible to do this?  I would guess no (though, I don’t really know because I’ve never tried it).  But I would also guess that it would be very very difficult to pull off in a convincing fashion.<br>
<br>

You said you went -with- groups or raids to unlock doors.  A cleric is frequently not invited to the groups of those who are demanding (or even politely requesting) his rezzing abiltiy.  In fact a cleric will sometimes be asked to travel across several zones, usually unescourted, to get to the place the person died and not to a corpse neatly dragged to a zoneline but out there somewhere.  The better equivalent for a rogue would be asked to go to the location of a raid/group to Sebilis (on your own without any help), unlock the door to the crypt, not participate in the actual battle with any intent of getting XP but do use your backstabbing and poisoning (the best rogue equiv of a cleric being demanded to go OOM to buff the entire party while still not being asked to join as a member), and then find your own way out when they are done with your lockpicking.<br>
<br>
NO ONE should be required or requested to drop their RP for anyone  else's benefit.  This game does not revolve around one person (the one demanding the rez to avoid a death penalty for doing something to get himself dead).  The other characters are played by people who are also playing their game.<br>
<br>
I am not required to track something for someone just because I am a ranger and rangers track well and that person needs to find his epic or quest somebody or see if a target is up.<br>
<br>
A wizard is not required to port or TL anyone just because she is able to do so.<br>
<br>
An enchanter is not required to cast KEI (or any other buff).<br>
<br>
and so on.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sajuiil>Sajuiil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/10/03 11:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3826.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hm</span><hr size=1> Are you even reading my posts?

You can play out the RP of good vs. evil all you want, make fun/RP harass in shouts, says, etc, you can mutilate their corpse and point fingers at the nakid toon, and then in tells let the poor sap that died know: &quot;Sure, I'll rez ya, but this is strictly ooc, no hard feelings.&quot; Again, NOONE is forced to do this, but it sure would be a lot more fun then basically saying F U and leave. There is always a choice of how you RP, including bending the rules a bit to make the game more entertaining.<br>

I do not play my Dark Elf evil, more neutral. That is the way I chose to play. Do I get flack for playing that way? Yep, I sure do. Do I put up with it? Yes, because that is the way other people play as well. They don't want to try to understand why,how or whatever. &quot;How did you lose your hate,&quot; is the biggest line I have heard. Sometimes instead of explaining the story behind my toon I point them to where they can read and find out all about her. Anyone I group with knows the way I RP and for the most part respect that, as I respect the way they play. If I am with a mostly evil RP group I don't ask them to let my pale friend join us and vice versa. Hell, I have been in a group that was evil and asked if my DE SK friend could join us. He was told no ..why? ..because he was in a neutral guild. That, to me, seemed silly, but I understood where the person in the grp were coming from.<br>
<br>
Now as far as the rezz things goes. I have ben called a bitch, a jerk and what not, because I refused a rezz when I was honestly too busy to do them. Now If I am in an area and the only one around to do a rezz,  RP-vise I will smack them around, abuse the corpse, do all sorts of nasty things to said grp and corpse, but ooc I will send a tell to the person and do the rezz. Why? That is the way I chose to do it. So, there really is no one way to play. It is a choice. I surround myself with people I like to RP with and I am always open to meeting more. We all have the way we like to do things and the way it is enjoyable for us /shrug ..Just my point of view ..I'm not bashing or trying to say anyone is wrong..the way I see it to a certain degree we are all right.<br>

Your EXP is none of my concern.<br>
<br>
Im sorry but my enjoyment roleplaying weighs more heavily then someone's lost exp.<br>
<br>
Lets say Im wandering through Chardok with some friends and an elf dies at Vabris' feet.  The elf sends a polite (because I wouldnt even respond if it was ignorant or inpolite ooc) and asks for a rez.<br>
<br>
What kinda position does this put me in?  I tell the elf no and there's a good chance I deal with ooc whining or insults, or at the very least someone who will say Im a piss-poor cleric.<br>
<br>
If I do rez them I have to break character, break everyone ELSE'S character in the group, and explain ooc that im rezing because she/he has asked nicely.<br>
<br>
Have I done it before?  Yes.  I remember once my group had just zoned into OT in time to see a bard pull all the cliff golems and 3 guards to a group of high elves who were resting at the book.  I thought it was shitty, so I rezed the elves.  It was an extreme case, and they died because of ooc stuff.  To me, that is warrenting a short &quot;ooc that was crap, let me help these guys right quick&quot;<br>
<br>
If your character is hunting, and something kills you... why is it suddenly out of character?  Because you lost a few ticks on a bar?<br>

Freeport is widely considered neutral, Qeynos is considered good.<br>

Kolani is KoS to certain factions in both. To the point that random guards/guildmasters/etc attack her as she walks through. Is she evil? No. She's allied with the good forces inside the cities, but by siding with the good, she's became KoS. The warrior guildmaster just inside the front gates of Qeynos has a propensity to jump out and proceed beating on her, although the guards mere feet from her regard her as an ally. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/kolanifv/crit.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Look folks, there is no such thing as good and evil.  No it game, not in reality.  They are meainingless lables.  When Verant created EQ they had to decide how they would apply those labels in their game world.  When FV opened they had to further codify it.  They decided race, class and worship would be the deciding factors.  That was their choice as designers.  If you don't like it you are not being forced to play on the server for those who prefer to role-play or even to play this game.  Find a different game where you like the alignment system, or there is none.  Or make your own game.<br>
<br>
But if you want to reject the role-playing framework of the game world don't come here and citch that no one is wiling to role-play with you.  Role-playing requires a common set of assumptions on how the defined universe of the role-play works.  If you choose to reject them you hurt the possibility of continued role-play in Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
It's fine to say I shouldn't tell you how to role-play but the creators of the server, the closest thing to a GM in a MMORPG set the rules and by not following them we've made RP all but impossible to maintain on the server.  <br>

It is my character's ultimate goal in life to see the tier'dal race exterminated. She might revive an animal race, like an ogre or a lizard, but she has an absolute, unwavering hatred for dark elves, and I absolutely will not break that.  It's a huge part of who my character is.  But, then, I play a character, not a generic set of stats and abilities.<br>

<br>
Shintou still doesn't give a rats ass how 'dark' your Woodelf pretends to be. You're a woodelf. He hates woodelves. You die. Its that simple. Blurring the lines grants tolerance. Tolerance is the absance of hate. Its against Innoruuk to do it in any other way.<br>
<br>
If you happen to die to say, a game glitch, LD, or something like that. Sure, I'll summon your corspe. Any other reason then that you better find yourself a Drizzit SK thx.<br>
<br>
He kills people for hates sake. You're a lesser race, cattle placed here for his enjoyment to flay and slaughter, and to evoke his hatred. Its funny, he acually likes it when people egg him on. They think they've won some major voctory but he sees it as the cattle doing its job.<br>
<br>
Hard for Neutrals to find groups?! WTF did that just come out of your mouth?! I mean.. arent the Highend Guilds on FV Neutral, FnF, Reso, etc etc etc? Come on you've got to do better then that, really.<br>
<br>
How about you try leveling on a BYOG basis. That is, Bring Your Own Group, because basically any pickup group you join will have a lightie in it. Join that group and you help that lightie, the enemy, get stronger. Such is not to be done.<br>
<br>
On a BYOG basis, you're going to solo alot. I in turn solo alot. Wonder why so many DE Clerics, Rogues, Enchanters and Warriors turn Neutral? Because they just cannot survive on a BYOG basis, for their lack of soloing ability.<br>
<br>
And because the Clerics, Rogues, Enchanters, and Warriors cannot survive on a BYOG basis, those that do will never see the 'High End Content', why? Cause we have no Clerics, Rogues, Enchanters and Warriors.<br>
<br>
So don't come here bitching and moaning that you can't get a group. RPing this line is much harder on your EXP bar then you're &quot;I'm a Neutral Rogue that wants to be a Dark elf let me group with everyone.&quot; stance. You have ALL the groups.<br>
<br>
And you wonder why he wants to kill you all. Its all about the Envy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I chose well when I picked Lanys T'Vyl as a diety.<br>

I, personally, get a bigger kick picking on both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; (my toon is neutral) while grouping, than limiting my interaction to my friends.

Am I saying you cannot play your character this way? No, I am not. If thats what floats your boat then float that boat. Am I saying Shintou is going to hate you, kill you, and not assist you in training/gaining armor/assisting in anyway because you are a Woodelf. You're darn tootin. Without Good their is no Evil, without Darkness their is no Light. Well, Shintou believes differently. Why does he see the Unkempt Druids not as an evil force? Because they only burn enought of the forest for population control, thus existing in the balance of the world, the Circle of Life. Shintou wants to burn everything down, kill everyone, and let that break the balance that the Druids hold so closely.<br>

B)If my woodelf rogue (who I don't even RP as a woodelf) kills the guards in Felwithe, is he still considered good? If eventually his faction at the Third Gate is better than in Kelethin, is he not evil enough? Cannot a monk be corrupted? Cannot a knight of shadows seduce a paladin with his dark powers? Cannot a druid be kidnapped at birth and instilled with hate while still being trained in the art of a druid ? (And yes, there are evil druids, plenty of fantasy books have entertained the idea). I have to agree that characters should be judged by actions not starting color of the toon.<br>

If he kills the guards in Felwithe, then he just hates highelves. He kills the guards in Kelethin, he hates his own kind. Oh, here let me let you into my group. Oh, wait! Why haven't you killed yourself, since you like to kill them. Is what Shintou would say. At any rate, Just because you kill some guards in a futile attempt to impress him, he's still going to kill you. Why? Simple reasons. Tunare created the elves. Innoruuk perfected them with Hatred. A Woodelf is in the form of Tunare. The form of Tunare must die. Shintou doesn't speak elvish. Why? Because the language of Tunare must die as well. Judge by actions? That takes too much time and tolerance. And in that time and tolerance, Shintou is losing hatred. Its easier to hate instead of waste time understanding people. /d. Die plz. As for the evil druid thing, see above, but also, Just because some DnD book says it, must I follow it? Hell, Sony could say those Unkempt Druids are the evil, and I would still kill them. Because of the reasons above. They work inside of balance. Working inside of Balance is working for the light.<br>

In a war, your character if he were placed on my side would die. You'd either serve as fodder, or be slain by the main force of darkness. Good groups and raids? You're Neutralic, see above. Neutralics have the best raiding on the server, and the best grouping since you dont have to BYOG. Shouldn't be disallowed from doing anything your character wants to do, espically in a guild like Noctre which I assume shares the views that your charrie does. But if lightie guild doesn't want to group with you all cause you group with dark ones, and the dark guilds don't want to group with you because you're woodelves and stuff, stuff being the neutral/light races and classes, then guess what? Thats Everquest Roleplaying. I don't like you cause you help Inkies, and I dont like you because you're a woodelf. What were you expecting, a cookie for being 'different and special'? Seriously, thats what hardlined good and hardlined evil are all about. You need to aim towards the neutralics more, find those ShadowKnights in guilds like Ebon Storm and such that aren't so .. I dont know the word Zenophobic? Find those Paladins in guilds like Clan Werre that aren't so Zenophobic. Group with them. Its not hard, at least I dont see it as being so hard but maybe I'm mistaken.<br>

1) Get your facts straight: I never ever played my toon being a DE, wanting to be a DE, or anything remotely close to it and I have no clue what gave you that idea. There is more to roleplaying than having two choices, I let my imagination run a bit wild with my toon's story line. <br>
<br>
2) I have not bitched about anything. I have no problems finding groups, RPeing, going on raids, etc. I used myself and my toon as an example so as not to offend anyone, although this seems to be what Soapbox is all about. <br>
<br>
3) As I said before, whatever you say about me and my toon is ok by me, but don't bring my guild into the discussion.

They describe the average or most common motivations and qualities of that race/class.<br>
<br>
If everyone played that way the world would be hopelessly boring.  You'd know exactly how any character is going to react, and it would be the same, every single time, because they're motivated by the same things.  How mind numblingly restrictive and unrewarding.<br>
<br>
If nobody played that way, the world would be hopelessly distasteful.  I can think of nothing worse than 1,000 dual scimitar-wielding dark elf rangers running around.  Of course that's an exaggeration, but at the height of R.A. Salvatore's popularity, you'd hear/see so much Drizzt crap (like the guys at Gen Con talking about their AWESOME!!1!1! level 15 dark elf ranger (in D&amp;D)) that I literally lost all interest in continuing to read that series.  Lets call this extreme Drizzt Syndrome.<br>
<br>
Those are really the two extremes.  The &quot;no evils allowed at this raid&quot; thing is very much at the first extreme.  If you want to play your game that way, fine, but making rules that affect how others can spend their time, like rules for the members of your guild, is extreme, if you ask me.<br>
<br>
For the people crying &quot;don't tell me how to RP you ass&quot; (or various paraphrased equivalents thereof), I'm not.  You're the people writing guild charters that say, for example, that Dwarf Clerics of Brell and Dark Elf Shadowknights of Innoruuk can't group if one of them is in your guild.  You're telling your fellow guildmates how to RP, and telling me who and whom I can't play the game with by making your guildmates say no if I ask them to group.<br>
<br>
I understand it's pretty hard to balance realism and variety vs Drizzt Syndrome.  Maybe quotas would be best.  Evil/good RP guilds could try having quotas (no more than 10% unusual characters, for example, where an unusual character is of a different alignment than his or her race/class would suggest), I suppose.  Even then, though, you can have Drizzt Syndrome actually work, too.  In D&amp;D in the Forgotten Realms setting, there's a group of dark elf maidens who are good, and gather to worship through song and dance some goddess whose name I forget because it's been too long.  Anyway, in that case, if you had a guild following an idea like that, it might work, but you'd have to be careful that every other guild on FV was like that, or it'd lose any sense of uniqueness and drive some people nuts.<br>
<br>
But when you make guild rules set in stone, with absolute terms (no evils, only good races/classes are allowed, etc) then you're basically telling people how to roleplay... so if someone gets upset at you for making rules like this, don't turn around and barf out meaningless puke like &quot;how dare you tell me how to roleplay?!&quot;  That's like cutting off someone's foot, and then shouting &quot;how dare you cut off my foot!&quot;<br>
<br>
Not sure why I even get involved, but I hate Drizzt Syndrome, and I hate cookie-cutter RP, too.  Luckily you can find balance on this server, too. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely/signature/sig_top.gif" style="border:0;"alt="Gravely Mistaken"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

1) We are not playing in FR. Verant set the rules that we play by. They are the GM's. Literally. They decided what races and classes and God we get.<br>
We have to agree on the basic principals or the game goes to crap...guess what..getting close to crap.<br>
<br>
2) Innouruk the One who made Dark Elfs made them evil. Evil runs through their veins. They cannot get away from it. Evil. Period. There is no way around it.<br>
<br>
3) Someone said the game would have all the same characters You would know who everyone waswhen you met them. That is wrong. Some races get choices. Gnomes. Humans. Half-elf. They get choices. Iksar, Dark Elfs, Trolls, Ogres, High Elfs, Wood Elfs. No Damn Choice.<br>
NO CHOICE!<br>
