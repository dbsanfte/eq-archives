class=title>   Of course...</span><hr size=1> I'm 'blindly' American, that is the very essence of International Statesmanship.  Remember, Buran, nationstates do NOT have friends, they do not have morals, they do not have ethics... they have interests.  The US will act in its own self-interest, just as will any other nation state.<br>
<br>
When the US self-interest is to care about the deaths of foreign nationals, the US will do so, when it is not in the US self-interest to care about them, then the US will not care.  Either way the United States will come under criticism, either for 'interfering in the sovereign affairs' of a smaller nation and being the big bully on the block, or for 'not caring' about the problems facing smaller nations.  Bluntly, the United States is currently the top dog in international affairs, and the rest of the dogs will spend most of their time yapping at the top dog.  This is not a statement of boastful pride or vanity, but merely fact.  As of now, the United States is the global hegemon, the only Nation State capable of projecting power on a global basis.<br>
<br>
Historically speaking, the US has been rather passive in the last 50 years or so responding to threats and deaths to its citizens overseas, especially in comparison to both other nations and history.  Theodore Roosevelt dispatched the entire Atlantic Fleet to Morocco to pressure the Sultan into securing the release of a man who *might* have been an American citizen and who had been kidnapped by rebels.  12 Battleships, 6 Armored Cruisers, about two dozen destroyers, and auxilaries... dispatched across the Atlantic over a single *possible* citizen in trouble.  During the Iranian Revolution the Soviet Union had 4 diplomats held hostage, the Soviet Military threatened to engage in a border incursion into Iran in which every day those four diplomats were held they would kill 400 Iranians.  Iran returned the hostages 2 days after the threat, and before the killing actually started, and never again threatened Russian nationals.<br>
<br>
Nation states are different than interpersonal relations, and the same rules do not apply.  Nation states are, by nature, amoral entities, at the level of international relations, common morality no longer applies.  The whole question of 'right and wrong' is not often asked, but rather the question is of capabilities and interests, the callous, brutal arithmetic of power.<br>
<br>
If the United States had reacted to the USS Cole, the Khofar Towers, the embassy bombings, the first WTC attack, the Beirut Marine Barracks bombing, as energetically and forcefully as the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Japan reacted to the Boxer rebellion in China, the terrorist threat would have never reached 9/11.  It was in attempting to inject morals, and 'multilateralism' into international affairs that paralyzed responding to previous attacks by the Radical Islamic Fundamentalists, thus emboldening them to greater acts of terror.  The US, through its actions, appeared 'soft', and became more and more of a target, after all, we hadn't reacted to previous attacks, but rather lobbed a few cruise missiles at empty huts.<br>
<br>
Israel is currently in the process of a much more rapid progression through the same process.  At the beginning of the Al Aqsa Intifada they responded rather anemically (and were damned regardless), attacking known terrorist installations after warning everybody to leave, trying to treat the terrorist threat as a law enforcement problem, and not a military one.  The attacks continued, and escalated, and now Israel is at the point that the US reached on 9/11.  Now Israel is pretty much adopting the Bush Doctrine vis a vis terror, and striking directly at the terrorists where they live, where they hide, and rooting them out.  Nobody asks why the UN operated refugee camps were functioning as arsenals for terrorists, why UN buildings were used as armories... why the UN stood by and watched as Hezbollah terrorists kidnapped and murdered 5 Israelis from the Israeli side of the border with Lebanon.<br>
<br>
Irexes, at the scale of personal relations, yes, 1 US life = 1 Afghan life etc etc etc.  But that is personal morality.  In the realm of international affairs, 1 'my country' life is greater than any number of 'other country' lives.  Why?  Bluntly, those 'other country' lives don't pay taxes and don't vote.  It's not 'jingoism', its reality, it is how nation states manage their affairs.  The UK is equally callous in its International Relations, elsewise explain Rwanda?  1 UK life was more valuable than however many hundreds of thousands of Rwandans who died to the genocide their, why else didn't the UK send in forces to secure peace?  The Royal Marines and Army are certainly capable of dealing with tribal fighters... Every nation, from Albania to Zimbawye, operates under the same calculus of interests.<br>

And you're right, the UK has done some very questionable things.  I not involved in the decision making process (a tick in a box once every 5 years notwithstanding) so I don't hold myself accountable.<br>

Why no ethics in foreign policy?  It's still individuals making decisions that lead to other people being killed.

<br>
Banana_Republic00 is in the midst of a civil war in which tens of thousands or innocent civilians are dying.<br>
<br>
Major_Power00 has to decide whether or not to get involved.  Major_Power00 has no stake in the civil war, neither outcome will harm it, none of its citizens are currently in danger, and there are Banana_Republic01 and Banana_Republic02 there that should be able to deal with it.<br>
<br>
If Major_Power00 intervenes, it risks the death of its own citizens, the loss of equipment and prestige, the costs of the operations, and the reduction in capability to deal with other situations that might arise which might be a more immediate threat to the interests of Major_Power00.<br>
<br>
Moreover, if Major_Power00 intervenes, International_Body00, which is dominated by the various Banana_Republics, will no doubt engage in major criticism of Major_Power00 for intervening in the sovereign affairs of Banana_Republic00, since it is in the interest of Banana_Republic01, 02 and 03 that 00 remains in turmoil, since they are profitting from the situation by looting the refugees.<br>
<br>
What is Major_Power00 supposed to do?<br>
<br>
Ethics and Morality are fine for personal behavior, but at the level of nation states, making decisions based on them can very well mean that your people will die.  Bush, Blair et al answer to their own nations people, not to Afghans or Palestinians, and if American or British soldiers are to be placed in harms way, it damn well better be for the benefit of America and the UK.<br>
<br>
Yes, I freely admit it is brutal, it is not 'nice', it is not 'fair', it is not 'kind'.  It is reality.  No nation, no matter how 'progressive', acts in anything other than its own self-interest.  If that self-interest happens to coincide with common morality, we call it 'enlightened self-interest'.   The United States acts that way, the UK acts that way, Canada acts that way, Switzerland acts that way, EVERY nation acts that way.<br>
<br>
In many ways diplomacy is the art of making other nations see that their self-interest lies with supporting your national self-interest.  When nations interests coincide, you have alliances, and oftentimes a nations interests are quite moral, witness the international relief efforts throughout the Third World, witness the major nuclear powers uniting to pressure India and Pakistan into backing down from the brink of nuclear war...<br>
<br>
Personal morality really doesn't enter into this equation at all, where morality makes its appearance is in the methods and procedures, not in the actual decisions.  After 9/11, the US could, with the full support of the US populace and the full understanding of nearly the entire world, have launched a few ICBM's at the known terrorist supporters strongholds and incinerated tens of millions of people along with the terrorists.  Or the US could engage in a pin-point precision campaign against the terrorists while simaltaneously engaging in humanitarian 'hearts and minds' operations.  The 'interests' of the US was to destroy terrorism, where morality came into play was in deciding that it was more moral to risk our own soldiers lives in direct combat with the enemy rather than make use of our massive nuclear arsenal to obliterate it.<br>

<br>
International Affairs are by their very nature and practice amoral.  Morality, ethics, friendships, et al do not apply in the decisions of nation-states, only their interests.<br>
<br>
Those interests can, indeed, be 'moral' and 'ethical' if morality and ethics coincide with interests, but no nation state can afford to allow mere morality and ethics to overtake its interests, because if it does, it is quite possible that the 'moral' and 'ethical' decisions will lead to the deaths of citizens for no actual gain.<br>
<br>
Nation-states do not deal with issues at the same level as you or I do, when a nation state acts, it is quite possible that large numbers of people will die directly by either action or inaction, and oftentimes people will die either way, therefore, no nation state can be justified in acting in anything other than its own interests, because to throw away the lives of its citizens on things outside of its interest is amongst the worst things a nation state can do.<br>
<br>
Now in the practices and execution of these interests is where ethics and morality occur, where the leaders make the ethical decisions between options for attaining the nations interests.<br>
<br>
There is no 'new paradigm', there is no 'more ethical way'.  The basis for international relations has remained constant from the Pharoahs to today, and will still be the same when the universe succumbs completely to entropy.  'Society' is, by its very nature, amoral.<br>
<br>
Let me give an example... Somalia, where morality and ethics overrode national self-interest.... result? 19 American dead and the prestige of the US weakened, emboldening the terrorist threats and totalitarian opponents of US interests.  So, was ignoring self-interest in the interest of 'morality' justified? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>mistayn the mindless</span><br>  Posts: 384<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 2:48:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nakath...</span><hr size=1> that also depends on your view of morality.<br>

some people think its more than rude, almost immoral, to go around minding everyone's business for them.<br>
<br>
we don't need to meddle, but when we do we HAVE to have good reasons for it.  after reading a very large synopsis by a military general who was in the vietnam war, i'll agree with his point:  you aren't going to get citizens willing to lay down their lives for something less than what they feel is 'right', or righting a wrong somewhere.  <br>
<br>
ethics may have little to do with nation states and their interest.  but nation states are composed of, and supposedly serve the people that live in them.  at least ours has always given lip service to this concept.  <br>
<br>
and if the people think that their nation is a foul villain and agrees with almost nothing that it does because of their standard of ethics,  that nation state is not going to have a compliant populace and may not be in existence for much longer.<br>

That gets into the question of 'what are a nation's interests and how are they set', rather than how the nation state acts upon said interests.  Generally speaking, a freely elected government will have more 'moral' interests than a dictatorship, precisely because of the more communal setting of the interests.  But that is not always the case, and in many cases it is not the preferable way to get things done.  The Founders, and many political thinkers throughout history, have rightly abhorred mobocracy, because just because 90 percent of the populace thinks something is good doesn't always make it so.  That's where 'statesmanship' comes into play, and it is those crass amoral statesmen who oftentimes reap the greatest good for both their nation state, and, ultimately, mankind.<br>
<br>
Now to address the questions about the US 'over arming' and spending so much on defense.  There is a very real, moral, and ethical reason for a nation state in the global position of the US to do so, it's called 'peace'.  Peace is not achieved between nation states because of warm fuzzies or feel good words, peace is achieved when the most primitively barbaric thug on the planet is afraid to realize his ambitions because he knows that there will be a 800 pound gorilla hammering him into the dirt if he tries.  Crass?  Yup.  Crude?  Uh huh.  Uncivilized?  Damn straight.  True? Oh yeah, very.<br>
<br>
Its when the Osama bin Ladins and Saddam Hussein's and Jiang's and Qaddafi's and Arafats and Assad's of the world are trembling in terror of what the global hegemon will do to them if they dare disturb it that there is peace, and with peace comes such nice things as 'not getting blown up by terrorists' and 'not having to go to war'.<br>
<br>
Morally speaking, the US committed a great sin by allowing itself to be weakened by failing to act against previous terrorist attacks strongly, be drawing down its defense, and by weakening its military.  Why?  Because that emboldened the true barbarians fo the world into thinking that they could win, thus they struck.  World War III did not occur because the Russians were nice enough to want peace rather than conquest, World War III was prevented because the Russian leadership knew if they tried that they would die.  9/11 didn't occur simply because somebody hated the US, the US has been hated by much more powerful enemies in the past, 9/11 occurred because somebody who hated the US felt that they could get away with attacking the US without getting hammered.<br>
<br>
Once you have established such credentials that nobody dares piss you off, then you have, not just 'peace', but Pax.  Where the hegemonic power can bend events globally to its liking without the use of force, through the simple fear of the force lurking in reserve.  Then, a moral hegemonic power is able to impose more 'ethical' interests onto the lesser nation-states by making it too dangerous for a lesser nation-state to act on interests that may be seen as immoral (note, IMmoral rather than Amoral, there is a difference, immoral is the opposite of moral, amoral is the absence of morality) to the hegemonic power.<br>
<br>
I don't think that there is much argument that the US is more 'moral' and 'ethical' in its dealings than, say, Iraq.  The US is certainly not a paragon of virtue riding its white horse polishing its stainless escutcheon, but let us be honest, nobody else is either, and the US is certainly closer to the ideal 'moral hegemon' than any other nation-state that has achieved that level of ascendency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Feisty Dwarf!</span><br>  Posts: 620<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 4:21:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nakath...</span><hr size=1> Very nice post Edward Dunai.<br>

we don't always support the reasoning that the politicians &amp; folks in command give for sending those orders on down to you, but we support you for doing exactly as you signed on to do.<br>
<br>
you are right, it's a tough job and not all of us want to sign up for it.  that you do so frees us from the worry of having to be willing to give our own lives in service so that we can concentrate on whatever it is we like to concentrate on, like mowing the lawn perhaps.<br>
<br>
i've never had issue with the individuals in the armed forces.  actually, i hate the arguement that just because someone disagrees with the policies that set those forces into action, they are somehow disrespecting the people who had to go to war.  <br>
<br>
all of us who have ever been employed by others understand having to do things that we don't always agree with to maintain our jobs.  we may not like it, but we have to live with it regardless in order to pay the bills.  nothing personal, but you must follow orders.  we can all respect that, i'm sure.<br>
<br>
so, as you can see, we do respect you.  the arguements and dislike is for the people who are in command, the ones who actually decide whether or not to fight wars justly or unjustly.  the issue is not with you, it is with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upoppyseedmcmuffin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PoppySeed McMuffin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Muffin Chick </span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 1:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.namelessofmercy.com/pictures/1025208718.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: US ARMY as well</span><hr size=1> (ooc)<br>

There is so much wrong with this it scares me. A moral hegemony governing through fear. Sounds pretty immoral to me (and incidentally the perfect breeding conditions for terrorists). But as long as the ends justify the means, who cares.<br>

<br>
The reason that deterrence works is fear, the reason why there was no nuclear war between the US and USSR was fear, we both could annihilate the other if we pursued our national interests vigorously, therefore, instead both sides backed down, and instead made it their interest to oppose the other in ways short of war.<br>
<br>
And the 'fear' works both ways, if two small nations both know that if they go to war with their neighbor that the US will come down on them like a load of bricks, and conversely knows that if their neighbor goes to war with them that the US will come down on their neighbor like a load of bricks, and thus knows that neither them nor their neighbor could possibly win any conflict, might they not then be more amenable to peaceful settlement, knowing that there is a hegemonic force in the wings expecting them to do so?  Or would it be more moral for the two nations to go to war with each other and slaughter thousands of people so that the US can feel good about not making people scared of it?<br>
<br>
Is it more 'moral' to permit war and violence to reign unchecked throughout the world or to increase your own power to the point where the mere threat of you intervening keeps the peace?  Is it somehow wrong for dictators and tyrants to fear the consequences of their actions?  A moral hegemon is one who makes use of its power to further moral goals, and peaceful coexistance is by any defination a moral goal.<br>
<br>
As far as terrorists go, the United States is hated already, irregardless of what we do, by the authoritarians and dictators of the world, and those who follow them.  We will be the target of fanatics regardless of what we do, but with an overwhelming preponderance of power and a demonstrated willingness to make use of that power, few if any nation-states will risk their own existance to sponsor and support terrorist organizations, which reduces the threat to the 'lone wackjob' category.  Sure, lone wackjobs can do damage, but they also are far more likely to get caught before they manage to pull off an attack, and are far less well equipped/trained.  All in all, a worthy tradeoff, in my opinion.<br>

It's called 'peace through superior firepower' and, historically, is far more reliable than 'peace through warm fuzzy feelings of love and happiness' <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=traxxus>Traxxus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 308<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 3:27:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Irexes...</span><hr size=1> Well said Edward <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukiluen73.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kiluen73</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 4:20:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Irexes...</span><hr size=1> Don't care much what everyone thinks or has to say on this subject.
