<br>
Yes, some of zones have fewer people than others, but I think patience will reveal that the server is thriving, in spite of what the doomsayers think (or desire).<br>

I do think TLC has really brought a negative show so to speak as it applies to questing and what not. That I think is bad. Honestly I think the altruistic fix is just to make all magic items no drop and do what they did at release; have lore tags only on all items which were involved in the quests. Those that like loot still get loot, and those that love questing can still go and quest. For that matter, we can still multiquest as well. Think of it from the table top aspect. Magic items should be something special somewhat, worrying about an economy in a role playing game is just out and out wrong.<br>
<br>
The Alignment system just isn't working. Goods and evils just don't belong together in guilds and groups. Think about it from the table top viewpoint which this server was meant to emulate. Paladin X groups with Necromancer X. In a tablerop setting I guarantee you one of the two would be rolling up new characters not long into the first adventure.<br>
<br>
I see and here about people leaving the server consistantly. As much as I hate to say it, I see it. I waited, I watched, and even after Luclin...people continue to go.<br>
<br>
This server needs some changes if its going to really survive long term. As much as I hate to say it, if there aren't changes made and made vocally so...I only see the server continuing on its residual decline. And the longer they wait to make the fixes (if they do), the worse its going to get.<br>
<br>
The idealologies that went into the server are absolutely wonderful. The applications of such however, just isn't equitable math.  <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 6:24:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoL</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Personally, I think that the population of the server is much less because of the amount of people that can't run EQ any more because after the Shadows of Luclin update their computers aren't up to scratch any more.

Bingo! <br>
<br>
All other theories aside.... 2 more additional reasons why all server populations may be slightly lower:  <br>
<br>
#1. Luclin expansion = players having a hell of a time getting logged on after the expansion gave them all sorts of technical problems <br>
<br>
#2. People are trying out the OTHER MMORPGs like Dark Age of Camelot, which means they cannot be playing EQ and those other games at the same time, can they? <br>
<br>
Time trying out new MMORPGs = Time away from EQ <br>
<br>
simple equation <br>

The people that I know that are leaving the server are:<br>
a) People that joined this server for a challenge (They want to become uber first, not roleplay)<br>
b) Farmers who thought they could get rich because of lower population<br>
c) d00ds who like showing off their uber gear, but can not shout about how uber they are because the language and limited shout range<br>
d) People whose computers could not handle the Luclin expansion (We have had a number of these in our guild)<br>
<br>
     I believe this server is doing well for the people it was designed for. People who like to roleplay, casual gamers who dislike the crowds and want to see the sights that are always camped on other servers and older players who can never understand d00ds. Now this does not mean RP at all times, but as a matter of practice.<br>
     I do see a problem with the 40+ group though. They all leveled so fast that a gap formed between them and the rest of the server. Alot of them came with ready formed guilds and power leveled their way to the top. Then when FV did not meet their expectations they left and there is not enough mid-level people to fill their shoes.<br>
     My guild, which started about week 3 of this server, is doing well with our leadership group in the mid 20's, even more teens and a few in their 30's. We are growing at a slow and measured pace like we want to keep that family atmosphere. There is almost always someone to group with in our level ranges, but it is rarely over-camped which is nice. Sometimes it can seem there is not enough people in your range because alot of people are busy running quests and things instead of grouping. This has happened to me before where I run a quest one night and the next a person I usually group with is doing the same.<br>
     I like the closeness of this server, the slower pace and the feeling that you know most of the people around you. I always know some of the people I run past on the way from FP to Qeynos, on my old server I never did. Leave the server the way it is. I see it as a fine wine, it will just get better as it ages.<br>

You can play on any server with a big population if you want, where you can enter an overcrowded zone and /shout LFG to your hearts content and be like all the rest of them.....Those servers may have a lot of people- but in general they're all very far apart.  Meaning - they come they group they get exp they leave. Like wham, bam, thank you ma'am.  <br>
Here is different.  You really have to make friends, you have to let yourself be known.  You have to make it so that others are comfortable enough with you to see you logon and /tell you: hey! want to come do such and such in said place?!?!?!?<br>
You have to be flexible, you have to be willing to run across continents and take the boats and not rely on others to come to you.  In essence? You really have to try here......<br>
