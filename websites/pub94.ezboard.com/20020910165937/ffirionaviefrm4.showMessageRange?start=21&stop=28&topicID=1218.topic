<br>
South Korean naval forces several months ago engaged in a major gunfight with North Korean naval units with US AWACs and C3I support, plus there has been a growing number of skirmishs between North and South Korean military units.<br>
<br>
Iran is so unstable that the US might not HAVE to take military action against it, so it's in a wait and see mode.<br>
<br>
Right now we're seeing the chessgame, the initial positioning, the jockeying for position and advantage, the actual fighting has not yet fully begun, but that is because we have the luxury of picking the time and place of our choosing.  After the massive demobilization and intense optempo of the Clinton years, our military needs to complete its maintenance cycles on its equipment, rebuild the depleted arsenals, and restock.<br>
<br>
Just because you don't see it in the press or in the news doesn't mean it isn't happening, the trick is to look at apparantly unrelated developments, inconsistancies in what is known, and trying to figure out why the developments might be related or consistant after all.<br>
<br>
As far as 'to the right' or 'to the left', I, for one, have no animus towards those who disagree with me, indeed, I tend to think that I'm just not explaining myself as best I can when people disagree with me than think that there is anything 'wrong' with what they are saying or with who they are, perhaps its the academic in me *shrug*. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>mistayn the mindless</span><br>  Posts: 449<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 3:37:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1218.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: History</span><hr size=1> your citizenship shouldn't suddenly change just because of the unproven possibility that you've engaged in certain activities.  do we classify all drug dealers as non-US citizens, even though we're engaging in a so-called War on Drugs?<br>

However, I still maintain that small skirmishes and intelligence gathering do not constitute a war, and I thought your original point to be that we had an actual war going on, with clearly identified opponents. The actions you mentioned seems to be little more than the stuff we do every day.<br>
<br>
It simply bothers me that the Administration can use 'Act of War' and 'War on ***' in the Joe Bluecollar sense, and then perform actions that are intended for the Real Thing, without all the attendant legality and checks in place.<br>

In my opinion, and backed historically, war consists of 70 percent jockeying for position, 20 percent getting ready, and 10 percent actually fighting.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way, Afghanistan was the first campaign in the War on Terror, simaltaneously we built up bases and assets to threaten other theatres in the war, propped up allied governments, engaged in operations intended to stretch the resources of the enemy, aided our allies in holding actions against our enemies (Israel vrs the Palestinian terrorists) and begun shaping the battlefield to our liking.  The preparation and planning are almost more important than the fighting itself, it is a truism for the military that amateurs discuss tactics, professionals discuss logistics, it is the invisible factors at work that make later military success inevitable.<br>
<br>
Small skirmishs and intel gathering in wartime are just as, if not more, important than the major battles that are studied in the history books.  The Battle of Gettysburg, arguably the turning point in the Civil War,  began as a small skirmish between a Union cavalry patrol and a Confederate foraging party, after all.  The little skirmishs and the intel leads to the major fights, and shapes the arena in which those major battles are fought.<br>
<br>
Now, it is certainly your right to be concerned by the actions of the government, civilian audit is vital to the proper functioning of a Western democracy and the American system of governance.  Even if I disagree with it, it would be stupid and assinine of me to dismiss it out of hand, because those concerns point up the failure of the Administration to properly inform the citizenry of what is going on, and, in my opinion, illustrates the sorry state of education in our society where the study of Military History is so sadly neglected in our schools that the majority of the populace doesn't understand these things.  If, after reviewing the historical antecedents and educating yourself as to the 'facts on the ground' as it were, you still disagree, then by all means do so, there is no 'one true conclusion' from history or anything else, reasonable, intelligent people can see the exact same pieces of data and form different opinions, and THAT is why consensual governance will always triumph over authoritarianism.  I might be wrong in my interpretation of what is going on, and you completely right, or the other way around, or some blend of the two.  In an authoritarian regime, once the 'truth' is defined by those in charge, to challenge it is death, in consensual governance, the illustration of folly can lead to its rectification. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uirexes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irexes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 5:24:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1218.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: War...</span><hr size=1> =======================================<br>

BTW what the hell have the people of North Korea or Iran done lately to deserve a good bombing?  Or is it because they were foolish enough to let themselves be governed by dynastic, unelected trigger-happy loons (in which case bomb yourselves).<br>

But your bile and venom is rather amusing, and illustrative of why the left is losing ground at a rather rapid pace.<br>
<br>
What did the people of Japan do to deserve World War II?  What did the people of Germany do to deserve either world war?  It isn't the *people* who have done much of anything, its the authoritarian governments that have, are, and will be our opponent.  We did not go to war in Afghanistan against the Afghan people, we went to war against the Taliban and Al-Qaida, and once free the Afghan people were rather enthusiastic about the whole affair.  Unfortunately, it is always the people of authoritarian dictatorships who suffer when those dictatorships engage in war, and remember, they started it, not us.<br>
<br>
Right now the main reason why we aren't hitting Iran is because it is becoming apparant that the people of Iran are about to take matters into their own hands and forcefully remove the Islamofascists from power.  If we can accomplish our goals without having to risk the lives of our fighting men and women, so much the better, I doubt you'll disagree that it is better to risk our money than it is to risk our blood if both can achieve the same goals.<br>
<br>
I'll take your silly comments about President Bush as entertainment, and pass on with merely a point that in no recount in which illegal ballots (those cast by convicted felons) are excluded has Gore won Florida, in order for Gore to win, the law has to be broken... and military absentee ballots have to be ignored.  Indeed, even when *all* overvotes are counted as Gore votes (an overvote is where both Bush and Gore were selected) Bush STILL wins the state, of course, assuming that only Gore supporters would be so imbecilic as to be unable to complete a ballot that first graders were able to handle is hardly complimentary to the intelligence of Gore voters, isn't it.<br>

That is the issue. If you have evidence of intent, assistance or involvement, then by all means necessary detain, prosicute and convict. Treason, Murder, Conspiracy, etc against the citizens of America is a crime. Whether they are a citizen tried millitairially or a non-citizen tried criminally... I couldnt care less. Against such an enemy as we see before us, some necessities arrise.<br>
<br>
For instance, if a citizen of the US is caught red-handed and was found to be of critical strategic importance, I can see the need to try him in the military and keep much of the details &quot;classified&quot;.  The enemy has so much advantage in guerilla war, we must maintain every advantage of our own.<br>
<br>
By the same token I believe that if a non-citizen, of any nationality, is caught doing anything worse than j-walking, such as over staying their visa or shop lifting they should be deported with haste. &quot;You just lost the privilage to visit. We have enough crime of our own and do not need your help. Thanks for dropping by.&quot; <br>
<br>
But PROVE they are the enemy/guilty. Without a tial, without EVIDENCE, clearly and openly presented before your citizens, OR at least to some congressional oversite, you are not protecting your country. You are participating in a crime against it's people.<br>
<br>
We are supposed to be a country of equality, freedom and personal inaliable rights. Citizenship does not grant these things, just being human does. Preserved ONLY by the fact that we are a country founded on LAW. Not God, not Allah, not good intentions, not guns... law. Allow them to break the law and you are allowing them to break you. and all of us.<br>
