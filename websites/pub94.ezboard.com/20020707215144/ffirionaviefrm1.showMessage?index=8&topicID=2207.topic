<br>
The point was that within the context of a campaign world, in any RPG, the Game Master decides what is true and what is propaganda. The second version is what is the actual history according to our GM, Verant. It also has the advantage of being part of the official release of the game, instead of being a beta artifact.<br>
<br>
Does the other story have value? Sure. Makes for an interesting myth for the dark elves to spread around. But, as a player, one has to realize that one is playing a character who believes a lie. A very devout believer in a lie, but a lie, nonetheless. Because that whole second story just didn't happen that way.<br>
<br>
For a comparative thing... I have a legendary warrior in the history of my campaign world (long story omitted here). Half the races in the world believe he was one of them. He was, in actuality, a half-orc. Doesn't make anyone else less fervent in their cultural beliefs that he was something else... but I, as the creator of that world, have decreed that he WAS a half-orc, no matter how adamant the elves are that he was an elf.<br>

<br>
For example, before the addition of Paineel, when the Heretics of Odus lived in a shack in Toxxulia Forest, the Heretics were allied with Bertoxxulous, not Cazic Thule.  I believe you can still find some in game references to that, and a few die hard NPCs, like Maugrim in Kerra Ridge, are on Bertoxxulous faction.<br>
<br>
But the above story was obviously scrapped by VI, as a lot of the details are wrong.  The Capital City of the Elven Empire was Takish Hiz, and it was on Tunaria (now called Antonica).  The Deserts of Ro were once lush forests, till it was burned up by Solusek Ro and the Elves fled to Faydwer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukerysfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KerysFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/28/02 8:50:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> OOC, I find it very interesting that the dark elves are, in the story given here, the loyalists from an ancient revolt.  I like the idea of &quot;shades of gray&quot; rather than black/white good and evil in a gameworld.  <br>
<br>
As others have said in this thread, though, what the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter is, who knows.  It's true that Verant as the GMs can (try) to dictate a certain version as truth, but players are chaotic beings and will believe whatever they want to believe ! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 669<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/28/02 9:10:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> Lemme toss out one other snippet to clarify the idea of a &quot;real&quot; history of Norrath vs. a false one...<br>
<br>
I could go write a story up that explains how gnomes were actually created by Cazic Thule and are his chosen people. Now, would the fact that the story is written mean anything? No. It would be a personal story, and a rather silly one... so folks would ignore it when discussing the supposed history of Norrath. Nobody would say &quot;But Ellywig wrote that gnomes are the chosen of Cazic Thule, so that is how it is&quot;.<br>
<br>
Why? Because I am NOT Verant! Verant is the official historian here, and therefore my new history is meaningless, other than as a personal roleplay thing - in this case I would be roleplaying a very deluded gnome.<br>
<br>
If you want to use the Official Verant Authority (tm) to disprove my bizarre little hypothetical tale, it is equally valid for disproving the whole dark-elf loyalist tale. Verant published their official history of Norrath. The fact that they floated around some other stuff during beta doesn't mean it is true in this version of Norrath. The GM hath spoken - elves were created by Tunare, and corrupted by Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
I do like that there is an alternate 'myth' out there, a possible &quot;official lie&quot; for the dark elves to believe. Makes for a richer world. But, it is just as false as my little story. You can't have it both ways - Verant isn't the ultimate authority and then not on the same subject.<br>
<br>
It is all part of the player/character distinction. Your character may fervently believe any number of untrue things. But don't fall into the trap of thinking that you, as a player, have to support the lies. Just roleplay them, don't defend them.<br>
<br>
If everyone was roleplaying their little hearts out - please ignore the commentary. But it was starting to look alot like players (not characters) saying &quot;well, we don't know, really&quot; - and you do.<br>

Thus Teiraa is believing in a lie. Absolutely correct. I agree with you OOC-ly. No doubt on that at all. Teiraa is crazy, and her main beliefs are a lie. (note: no sarcasm here!)<br>
But IC-ly it doesn't matter at all, actually, since it is impossible for a small weak dark elfie to understand all the things around her. And she'll never see enough evidence to be convinced, that her beliefs are wrong. Therefore, if someone would tell her some bad things about dark elfies, she will start to laugh about it, or in severe cases to pout, to cry and to fret. But OOC-ly, I see this as fun. Ok, I assume you know that already.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, another point here is how  players in general are dealing with the background story IC-ly. The story actually is an OOC-ly made dogma. As I see in this thread and elsewhere, there are three basic approaches for a player:<br>
<br>
First approach: The background story is absolute truth, and my character knows about it and acts accordingly. Thus an OOC-made dogma is transfered to an IC-truth for the character. In other words: Not only the player believes OOC-ly in the truth of the story, but the character does it as well, IC-ly.<br>
Makes it a bit easier to play, since you can identify yourself with the character. And since the background story is a good one (in my opinion), it makes good roleplay.<br>
<br>
Second approach: The background story is truth, but my character doesn't know it. But nevertheless he is behaving according to the storyline, even though he thinks different.<br>
Best example here: Skathris Ven'sho. Really not easy to do, but yields very good roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Third approach: Background story, so? What me worry! It's my character and I do what I want. In other words: Ok, OOC-ly I have that story, ok, IC-ly it might be the absolute truth in the world, but my character thinks different. Basta!<br>
A bit more difficult, since you always have to think &quot;How would I behave if I believe in the basic principles of my characters thought, even though they are a lie?&quot; That's more spicy gameplay.<br>
<br>
If I would be number one, I'd say: Yes, I am a perverted Fier'dal, and I am spreading hate.<br>
If I would be number two, I'd say: No, I am not a perverted Fier'dal, but I'd still be spreading hate.<br>
And I am number three, I say (for example): Innoruuk needs love. *bump*<br>
And as a result, of course, I am alone with my belief, and not many people respect me (IC-ly). But that's the price for it. Just please don't say that I do this because I want to powerplay <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But still, for me IC-ly it doesn't matter very much whether your character's story is a lie or is truth OOC-ly. Not a big difference. It doesn't make a character more 'worthy' if he/she reacts exactly like Verants (maybe) wants him/her to react.<br>
<br>
We have many players from all types. And I think that we can coexist very well. I use the third approach, evidently, and actually don't feel any trouble when I meet players who think different. <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>

The point wasn't about whatever beliefs people choose to play IC - it was about the appearance that players were starting to say that the existence of this beta-era story meant there was no 'real' history for the game world.<br>
<br>
I have played characters with very false beliefs before... it has led to some great storylines. The neutral necromancer who believed that the forces behind undeath were neither good nor evil, much like fire has no ethical alignment, in a world where that wasn't so (home campaign). In that world, undeath was inherently evil and corrupting.<br>
<br>
He had a rather harsh awakening to the truth, and became quite a crusader against the undead, rather than the dispassionate scholar he had once been. But, I did know during the whole time that I was playing him that he was wrong in his theories.<br>

That WAS my point of posting the story. Because I found it an interesting deviation of the standardized this-race-is-this-this-race-is-that stereotypes. I saw cool RPing potential in it, and though perhaps others might as well.<br>
<br>
Period.<br>
<br>
It had nothing to do with what me, as a RL OOC human, believes or reads about Norrath's Lore, as doctrinated by Verant. My character Ana came across an old Tome in the library one day, and...well...<br>
<br>
That's it, nothing more, nada zero zip. I am however, starting to believe that you work for Verant PR <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (joke).<br>

<br>
kind of similar (but tad off topic). all the talk about taking the words &quot;under god&quot; out of the pledge of allegaince brought some news to me i didnt know. those words were added in the 50's. why? to sepreate america from the GOD-LESS RUSSIANS. /boggle<br>
this is a prime example of how many of these so called myths abound in norrath. <br>
<br>
a government wants to build support for its goals so they spread information to make thier goals seem to be the only reasonable course. in this case (original post) the message is &quot;all the above lands were taken from us and it is the duty of all dark elves to bring our vengenace down upon the surface world&quot;. youd be hard pressed to find even one dark elf who had a different view of the world, because theyve been taught that since birth.<br>
<br>
the point is in this RL age of the internet and 24 hour news we still have people who think all afr-amer are criminals (racist whites) and all white people have life easy(racist afr-amer). its just pure ignorance and racism, how bad do you think this would be in the world of norrath?<br>
<br>
it doesnt mean that thier view is historically correct but youd have better luck charming wushi at lvl 12 than convincing them they are wrong.<br>
