Here, i will tell you what you have accomplished. <br><br>you have disabled a few keys from people having more than 1 on them(you gave us no warning... that's the LEAST you could do). <br><br>you have disabled a few more keys due to people having them that weren't returned to guilds when they left guilds, etc. (again because no warning... thanks)<br><br>you have accomplished what will probably only make negative competition for ST keys. unless a rotation is agreed upon, Reso and FnF are going to be racing to Zlandicar to get keys, and i'm sure ill feelings will ensue if there's no rotation. other options for keys are very limited. Plenty of people in each of the 2 guilds that can do ST already have Primal weapons and the other drops as well. and they are all droppable. really, what did you accomplish but instill negative competition? nothing. if you wanted to have the keys be no drop, then ya shoulda made them that way in the BEGINNING. <br><br>thank you so much Verant. you love your customers dont you? the VERY least you could have done is tell us in advance so we could retain more than half our keys. We still earned those keys.  what were you afraid of? that with warning, we'd all camp in ST before patch? do you think we're really THAT stupid? If we wiped out that would be a near impossible CR with alot of risk to losing our corpses. <br><br>as if you hadn't done enough for us, you go and do this shit. honestly if EQ weren't so addictive and more like a real business, you would have lost alot of your customers pulling that shit. if you dont understand anything else, maybe you'll understand what a bad business move is. oh wait... you're verant... nevermind.<br><br>EDIT: not to mention the myriad bugs brought on by this treachery. everytime someone puts a normally no drop(on regular servers) item in a trade window, their computer freezes. One would almost think this was intentional after the shit you just pulled. except for the fact that TLC + no drop makes absolutely no sense. And did you purposefully make some of the coldain shawls and rings(rumored) no drop? so what are people supposed to do about all the TLC quest pieces? dumbasses <p><BR><B>Baroness Veloxia Voluptuous </B><BR>57 Halfling Warrior~run speed 3~regen 3<BR>"Even the smallest person can change the course of the future" ~ Gandalf<BR>Veloxia@hotmail.com<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~2emiller/Sig4final.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A> at: 6/6/02 3:29:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukarleafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KarleaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/6/02 6:15:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=779.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: a love letter to Verant(i know you guys read this board)</span><hr size=1> I think they made them no drop cause they want to avoid that 6 people go to e.g. Sebilis with only 3 actually having keys.<br><br>And I lost an hour of gaming due to my computer freezing 3 times during trades.

You're saying the end game should be gift wrapped and given to us because, ummm? Anyone who wanted it had a free pass to the high end game on FV. By free, I mean void of competition. Competition with other players is the most significant hurdle, everything else is just time at the keyboard. The dropable zone keys were an obvious oversight from the beginning, and in my eyes, not bothering to obtain enough of them tainted what should have been crowning achievements. Fortunately for most of you, you're not charged with impressing me, and in your defense, you played within the rules. Anyway, surely there are enough valid keys for a joint Reso/FnF venture if competition is too foreboding a thought. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49821" target="_new">Zarsiss Razorscale</a><BR>Iksar Monk, 56th Scale<BR><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/bdreadstorm" target="_new">Dreadstorm</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Corrupted Halfling</span><br>  Posts: 780<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/6/02 11:15:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=779.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: a love letter to Verant(i know you guys read this board)</span><hr size=1> Zarsiss... congratulations you missed my whole point. <br><br>did you read the whole thing? <br><br>my point was that if they were going to make them no drop, they should have done so at the BEGINNING, or as soon as they found out they are no drop. not wait a few weeks or more to let things get going, let a nice rotation system get going, then dash it to pieces without warning. because they didn't warn us we lost keys too. we still earned those keys no matter what. we should still get to use them. all they have accomplished by doing this is to almost certainly promote negative competition(ya know FnF and Reso are actually getting along fairly well right now). who knows what will happen with both scrambling to take out the keyholders.<br><br> <p><BR><B>Baroness Veloxia Voluptuous </B><BR>57 Halfling Warrior~run speed 3~regen 3<BR>"Even the smallest person can change the course of the future" ~ Gandalf<BR>Veloxia@hotmail.com<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~2emiller/Sig4final.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzarsissrazorscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarsiss Razorscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/6/02 12:06:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=779.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: a love letter to Verant(i know you guys read this board)</span><hr size=1> Well no, I didn't miss the minor point, I just didn't address it. Because it wasn't done from the beginning doesn't make it right from the beginning. When our Lead GM saw that entry to ST was being trivialized, some sort of immediate action would obviously have been better than to allow an influx of unearned uber loot and then simply shut the valve later. It was a disservice to us all to consider something was wrong and not do something about it at the start. Maybe there was some deliberation to do in regards. Fixxing it, however late, was still the appropriate action. Announcing it might have been appropriate, but if you follow the tone of some of the discussions on these boards you might consider that option dangerous. Waking the sleeper might seem attractive to someone who is suddenly faced with months of work to do for something they've taken for granted all this time. While I'm sure more loot would be desired, a we have enough arguement could possibly be made. No offense intended anyone there, but it's something I would have considered were I representing VI's and FV's interest. At any rate, was even a single key lost? If so, is that such a big deal considering the fair effort it now takes to regain entry? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49821" target="_new">Zarsiss Razorscale</a><BR>Iksar Monk, 56th Scale<BR><a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/bdreadstorm" target="_new">Dreadstorm</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umorgauth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morgauth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/6/02 12:14:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=779.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/classes/c_necromancer.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: a love letter to Verant(i know you guys read this board)</span><hr size=1> in my 3 years of EQ ive seen verant treat us progressively worse, dont expect it to improve..... <p><img src=http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL22/566694/847606/10005863.ptp.gif ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I got more post<br>than all of you</span><br>  Posts: 786<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/6/02 1:09:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=779.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: a love letter to Verant(i know you guys read this board)</span><hr size=1> I gotta agree, they only fixed a bug/exploit... nothing more, would you rather they take back the loot or give you no warning while taking away your right to be there before its done fairly?<br><br>Karlea... sebilis keys, why bring those up?

They're going to be competing with guilds that are already, to one degree or another, bristling with primal and priceless weapons and can take down the key givers more or less at will. In that contest, who do you think is going to win? It's a brutal hard truth that no other guild is going to have much of a shot at even ONE key for many many months now, much less 30 or more of them. If any other guild ever gets 30+ keys now, it will probably be long after EQ2 is out.<br><br>If you thought you might be able to get a glimpse of some of the less commonly seen zones, that dream is now over, unless you belong to Reso or FnF. It would have been cooler all around for more people to have the opportunity to see more zones before EQ's 'end of days', but that's not in the cards anymore. That seems a shame to me, but that's just my opinion.<br><br>Changes like this, long after they should have been changed if they were to be changed at all, are inherently bad in that the server is no longer a land of equal opportunity.

ST will be no different.<br><br>Reso and FnF have fought amongst themselves in the past. That was actually a misunderstanding,  what was perceived as a broken promise. But thats water under the bridge.<br><br>We have no interest in enforcing our ideals onto anyone on this server. We dont expect anyone to look up to us as rolemodels or as an example of &quot;how to do things&quot; (like when alignment was dropped and people were so curious as to how we would react).  All we want to do is play this game, take on new challenges and have some fun doing it. We would /cheer any guild who got to enter ST and infact I did just that when reso went in for thier first time. The only &quot;personal playground&quot; FnF has is our guildchat and raid channel.<br><br>ST was a thrill. Wether or not Verant wanted to allow players to enter that zone so early was discussed by folks in FnF and I am sure folks in Reso had similar conversations. But since they made the keys tradable, we assumed this was part of the FV rule set. Just like the seb keys, HS keys and having to deal with TLC.<br><br>GM's watched us in ST and cheered us on. We had no reason to believe that the key being tradable was not what Verant had intended. We certainly didnt consider it an exploit especially with GM's there congratulating us. The fact that they changed this on us with out warning is just poor planning on Verants part. If they meant the key to be no drop then they should have made it no drop to begin with. If this was an oversight on there part it seems only fair for them to warn us before they change it.<br><br>Edit: Cori is right. All this change has done is made it harder for other folks to get to see ST. FnF and Reso had enough Keys to do ST (obviously) and were just getting more keys as it was convienent. Now there will almost certainly be a &quot;lock&quot; on the monsters that will let folks get keys for ST for the next few months. Hopefully, by the time another guild is ready to try ST, Reso and FnF will have thier keys and wont need these monsters anymore.<br><br><br> <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220314" target="new">My Magelo Profile</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A> at: 6/8/02 7:31:08 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=779.topic&start=21&stop=35>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=779.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=779.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=779.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=779.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=779.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=779.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
