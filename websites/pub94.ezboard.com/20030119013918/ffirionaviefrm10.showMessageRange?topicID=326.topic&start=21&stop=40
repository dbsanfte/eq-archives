<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
NO NO NO NO NO!!<br>
<br>
Forgive me, little book, but I need to see that word and get used to using it more emphatically. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO<br>
<br>
Damn my weaknesses! To the abyss with all the questions in my head! How easily I get sidetracked from my duty. No wonder I frustrate Father. <br>
<br>
I do not want to write all that I have to say, as I think someone has been snooping in my things, though I really have no evidence. I usually keep you close by my side, but the upcoming wedding has kept me so busy that I'd forget my head if it weren't attached. <br>
<br>
But please, little book, remind me not to veer off the path chosen for me. Please, little book, help me to remain strong in my decision. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
She slams the cover shut and lifts her eyes to the mirror in front of her. The Lady staring back at her looks frazzled, her cheeks mottled and pink with frustration, and her hair hanging in limp clumps, as if recently wet. The wet greenness of her eyes threatens tears, but Isharra does not cry. She must never show such weakness; she must be strong. She lifts a silvery brush from among the bottles and accesories scattered on the elegant wooden vanity, and pulls it through her raven hair, working out the spots where her wet hair had dried in clumps. When she's finished, she replaces the brush, then calls for Marha, her servant and friend.<br>
<br>
The stout dwarven lady appears in an instant from within Isharra's vast closet, a half-folded garment still in her hands. &quot;Yes, dear?&quot; she says amiably, before dropping the cloth and running to her charge's side. &quot;What is it, Miss? You look terrible!&quot; Marha's wide brow creases with worry as she takes Isharra's arm and tugs her down to feel her forehead. &quot;Well, yer not runnin a fever, Miss, but you sure are pink.&quot;<br>
<br>
Isharra waves off the tiny hands kindly, managing a smile for Marha. &quot;I'm fine, fine, nana. I was going to ask you to fix me a bath, with rose oil for soft skin and essence. Could you do that for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly, dear. But sit you down here on the bed until it's all ready. Can I get you some tea or juice, Lady? A biscuit, mayhaps? Do you need a nap?&quot; Marha's dark eyes study Isharra's face, obviously not convinced that all is well. The fat brown braid hanging over her shoulder is laced with gray, more gray each day, it seems.<br>
<br>
Isharra smiles at Marha with love and deep gratitude. &quot;No, nana, I  swear, I'm fine.&quot; <br>
<br>
Marha nods, a brow inching into her forehead to let Isharra know she wasn't convinced. She turns to go, stopping to pick up the dropped garment before opening the tall, blackwood door. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nana! One more thing. Please deliver a message to Gareth. I'd like him to visit me before he rests tonight. I have something to show him. . .&quot; the cleric says softly, her voice trailing off in a whisper. <br>
<br>
Now both brows inch into the dwarf's forehead and she opens her mouth to object, but Isharra holds up her hand pleadingly. &quot;Please, nana. This is very important to me.&quot; Marha's dark eyes bore into the Koada'dal, and Isharra knows her nurse  is reading her heart with the experience of years of love and caregiving. &quot;Please,&quot; Isharra croaks miserably.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, Miss, very well.&quot; <br>
<br>
The door to her chamber thuds to a close, and Isharra shivers, the quiet, empty chamber feeling like a tomb.<br>
<br>

She was dressed in one of her finest gowns, a dark burgundy silk with empire waist, the neckline low-cut across the top of her bosom. The late-afternoon air was cool and refreshing on her pale, rose-scented skin.<br>
<br>
 The wrought-iron garden chair upon which she sat was pulled up to a tiny matching table set with wine, fruit, bread, and cheese, and tea for herself. Gareth's chair was still empty after forty minutes of waiting, and she was contemplating leaving when she heard the crisp clack of boots on marble. Gareth strolled onto the terrace, the robes of his station replaced by leather breeches and a loose cotton tunic.  His smile was warm as he approached and scooped her up from the chair into a tight embrace.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Isharra, my love! Sorry I'm late.... you know how it is these days at court. I was meeting with an ambassador from Ak'Anon all day... creepy little folks if you ask me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Do you smell lilacs?&quot; Isharra asked, sniffing at the air. <br>
<br>
Gareth paused as if caught off guard by the question, then replied smoothly, &quot;Why, of course! I had Dyrak fix my bath with essence of lilac, as I know how fond you are of lilacs.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Roses,&quot; Isharra corrected, her stomach sinking. &quot;But no matter; Tis the thought that counts, so they say,&quot; she said cheerfully, a smile painted on her lips. <br>
<br>
Gareth almost seemed relieved as he turned his attention on the food. They sat and ate, talking about little things: rumors at court, upcoming marriages, funerals, and court affairs. The conversation was pleasant enough, if a bit bland, and by the time they were finished, Isharra had worked up the courage for her next step.<br>
<br>
They were walking through the garden, arm in arm, when Isharra came to a halt. Gareth smiled curiously as she looked up into his eyes. They were blue flecked with gold---they could be loving, she thought, a little too eagerly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Darling, what is it? You look as if you have something to say...&quot; Gareth intoned, stroking her cheek with the backs of his fingertips. He barely finished the sentence when she pulled him downward into a long, slow kiss. His smile was radiant when she pulled away. &quot;So finally you have warmed to me, my sweet! It's about time you came around. I was starting to worry that I was marrying a prude, you know. Perhaps I won't have to take others to my bed after all!&quot; he said teasingly, though the unspoken threat hung in the air between them. <br>
<br>
And as Isharra looked up into his beautiful smiling face, her skin crawled, and the woodenness of their kiss lingered on her lips, sickening her. It would have to do. <br>
<br>

His silver brows were an angry V as he dabbed his wine-stained lips with a kerchief then tossed the elegantly embroidered cloth down onto his plate like a rag. &quot;How dare you ask such a thing, Isharra? We are not yet married, so what I do in my bed is my business. But you impugn my honor by suggesting that my nightly pursuits will continue after we wed! A man has his needs, you know! Once we are wed, I'll not have to look elsewhere anymore, will I?&quot; The high elf stood, brushing his long silver hair back from his face.<br>
<br>
Isharra's eyes drifted to the kerchief on his plate. How long had it taken her to finish that pattern? The cranberry baste soaked into the snowy white cloth like blood into a bandage. Isharra's gaze fell back to her own half-eaten meal. &quot;That is all I ask, Gareth. I do not question your honor. I just wish to make sure that once we are wed you stop your ...'nightly pursuits,' or whatever you call it. This is the only thing I ask, and I do not think I am asking too much. I am still a maiden, you know. Females have 'needs' as well, don't you think? But I do not seek any bed but my own, at night, to sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gareth laughed harshly, then abruptly his demeanor changed as he knelt down onto one knee and took her hand. The smooth planes of his face caught the candlelight, making him seem like a dream. Little flames danced within his eyes in time to the candlelight's rhythm. &quot;Isharra, my beautiful love. Of course I will be true to you.&quot; He paused, reaching up to stroke her cheek gently, and his lips curved into a charming, sly smile. &quot;I have an idea that will make us both happy.&quot; His hand moved from her cheek to her shoulder, his touch warm and feather-light. Isharra wanted so much to love him, to trust her heart to him. What beautiful children they would have! But the thought fled in an instant as she felt the strap of her gown being tugged down and Gareth leaned up to kiss her neck, whispering, &quot;Why not end this disagreement now, my love? Let us make our marriage bed tonight. I'll not tell a soul. Then I will not have to go elsewhere for my pleasure, and you will no longer seek an empty bed.&quot; <br>
<br>
His breath was hot on her neck and Isharra trembled, wanting to give in, to seal their marriage secretly and get it over with. But something inside her recoiled and she pushed him away gently, blushing. &quot;No, Gareth. Not yet. Father is still up and about. It would not bode well for your future to anger the general, my sweet,&quot; she said, forcing a smile. <br>
<br>
Gareth's eyes blazed with lust, and, for a moment, she feared he saw through her ruse. His hand burned into her shoulder, and she felt herself stiffen. But then he smiled, a sweet, boyish smile, and touched his lips to her forehead. &quot;How right you are, my love,&quot; he said, brushing his lips through her hair, taking in her scent. &quot;But I can't help but want you. You know that, don't you? No woman in the world is like you. You are my prize, my jewel.&quot; The high elf stood and smiled down at her, fixing her strap with a delicate hand, before cupping her chin. &quot;My sweet, innocent Isharra. I'll not deflower you tonight. You are truly a Lady,&quot; he said, then looked into the dim hallway, calling, &quot;Marha, my cloak, please!&quot;<br>
<br>
Isharra stood, smiling gently up at him through her apprehension. &quot;Do you have to go so soon? We could read together, or perhaps go swimming? It's a lovely night. . .&quot; she began, but his finger touched her lips to silence her. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, my dear. You have stirred up the beast in me. I must go release him before he overpowers me and I spoil you for our wedding night!&quot; He grinned, but Isharra just blinked slowly, stunned. Mistaking her silence, he added, &quot;Yes, there are many mysteries to a man that you will learn one day, but not tonight, my sweet. Tonight you remain a maiden.&quot; <br>
<br>
And before she could respond, he yanked his cloak from Marha's tiny hands, and Isharra thought she heard him say &quot;To Kelethin.&quot; to his servingman as the door closed on his back.<br>

Not finding it there, she checked her packs, and then beneath the bed, and then under the rugs of her chamber. No journal. Frantically, she began tearing apart her chambers, Marha at her side, sure she would find her journal among her things. <br>
<br>
They were up until the wee hours of the morn, and finally Marha sent Isharra to bed, where she fell asleep immediately. When she awoke, Isharra continued her search, now retracing her steps the entire evening before. She hadn't written in it in days, though, so it could be anywhere---too many places for her to check. <br>
<br>
Finally, quite vexxed, she ended her search. Hopefully, whoever finds it will not read it, and if they do, they'll not recognize the author. Hopefully, the secrets of her heart were still locked up within her.  <p><i>Isharra Moonsong</i><BR>

Gareth warn't in Kelethin, Lady. Oi'm certain Oi saw 'im at the inn in East Commons.&quot; The grizzled old dwarf's big brown brows caved into his eyes like a rockslide and his lips pursed comically as he stroked his graying beard. &quot;Oi, that was 'im. Oi know'd it was. In fact, he even mentioned yer name to 'is lady friend. Oi' didn't get a good look at eeder of 'em, as the lady was cloaked from head ta toe. Small she war, like one o' them treehuggin elfs, but she warn't dressed like 'un. She war wearin a long velvet cloak, black like the night, and Oi got a quick glimpse of oiled leather armor beneath. They was talkin in some strange tongue, but Oi recognized yer name. Oi tol' Marha here soon's as Oi got back ta Faydwer, knowin how close she war ta ye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Marha's eyes flitted to and fro between Brogdan and Isharra, and her hands were in constant motion in her lap. She shook her head as she listened, cursing under her breath as her brother repeated his news to Isharra. &quot;See? I told you it was important that you hear this, Miss. Praise to the gods that he came to me straightaway. Something's not right here. Always knew that boy was trouble. What in the blazes was your father thinking trying to marry you off to him?&quot; Marha's face was pink, simmering with slow rage as she met Isharra's eyes. Isharra, pale as a maggot and still as a tomb, was Marha's opposite as she digested Brogdan's words. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are sure, little sir? You must be positive, beyond a doubt. You say he was in Teir'Dal form, but how did you recognize him then?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He warn't that way the whole time, lady. He came that way, but Oi'm a sneaky lil rogue an' Oi managed ta peek inta thar room when the lady opened the door ta leave fer a bit.&quot; At this, he grew uncomfortable, averting his eyes for the comfort of the floor. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; probed Isharra, noting the change. <br>
<br>
Brogdan stroked his beard some more, obviously stalling. A thud to the back of his head got his attention, and Marha smacked him open-palm once more for good measure, exclaiming, &quot;Well, go on now! Tell 'er the rest! No time for pleasantries or saving  feelings!&quot; <br>
<br>
Recovering some of his dignity, Brogdan continued, &quot;Oi knowed it war him cause he warn't dressed when Oi saw 'im, and he warn't in darkie form either. Oi sar his long silver hair, his high elfin face, an' that birthmark on 'is hip. Looked like a great big brown turd stuck on 'im.&quot; Had the story not been so depressing, Isharra would have laughed at how red Brogdan's ears were burning and the way he kept looking everywhere but into her eyes. Brogdan was not known for his manners, but he was certainly doing his best to address the subject delicately, and for that she was appreciative. <br>
<br>
Marha turned to Isharra triumphantly, her arms folded over her chest. &quot;See? Who else would have that birthmark? Brogdan couldn't make <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> up! You should go to your father at once!&quot; the dwarf said firmly. But Isharra was hardly listening. Her eyes were fixed on the lamp-light as it danced in the breeze wafting through the open window. <br>
<br>
&quot;You said his lady was *like* a wood elf, but I notice you did not say she *was* a wood elf. I feel your choice of words was intentional. Am I correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brogdan chewed on his lower lip a moment, but when Marha's hand came up again he blurted, &quot;Oi, yer right, Miss. Oi left out that she warn't wearin' gloves. Oi also left out that the reason Gareth war in darkie form is cause his comp'ny,&quot; he stopped, choosing his words, &quot; .well, she war also... . eh...  in darkie form---but Oi don't think it war magic in her case.&quot; Isharra nodded slowly, maintaining control over her emotions. A dark elven mistress was not so bad; after all, perhaps the mistress was like Cronadan, dark in skin but not in heart. Mayhaps she didn't even know Gareth was to be married. If so, then they were both being played as fools, allies in a strange way. This proved nothing but that Gareth was more tolerant than he let on. It was almost a relief, in a warped way. <br>
<br>
But Brogdan interrupted her thoughts, his voice soft and anxious. &quot;But that ain't all, miss. Oi sar 'em both again.  . .  but this time they war in Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>

The rain of Felwithe fell soft and warm on the streets as the enchanter and his two bodyguards walked out of the office. In the high elves arms was a rather large chest, a symbol on the clasp acting as a a magic lock that would hold any thief at bay.<br>
<br>
The laughing threesome walked joyfully in the late summer rain that felt like a fine mist on their skin. It felt that way to Gatsu as well as he stood in the shadows.<br>
<br>
It had been a long time since he had gotten to wear the gear he had on now, The extra long gnomeskin cloak hung scant inches above the ground and covered everything on him in a lightless black with the exception of his face. That was covered by his hair, now dyed jet-black, which hung damply infront of his eyes. Combined with the training he had received all those years ago there was no way any of the three elves could have seen him.<br>
<br>
They past joyfully right in front of the warrior as he stepped slowly out into the alley behind them. Now they felt his presence but it was already too late.<br>
<br>
The first bodyguard reached for his sword but Gatsus blade was already drawn and ready in his right hand. Gatsus slice was quick and efficient, it came across from Gatsus left to his right side and through the high elfs exposed throat. The gurgling sound that escaped from his neck deafened by a crack of thunder in the distant sky.<br>
<br>
The second bodyguard was a little faster and aimed his backhand-sideways slash at the warriors neck to sever it from his body. Still moving fluidly from the first slash Gatsu spun a full circle as he ducked under the attack. With the sword in his right hand he dug his blade deeply into the side of the elf. As he continued his spin Gatsu brought his left palm against the back of his blade and using his momentum and strength pushed the blade completely through the elfs torso. His legs fell to the floor as his upper body slid into the far alley wall.<br>
<br>
Gatsu raised himself up slowly his steel-cold eyes freezing the enchanter in place before the enchanter could react with a single word to a spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing personal you know&quot;, Gatsu calmly stated at the target through his own hair hanging lightly in front of his tilted head, &quot;Just business.&quot;<br>
<br>
With those words Gatsu sprang forward lunging with his sword. He drove the elf to the ground, the blade pierced right through the high elfs dainty throat. The politicians eyes, blue with gold flecks, stared pleadingly up at Gatsu. Gatsu smiled evilly at the high elves silent prayer for mercy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bet you wish you had Tunare to pray to eh Gareth.&quot; Gatsu coldly said as he twisted the sword snapping the elves spine and ending his life. Gatsu let the rain wash his blade clean before collecting his prize from the bloodstained alley.<br>
<br>
He leaned over the corpse and took a ring from the finger. Then he took the chest in one hand and left the scene.<br>
<br>
He looked at the chest and recognized the family crest on it, the Moonsong family. As Gatsu passed their estate he tossed the chest through a dark open window. <br>
<br>
As he walked out of Felwithe Gatsu flipped the ring into the air as one would a coin. The emblem of the Crytalbrooke family shone in the dim moonlight. Catching the coin with a sweeping hand he smiles at the trinket. The prize for this ring was indeed high, and he had the inside track on the kill. Gatsu lightly touched the small book safely tucked into his belt.<br>
<br>
With that a shadow passed over the moon and it darkened the night to pitch black. When the light returned the warrior was gone.<br>

Isharra arrived late to the servants standing slack-jawed staring at her father, who knelt, still in his sleeping gown,  next to something on the floor. The hall was dark but for a few candles and lamps held by the servants, and ugly, dark shadows performed a hideous dance along the walls. <br>
<br>
A feeling of forboding settled in the pit of Isharra's belly as the servants parted nervously, opening a path for her. The movement alerted her father and he lifted his face, his face hard and grim. Isharra heard the jingle of coins falling to the floor as her father stood, holding out a hand to keep her away.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Isharra. Return to your chamber,&quot; he ordered, his voice cold authority. But Isharra could not take her eyes off of his sleeping gown, or rather the spattering of dark marks covering the front. Though they looked black in the darkness, Isharra could smell the blood and identified it immediately. <br>
<br>
Her lips moved wordlessly as she tried to form the question. &quot;Wh- what is this?&quot; she managed hoarsely, her terrified emerald eyes shifting to the open chest on the floor. <br>
<br>
But before Jaryll could answer, voices filled the night outside the open window. A cry of alarm drifted in with the breeze, and suddenly the door began to shake as someone pounded frantically on it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Master Moonsong! Are you all right!?&quot; came a voice. Jaryll managed to get to the door just in time to prevent it being knocked in. Two Felwithe guards stood outside, worried eyes peering through their helmets. &quot;We heard a ruckus and came to check. There's evil in Felwithe tonight, my Lord.&quot; The guard's eyes drifted to Jaryll's blood-speckled tunic and then  at the mess on the floor. Isharra watched them, stunned, her mind reeling. <br>
<br>
&quot;Evil? What do you mean, man? Speak up!&quot; growled Jaryll, his eyes darting from the guards to the box on the floor. <br>
<br>
Both guards hesitated, looking uncomfortable. &quot;Perhaps we should go someplace private---&quot; he began, but Jaryll cut him off.<br>
<br>
&quot;Speak your mind. There are no children here, sir.&quot; <br>
<br>
The guard shifted his gaze to Isharra for a brief moment then back to the old general. &quot;General Moonsong, Sir, Gareth Crystalbrooke and two of his men have been murdered.&quot; <br>
<br>
Both Isharra's and her father's eyes fell upon the chest in horrified understanding, and Isharra's scream filled the night. <p><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/bshadesofgray30856"><img

Marha was the one to deliver the news. She entered the hall slowly, her face grim and eyes rimmed in red. Isharra's closest comrades and friends were gathered there, awaiting the urgent news that summoned them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Isharra sent me to you,&quot; said the dwarf, pausing a moment to gather her thoughts. &quot;Her betrothed, Gareth Crystalbrooke, is dead, murdered. It's no secret that she held little love for him; nevertheless the brutality of his murder has torn her heart asunder. She will be in mourning for a time. She asks that you make allowances for her current state of mind. I'm sure you all understand.&quot; The little dwarven handmaid curtsied and hurried away, afraid her emotions would break if she were asked to answer any questions.<br>
<br>
And the news soon spread throughout the land that Isharra's betrothal ended tragically; her hopes of marriage were dead. <p><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/bshadesofgray30856"><img

She was on a mission, a mission to learn first-hand about the majestic race that built such beautiful monuments all over Kunark. Many called Iksar evil, pointing to the deaths of Norrathian pilgrims as evidence. But how would the Koada'Dal react if the Iksar moved into Faydwer and began to settle, claiming elven land for their own? <br>
<br>
The Trooper had seen her from afar and made it clear that she was not welcome in his city. But she knew that the Iksar were not without honor, and she planned to prove herself to them, to gain access to their rich and glorious history.  So, lifting her mace, she swung it as a goblin outrider scurried by. It's skull splintered under the crushing blow and Isharra winced. curling her lips in distaste. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she whispered, lifting her mace again as a goblin witchdoctor tried to scurry out of her way. CRUNCH. And thus, the priestess-turned-pest control reluctantly continued her messy work within sight of the Iksar capital, hoping they would notice her service to them and allow her to continue her scholarly pursuits within their city. <p><a href="http://pub36.ezboard.com/bshadesofgray30856"><img

Mard had friends everywhere, but business had been slow, and the only flesh he had left to sell was a fat dwarf, a lame ogre, and two wasted old humans, both gotten in trade for a half-dead horse in Qeynos. Well, the buyer didn't know it was half-dead, anyway. Business had been slow, mainly because the supply of fresh flesh was low. Too many folks staying too close to home, Mard thought bitterly. <br>
<br>
As his cart approached the massive gate to the giant fort,  Mard noticed a commotion upstream from the path. Two giants stood together arguing in their deep, guttural tongue, gesturing excitedly to something on the ground. His curiosity piqued, Mard approached the pair, calling up a  cheerful hello in their own language. <br>
<br>
The giants turned and greeted their tiny human friend with lopsided, ghastly grins as he came to stand between them, his eyes on the ground at their feet. &quot;It my kill, Mardy, mine!&quot; said the giant called Gargle, and the other one pushed him roughly, shouting, &quot;No, Gargle KS it from me, Mardy! I tried to tell GM, but he only say if he not see it, it not happen!&quot; At once the two giants started arguing again when Mardy held up his hand, hollering, &quot;Quiet! Well, I fer one know how useless GMs can be sometimes. So, I'll help ya out.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mard knelt next to the crumpled form on the ground, turning her over gently. His hand stroked the smooth skin of the high elf's face and he laughed aloud, praising Bristlebane for his good fortune.  Not taking his eyes off his prize, he called up to the giants, &quot;I'll give ya four bodies fer this pathetic piece o' meat, fellas,&quot; knowing the giants would be too dumb to realize the worth of their catch. <br>
<br>
&quot;Four?!&quot; exclaimed Giggle, holding up five fingers and jumping up and down. &quot;Sure, Mardy, Sure! Take this one if you want it. I'm hungry!&quot;<br>
