When I was a younger cleric, all I really cared about was getting more and more wisdom. Now that I have become a bit older, I value AC and resists a fair amount more, and I think that's getting very well reflected in my equipment (( see the link below in my sig, if you want to check out my Magelo ))<br>
<br>
I'm pretty happy with my resists and I still want to work up my AC a bit. My goal is to have an unbuffed AC of 1000 or so, without sacrificing too many of my other stats.  My resists are all above 80 (regardless of what Magelo says - I have some disease and poison augments I've added on to my gear)).<br>
<br>
I'm trying to keep in mind AC and +mana items as my next upgrades, since I see some clerics my season having 200 to 300 more mana than I do. It helps that I have Spellcasting Mastery 3 and Mental Clarity 1, but that can't really make up for extra mana *plus* those abilities. <br>
<br>
I'd also like to upgrade my current &quot;resist-only&quot; slots - namely, my mask and my rings. I will likely keep my rings, if I can ever find +wisdom augments for them. As for the face slot, it's something I've been looking to upgrade for a while. There is a comparable LDoN-earnable mask which I think I might end up getting, but I'm not sure yet.<br>
<br>
I also hope to do the clockwork talismans for my neck, so that's the other thing I really want to look at doing.<br>
<br>
So, care to show off your equipment and discuss your strategies for wearing what you have? I'd love to hear it.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

You still need your resist gear but it is situational.  Most xp zones don't need high resists.  I carry around a few pieces and switch as needed.<br>

By that I don't mean that these stats do nothing - even if by casual observation I'd say they do very little - but rather that you're invariably left with better options rather than wearing items solely for their AC or resist benefits.<br>
<br>
Here are the important things to consider in my opinion, listed pretty much in the order in which I rate them.<br>
<br>
1) Focus effects. A single critical focus effect is usually worth more than the stats of several items combined. The most important for any caster is mana preservation. Read gravely's text about the spell casting mastery aa for the math, as this applies to mana preservation too. <br>
<br>
The second most important focus effect would be improved healing. The main task of a cleric is to heal, and an extra 1-20% to a quick heal can often save the day.<br>
<br>
Spell haste is handy, but a lot of cleric combat spells aren't affected by spell haste, like supernal remedy, DA, DB, stuns, greater immobilize and complete heal. In fact, post 60 I think the only cleric combat spells affected by spell haste are pacification and supernal light. Having spell haste to cast virtue is certainly handy, but hardly a measure of performance.<br>
<br>
Extended reinforcement may seem interesting, but it doesn't work on the spells you really want extended, like the elixir line, yaulp, and DA/DB. To extend these, you'll need aa pts - and at the present moment that would dramatically reduce your pacification duration.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Flowing thought: A cleric's mana <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>regeneration</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> - not necessarily mana pool - is often the bottleneck on how effective a group will be, is definitely what's holding back a large amount of raids, and is certainly directly affecting the degree of effectiveness at which you can solo. <br>
<br>
<br>
3) HP vs Mana. This is something you have to decide for yourself. A long time ago on my previous server, I was leveling my little enchanter, and I was dying a lot. As I was painfully going up through the levels I started noticing a disturbing tendency: I was invariably dying with quite a bit of mana left, and very rarely was going oom and getting myself or someone else killed as a consequence. So I started wearing hp gear over int/mana or cha gear. And while the death count went down dramatically, I was still dying with mana left way more often than I was going oom at critical moments. So I kept favoring Hp gear over anything else and until FT gear was released simply never came close to the point where I could consider giving up hp gear for mana gear. This changed with PoP and using charm a lot more and more mana intensive spells, but if I don't have a pet up it's basically the same mechanics and results.<br>
<br>
Now this might not apply entirely to clerics, but from casual observation I see clerics generating a lot of aggro, and I seem to see a lot of clerics dying with tons of mana left . Certainly a lot more than I see calling oom at a critical moment. So my suggestion if that's the case, is first to look in your gameplay habits to see if you could do anything to increase your survivability. And after doing that start trading out wis/mana gear for hp gear, and keep doing that until you get close to a  point where your amount of dying with significant mana left is starting to balance out with the amount time you get oom at a critical moment.<br>
<br>
Also, remember that going out of mana can be the result of attrition over a long period of time, and for that increasing your mana pool by even a large amount will do very little. You'd much better off with investing in FT gear instead in these situations, or even better, mana preservation if you don't have any.<br>

<br>
Mana/wisdom in itself is not as important.  It's not terribly difficult to get your wisdom up to 255+ anyway, so start trading things out.  <br>
<br>
Trade out for what?  <br>
<br>
Well, first... I think it goes without saying, Mana preservation, flowing thought.  Other focuse effects are important.<br>
<br>
HP are VERY important.  Every little bit helps.  When I put on my gear, I double my hp now.  I'm getting close to 2k hp unbuffed, which is pretty good for a non-raiding enchanter I think?  But just being able to take one more hit without getting blood aggro can mean life or death sometimes.<br>
<br>
Also maybe look into something with +channeling.  Channel that heal through and you'll give the tank a lot more time to save you.<br>
<br>
These thing obviously don't help as much in raid situations, but are an incredible benefit in single group hunts.<br>
<br>
Just some ideas<br>

As a cleric, we already get a spell haste buff, so I wouldn't spend a whole lot on one of these items. I love my reagent conservation item to swap in and save a few peridots here and there, and I've found extended range to be helpful especially in outdoor areas. (It can really throw things off when someone goes out of range mid-complete heal, when you can only find out after its over. The little extra range gives some more breathing room).<br>
<br>
Flowing thought - nice, but also very expensive. (That may not be a problem for you though).<br>
<br>
AC - Mine isn't really high. Maybe it should be higher, but there always seemed to be more important things to focus on.<br>
<br>
Resists - I usually swap things in/out when I need more or less resists. I don't raid much, so its not as important to me, but I still like to be able to get my resists up there when I need to (like in LDoN versus many PoP zones).<br>
<br>
HP - I haven't tried yet to get a lot of hp- gear, but I think its a good way to go. My question to those of you who posted: Do you look just for straight hp or is stamina a good thing to beef up on? <br>
<br>
I've been lucky enough to get a hold of three wisdom augments, which really helps me free up slots to upgrade. <br>
<br>
I'm still working on SCM 3, but with KEI/Tranquility and a decent group mana is rarely an issue. But for some groups I've been in (last night in Takish for example- warrior, ranger, wizard, necro, bard, cleric), mana does become very important. <br>
<br>
You must not forget about style, too. Some helms are hideously ugly, and I think Mely looks cuter in a chainmail tunic versus a plate chestpiece. For a long time, I wore a robe for the looks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The true effect of fashion on gameplay is debateable though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Your level 63 healing spell (can't remember what its called) is basically the replacement for complete heal. Although it chews up alot of mana for pop fights it is really really good. To make it most effective use a spell have IV item with the revernence buff to make its cast time quite fast. If you then have the improved healing aa and items the amount of hit points per second you can heal is amazing. This can come in very handy in pop named mob fights where the mob has a huge dps but very few hitpoints.... ie the fights dont last long enough for your FT to come into effect.<br>
<br>
For me personally the mana preservation focus effects are not that important as I generally group with a bard and chanter... thus mana regen isnt holding me back.... its just how many hitpoints I can heal per second that counts.<br>
<br>
Also don't forget that having lots of flowing thought isnt nescarrilly better than having a large mana pool. Lots of flowing thought is good for xp grinding, but for raiding and killing named mobs having a big mana pool is important. Just think how long it takes FT1 to regen 100 mana (10 minutes)... ie longer than the duration of most important battles..<br>

If you then have the improved healing aa and items the amount of hit points per second you can heal is amazing.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Complete Healing still generates more healing per second.  Healing AAs apply to complete healing, too (I'm at 8925 base).  Even with IH4, complete healing &gt; supernal light.  I rarely, rarely memorize that spell... because a maxed-AA, IH4 Supernal Remedy is just fine when you need speed (up to 2115 non-crit, 16% chance of crit, maximum of which is 3926).  Supernal Light has one definite good use that Iumuno brought to my attention... suppose you're on a CH chain, and your supernal light runs 3 seconds with full spell haste.  If you're trying to stay out of range of an AE and you hit your CH button and get an out of range message, don't panic... count to 7 as you get in range, then cast supernal light... at least you'll deliver a fairly large heal when your CH would have landed.<br>
<br>
Spell haste is good for a couple other spells, ethereal elixir (but usually that's not time-critical, since it's a heal over time and only does 300/tick for 4 ticks) and Word of Replenishment, and even Word of Restoration (group CH, so you can cut it from 12 to 9 seconds with BoR and 15% item spell haste).<br>
<br>
I agree fully with Iumuno about hitpoints.  I don't believe in AC (at least for clerics) either.  I mean yes, it does something, but my job is not to be an efficient tank.  My job is to keep the group, including myself alive.<br>
<br>
Suppose you have say, roughly 1600 hps and Virtue and BAotR put you at 3300, with 1200 AC.  Now, you're fighting something that triples for 600, and you're medding.  You catch some heal aggro when you next sit, and get tripled for 1800 total, putting you at 1500.  Now, suppose you can't ditch aggro.  What happens if the mob does 83% or more of its max round on the next round of attacks?  You die.  Even if it only does just over 700 damage next round, you're under 25% hps (at 800 out of 3300) and you'll have &quot;blood aggro&quot; or &quot;frenzy aggro&quot; or whatever people call it here on FV.  That forces you to heal yoursel with a fast heal, and creates more aggro.<br>
<br>
Now, if instead you went for hps, got up to say 2300 with only 1000 AC, then buffed you're at 4000.  You get hit sitting and take 1800, putting you at 2200.  Two things have changed.  A max round from the mob <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>cannot kill you</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  In addition, in order to stay above blood aggro level (25% or 1000 hps) you can take up to 1200 damage in the next round, or 66% of its max round without blood aggro.  In this case, the hitpoints are more likely to keep you alive.<br>
<br>
Resists - I agree with Iumuno again.  For efficiency on long fights, sure, they're invaluable.  But really, if you're talking survivability, hitpoints are the only way to guarantee survival.  It's a rare AE that's going to kill you outright, but there are some 3k to 3500 AEs out there.  Here's maybe a good example.  Suppose you are off to kill Trakanon.  He likes to dot you up good.  His AE has like a n300 resist adjust.  To even begin to think about resisting it, you need 400+ poison resists.  Keep in mind, Trak is going to AE more than once, so don't think a fluke resist is enough.  To get halfway reliable resists of the AE you need 450+, and to really consistently resist it, we're talking 500 svp.  Why would you sacrifice hitpoints to try to attain that, though?  Why not just get enough hitpoints so you a) survive the AE, and b) buy more time to cure/heal yourself (raidant cure &gt; all for trak's breath) and c) don't get blood aggro and get summoned and chomped on.<br>
<br>
Another benefit of hitpoints is you increase the effectiveness of Divine Arbitration.  If you add 600 hps to yourself, you add 100 hps to the group's average... that's 100 more hitpoints someone gets when you use Divine Arbitration to save them.  You're effectively adding 100 to your &quot;heal&quot; from that ability.<br>
<br>
Best ways to add hps:<br>
<br>
1) got an item that's 15 wisdom and 25 mana?  Consider replacing it with a good hp item.  Probably your wisdom is plenty high anyway.<br>
<br>
2) ignore AC on items.  Just don't even consider it as a factor.  Many good hp items have good AC anyway, so you won't have a problem with a low AC if you go for hitpoints.<br>
<br>
3) Ignore fire, cold, poison and disease resists on items.  See 2).  You'll get resists anyway in the process, just don't stress about any except MR, and don't stress *too* much about that one, either.<br>
<br>
Focus items &gt; hps.  See Iumuno's post.  Mana Preservation &gt; all.<br>
<br>
I see from your magelo you did SCR2.  Your Pacification duration is already &quot;broken&quot; from the (bugged) 5 minutes, so now there's no reason not to do SCR3 and SCRM.  They should increase duration on heals over time, divine aura/barrier, etc, from what I've been told.  Good stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Natural Durability is a good AA skill... it will add about 300 hps total for me (roughly 60/90/150), but I haven't finished it yet because cleric AAs are generally quite good and there are a ton of things I wanted first. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The amount of hp/second that CH generates is very dependent upon the amount of hitpoints your tank has.<br>
<br>
Lets say an average tank (not talking FnF's top raid tank).. say raid buffed... is going to have what 6500 hitpoints... give or take a few.<br>
<br>
And lets say your average complete heal hits them when they are at 30% (its probably higher, much lower and you risk the tank dying from a flurry)... that means your CH is doing ummm.... 4500 hit points per heal.<br>
<br>
So we can thus theorise that complete heal does 450 hit points per second (10 second cast time).<br>
<br>
Now lets look at supernal (damn forgotten its name already..)...<br>
<br>
With appropriate aa's and focus effects it will produce an easy 3000 hit point heal.<br>
<br>
Given the fast cast focus and revernance it takes what 3 seconds to cast....<br>
<br>
That gives supernal remedy 1000 hit points per second.<br>
<br>
So in summary,<br>
<br>
Complete heal 450 hps<br>
Supernal remedy 1000hps<br>
<br>
Clearly supernal remedy is the vastly superior spell when you have an &quot;average&quot; tank. If you tank has like 10000 hit points raid buffed the results are clearly different and will begin to favour CH more and more..<br>
<br>
Clearly this doesnt take into account mana effeciency etc etc, It just shows that for high dps mobs you have a healing spell that has the high hps to counter with.<br>

Boots of flowing slime is great to have a CoTH mage to summon you there,just a little less hassle with invis and all.<br>
<br>
Maybe when you hit 62 can think about Akkirus BP.You will have great spells then and can do Halls of Testing with one group.Maybe cultural BP till then.<br>
