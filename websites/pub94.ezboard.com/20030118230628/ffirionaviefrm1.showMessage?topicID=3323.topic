I can see why it is tempting. I personally don't have the time to sit and play for 2 years farming to get enough money to buy one. Not saying i am going to use my real life cash to get one, but i don't see why people are not tempted and i dont see whats wrong with it. If they want to do that then fine...<br>

Aside from self respect, ethical retardation, and lack of accomplishment issues, there are also very real quantifiable problems with people buying platinum/items for real cash. <br>
<br>
For starters, many of the e-bay suppliers are organized and can permacamp an area farming it 24/7 thereby depriving Joe Adventurer of the rewards of a given camp.  Seen stormfeather lately?  Unlike standard characters that play by the rules, cash farmers start out with the understanding that what they are doing is prohibited. There is no reason for them NOT to use third party software to detect rare/named spawns.  All they need to do is enter a zone, check their other box for spawns, and see what loot they have, then take their hydra in and it's all over.<br>
<br>
Second, they use exploits to gain platinum to sell. Remember the recent fletching nerf?  Thanks to pp traders that used a third party script to farm platinum, EVERY fletcher in the game was horribly affected. Now instead of making a few platinum on the way to 250 fletching, it costs nearly 50,000pp in total.<br>
<br>
Third, on the buyers side, Most e-bayed characters have no idea how to play their class. Sure they may have an uber level 65 manburning wizard, but they can easily get an entire raid wiped if they screw up and nuke at the wrong time. This goes for any class, it takes time to learn to play your character well.  Buying a character robs the buyer of critical knowledge that can only be gained through hundreds of hours of play. Grouping with an inept player will very possibly lead to a horrible death and a brutal CR.<br>
<br>
Fourth, by buying said items, you are encouraging scammers to use any method necessary to acquire goods, that includes outright stealing items (like horses), using the trade window macro . You are also opening yourself up to be scammed mercilously. Try complaining to SoE when someone doesn't deliver your uber sword of asskicking that you paid $100.00 for. I don't see your complaint getting much attention.<br>
<br>
Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But it's pretty clear to me that nothing positive can result from spending real cash on fictional items/platinum. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grimjakkghostripper>Grimjakk Ghostripper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/02 1:24:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3323.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: one word</span><hr size=1> Traxxus... exactly right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caillougna>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pebble with a bow</span><br>  Posts: 953<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/02 2:33:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3323.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: one word</span><hr size=1> As for a casual player thinking he/she is being shorted by, say, not having the plat to buy a horse.  Umm.... why do you think you are entitled to have a horse?  If you don't play a lot, why do you even need one?  if you play in the level range where a horse becomes more desirable, then you will also be in the level range where making money becomes more viable.  Simple.<br>
<br>
To state it another way... if you are in your 20s and don't play frequently enough and so only gain a level a month, of course you aren't going to be able to afford a horse.  By the same token, you aren't going to -need- a horse the same way a 50+ enchanter who frequently goes on raids would.  The 50+ enchanter probably has several ways and means to make the money he/she needs to buy that horse.<br>
<br>
The more common excuse/reason I have heard to justify the out of game purchases is j-boots or the pegasus cloak.  In both cases, part of the reason (as stated by a previous poster) the item to get can be sooooo hard to obtain is because of the for-RL-profit campers.  Purchasing from them continues to encourage that behaviour which means those who &quot;honestly&quot; want to get it can't and then feel forced into purchasing it from the for-RL-profit campers *sigh*.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how even -that- can be justification to buy and sell plat and items in game for real money.  I still think it is bluing our server to do so.<br>
<br>
Oh... and though that one company may not have entered FV until recently, the act of buying and selling things on FV for real money has been around... probably from the 1st week the server went live.  But I do think it has gotten more rampent with the explosive growth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vagnarfv>VagnarFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/02 2:40:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3323.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: one word</span><hr size=1> Good point Caillou.<br>
Yantis is not the 'only' one out there.  S/he just has a site dedicated to it.  (and the prices on yantis' site is more expensive than other on say .. playerauctions ..)<br>
<br>
One point on horses.  Why do people want them?  Because of the mana issue.  Because casters can med and stand while on horseback.  IMnsHO, that is a bug that needs to be fixed.  Horses do not provide some 'mythical mana regeneration quality'.  It is a form of transportation.<br>
<br>
Oh, and sad to say Caillou, FV is more blue than any of the 'old timers' would care to admit.  Ever since May 8, it was turned into a 'blue'.  Sad, but true.<br>

There are several reasons casters by horses. One, you are considered sitting when not moving or meleeing. This is huge means you can cast and regen at same time. No more canni dance for us shaman. THe other big reason is there is no sit down agro while on a horse. So mobs are not ping ponging back in forth between medding casters.<br>

I play -a lot-, am now in my late 40s and I am starting to hit into the things that are making me money (well, combining incomes for Bippin and I... seems to be working *smirk*).  If I were to look at my -play- time vs a casual player's -play- time, we probably make about the same amount of plat though my -real- time (as in days, weeks, months by the real world calendar) would be less.  THAT is what I was saying.  It's true whether the object of desire is a horse, an uber stick of thwacking, a mighty sword of slicing and dicing, or whatever.

I got bored of DII because it was nothing more than that.  The real purple of the server is in the hearts and creativity of those who roleplay and continue to do so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naari@firionavie>Naari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/02 4:08:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3323.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To stop some of it</span><hr size=1> Remind me to stay clear of Noggy. Between this post and his post about too many guilds, it is clear he and I see things VERY differently.<br>
<br>
Others have stated reasons for why allowing people to buy plat, etc. with outside cash causes problems in game. I don't need to rehash that.<br>
<br>
I would like to deal with the whole gear issue.<br>
<br>
Yes horses are nice. Yes it would be great to have the most expensive one. Yes it would be great to even have the least expensive one. I don't. When I earn the money, I will.<br>
<br>
Is it necessary to have that or any other particular piece of gear? No.<br>
<br>
As I stated in the other thread, I could easily level my mage buck naked except for food, water, and pet components.<br>
<br>
In many situations I could level my cleric buck naked and my group wouldn't suffer for it. (Mana recovery rate is more important than Mana pool in many situations).<br>
<br>
If I was a melee type, gear would be more important. Even so, it isn't that difficult to cheaply equip a melee character with gear that would have been considered Uber when this game came out.<br>
<br>
What I am getting at is this - there is no need for a casual player to get items outside the game since casual play does not require it.<br>

These abilities are limited by real life, can you afford 2 accs, 2 comps, and not to work so that you can play all the time.<br>
<br>
 I am not saying that I would buy anything from these people for RL Â£, nor am I condoning the methods used to &quot;farm&quot; the items or whatever that are available to purchase. <br>
<br>
 I would say I am new to any kind of RPing and not sure of the pen and paper side of things, I realise that some people reading this forum may have been doing this for years, so I put a question to these people: If I had to work away from home in RL for a week I wouldn't get my fix of EQ and wouldn't have made my usual 400 plat in that week ( don't laugh that is my average income not being much of a trader).<br>
  <br>
 Now with the money I make from my extra hours or whatever I buy the plat to purchase a bridle.<br>
<br>
 If I were to return to my friends in game on horseback they would ask firstly where I had been, and secondly where I got the horse ( just an example I don't have a horse or work away from home much at all). If I were to reply that I had taken a job mucking out stables on the moon in return for an old nag that was headed for the knackers yard and had the Rp tale of what happened is that not as valid a way of role playing as any other.<br>
<br>
 It ain't going happen mind you this is a purely hypothetical conundrum. Just wanted an opinion or 2.<br>
<br>
Anyway just wondered how this sort of thing stands. If it is a ridiculous idea say so.<br>

Now, if you did it all the time or let that one thing let you be drawn to the dark side.... you see.. it is a slippery slope, if you take the easy route once (some of us can afford more in RL than we can in-game), then you'll see it is easy to justify again.  Not everyone does, but... it is jsut to easy to succumb to such.  <br>

This is like the twinking threads, whines about how it is cheating to allow others to have stuff are just that whines. Let me see if I have this right. If I get Joe schmuck to give me 20000 PP for what ever reason that is ok, but if I buy 20000 PP that is bad.<br>
<br>
If you dont agree with buying items and money, Dont. If you catch someone hacking the game, report them.  So where are all these mythical farmers at? Who has been denied the opportunity to hunt somewhere exactly?<br>
<br>
When someone posts a provable condition where others have been denied the ability to hunt somewhere cause Joe Farmer was there to raise cash to sell for real life cash, maybe I will worry about it. Till then I havent been inconvienced by any farmers except the times I wanted to hunt Hill Giants to get PP myself. And I doubt any of them were farmers of PP for sale to the highest bidder, they were just people like me trying to raise some cash.<br>

Eventually tho', the folks who cared more about being &quot;uber&quot; and &quot;winning&quot; started to crossteam.  They had all sorts of rationalizations, but what it came down to was that it was easier to ignore the rules of the community and group/guild with the enemy than it was to fight.  <br>

No matter how much time you play, what items you aquire, it is still the intellectual property of Sony/VI.  All these auction sites are just taking advantage of the currently poorly enforced intellectual property laws.  I would love to see Sony set up some stings and start deleting accounts and voiding the account keys of people they catch violating the EULA in this way.

<br>
 When you come to these boards you need to put the weapons down and put them back in your holster. Of course you are entitled to your opnions but you need to start approacing my comments with a less defensive stance buddy.<br>
<br>
 I am merely provided arguments to WHY people who play this game would see an attraction in buying a horse for real money. I NEVER said that is what I would do or am doing. I won't buy anything for real money and although I too would like that horse I am never going to afford it and am certainly not paying real cash for it. <br>
<br>
For those of you accusing me of being  loot dude, I can say you don't know me at all. For those that know me know that I play this game for fun and to talk to online friends i have aqquired on this server. I just mentioned reasons for why this would be an attraction and gave an example of how someone  like me who plays regularly but not regularyl enough to afford a 100k horse would be tempted by such. Is this perfectly clear guys??<br>

It is entirely possible you are a swell guy. In your other post on guilds, the eventual point you got to, that guilds should band together so they can accomplish more together than individually is something I certainly can agree with.<br>
<br>
However, it isn't what came across in the original post and I altogether disagree that there are too many guilds. As I said there, I would like to see even more guilds.<br>
<br>
Here, you took the viewpoint that buying items with real world money is ok. Many on this server feel very differently. In fact, even on blue servers, many feel differently. On this server in particular, with its supposed RP preferred orientation, many feel that this is just another part of the slippery slope that would lead us to be just like the other servers. Speaking for myself, that is NOT something I want to see happen.<br>
<br>
Tolerance is held up as a virtue now days, in and of itself. But frankly tolerance of some things leads inevitably to those things becoming common place. I'm not going to be tolerant of the viewpoint you expressed here for that reason.<br>
<br>
The truth is that we do apparently see things very differently. From what you have said it is abundantly clear to me that I would never feel comfortable in your guild. There are probably many activities I would enjoy doing with you. Being in a guild together probably isn't one of them.<br>
<br>
Judging from these two topics and your responses, I am honestly puzzled why you want to play on this server.<br>
<br>
By the way, neither this or the original post in this thread is a flame. You have a right to take the viewpoints you did and express them. I do strongly disagree in both cases. I made my case why.<br>
<br>
I agree with those who are worried about the effect farming plat and items for sale in real world money causes. I didn't need to repeat their arguments so I didn't. I do think I addressed why it is completely unnecessary in the first place.<br>
<br>
I understand the temptation for buying something like a horse with real world money. But I am afraid that if that temptation is allowed to flourish and grow, we will have sown the seed of this servers destruction. In my mind, that would be a real shame. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1779<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/02 8:12:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3323.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> One of the things I look for ..</span><hr size=1> .. in a guild is non-tolerance of e-bay: buy/sell anything in game for RL cash and get booted out of guild.
