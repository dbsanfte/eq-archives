Returning from his visit to Luclin and without the aid of a wizard to send him back to Nektulous,  he had no choice but to return home the old fashioned way..  by foot.  <br>
<br>
As he wandered the plains,  heading south to Lake Rathetear,  the sun began to set.   Zoronious,  not being particularly fond of sunlight , released a sigh of comfort as he paused to watch the sun set behind the Mountains of Rathe.    As comfortable as he was in the night,   he was not blind to the dangers which arise once the sun sets.   Zoronious looked cautiously around him as the sunlight faded,  then slung his blade over his back.. sliding into the hard-leather holster which was strapped to his chestplate.   He placed his traveler's pack on the ground before him..  searching the contents inside.  He then drew forth a pair of leather boots..    kneeling, he removed his heavy, plate boots..  replacing them with the leather.   Tossing the plate boots in his pack, he then slung the pack over his shoulder..  and began to walk.. then jog..  eventually picking up speed until he was at full running speed.    As he ran..  he chanted softly..  the leather boots emitting a soft red glow.    Zoronious began to run faster... and faster..    his vision becoming a blur as he ran.<br>
<br>
He continued to speed his way towards the lake,  when in the distant blur of his vision, he could make out what looked to be ruins.  He slowed his speed..  bringing himself to a hault, just before the structures.   The structures seemed to be nothing more than wood and metal..   some housing bells within them..  some so old and decayed that they were falling apart.   As he looked around ,  he noticed that they were all arranged in a large circular formation..  and inside that circle..  were corpses upon corpses..  piled upon layers of bones.   It appeared to be a  burial ground of some sort..  but for who,  Zoronious had no idea.   <br>
<br>
Zoronious walked cautiously through the remains,  bones crunching beneath his feet.  He could see heap of metals amongst the bones and bodies,  their metalic surfaces gleaming as moonlight relfected from them.    As Zoronious looked around him..  he immediately found it odd that everything around him was weathered, rusted, decayed..    except for that bit of gleaming steel.    Curiousity overwhelmed Zoronious,  he walked towards the metal objects.. to investigate them further.    <br>
<br>
As he approached them..  beneath the bones and body parts.. he could see that it was a suit of armor,  finely crafted platemail..  and beneath it..  was a large battle axe.    The axe's blade was covered in writing and runes..   a language which was forgein to Zoronious.   The letters seemed to almost glow in the moonlight.  Feeling the axe could prove a useful weapon..  or at the very least.. fetch a few platinum to a foolish buyer,  he reached forth to grab it.   As he did,  the armor and axe began to shake..  aswell as the bones beneath it..  they continued to shake and rattle ...  as an eerie blue aura sorrounded them.. lifting them into the air.<br>
<br>
The remains, floating in the air,  began to twist and spin as a tornado would..   drawing into it more remains.   Zoronious,  stepping back as he stared curiously at the happenings,  withdrew his sword.    The swirling mass of remains moved towards the center of the circle..  then it burst..  sending fragments of bone and flesh alike, sailing through the air.     Zoronious shielded his face as bits of bone and decayed flesh bounced off of his platemail.    As the dust cleared..   he could see a large figure standing in the midst of the cloud of bone dust lingering in the air still.    The figure stepped forward,  bones crunching beneath each of its steps..  the sound of steel plate grinding together .. filling the air.<br>
<br>
The dust settled further,  allowing the figure to be clearly seen.   It was a large humanoid undead..   its body nothing more than a skeleton..  but it's plate armor still sat upon it's body as though it had flesh.   A dim blue aura sorrounded its bones..  which sent chills up Zoronious' spine.  The figure stood there..  wielding the impressive looking axe in hand..  its hollow eye-sockets fixed upon Zoronious.<br>
<br>
Zoronious approached the creature fearlessly,   as he did so..  he heard a voice..  which appeared to come from all sides of him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Traveler....       you will not take my weapon..   I must unite it with the other four pieces....  I will not let you interfere!!!!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->    shrieked the creature... its eyes filling with a red glow as it spoke.  Zoronious stood there,  raising an eyebrow at the beast..  puzzled at its words. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;I could care less about your trinkets, I have better anyhow....       remove yourself from my path before I do so myself&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  spoke Zoronious,    raising his two-handed blade to the creature's chestplate.. rapping upon it with confidence.   <br>
<br>
The creature bellowed with laughter at Zoronious' words.   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Oh, by the gods little man,  that is the most humerous thing ive heard in years...  im not sure whether you're just courageous..  insane.. or blind as to what stands before you&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said the creature.. still cackling with laughter.      <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Erm...   did you just call me little?...  insane?... and blind?&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->   said Zoronious..  scowling at the creature as he walked towards it.. his blade still at the beast's chestplate.    Puzzled, the creature stepped back as Zoronious paced forward.. staring coldly at the creature.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;You know not what you deal with,  spirit..     for I am one of Innoruuk's chosen..  and I carry his hatred with me...  &quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->    Zoronious drew back his blade as he spoke.. gripping it tightly with both hands.. walking quickly towards the creature.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;I have no tolerance for your ignorance..  &quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  with those words..  Zoronious swung his two-hander into the creatures side..  its left arm falling to the ground as his blade cleaved through its plate and bone.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;I have no tolerance for your insults&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->   He then swung his blade once more .. into the creatures legs..   severing them from its body..  its torso falling to the ground as its legs crumbled.    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;And ..  I have no care of your pitiful belongings..   but... &quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->     and with that..  Zoronious drew back his sword once more..  bringing it down to sever the creatures right arm from its body.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot; since you wanted to be pissy about it..   gimme this goddamned thing&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->    Zoronious reached down..  taking hold of the axe..  the creature's hand still gripping it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;You know not what you are doing, knight!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> shrieked the disabled beast..  staring up at Zoronious <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;The axe will take over!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Hush fool.... I care not..  your axe will pay for my supper&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Zoronious then fiercely brought his foot down upon the creatures skull..  shattering it to pieces beneath his boot.    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;You can keep this,   ..  you'll need it more than  I&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  he plucked the axe from the creature's severed arm..  tossing the remains over his shoulder as he walked away.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Mindless undead..  such a shame that an art as great as necromancy can produce such feeble creations at times&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said Zoronious to himself..  as he dropped the axe to the ground to re-holster his blade.   Looking up into the night sky,  he noticed the position of the moon..  knowing he was running late.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;Hell,  Sarhea's gonna be pissed..  I'm sure I'll never hear the end of it when I arrive.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->   Letting out a sigh,  he reached down to grab the axe..  taking it in hand he once again started on his way.<br>
<br>
As he walked across the plains..  axe in hand..  his thoughts began to race.  His mind was filled with thoughts of ferocity..  anger..  hatred..  bloodlust..  carnage.   His hand gripped the axe tighter..  and tigher.. his palms sweating as he held onto it.   He could feel himself losing control of his body... his muscles contracting..  his mind becoming consumed with rage and violence.  He trekked forth across the plains.. towards the lake still..  feeling as though nothing will stop him from getting there.<br>
<br>
So ran Zoronious..  mindlessly through the night.. only knowing that he must reach the lake..  and that nothing could stand before him..  a hunger for carnage growing within him.. and all other thoughts and feelings dulling out in his mind and body.   The axe's writing glowing a soft blue in the moonlight as he held it out before him...  eager to sink it into the flesh of anyone foolish enough to interfere with his unknown compulsion. <br>
