In any case, here are my questions: <br><br>1. Is FV a deserted server? I remember a few comments online about it being so---and since it's the only server I intend to play in, it'd be a shame if it is... <br><br>2. Are there alot of d00ds running around? This was one of the main reasons I stopped playing UO years back, is the community at FV a mature one? <br><br>3. What's the best race/class for exploring Norrath? I'm one of those 68% explorer people =) So would appreciate any tips regarding this issue. <br><br>Thanks in advance.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator<b>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/6/02 4:36:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1030.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few questions...</span><hr size=1> 1)  No, it's not deserted.  In fact, I'm starting to see a lot of new faces show up, and most of them are brand new to the game.<br><br>2)  You'll run into d00ds, but there are far fewer of them on this server than on the other servers, from what I've seen.  Only one of them has promised to 'get his level 40 friend to kill me'.  I was still laughing as he zoned.<br><br>3)  My personal favorite is Vah Shir, but any race will do nicely.  Your best bet for exploration is a rogue, as they can sneak/hide into just about everywhere from level 3 on up.<br><br>If you're interested in the class, www.thesafehouse.org has a lot of good information on it.<br><br>Wizards seem to be good at getting around also.  As are enchanters.  If you're an enchanter, then the best bet for exploring is to be agnostic, as religious faction can't be hidden by illusions.<br><br>Of course, your best bet of all is to get in with a group and explore.  Then you get the benefits of being with many different classes at once.  It's a big Norrath.  Enjoy it. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>Taruun of Shar Val<BR><BR>Master Cook <BR>Lousy Fletcher<BR>Grandmaster Lech<BR><I>"Show me a good mouser and I'll show you a cat with bad breath" -- Garfield</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uebine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ebine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/6/02 6:28:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1030.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few questions...</span><hr size=1> FYI now is a good time to start on this server. It is a fairly young server and there are a lot of new guilds starting out so you will be able to see all aspects of everquest. When I started my char on my first server I had to wait for a long while before I was old enough to go on raids. On this server people are actually raiding warrens at times. <br><br>The server isnt empty but its not that full either. Best bet is to look for a guild to join. Look at the content that each guild has and find one that you like.

I like to have a healer along with me at 10, since you can't practice backstab if you're soloing, and that's your bread and butter.<br><br>Clerics, Druids, and Shamen abound on this server, and all of them like having a nice big wall between them and the mob.  As well, most are willing to tank for you while you practice backstab against light blues and low blues, and using your evade you can give or take agro pretty much at will.  Running as a duo in this manner can take you as high as 25.<br><br>Once you hit 25, you might want to look at joining a guild.  Yes, it is possible to solo all the way to 60, but I wouldn't recommend it.  In a group you can dish more damage in a short amount of time than just about any other melee class (given that you have the best possible gear for your level).  You can tank in a pinch, you can steal the mobs' attention from the main assist when he/she is getting low, you can instill doubt in an emergency, you can sense and disarm traps (very important in Luclin), you can pickpocket for fun and profit, and most importantly, you'll be able to do CR's for those of good allignment (who can't get their corpse summoned by a necro on this server) with relative impunity and you can make poisons (which are very nice).<br><br>Yes, there are drawbacks.  You have relatively low HP for a melee class.  Your lower level piercing weapons do lousy damage.  You don't get 2Hand Slashing skills.  You constantly need to be staring at the mob's butt.  There's more, but I think you get the point.<br><br>If you choose rogue, enjoy!  Whatever you choose, have fun with it and group often. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>Taruun of Shar Val<BR><BR>Master Cook <BR>Lousy Fletcher<BR>Grandmaster Lech<BR><I>"Show me a good mouser and I'll show you a cat with bad breath" -- Garfield</I></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxharian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xharian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/7/02 3:42:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1030.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Don't be afraid of alignments....</span><hr size=1> Hi again, getting the game tomorrow (either the trilogy or just the original--not sure yet) Here's the classes/races I'd really love to play roleplay as:<br><br>1.

For exploring you have a couple different routes: if you like to see a lot of new places, bard, druid, wizard, and maybe shaman fit that (they have good runspeed or ports or both and invisibility).  If you like seeing dangerous spots others rarely see, try rogue, enchanter, or monk.  Rogue has invis and invis-to-undead at the same time -- can go nearly anywhere at level 1 in (slow) safety.  Enchanter has either invis or invis-to-undead -- can go most places by picking the right invis.
