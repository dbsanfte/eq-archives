<br>
---<br>
<br>
ladeesman146: mr anderson<br>
RWAnderson: Yes?<br>
ladeesman146: Seems we have a .. problem with authority.<br>
RWAnderson: Uh-huh.<br>
ladeesman146: just kidding :-)<br>
RWAnderson: So, first off, who's this?<br>
ladeesman146: Who is this Mr. Anderson?<br>
RWAnderson: Well, I have a few guesses, but I'm going to hold them close to my chest.<br>
ladeesman146: A few guesses to whom you are?<br>
ladeesman146: You know not your identity?<br>
RWAnderson: I want to know yours.<br>
ladeesman146: I am John<br>
RWAnderson: John?<br>
ladeesman146: My students call me Mr. Dough. I hear you work over at UCR<br>
RWAnderson: Mr. Dough, huh?<br>
ladeesman146: Yes, you can call me John.<br>
ladeesman146: What should I call you?<br>
RWAnderson: Well...  that would depend.<br>
RWAnderson: Apparently, you teach, huh?<br>
ladeesman146: I say what is in books and hope it penetrates the mind of students, yes.<br>
RWAnderson: *nod*<br>
RWAnderson: Okay, then my initial two guesses were wrong.<br>
ladeesman146: Which were they may I ask?<br>
RWAnderson: No one you would know, I'm sure.<br>
RWAnderson: So which John is this?<br>
ladeesman146: Thee John of course?<br>
RWAnderson: *eyeroll*<br>
ladeesman146: Im kidding<br>
ladeesman146: I guess it is true what they say about UCR professors haha ;-)<br>
ladeesman146: What exactly do you teach again?<br>
RWAnderson: And what's that?<br>
ladeesman146: They say they are almost as uptight as us RCC professors, except RCC professors are losers.<br>
RWAnderson: Ah, okay.<br>
ladeesman146: So what exactly do you teach?<br>
RWAnderson: Figure it out, hon.<br>
ladeesman146: Hmmm<br>
ladeesman146: John<br>
ladeesman146: You mixed up the o and h and forgot a J<br>
ladeesman146: Is your first name rich or rick?<br>
RWAnderson: Hm.  Nope.<br>
ladeesman146: What is it?<br>
RWAnderson: Or...  maybe it is.<br>
ladeesman146: Has to be rich MAYBE rick.<br>
RWAnderson: Could be.  Might not be.<br>
ladeesman146: No it has to be.<br>
RWAnderson: Why's that?<br>
ladeesman146: It just is.<br>
ladeesman146: Fits you.<br>
RWAnderson: Hm.  Interesting.<br>
ladeesman146: Philosophy must pique your interest does it not ?<br>
RWAnderson: On occasion.<br>
ladeesman146: Hmm<br>
ladeesman146: Rob or Bob<br>
ladeesman146: What is the difference between queer and gay Robob ?<br>
RWAnderson: Take a look at the site.<br>
ladeesman146: Link me it.<br>
RWAnderson: Nah...<br>
RWAnderson: So.  How's Corona?<br>
ladeesman146: Robert W. Anderson 6'8&quot; 175lbs light brown hair blue eyes age 29 lives in southern california area<br>
ladeesman146: openly gay and has been since the age of  18<br>
ladeesman146: wishes everyone would stop the hate, and start to appreciate and recognize<br>
ladeesman146: English grad and foci of lez/gay studies (wtf is that if i may so rudely ask?) colonialism and post colonialism and victorian studies<br>
RWAnderson: Hmmm...  should update the site, seems like.  Been a while.<br>
ladeesman146: Aye<br>
ladeesman146: sci-fi.. bleh only some sci-fi is good<br>
ladeesman146: politics *applauso*<br>
RWAnderson: And if you want to know what any of that is, well...  Use a library.<br>
ladeesman146: liberal? democrat?<br>
RWAnderson: You tell me.<br>
ladeesman146: well one in the same<br>
RWAnderson: When you're 16 and everything's black and white, yeah.<br>
ladeesman146: just didnt want my question to seem rich in brevity and seen as demanding<br>
ladeesman146: Everything has to be black and white as relativity is a self-defeating clause<br>
ladeesman146: some black is closer to white and some white is closer to black, but there is an imaginary line that separates the 2, there is no gray :-)<br>
ladeesman146: Do you believe in relativity or absolute truth?<br>
RWAnderson: Read my work, you'll figure that out.<br>
ladeesman146: Im sorry I like to hear what people believe from them and not have to sift through papers to find this.<br>
ladeesman146: Come on im 16 and naive, enlighten me<br>
ladeesman146: I promise I wont flame or be mean.. no pun intended :-)<br>
RWAnderson: Sift through the papers, you'll figure it out.<br>
ladeesman146: Why cant we have a direct conversation or debate on it?<br>
ladeesman146: Dont tell me this ignorant youth has intimidated you enough to not have a direct convo or debate online about it ?<br>
RWAnderson: Give me one good reason it would be in my interest to do so.<br>
ladeesman146: I find it interesting. Im openminded and like to hear how other people view things.<br>
RWAnderson: That's your interest.<br>
RWAnderson: Tell me why it's in my interest.<br>
ladeesman146: Nay your own.<br>
ladeesman146: From what I have read, you want people to recognize and stop the hate.<br>
RWAnderson: Hm.  You didn't read too much, then.<br>
ladeesman146: I personally dont think we need to recognize homosexual marriages (ill use homo for short, but not in a derrogitive way just clears up room)<br>
ladeesman146: i dont hate lesbians or gay people either tho<br>
ladeesman146: You want other gay people to be aware to take back the word queer too<br>
ladeesman146: Im a backwards hick republican who is intolerant so please enlighten me.. specifically on relativity and absolute truth. Teach me as it were.<br>
RWAnderson: Go read a little Derrida, figure things out.<br>
ladeesman146: Blah<br>
RWAnderson: I see.  You'd rather be spoon-fed the answer.<br>
ladeesman146: I dont see how the gay and lesbian population being so small can sit back and not be vocal about their beliefs<br>
ladeesman146: No<br>
ladeesman146: Id rather hear it from someone who blieves it and can answer question<br>
ladeesman146: Fine then if you will not teach me what you believ Ill simply state what I believe and i guess you can come back from there.. or not *shrug*<br>
RWAnderson: Or I can just block you.<br>
ladeesman146: I dont think homosexual marriages need to be recognized, and I think homosexuality is morally wrong. However, I still do not hate lesbians or homosexuals<br>
ladeesman146: /shrug<br>
RWAnderson: I see no point in further pursuing this conversation.<br>
ladeesman146: *sigh* If only people would answer when people had questions and would stop mindless parades and protests that have no coherence no clear message with answers to questions.. we might get somewhere<br>
RWAnderson: Says the 16-year-old-straightboy-who-knows-everything-cuz-he's-experienced-it.<br>
ladeesman146: I dont need to experience drugs to kno they are harmful<br>
ladeesman146: I dont need to experience a lot of things to they are not beneficial or even detrimental.<br>
RWAnderson: Wow, you bought that one hook-line-and-sinker, too, huh?<br>
ladeesman146: No I saw facts from more than one source and made a logical conclusion<br>
RWAnderson: *pats you on the head* Good for you.  You get a cookie.<br>
RWAnderson: Gold star, too.<br>
ladeesman146: Ah thanks<br>
ladeesman146: a big one?<br>
RWAnderson: Only if you're a size-queen.<br>
ladeesman146: Funny you make pithy remarks yet you refuse to give me any content or facts or any logic or philosophy<br>
ladeesman146: then you point me elsewhere<br>
ladeesman146: This simple fact already puts negative marks on your side to anyone you would wish would understand/accept/believe/whatever<br>
RWAnderson: Says the Bazaar-thief.<br>
ladeesman146: Ah attack the messenger I see.<br>
ladeesman146: another negative mark<br>
RWAnderson: You don't know anything about Philosophy.  I &quot;sent you elsewhere&quot; because that's how philosophical discourse operates.  It's very referential.<br>
ladeesman146: Actually you say your piece then cite your source<br>
ladeesman146: your simply making vague citations<br>
RWAnderson: Actually, no, philosophical discourse operates by laying out the cast of philosophers upon which the argument you're making is built.<br>
ladeesman146: Well vague citations dont even fall under even your rules of engagement<br>
RWAnderson: Not really vague at all.  Derrida, the one I mentioned, is a huge name in contemporary philosophy.  He's a major figure in the French poststructuralist movement, and occassionally teaches over the summers in Irvine.<br>
ladeesman146: cool<br>
RWAnderson: And his work, more than any other poststructuralist's, is about decentering the center of philosophy.<br>
ladeesman146: Im sorry I obviously lack the knowledge of famous philosophers<br>
ladeesman146: I am no philosophy student or major, I just stick to logic common sense and things most people can comprehend easily.<br>
ladeesman146: Want to explain what he believes?<br>
RWAnderson: No, not particularly.<br>
ladeesman146: *shrug*<br>
RWAnderson: Also, &quot;common sense&quot; is usually just code for ideology.<br>
ladeesman146: Bah your no fun and maybe it is because you cant back your beliefs<br>
ladeesman146: Babble is code for &quot;this is like this because I said so and cant back it up with common sense&quot; ;-)<br>
RWAnderson: So, tell me, horse-thief, do you believe in absolute truth?<br>
RWAnderson: Or does it just not apply to you?<br>
ladeesman146: Yes I do, sir.<br>
ladeesman146: I believe it applys to everything<br>
RWAnderson: I see.  But it apparently doesn't apply to you?<br>
RWAnderson: I see.<br>
ladeesman146: No it does<br>
RWAnderson: Then how do you explain your own morally bankrupt behavior?<br>
ladeesman146: *ponders if he should take a secular point of view on this to avoid the flames, but then ponders if it will mix with core beliefs*<br>
ladeesman146: uh oh I think I already opened up to flames<br>
ladeesman146: I explain my morally bankrupt behavior in game as a release from being good in life and knowing it is simply a game like any other<br>
ladeesman146: Maybe my ingame behaviour should apply to the morals and things I hold true in life, but until someone can show me this I have no reason to believe it.<br>
RWAnderson: So, it's okay to steal...  sometimes?<br>
ladeesman146: If the money is fake and its in a videogame<br>
RWAnderson: And as long as no one knows who you really are, right?<br>
ladeesman146: Well I know many people take it TOO seriously so it is in my interest they dont know me, but if they do I dont worry too much more<br>
RWAnderson: Golly-gee, aren't we a paragon of virtue?<br>
RWAnderson: How is that &quot;common sense&quot; saying goes?<br>
Oh, yeah.  I think I have this right:<br>
You should take the rather large log out of your own eye before pointing out someone else's sliver.<br>
ladeesman146: Very good.<br>
RWAnderson: Oh, by the way, you might want to smile for the cameras.<br>
ladeesman146: I miss your point<br>
ladeesman146: *smiles IRL*<br>
ladeesman146: Smile for the cameras?<br>
RWAnderson: Yeah, you're supposedly a bright kid.  Figure it out.<br>
ladeesman146: Your gonna post the convo ?<br>
RWAnderson: Another bit of &quot;common sense&quot;, something my mom passed down to me:<br>
&quot;Never say anything you don't want on the Six O'Clock News.&quot;<br>
ladeesman146: I havent said anything I regret<br>
RWAnderson: Good.<br>
ladeesman146: I thought of posting the whole convo too<br>
ladeesman146: kinda funny kinda interesting hoping someone might get a kik out of it<br>
RWAnderson: Yes, I'm sure you did.<br>
ladeesman146: john dough :-D<br>
RWAnderson: Though I'm quite sure you'd edit it.<br>
ladeesman146: no way<br>
ladeesman146: anti-censor for life :-D<br>
RWAnderson: As for queer marriages, I really don't care what you think.<br>
RWAnderson: Unless you're the one getting married, it's really not your business.<br>
RWAnderson: And I just took any &quot;moral&quot; argument right out from under you there.<br>
ladeesman146: I think marriage is between a woman and a man. A holy event, and marriage is nothing secular.<br>
ladeesman146: Look<br>
RWAnderson: My church marries same-sex couples.  Who are you to tell another religion how they should practice?<br>
ladeesman146: You can get equal rights as a married couple through the courts and some easy forms. Only thing left to do is to desecrate what marriage always was<br>
ladeesman146: What religion ?<br>
RWAnderson: Unitarian.<br>
ladeesman146: interesting<br>
RWAnderson: However, Episcopalians also recognize same-sex unions, as do some other Christian denominations.<br>
ladeesman146: Well to unitarians you will be an official couple<br>
ladeesman146: Episcopalians are dying off. Not them, but their religion. Their denomination I mean.<br>
ladeesman146: Episcopalians are no longer true Christians, they deny basic beliefs and they cant dance around the blatant verse which speak on the topic.<br>
RWAnderson: Actually, the verse doesn't say in the original Greek what it's been translated to say.<br>
ladeesman146: Hehe greek?<br>
ladeesman146: Blah go back to hebrew my friend<br>
ladeesman146: read romans 2 i believe<br>
ladeesman146: Original hebrew is clear<br>
RWAnderson: Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic.  However, the pertinent passages were mostly in Greek.<br>
ladeesman146: ...<br>
ladeesman146: The bible started in hebrew and was later translated<br>
ladeesman146: The original translataion was hebrew and thus the most accurate version.<br>
RWAnderson: I'm sure that's what your pastor said, yes.  Look into the theological scholarship on the issue and you'll find something different.<br>
ladeesman146: haha<br>
ladeesman146: check every major Christian organization<br>
RWAnderson: You believe a lot of what people tell you, don't you?<br>
Well, you'll make a good little corporate android.<br>
RWAnderson: Even dip your hand into the till from time to time, while moralizing about others' behavior.  Sort of like Jim Bakker.<br>
ladeesman146: I wont end up an old lower tier university professor who thinks he is a rebel.<br>
ladeesman146: I believe what is backed by logic and facts<br>
ladeesman146: If you want to go into apologetics I can cartwheels around you :-)<br>
RWAnderson: *raises eyebrows*<br>
Lower-tier, huh?  You really don't know much at all.<br>
ladeesman146: UCR isnt exactly an allstar university<br>
RWAnderson: What, your friends tell you that?  And they know anything because...?<br>
RWAnderson: Oh, right.  They're all teenagers!  Teenagers know everything.  How could I forget?<br>
ladeesman146: my high school counselors tell me that lol<br>
RWAnderson: Well, then they're doing a bad job.<br>
ladeesman146: i talk to college people too and i know many people that go to UCR<br>
RWAnderson: But then again, what do I expect?  It's Corona.<br>
ladeesman146: hehe<br>
ladeesman146: we got better test scores than most of southern cali ;-)<br>
RWAnderson: In the last ranking, UCR was high Tier-2, and my own department is ranked quite highly.  If you put any stock in the rankings.  But, what do they mean?  After all, you have &quot;friends&quot; who &quot;know&quot;.<br>
ladeesman146: I have UCR students and other college students who KNOW :-)<br>
RWAnderson: Yeah, they would know.<br>
ladeesman146: didn say it was a crap school just didnt say it was an allstar school<br>
ladeesman146: aye they would they arent biased faculty<br>
RWAnderson: No, they're just whiney students who think they're entitled.<br>
RWAnderson: Gee.  Not unlike you.<br>
ladeesman146: I dont whine :-)<br>
RWAnderson: Really.<br>
RWAnderson: What's that whinefest on the Soapbox, then?<br>
ladeesman146: guess everyone are whiners then<br>
ladeesman146: it is the soapbox its where u vent and rant .. which is whining<br>
ladeesman146: we all have complaints i just dont take them publicly and repeatedly<br>
RWAnderson: You know, it doesn't do to contradict yourself from one line to the next.  Haven't they taught that to you?<br>
Oh, wait.  I know the answer to that.<br>
ladeesman146: ?<br>
RWAnderson: You said you don't whine.  Then you said &quot;the Soapbox is for whining&quot;, an admission that you do whine.<br>
ladeesman146: I dont whine as in complain openly and publicly and constantly<br>
ladeesman146: I do put one rant in the soapbox to vent<br>
RWAnderson: &quot;Just one&quot;.<br>
ladeesman146: I only put one complaint thread<br>
RWAnderson: &quot;I don't whine.&quot;<br>
ladeesman146: Well one general rant and one specific rant to warn people<br>
RWAnderson: &quot;Just two.&quot;<br>
ladeesman146: one was a general term to mean little<br>
ladeesman146: your a pretty literal rigid guy<br>
RWAnderson: Well, when you speak in absolutes, you really ought to be careful that you're speaking the truth.<br>
RWAnderson: Weren't you the one who said you believed in absolute truth?<br>
RWAnderson: I'm just holding you to your own standard.<br>
ladeesman146: Im sorry I like to use &quot;common tongue&quot; the &quot;colloquial language&quot; the &quot;slang&quot;<br>
ladeesman146: Your being overly meticulous and a literalist<br>
ladeesman146: Im sorry you refused to debate or argue so I refrained from going into specifics when I speak<br>
ladeesman146: according to you were casually talking in a normal conversation<br>
RWAnderson: Not really, no.  You made a flat, and patently untrue, declaration and then immediately contradicted yourself..<br>
ladeesman146: excuse my lake of being primand proper<br>
RWAnderson: You have excuses for everything, don't you?<br>
ladeesman146: If you took it literally yes<br>
RWAnderson: Works on your teachers, I'm sure.  Your parents, probably, too.<br>
ladeesman146: You love being offensive in your speach without letting me give reason<br>
ladeesman146: No they can hear the tone in my voice and have the brain to know when im being literal or nonliteral<br>
ladeesman146: Im sorry you lack this ability without hearing tone<br>
RWAnderson: Hon, you've given no one any reason to like you, and then you come into chat like gangbusters offending me with your moralizing about how gay marriages are wrong and so's homosexuality.<br>
You're lucky I'm still entertaining you.<br>
RWAnderson: So, you started off at a deficit, and then you dug yourself in.<br>
ladeesman146: Im sorry you must be childish and play semantics to &quot;debate&quot; and &quot;prove&quot; me wrong<br>
ladeesman146: Your just being difficult because your apprehensive to debate/argue or you are trying to irk me.<br>
RWAnderson: *raises eyebrows*<br>
No.  But I do rather enjoy using a person's own logic against him, as I have with you.<br>
ladeesman146: *shrug* ya failed buddy<br>
ladeesman146: No you used semantics and used that as a weak weak evidence for your plight<br>
RWAnderson: *laugh*<br>
ladeesman146: Funny you have proven nothing except you like word games and lack any content to back up what you believe or prove my beliefs wrong.<br>
RWAnderson: Fine.<br>
RWAnderson: Here, have some happy reading.<br>
ladeesman146: No thanks.<br>
RWAnderson: Boswell, John. _Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century_. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1979.<br>
<br>
---. _Same-sex Unions in Premodern Europe_. New York: Villard Books, 1994.<br>
<br>
White, Mel. _Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay and Christian in America_. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1994.<br>
ladeesman146: I do 1 on 1 debates and arguing but cite if you wish, I just want to hear it from you concisely then you can cite your sources<br>
RWAnderson: That should get you started.<br>
RWAnderson: That's regarding the marriage issue you tried to bring up.<br>
ladeesman146: No thanks, why dont you show me the greek txt in the bible that shows being gay is ok with Christianity<br>
RWAnderson: When you actually know something about the issue, we can discuss it, but I'm not going to have a &quot;debate&quot; with an ideologue on the point.<br>
RWAnderson: Lazy, huh?  Well, I'm not surprised.<br>
ladeesman146: Not being egotistical, but I truly do think you have a bit of trepidation over some &quot;ignorant 16yr old&quot;<br>
ladeesman146: Not lazy, I am just an awesome time manager ;-)<br>
RWAnderson: Reading something would be work, and it might challenge your belief systems, and that just wouldn't do.<br>
ladeesman146: No I read contradictory things allll the time<br>
RWAnderson: Good.  Then this shouldn't be a problem for you.<br>
All of them are available at your local Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders, or city library.<br>
RWAnderson: Have fun.<br>
ladeesman146: Many of them &quot;skip steps&quot; as I like to say or have some basic weaknesses that the author loves to cling to as truth no matter what so it makes the rest of their joke work<br>
RWAnderson: Oh, and for a hint, the &quot;Greek&quot; thing comes from the Boswell.<br>
ladeesman146: Haha, no thanks.<br>
ladeesman146: Hebrew = original = most accurate<br>
RWAnderson: Predictable attitude.<br>
ladeesman146: Sorry you cant twist truth on that one ;-)<br>
ladeesman146: Your attitude was predictable too<br>
RWAnderson: Except, see, the difference is you're trying to talk about something you don't know.  I have read the Bible, and I've also read the theology on those passages.  You haven't read the latter, and therefore really aren't in any position to talk about it until you do.<br>
You're speaking from a position of ignorance, thinking you know something when you don't.<br>
ladeesman146: Dodge any direct conversation on topic, point me onwards to the big wigs where I will spend a month scanning and reading carefully over one book to find the fundamental weakness they cling to as truth to back up the rest. Its like a formula. I kinda wait for something groundbreaking someone notices and puts out then i check it out<br>
ladeesman146: Haha<br>
RWAnderson: Sure, there you go again, judging something you've never read.  Very predictable.<br>
Also quite lazy.<br>
ladeesman146: You have read false theology and the Bible through a tainted lense<br>
RWAnderson: This discussion's over.<br>

<br>
ladeesman146: Your being overly meticulous and a literalist<br>
<br>
You used the words meticulous and literalist, used them correctly, but misspelled you're. <br>
<br>
Third, I am sure that is not the first time this has happened to Robin. Can you imagine just sitting at home and then all of a sudden, anonymous im dork #3245 with google and a few hours to spare wants to grill you on every aspect of your 'immoral life'? I'd end up just turning off IM. Robin's a lot more patient than I am. <br>

Fourth: I don't think this 'kid' is 16. I've been right about every single age guess so far. If he's 16 then I'm a 14 year old nigerian girl.<br>

<br>
Part of it is in greek (which is impossible to just cut and paste into the roman alphabet), part of it in aramaic (ditto) and part of it is in hebrew (not even written in the same direction).<br>
<br>
You're asking for someone to first select text for you, then transliterate it and then doubtlessly translate it for you.<br>
<br>
This is what I object to in organized religion. Having other people select and translate text for you is a bad idea. It means you are left subject to another's whims without recourse to verify claims made by them.<br>
<br>
The fact that you're begging Robin to do this for you explains what's wrong with you. You are demanding to be treated like a sheep and offended if you aren't.<br>

<br>
I don't know about that.  I knew a kid in high school that was basically an ultra-nerd.  Carried around a lot of books, prided himself on having this &quot;large&quot; vocabulary.  Made fun of most people, probably considered them his inferiors.  He started griefing people in the local BBS community (this is the days before everyone was on The Internet).<br>
<br>
Funny thing was, he sort of stopped doing it when the news broke that his mom and dad were running a church that worshipped the egyptian goddess Isis.  (I don't know the whole philosophy behind it, I just know there was something about a vision that got it all started.)  Well, the problem with this church was that men had to donate and have sex with the high priestess, which turned out to be his mom.  I guess it became sort of hard to grief people when there were news stories getting published in the paper that she had been sent to prison after admitting to doing some sex act with more than 2000 men.<br>
<br>
So maybe he is just lashing out because his parents are at Isis worship training camp or something.<br>

Kuladen, we all saw the photos. We know you're a 14 year old nigerian girl. What does that mean then? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95331" target="_new">

<br>
I agree the person is out of highschool.  I also think that person never went to college. So... I'd guess the type of kid that stays at home with mommy and daddy, letting them pay for him.<br>
<br>
Age guess late 20s.<br>

<br>
But, let's take stock in what we've learned so far.  Last week, we found out that Cielo is, like, in my pocket.  This week, we found out that the entire board, maybe even the entire server, are my &quot;yes-men&quot;.<br>
<br>
My plot to take over the world is working as planned.<br>
