She is a proud follower of Innoruuk. But maybe she got too much love from her parents, since she is not aggressive and quite sociable to light races (except those evil guys, who are killing innocent skellies). Because of those contacts she is sometimes even insulted by members of her own kin. But she is selfconfident enough to deal with that.
She also doesn't like other races call the dark elves evil. She thinks that she is orderly good, and that dark elves are just dark, which is beyond evil, neutral or good. And dark she is; she has a strong addiction to skellylogy (she loves skellies as if they would be her children) and an extreme aversion to sunlight.
She has always thought that she was a normal Teir'dal as a Teir'dal should be, but during her life as an adventurer she has learned that most dark elves are quite different. Still she would never stop to love her god and her profession, even though recent events have marred her happiness somewhat.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="mailto:teiraa@yahoo.com">teiraa@yahoo.com</a></span> </div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 		 		<span class="privatevalue">private</span>						</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
