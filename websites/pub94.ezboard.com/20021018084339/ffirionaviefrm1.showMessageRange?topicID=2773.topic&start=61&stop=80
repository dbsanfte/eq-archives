Talk to Coinfist if you want to try and work something out, BUT if I were to make a deal it would have to include first warder staying alive for the length of the deal. This because if Reso wanted to kill 4th again and another guild cleared 1 through 3 it would prevent Reso from getting 4th again. [If you clear warders and really had your heart set on a smolder from first for some reason then we could work out a deal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ] Any deal about this would have to be made in front of the whole server as well since people sometimes like to twist a deal before it is made public.<br>

I only posted that is because I am curious as a player of FV and not an officer of Resolution. If I put Resolution in my sig then it is more of an official statement, but if I just sign it Rollen then I am probably just posted as another player.<br>

Save me at least an SoD*grin* and let the server know ahead of time if you plan to so those of us who want to see it, can.<br>
<br>
I think that people who know damn well that they'll never see 60(Myself for example*snicker*), should bitch not about not getting the chance to farm ST.<br>
<br>
I think the fact that Rollen's here discussing this, rather than posting a kudos to Reso for waking his ass, should tell you naysayers that he's thinking about the server(when he doesn't really have to. We don't ask anyone else to ponder what they do in either RP or hunting before they do it)<br>
<br>
I do, rather agree with waiting till the new ST is put in, since so few servers will have any chance to see the changes prewaking.  After that, as long as I get the possibility of seeing what happens when he gets woke up, I don't really care.<br>

<br>
It is inevitable.  I only have 2 regrets.  One is that I likely will never get a Mask of Tinkering.  Even with the lottery there is little chance I will be 55 by then, as I am only 37-38 now.  It is extremely unlikely I will ever get the chance to get one myself, and only slightly less likely I will get a chance to participate in this proposed lottery.<br>
<br>
My second regret is that I will not be able to witness this dragon first hand on a killing spree, even if it is in a secondary location visited hoping the script works this time.  Whoever does it will most likely do it in secret, as nice as a serverwide announced event would be.  Announcing it ahead of time would please some, but cause a flame war the likes of which this board has never seen.  A flame war is inevitable, but people will be all the more charged if they think they have a chance of stopping it. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
EQ is a competitive game. You constantly compete with other guilds and you are constantly competing with yourself to improve your gear / AA etc. You can be civil about it. You can be nice to your competitors (thanks very much for the rezz and buffs in ToV that one day) but the bottomline is the less competition you have, the better it is for your guild.<br>
<br>
Why are you hesitating?<br>
<br>
Are you looking for permission to wake the sleeper? You will most definately NOT find it on these boards.  Four shrouds rock, I think thats enough for every monk in Reso isnt it? Are you waiting for other people to have an oppourtunity to see warders or the sleeper? Well you've given them plenty of time havent you? If folks really wanted to see warders / the sleeper they knew what it was gonna take and they should have worked towards that goal, not pissed around waiting for the oppourtunity to be handed to them.<br>
<br>
Their are only 4 servers with a sleeper still asleep. That does speak volumes. Its tactically wise to wake him so that the top guild can strengthen their position. Yes warders drop some great loot, but weigh the oppourtunity costs involved. What does the top guild GAIN by sacraficing the potential for those drops? Especially if they feel they have all they need. Does Reso need more SoD's? Do they need more Shoruds? Need other warder 4 drops?  If you can answer &quot;no we don't&quot; to these questions then the smart thing to do is wake him.<br>
<br>
It gives the top guild more chances at prime targets, and the ability to equip your people with better gear faster, so you can move on to even greater challenges.<br>
<br>
The only reasons NOT to wake the sleeper are:<br>
<br>
1. To avoid the whining you will get from players who didn't wake the sleeper.<br>
2. You don't feel the gain in competitive advantage is worth the potential gains for your guild in warder drops. That is, you still need loot from the warders. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

<br>
...<br>
<br>
That is the absolutely best motivation I have ever had not to level.  It seems that the high level EQ is a completely different EQ than I am playing now.<br>
<br>
Competitive you say?  To what goal?  Runners compete to get the best time.  Fishers compete to convince their friends they caught the biggest fish.  Hunters compete to get the biggest buck.  Basketball players compete to get the most points.<br>
<br>
What is the goal of EQ?  ...  Let me rephrase that.  What is the goal of EverQuest?  The goal is to have fun!  So by saying you are competing to have fun, you are implying that you are having more fun than others, and you will use tactics to lessen their fun to achieve your goal.  Is that it?  ...  Maybe the goal is to be the one guild for that one time encounter.  You want to wake the sleeper.  Then what?  No more sleepers to wake.  Maybe the goal is to be the first to a certain area.  There are only so many places to be first to.  And in most cases, the area does not change once you get there.  If your goal is just to get there, then you aren't even competing.<br>
<br>
Well I like to stick with the goal to have fun.  Only I find that I don't have to lessen others fun to make me have more fun.  I can work with them.  I can cooperate with them, even!  Guess what, cooperation is what groups and guilds and raids is all about.  If you want competition, then go to one of the zeks.  There at least the goal is clearly defined. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

<br>
Fun being relative. Fun for some is seeing the high end encounters. To reach that goal requires a level of determination that is not found in all players. But for those that do have that level of commitment then they find themsleves competing for resources.<br>
<br>
Resources being gear from targets that might be on a 8 hour, 24 hour or even weekly spawn cycle. Resources being other players, who typically migrate to the &quot;top&quot; guild if they are folks who also want to see the high end game. All the raiding guilds on any server (including ours) compete for these resources. If one guild can consistently &quot;farm&quot; a particular target without competition they can equip their guild with those resources much quicker which strenghtens their position even more.<br>

Perhaps I'm being foolish, but thats the way I am.  Reso already has a significant head start on anybody else.  If they want to stay ahead of the curve, they don't need to resort to backstabbing to do that.<br>
<br>
If that was really the goal, then if two guilds were competing for resources, it would make more sense for them to merge.  No more competition.  Similar goals and abilities for them to continue stepping on each others toes like that.  And the result is that much stronger of a guild.  It may take longer to outfit everyone, but it would take less effort collectively by the guild as a whole to get that gear.  And once a large enough subset is outfit, they could move on and get other stuff, while the lessers finish off their stuff and outfitting.<br>
<br>
But you won't see that for a number of reasons I won't get into here.  My point is if the only goal was seeing the high end encounters, it is better to work with others than work against them. <p>Mithlin Lussarrna<BR>

it's competitive sure, but competition will -never- be significantly slowed down by reducing primal drop rate like that, it will just make the game a LOT less fun for ANYONE who wants to do the zone after it...it extends WAY beyond AS..WAY beyond the top 3 guilds...in 5-6 months no doubt other guilds will be wanting to do ST...I'm sure they'd appreciate it not being a huge shithole...<br>
<br>
Ultimately the decision is up to Resolution, but if they do it, the only reason they did so was to block competition, there's no way they can convince anyone otherwise. <p>--Lacus<br>Grandmaster<br>

I feel for the bards and rogues. However, all of the eloquent guild Politik aside, it would be patently unfair of Resolution to not wake him. The awakening is a seminal oportunity for the RP community and the only means of furthering the story of Resolution and dragonlore. The zone doesn't pack up and leave with Kerrafym, it gets more challenging. Challenge can be fun. I realize some very ph4t l3wt5 become finite. &lt;shrug&gt; Is that more important to you than a hero's saga ? <br>

The fact remains that unless you are willing to give up YOUR SoD's, and YOUR shrouds, you have no business waking the Sleeper.<br>

For the record I didnt flame AS for the FCFS ragefire. I posted I thought it was rude of you guys, but you didnt break any rules. I also posted folks should give you guys an oppourtunity to tell your side fo the story before they jumped to conclusions.<br>
<br>
Are you now saying you don't like it when the tables are turned? Reso waking the sleeper wouldn't deny AS primal, it will just slow the obtaining of primal for AS. Just like AS &quot;slowed down&quot; that cleric's goal of obtaining his epic when they opted to use FCFS instead of politely giving that cleric his shot and waiting for another oppourtunity. Why are you so bent over someone not being &quot;polite&quot; in game now? Don't give me the &quot;I am concerned about the server&quot; crap. AS has publically posted they dont give a sh!t about this server, just themselves.<br>
<br>
/rant off. <br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with AS or Reso. I don't really have a problem with any guild. My post was just another way of looking at the situation. One that other folks were dancing around already, but for some reason just didnt want to come right out and say.<br>

<br>
The reasons TO wake the sleeper is called &quot;Denial of resources&quot;. Its a very common tactic used in competition. If you read my post, I make no attempt to hide the fact that waking the sleeper should be done to gain / further a guilds competitive advantage. Thats pretty much the only reason and I thought I made that very clear in my post.<br>

<br>
waking sleeper would not be like FCFSing ragefire, it would be like a guild killing ragefire whenever he popped so other guilds couldn't get epics..<br>
<br>
you can say I don't care about the rest of the server, but you'd be wrong...I know how much of a shithole post-awakening ST is, and I really think it would be great if we could keep him asleep for as long as possible <p>--Lacus<br>Grandmaster<br>

Even a little server with a very small and relatively polite high end population like FV already has huge drama over raid sites.  Multiply that by 100 for what goes on elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Hopefully POP will end all that.  It's supposed to provide a completely unique &quot;zone copy&quot; for every raid force that wants to raid a particular plane there much the same way AO handles missions.  'Course the only way for it to end the competition is for the risk/reward of going there to be at least as good or better than the places outside POP.<br>
<br>
The reason old sleeping ST had the hell farmed out of it on Legends was because it gave great drops for relatively little work.  The reason that the new wakeup ST is ignored on Legends is that it has much worse drops for much more work.  Truly, the only good thing that can come of waking him is to experience what might be a new wakeup script.  Until the new wakeup ST goes live, it really doesn't make sense to wake him.  It doesn't slow the competition anymore with Luclin weapons much better than SODs available, but it does piss them off in a big way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulacus1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lacus1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/24/02 11:39:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The competitive nature of EQ ..</span><hr size=1> you'd be fooling yourself about VI if you think they fixed the script for the 4 servers who haven't awoken him yet <p>--Lacus<br>Grandmaster<br>
