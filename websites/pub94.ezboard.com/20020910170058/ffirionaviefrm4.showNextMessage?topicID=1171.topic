Endalmir being one of them... ulimarath also witnessed some of this (misspelled im sure, she is in fire and fury however) while i was in arena one day i was healing one of my friends, i went LD due to a phone call and i came back on dead, lvl 50 again *i lost xp* it is a known rule that if you die LD in arena by dot or pet you will lose XP well, he saw me there and uli said she tried to get him to stop shouting he will lose xp, he kept doting me and let his pet kill me *according to uli* he did not apologize or anything, he just said well what was i supposed to do! he would attack me in LD its just too bad! uli had to find a res for me while Taiil just sat there, after Uli left, my friends where in there messing around so i went in to heal one of them when Taiil rooted me, doted me and sicked his pet on me, doing a continued root dot root dot then i said please stop Taiil! stop! my friends where healing me and trying to cure poison but he kept it comeing till eventually i said please back off at half a bub, he backed pet off and said SURE THING! HA! and let the dot kill me, after he killed me he sent a tell that he hoped i lose xp again and left, luckily i did not lose xp but his sheer rudeness brought me to anger.... has anyone else had problems with the AS? after i told xarpolis he said, it was not me and i would not do it, so i am not worried of it<br>**EDIT** i do not doubt that there are good members in AS but i have had nothing but horrible experience with Xarp, if it takes being rude to be uber then i dont want to be uber, FV is a ROLEPLAYING SERVER to start with, i know that does not mean you have to RP all the time, but you should atleast respect when someone else is RPing... and as far as congratulating them to being a &quot;uber&quot; guild for being so rude, Taail was not gaining anything by root doting and attempting to make others lose XP...**EDIT** <p>Hysar Vakaidon-Primalist    House of Carnage<center><a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/q3.htm" target="new"><img src="http://www.mutedfaith.com/images/hero.jpg" border=0></a><br><a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/q3.htm" target="new">Find your Role-PlayingStereotype</a> at <a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com" target="new">mutedfaith.com</a>.<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/labile">[Angel.]</a></center>"Evil is not evil unless intended to be evil, ones evil is anothers virtue... one proves them SELF, not there race.... not there class...."

I'm sure you won't get many disagreeing with you about AS as a whole guild.  And, as much as I really don't like them nor what they stand for as a guild, I must point out that Taiil's actions were of his own.  While his actions to reflect upon the guild, they do not really represent the whole guild.  Nor does Xarpolis' personally being a jerk toward an open raid (although the entire guild stepping forward for a mob that already has a large group around it and speaking as a guild leader does speak for the whole guild)  It doesn't mean there aren't some good people in the guild, although why they remain is a mystery to me.<br><br>Personally, I do not doubt your story in the least.  The two you mentioned have been, in my own experiences and in the experiences of my friends, the worst of the worst when it comes to AS and being rude and inconsiderate, and that's saying a lot.<br><br>Just accept the fact that they don't care about you or anyone else not in their guild and move on I suppose... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A> at: 8/12/02 8:52:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usindellfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sindell FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 10:01:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1187.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Awakened souls, Feriona's RUDEST and most inmoral guild</span><hr size=1> I sure hope to one day see some posts from the people we have bent over backwards to help.<br><br>Saiyjian LD on an open raid stranded with 4 corpses in plane of hate.

The good apples (samaritans) do what most people really expect from a guild. Helpful, decent and generous. The bad apples (PUNKS) have no other purpose than to exemplify every discourtesy  that their powers will allow, and not all of them are 50+.<br><br>Most guild members fall in between, most leaning towards samaritans. Most are also followers, who feel a sense of loyalty to their guild. They will follow the example of whoever is leading their group/guild at the time. So when a PUNK is in charge, it rubs off on the members a bit as they try to stick together. That doesn't make them all PUNKS, but every guildmember needs to realize that their personal actions reflect on their guild, good and bad.<br><br>A guild needs to identify these PUNKS and decide if they are worth the grief they will inflict on the guild. Its all relative to their sense of community among other guilds.<br><br>It is also sad that many samaritans begin to change into PUNKS as they level higher. I had the educational experience to be forced to play a lower level character for a time. I found that players the same level as my main wouldnt even be bothered to speak to me when I asked them a question, as if I was a subspecies not worthy of notice. Not once did I ask for any free stuff from them. They only seemed to speak to me when they needed MY help to complete a quest that TLC prevents them from  completeing themselves. It made me sit back and wonder if I have ever treated anyone that harshly.<br><br>So, there is and always will be arrogance in the game that will make it unpleasant for others. We can only stop to look at ourselves and try to treat others as we WANT to be treated, rather than how we HAVE been treated.<br><br>Xianya Lilboomer<br>Witch of the 44th broomstick <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uuliamarathfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>UliamarathFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/02 1:07:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1187.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Crispy Leezards</span><hr size=1> Well the first time he killed him and he lost xp. I told him not to (i should have nuked him *shrug) but anyway its understandable that maybe he did no hear me i know. So I eventually dueled and killed him and he was not D00Dish or anything and he was polite so i figured it was cool and left to plow some xp... i get a tell a couple minutes later at the same exact time from 3 people (whom i all know rather well and trust more or less) saying that this guy nuked rooted dotted him over and over again and said &quot;Haha fag i hope you lose xp again&quot;. now this is obnoxious enough right? so i send him a tell asking wtf is up with him doing things like that and he starts spinning a story about how Hysar &quot;called him a fag&quot; so one of them was lying but these other 2 people (a shaman and an enchanter both too low to get into these wonderful guild politics) are supporting exactly what hysar said but still i can't know for sure because i was not there to witness it. Anyway today im in arena and our favorite neighbor hood lizzie shaman shows up and starts popping out of gates and dotting people and jumping back in. Until I challenge him to a duel (we are both level 60) which he declines and leaves immediately. Probably because i am not a green con he can pop out and dot and watch as i lose xp before his eyes in the safety of the arena gates. My experiences with AS have not been all too positive and most members in my opinion are downright obnoxious (several exceptions there are several wonderful people there too). I try to talk to Xarpolis about this and he simply says yeah if i see Taiill in the arena i would run ... Okay? What does that have to do with a member of the guild you lead TRYING to make people lose xp in the arena and gloating about it. I dunno if he went ld or put me on ignore but i have not been able to talk to him since. I'm not one to talk about honor in the arena as far as killing people goes (step in i will nuke you &gt;)  ) I know but i have never made someone lose xp and if i did i would apologize profusely and get them a rez. Anyway Taiil said he had logs of all this stuff but surprisingly enough he never sent them like he said he would.
