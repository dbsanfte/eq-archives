<br>
i can shed some light on to some things people have not talked about....<br>
<br>
sooo you say reso had absoultly no clue who ogah was....<br>
this is parcaly true however the GL and posibly officers knew sence ogah applyed druing my last few weeks in Reso i kenw he was akaen and i knew shoug was belika &lt;sp&gt;...<br>
<br>
so did the GL&lt;whos name im not going to say becuse it would look like i was dumping this all on him&gt;<br>
<br>
i sent a tell to the GL saying &quot;hey do u know ogah is akaen?&quot;<br>
i get no reply so i resend<br>
then i get a &quot;yea but not many people know or should know&quot;<br>
<br>
as a loyal member i say noting, sence im no lo9nger a member i can.  <br>
<br>
the GL and posibly offcers KNEW this was ogah and they wanted him in the guild baggage and all.  sence joe/akaen/ogah had such a good game knolage they needed some one who could be 60 war to tank some or what ever i dont know.  but i can voutch 100% that the GL kenw.<br>
<br>
now as to him knowing about nabikki&lt;sp&gt; being stolen im not sure.<br>
<br>
however i would asume he did.  how dose it go from zok to zok's friend to ogah back again?   akaen./joe./ogah had been knonow to distrustworthy so any thing that he said should have been taken in question. <br>
<br>
this also raises anoter question... if they knew this was akaen which they did/ who btw bailed on the guild many many months befor cuz it was not the type of playing he wanted to be doing, i was told as was the same fro durs and kahveen.<br>
why in Gods name would u give him all the gear you did when u had had war's who had stuck with the guild and been there trought the roght times.  dose any one else not find that odd?<br>
you have upper 50's war in indo and u twink up a new member? someting fishy smelling in that barrel, but that might just be me. is it?<br>
<br>
thrid yes shoug u are involvoed.<br>
<br>
you lied to the members here.  u said u had not been speeking with joe<br>
however you were during yalls rading with the guild he frequnelty came over to your hosue and played with you in the same room. WHICH you told me about.  so you mean to say he sat there played and did not talk to you?<br>
<br>
second shoug <br>
<br>
you told me long ago Tiesto stole your shaman.<br>
<br>
in light of all of this i find that hard to beleave.<br>
Tiesto in his last days on this server says well the fucker who i bought the acoutn from stole him back today.<br>
<br>
Tiesto was not the highest guy in my book as far as people... however most every thing he said matched up.  he said he traded a druid for your shaman.  i see you with ogah in velks many months later with some druid. who yall &quot;bought&quot;<br>
and i have been looking for druids or sham for sale for abit and have seen none.  that also seems a bit fishy that many months later u end up with ur shaman and a druid!!<br>
<br>
maby Tiesto can by some fluke chace see this and enlighen us.<br>
<br>
thrid you LVLed with ogah. or told me you did a bit surly you had to know he screwed sok for nab.  he used ur paypal to sell would he not use it to by back?<br>
<br>
can you explain why joe./akaen.ogah dose not have ihs owen pay pal?  could it be that this is a regular occurace for him and they nolonger alow him to hold a pay pal acount?<br>
just a thgouth.<br>
<br>
<br>
lastly i would like to addres why the guild did not take more imediat action.<br>
you have zok sending tells to rollen about this granted he was at a raid but... zok offerd to send him emails and rollen so i was told from zok said it was not necary.  so that post about wishing u had more time to deal with this issue is crap.<br>
<br>
the GL put zok on ingore cuz he told zok he did not even want to talk about it.<br>
so zok asks me a former member to talk to him. the GL tells zok becuse u brught reg in to this  /ingore.<br>
<br>
DOSE that make sence? hell no<br>
<br>
it basicly tells you FU this has noting to do with me or the rep of my guild.  when he konwig it dam well did.  sence he KNEW it was akane he had every thing to do with this.  but i have a fealing he did not want to feal like a jack ass sence he had helped twink up ogah.  so instred of dealing with someting he was apart of he simply ingored it.<br>
and on top of that he cused me and told me how low donw and dirty i was for 15 mints then put me on ingore.<br>
but my skin is thick so no skin off my neck.<br>
<br>
<br>
this one is a question for yall reading<br>
<br>
<br>
if akaen/ogah/joe  reroled after leaving eq and lvled why would he chose reso when he spent his majority of the days in fnf?<br>
no one in fnf knew he was akaen so he could apply.  <br>
maby he did not want to however my theroy is differnt.  <br>
sence this is a falme board i can post it.<br>
<br>
my theroy is that GL sent email to ogay/joe./aken/who ever the hell he is  saying hey are u intersted in playing lvl to 60 a war and we will gear you up.<br>
my theroy is backed by this<br>
<br>
ogah was .lvl 52 at the time i first saw him.  shoug was like 54 or 55.  he had some raggedy gear but at this time i had no clue who he was so i helpd him a bit sence he said he was joing reso.  he truns up with more and more decnet war gear bt the time hes 55.  &lt;posobly a quidicent&gt; but i think not!<br>
he raids and gets guilded after i leave.  but isee him gettign good gear and better and better so i figured hell konor and otehr people who have been in guild a long ass time must have super gear.  i look at wars like konor who is 57 hard workign war who tnaks wells and has been in guild for a good bit and been to raids over and over and wipe after wipe. yet he dose not have near as good of gear as ogah.  once again posibly odd quoidience I THINK NOT.<br>
<br>
you hand primal to a new war in the guild? no<br>
you hand him BP that a person in the guild for over 4 months could use ? hell no<br>
You give him better armor than warX who was in guild for 1 moneth logner? nope<br>
and it goese on examples like that.  i konow how most guilds work particlry reso. people get loot for a reasion .  wars who have been in guild longer get preferace. why would war X get bp when hes been in guild one month when war Y has been in guild for 6 months? they bolth need an upgrade. however war Y has put in his dues.<br>
<br>
So u will explain why ogah got loot befor members who had worked hard to make the guild what it was. becuse....... IMO it was promised. thats all i have to say u psot ur coments and tos out ideas this is simply a pecing what i know with what i read and think about.<br>
<br>
ps this is long and my typeing is shitty so if u cant read get thraall or bri or even nimadno can translate for you they can read regharish<br>
