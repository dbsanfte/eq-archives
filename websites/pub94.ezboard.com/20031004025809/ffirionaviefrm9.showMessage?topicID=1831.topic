<br>
I wasn't sure where I should put this post because it is related to roleplay, but I'm asking about RL information from a medical stand point.  (Or well, I suppose I'm asking more of your approval from a fantasy roleplaying stand point.) I decided to place it here, but if you wish to move it to a more suitable forum, then by all means, do so!  But anyhow, I'll get to the point...but first a small bit of background.<br>
<br>
For awhile, I've been trying to piece together a RP persona and background for one of my main characters on Xev.  I attempted to create him here, but his personality was just too complicated for me to roleplay on my first try, so I used an easier personality for him here.  But now I want to make another attempt at getting him together because I am comtemplating joining Last Exodus, a roleplaying guild on Xev that you may or may not have heard of.  But anyhow, being the perfectionist that I am, I want to get out all the kinks from my characters background and persona before launching into it. <br>
<br>
So anyhow, the back bone to both his personality and his past is the scar he carries on his hand. (I think I will make it his left hand)  The scar goes diagonally (down and to the right if I make it on the left hand) across the center of his palm, and I think I'm going to make it about 2 inchs long. It will (sort of) follow his &quot;life line,&quot; if you know which crease that is on the palm.  He receives this scar when his father pierces through the back of his hand with a sword of some type.  At the time his hand is resting upon his brothers chest, so it is relaxed and slightly curved to his brothers body.  If you need more specifics on the scenario in order to answer my question (I am almost there, I promise, I'm just longwinded), then simply post and for them for I will gladly give them.  But anyhow, from a medical stand point or perhaps just a simple fantasy roleplaying stand point, would it be possible for his hand to heal without any disformities aside from a scar?  Because piercing through his hand would mean cutting through any blood vessels in the area, and snapping through the finger bones on the inside on the palm.  I'm trying to think of it from a fantasy stand point, like, he used &quot;Lay of Hands&quot; on himself afterwards since he was a low level paladin at the time, though I was planning for him to use it on his brother.  Or perhaps he stumbled to the cleric guild just after the event and a cleric is able to mend his hand, while leave only a scar?  <br>
<br>
Anyhow...I guess I asking more for all your approval of this.  I figured all roleplay professionals would be the best people to bring my question to.  So anyhow, if you could please let me know whether or not you think that my whole idea from his scar is acceptable by the laws and standards of Everquest, or even from a medical RL view, it would be much appreciated!  Anyhow, I want to thank you in advance for what ever help you may be able to give a novice roleplayer like myself!  And I'm sorry for how long this post was - I am notoriously long winded, so I hope you can forgive me!   <br>
<br>

<br>
Unaided by fantasy, is it possible for a stab with a broad blade through the hand to scar but not otherwise damage the bone structure?  I'd think not, unless it slid between the bones from the wrist to the fingers (not a doc, so I don't have da names, sorry).<br>
<br>
But if it were MY character's hand, I'd say that after receiving the wound, he bound it in a dirty rag torn from his dying/dead brother's tunic.  By the time he got to the healer's hut, the wound had already been infected, and he feared the worst:  amputation, a greater disfiguration and shame than a useless limb to his race.  Fortunately, the healer was competent and fully restored the use of the hand, putting the bones, tendons, blood vessels and skin back to their proper order.<br>
<br>
But alas, the healer says, &quot;I cannot restore your skin.  The cut of the sword can be healed, but you will forever bear the cut of injustice upon your hand.  The scar will remain forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I would do that only because it sounds all official and neat and mystical, and I really go for that crap.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
From a RL standpoint, no.  The injury your describing would be quite traumatic, and damage alot of internal structures in the hand. First off, what kind of blade if being used to pierce the hand?  If it's a typical longsword, blade width of about 2 inches, tapered, and going through deep enough to kill his brother below, this would leave a rather large hole in the hand.  Besides damaging the skin, it would of course break the bones that make up the hand, sever the arteries and veins, as well as damage the nerves/ligaments/tendons/muscles.  While the bones could heal, the ligaments would not, and your character would be left with at least his 2nd/3rd finger non-functioning, though he'd likely lose function of the 1st finger as well.  Modern medicine has a difiicult time healing and surgically repairing such a wound, in the EQ world you'd be SOL.  Of course, considering clerical magic can magically heal a warrior on the brink of death to full health, they could heal your hand.<br>
<br>
If you want an in-depth description of exactly what would happen at each level of the hand as the blade passes, I can post it (need to make that hellish year of gross anatomy pay-off sometime), otherwise that should pretty much answer your question. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.cableone.net/agunders/Pics/JaelynSig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=135606" target="top"><br>

<br>
If his hand sustained permanent physical damage from the sword, it could be roleplayed in that he, at one time, was a dual-wielding class (warrior, ranger or something). Now that his hand is no longer fully functional, he turned to the life as a paladin and equipped a shield instead. Even with one hand less than perfect, it should be more than possible to also swing a two-hander.<br>
<br>
No, I don't mean to say that paladins are warriors with one bad hand. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Like I said, just a small thought here. It's your roleplay! Do with it what you see fit! Most of all, have fun with it!<br>

2, He woulda died from illness; infection direct - gangrene, or blood infection or raging fevor an loss of weight and starvation from inability to eat.<br>

3, Loss of his hand but kept it on -- crippled and maimed from having it bound in order to avoid one an two above.<br>

4, Loss of his hand - cut off to avoid one and two above.<br>

Your aid is much appreciated! <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Khati Sha Rrraowl</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->,<br>
I thank you very much for your suggestion!  I actually had something similiar to that in mind - only instead of having the healer unable to mend the skin, I was going to have my character ASK the healer to leave the scar but repair all else so that he would alway remember the day he &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>killed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot; his brother. Not that he actually killed his brother, but my character blames himself for his brothers death because he didn't have the strength to save him, so in my characters mind it was he who killed his brother despite the fact that his father was the one who held the sword.  Again, I thank you for your input and for wishing me luck - will most certainly need it!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jaelyn DiMathe</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->,<br>
Wow, thank you!  All that information will be most helpful to me!  Thank you so very much!  You offered to post an &quot;in-depth description description of exactly what would happen at each level of the hand as the blade passes.&quot;  If it wouldn't be too much trouble for you, I'd love to hear it!  But don't go out of your way for me.

If you choose to e-mail me, I'd appreciate it if you put something noticeable in the subject line, such as writing in caps or including this post name of EQ somewhere in the subject line so that I won't confuse you with all the junkmail/spam I receive.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, you asked what type of sword would be used. Well...I actually hadn't given that much thought.  The typical longsword that you described sounds alright to me, though I was thinking of using something that has the whole taper effect but flares out again just before the tip and then slims down again.  Anyhow, I'll give it some more thought, but let me know if the sword that is used is needed for you to describe the hand thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Artanis Bor</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->,<br>
Hehehe, my original thought was to do exactly that!  He was originally a warrior.  Then I was thinking that perhaps, since the injury, he would have this sort of pain in his hand when he moved it so it was difficult to menuver a sword. I haven't yet decided whether that pain will be real for perhaps it healing incorrectly, or if it will be a pain he &quot;imagines&quot; so to speak, because his hand would hurt him even though medically it is fine.  But anyhow, he decided to take the path of a paladin after the death of his brother, who was a paladin.  And then would use his brothers old Chitin Shield in his left hand.  I was also going to use this to explain why my character has such a low level 2HS skill.  In the beginning, I think I'm going to say he couldn't stand the pain in his hand while weilding a 2 hander, but learned to tolerate it over time so that he could use 2HS swords.  I haven't decided whether or not I'm still going to use this original thought or not, because it brings up some conflicts in parts of the storyline. But it hasn't been rule out altogether yet, so I might just use this idea yet! <br>

<br>
1) The blade penetrates perpendicular to the hand between the metacarpal bones for the index and middle finger. This could leave an exit wound that cuts through the 'life line' on the palm at about a 20 degree angle. This would likely leave the index and middle fingers rather weak, although things could be held in the hand because the thumb isn't involved. The problem is that a 2 inch wound like this would likely split the palm all the way up to the crux between the fingers (quite nasty) unless the cut was all whe way down to where the two bones meet.<br>

2) The blade penetrates at an angle to the hand, cutting just to the thumb side of the index finger metacarpal. (Hold your hand with fingers extended but not spread, and turn the thumb toward you until you see no daylight between your fingers. This would be the angle.) this would cut more parallel to the 'life line', but would assuredly split the palm and nearly remove the thumb completely, rendering the hand mostly useless.<br>
<br>
Either of these wounds would be more manageable if the blade making the cut was thinner, more like a saber or rapier than a longsword (c. 1 inch or so). Hope this helps. <p>- - -<br>

What was baffling to me, though, was how a character in a fantasy world would even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>have</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> scars, considering the nature of magic and healing (which kind of does an end-run around medical science anyway, but hey, that's fantasy for ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Here's how I handled it with my character.<br>
<br>
When my character got his scar he was just a boy.  He was running from a High Elf Paladin, who stabbed him with an enchanted sword.  The very nature of the blade, coupled with the zeal behind it, left scars on my character that he'll probably carry the rest of his life.  It's a powerful reminder of what the so-called &quot;good&quot; races are really capable of...<br>
<br>
The kind of wound my character endured would be fatal nine times out of ten.  Thanks to the magic of a fantasy realm, however, he survived and is now out adventuring 'n' stuff.  Basically, my opinion is, a lot of what happens in a fantasy realm is A) circumstantial and B) based heavily on the player behind the character, and the story they wish to tell.<br>
<br>
So if it suits your character's story to bear a scar, bear it!  And don't hesitate to tell the story behind it in whatever way works best for your character... it is, after all, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>your</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> character. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
