The drone of their wings was soothing like a mother’s touch. They darted at her eyes eager to taste her tears, they clung to her ears whispering their nameless secrets into the depths of her soul and they scuttled into her nose bringing with them the sweet scent of decay.<br>
<br>
Valkiri had lay motionless in the Northern Desert of Ro for two days, she had ceased to breathe and only the keenest of senses or the most powerful of magics would have detected the fact that she was not dead. The drifting dunes of sand had covered her legs and most of her torso, the wind bit ravenously at her face and the sun scorched her pale flesh.<br>
<br>
Young adventurers from Freeport had stumbled upon her occasionally, they gazed upon her with a mixture of shock and awe, a mantle of power still clung to her body like a shroud, yet the swarm of flies more than attested to her lifelessness. None had dared touch her save one, a young rogue. He had crept forward and artlessly shoved his hand into her beltpouch. Jabober had risen from the dune the sand that covered him sieving off with a brittle hiss. The struggle was a brief one.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight had come to this land of decay, of buried cities and unquiet dead looking to commune with her master. So far the lord of plagues had not turned his will her way. It was the dawn of the third day. <br>
<br>
The sun exploded into her view, its light turned the tan sand a stark white. The heat caused the surface of the sand to crack as the dew from the night evaporated, everywhere the desert seemed to jump to life, dust released from the imprisonment of the sand as it cracked rose, to be caught by the newborn winds that always signaled the approach of the sun. Soon the wind would howl and the dust would dance as it raced up and down the surface of the dunes.<br>
<br>
Sand hissed as it cascaded down the face of the dune, covering a bit more of her body. She felt as if she were slowly sinking into the desert. The thought of slowly being smothered and dragged into the bosom of the desert was appealing. A sharp bite on her ear brought her attention back to reality. Somewhere between the sighing of the desert and the buzzing of the flies a murmuring voice seemed to arise. It was combination of all these noises.<br>
<br>
“At last, you properly emulate the stillness of the grave…” the voice droned. It stopped when the breeze did. It was a few minutes before another one came, blowing more grit and dust onto her body. “You have done well, but you are not yet ready to serve as the agent of the Lord of Entropy.” Again the wind died.<br>
<br>
“You are not yet ripe with rot. Your faith is strong but you must become a stronger vessel. The disease you will carry will be the mightiest of plagues, it shall incubate in you and you will have to carry it far before you can let it be born to cover the world.” The wind died again with a metallic hiss of sand on plate armor.<br>
<br>
“Great shall be your suffering and agony, that which once was pure, and become tainted shall continue to decay, your very being will erode until there is nothing left but the vessel.” The wind died again, this time with a sense of finality, the flies burst open with a wet cascade of pops, their insistent warbling stilled, their small bodies littered the sand and Valkiri stared at them with the perspective of a god looking upon the remains of a once great city dotted with the corpses of the dead.<br>
<br>
Sand, skin and a thousand tiny corpses sloughed off her body as she rose from her hollow in the desert. A bitter cough brought up a mass that was more sand than phlegm. The harsh rim of grit that edged her eyelids scraped her eyes jaggedly as she blinked for the first time in days. Her armor was a mess, the oil that protected the mail long ago caked into a gelatinous mass of black sandy grit. Jabober would be busy tonight indeed.<br>
<br>
As she staggered towards the sea she thought of the young barmaid at Crows she had once been. That girl would have been terrified at the prospect of becoming a plague vessel, the woman she was now looked forward to becoming the mother of misery.<br>
<br>
Valkiri Blackhand 41st Shadow Knight of the League of Shadows, Servant of Bertox. <br>
