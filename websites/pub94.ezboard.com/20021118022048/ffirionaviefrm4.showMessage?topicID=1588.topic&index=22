Investigative reports are often an important insight into society but they are just as often one-sided and present solely the viewpoint of the producer.  Did 48 Hrs. interview people who may have met and made close friendships from Everquest?  Did they interview people who play EQ as their entertainment? Did they interview people who just play EQ a few times a week and still have strong relationships with friends and family? Probably not, because those types of stories don't sell advertising, don't get headlines, and don't generate interest for the most part. <br>
<br>
I like Everquest. I wouldn't say that I'm addicted, even though I play it a lot.  I miss it when I don't get to play for a while. So?  I miss ice cream when I don't have it for a while. <br>
<br>
I remember a similar debate over the issue of suicide and Dungeons &amp; Dragons when I was younger...  the problem, just like a lot of others, is that when a person commits suicide, people ask questions - Why? Who was responsible? Who can we blame? This is just another example.   Everyone likes to point fingers.... except at themselves.  <br>
<br>
How many people commit suicide because of problems with gambling, unrequited love, dysfunctional families, or severe depression?  Do you turn around and blame the casinos, the dating sevices, family counsellors, or mental health professionals? Do you blame the family, the parents, or the children?<br>
<br>
I don't like to blame anyone.  I like to hold myself responsible for my situation.   <p><center>

The game itself...no.  I could care less if I get on to kill some spiders in Velks or sell some shite in the Bazaar.  I could care less if I ever dinged again.<br>

I'm addicted to the people I have met and spend my game time hanging out with and talking to.  I've made so many friends online and offline through this game, and that's what keeps me logging on.<br>

The game is boring.  The people make it interesting.<br>

The link I put there is not just the pulling report, but some wise-ass gamers editorial remarks. I found it funny. <br>
<br>
Anyway, this is nothing new. The media as a whole is made up of cows who follow where the rancher tells them to go, the rancher being corporations run by old white men who profess to value Christian morals and condemn video games and D&amp;D, yet go out ofter work, rip a line of coke as long as my arm and beat the hell out of a prostitute. Ah, good ol' America. <br>
<br>
The people who own the media will forever condemn our sort of lifestyle. What lifestyle is that? DEVIANTS! Not in a bad way, for the stigmatic nature of the word only exists because of people like these fools. The fact of the matter is this: deviants are those who dont make GAP, Abercrombie, Lincoln, Lexus, etc etc any money. Why? Because we're too busy gaming to care about grabage like that. Sure some dress that way and live that life, but its rare. To l;ive that life is to work and consume, work and consume. Gamers cant just work and consume, because they need... GAMETIME. And the ones that take the most time, Dungeons and Dragons, Everquest, whatever, those are the ones they truly hate.<br>
<br>
Corporate Old White Guy, &quot;Ahh! Get your kids away from those mind-destroying Devil games!&quot;<br>
<br>
Blissfully Ignorant Parents, &quot;Oh my god, yes! We must! Its the Devils games!&quot;<br>
<br>
Corporate Old White Guy, &quot;Good job! Now make him cut his hair and go out and buy him out NEW FALL FASHIONS! All the good little non-DEVIL CHILDREN are wearing our neon green dress-vests with 456 pockets youll never use, priced ONLY at $350.00!&quot;<br>
<br>
Blissfully Ignorant Parents, &quot;Ohh, our child is no devil-child. Lets make him look presentable, like all the other non-devil children.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gamer Kid, &quot;Um...&quot; &lt;/blink&gt;<br>
<br>
Extreme case? Maybe. But the fact of the matter is that someone thats @#%$ in the head will kill themselves NO MATTER WHAT THEY PLAY, be it Everquest or Football (remember those suicides centered around Football games being lost? No? But it happens...just in that instance, it was somethjing else apparently.) To scapegoat a game is to show ones ignorance and lack of responsibility for ones fellow humans. <br>
<br>
Instead of focusing on ones hobbies (ends and outlets) society should instead focus one what would make someone REALLY kill themselves (means to an end). Its easy to blame a video game when an oppresive disfunctional family chooses not to accept blame and pretend nothing was ever wrong. Its easy to blame a game when the schools look the other way and choose not to see a kid getting picked on every day. The list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
All I have to say is...<br>

<br>
They basically had 3 stories.<br>
<br>
1) First was a guy who had a good job, a family, house, wife, 2 kids, etc.  But when he got home from work he 2-boxed all evening.  They showed time lapse of his gameplaying, and you could see the kids running up to say hi to their dad, running off, dinner being served, TV going on and off, etc.  All the while he's just sittin there dual-boxing.<br>
<br>
I thought that one was the truest and best commentary on the problems EQ can have.  Normallish people just spending way too much time on it, to the point of neglecting other social contact.<br>
<br>
2) 2nd story was Ben Steins kid, who basically played too much EQ, got sent to boarding school, and now doesn't play as much.  Ben Stein's initial descriptions sounded fairly accurate (that he was moody, that he was staying up all night playing, playing on the weekends, etc).  His later descriptions (that it was like he was possessed by a demon) were stupid.  <br>
<br>
3) 3rd story was that kid who killed himself.  My wife and I both agreed that EQ probably played a part in his death, but not necessarily because of the game was designed.  Two most probable causes we thought he killed himself for:<br>
   a) Had, or thought he had, a romance w/ someone in game, went bad, shot himself over it.<br>
   b) Got extremely depressed over the fact that he had thrown away everything he'd worked so hard for in order to play EQ (He quit his job, etc).<br>
<br>
They didn't show any &quot;well adjusted&quot; people who play EQ just a few hours a week, but they don't do that any time they talk about addiction (ie: when talking about gambling addiction, they don't do a story about someone who goes to Vegas once a year with a 200 dollar limit).<br>

It can be books, games, exercise, food, TV, chatrooms, anything that keeps their minds off of their real lives.  These people aren't happy with their lives, and in some ways the escapist behavior actually extends their lives, because at least then they have something in their life that doesn't feel like it hurts so much as real life.<br>
<br>
EQ makes an excellent escape.  You can choose what your avatar looks like, and this person is almost always an attractive, powerful member of their race.  This person is either a powerful soloer, fighting tough monsters all by themselves, or a class that's &quot;needed&quot; by others in groups - and there's nothing a depressed person who is unhappy and disconnected from their real life likes more than to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> needed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and appreciated by others.<br>
<br>
In EQ, you have so much control over what you do and don't do.  Your character is a free wanderer that makes coin and gains power through adventure, not someone who goes to a 9-5 job every day that probably won't ever go anywhere.  If someone starts getting angry at you, you can just /ignore them.  You can present what you want of yourself to other people; they don't have to know that you're a high school dropout in a deadend job, and they probably don't really care to know, either.  If you do your job well in a group, people will tell you so and you can bask in their praise, feeling like you're actually worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't think that taking EQ away from a depressed person is going to help them.  It's not going to force them to &quot;be normal&quot; and make friends outside the computer environment.  They're just going to find some other escape.  EQ addiction is not the problem for these people.  It's just a symptom.<br>
<br>
I wish I could say what the solution was to help the underlying problems that these people face.  For some people, medication and psychiatric appointments may help their depression.  It's a good idea for their family to also visit their psychiatrist, to help the family help the depressed person, as well as to help the family cope with having a depressed family member.<br>
<br>
There's no easy solution.  You can't just prescribe a pill to make the person all better.  You also can't make them get better by &quot;forcing&quot; them out of the house to do things other than their chosen escape activity.  But blaming the symptoms for the root of the problem is as counterproductive as if doctors decided that the flu was caused by a stuffy nose. <p><div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/velsig.jpg"><BR>

People who are depressed need to find an outlet, and how they deal with things through that outlet is what people see, I suppose.  I've had some bad problems with depression myself (which I don't want to get into here), and I know at times EQ has been my outlet, and at other times, it's been reading... and other times, it has been other outlets.  I would say I was a lot more depressed before I got Everquest... now it's helped moderate that a bit, because I'm having more fun... and I also have a much healthier way of getting out some of my frustration and anxiety than taking it all out on myself (just like some other people play sports, exercise, take a walk, or read).. <p><center>

In reality though, they live a very dull, unimaginative day to day existance and I think many at least on a subconscious level are bitter about it and wish to condemn all of us to the same existance.<br>
<br>
There are some very common themes... <br>
<br>
Music is a common target, most of the great classical composers were accused of writing the &quot;devil's music&quot; at one time or another much as modern artists are condemed as as bad influences.<br>
<br>
Alternative religions are a nice, easy target for the sheep because if you trash another religion then God is on YOUR side of course. <br>
<br>
Dancing in general is still a target among many religious groups, all that touching and moving MUST be a sin... The combination of dancing and music almost always lead to alchohol and drugs and I dont think I need to go further. <br>
<br>
Throw alchol and drugs together with music and dancing and OMG you have the potential for... Sex. Well sex is a nice target because alot of the major religions say its evil unless used for the purpose of breeding.<br>
<br>
Gaming has been a target for some time as well, gambling, pinball, AD&amp;D and for the last 10 years or so video games.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the sheep feel a need to attack anything that &quot;we&quot; use to escape the mundane day to day boredom that they seem to relish. We're not allowed to have any fun and lord forbid we enjoy our lives when they can not. These are the people who sit happily on their couches tuned in to the television from 6:00PM to 11:00PM every night. The sheep are the ones who buy the products that keep the advertising money flowing in to the television stations.<br>
<br>
Ok Sakharra is going to go WAY off the deep end here, if you have read this far, you probabily want to stop because I'm going to make no sense at all while spouting out a sort of paranoid theory.<br>
<br>
So here we are, nearly half of a million people spanning from early baby boomers to post generation X young teens and we're spending 5 or more hours a night or so playing a game and not watching television. Our numbers grow daily as do the number of games we can play. If we're not watching television, we're not being force fed the advertising that drives the income of the networks. <br>
<br>
So is it any surprise that the network news would attack Everquest ?<br>
<br>
The really sad thing is, they view us as isolated in front of our computers yet never realize that we are FAR less isolated than they are sitting glued to their television sets. We meet and experience a multitude of people in our world, we have real conversations, we agree, disagree, make friends and enemies all with real people who just happen to be sitting on the next block or on the other half of the world. All they have are two dimensional talking heads acting out scripts written by people paid to capture their attention. I feel just a bit sorry for them. <br>

<br>
As a child, when you are frightened that the monster who lives in your closet is going to burst out of there and eat you while you're sleeping, you latch onto your teddy, pull the covers up over your head and close your eyes because if you can't see it, it sure can't see you!  When that doesn't work you scream for your parents.  Lights come on, fill the room, you're encircled by loving arms and feel safe, loved.<br>
<br>
As you get older, you follow the cattle because you feel wanted, accepted and loved.  You laugh, you smile, you have a good time.  Must follow the cattle, the cattle love you.<br>
<br>
You go to a boring school, listening to boring teachers, conforming yourself to what is accepted by society.  You look at the kids who show their individuality and stick your nose in the air, tease them, pick at them, fight with them.  Gotta love the Mickey Mouse High School Drama Trauma Soaps.<br>
<br>
Your parents expect one thing, religion expects one thing, society expects one thing, your friends expect one thing and the only way to be accepted is to try to please them all.<br>
<br>
Oh... whats this... Everquest?  Oh cool, that looks neat, think I'll buy it.<br>
<br>
WOW... now here is a place that I can be true to myself...<br>
<br>
You quit going to church, you only went because it was expected of you.  You quit your job, not going anywhere in it, dead end, you can't stand it.  Your significant other leaves you because you are no longer conforming yourself to his/her standards.  You are start to be true to yourself and for a while, you are happy.<br>

Who gives a rats ass?  You know what?  When I go take a dump EQ is on my computer screen.  When I'm doing my homework its on my computer screen.  When I'm thinking about the girl I love its on the computer screen.  Hell I can't think of a time when the log in fuckin screen isn't on the goddamn computer screen.  It wasn't even in game!  What the hell.  I'm sorry but this guy coulda been thinkin about just about anything and killed himself.  The fact that the game was on the screen only means he played.  He was &quot;mentally challenged&quot;, which means that he probably had real life problems...maybe he didn't quit his job but they told him to resign cuz he screwed up...I highly doubt that his reason for quiting a job was to play more EQ...do we have any statements from friends about his obsessive behavior?  No, that whole part of the documentary was fuckin ridiculous just cuz its on the screen don't mean jack<br>
<br>
As for an earlier post about escapism...yes...I'll admit it I'm the first one to find escape in real life.  I get shat on in real life so much that my friends tend to think of me as &quot;unlucky&quot; in all things pertaining to life...and so I like doing other things I have so many hobbies it isn't funny.  But when it comes down to it my friends have always been there to support me and pull me away from the game to go work out or party or whatever...and honestly...not always do even these things compare to the pure fun I have when playing EQ...I'm proud of my dorf and I'm happy to know the people in my guild and others in the game.  &quot;Its just a game&quot; I don't think is true and VI is full of shit but they always are so no diff there.  It IS more than a game...Will you commit suicide over it? Hell no! Will things in game affect you IRL?  YES.  Will they cause you to be depressed?  I sure hope not.  IF they do then find a new game to play...anyone doing something for entertainment...even escaping should take responsibility for playing something that affects them negatively.<br>
<br>
My advice: EQ is an amazing game.  Is it truly addictive? NO.  I played it more when I first started when the game first came out and played it for many months hours on end.  Then I decided that I'd stop and spend more time with my, at the time, girlfriend and eventually I didn't miss it.  I came back 3 years later because I remembered how great this game really is.  If I decided to stop playing now I'd miss it but I wouldn't say no to change.  If you are that addicted then maybe they have a point about it being like &quot;crack&quot;.  I kinda think of it more like &quot;Everweed&quot; in that weed is good shit and you wanna have it when you can.  You'll spend a monthly budget on it, but the fact is that you are never truly addicted to the stuff and if you wanted to you can stop smoking it forever after. <p>Rundo Nundodundo

You must be accountable for your own actions.  people blaming things, whether it is EQ or whatever for making them do anything is a cop out.  We make our own choices.  <br>
<br>
When we make bad choices, some of us, or those close to us, sometimes try to place the blame as far away as possible.<br>
<br>

<br>
That game made my son kill himself.<br>
<br>
That (insert anything here) made my son (insert any bad behavior here).<br>
<br>
I have had personal experience with real addiction.  And I was to blame.  Thats right, me.  Not the drug, not my mom, not TV, not popular music, I was at fault.<br>
<br>
It is true that only certain things are actually physically addictive.  But almost anything can be psychologically addictive.  I've known potheads who were every bit as bad as heroin junkies when they didn't have weed.  I've seen people who honestly would not leave there house to go out because they had to watch TV.  I've seen people completely blow off all there real world friends to sit in chat rooms.<br>
<br>
Yes, EQ can be truely addictive.  But then again so can anything.  And if someone gets addicted to EQ and makes stupid decisions regarding their life because of it, it is not EQ's fault, anymore than it is TV's fault, or internet chat rooms fault.  It is the persons fault for not controling their own life.<br>
<br>
People blame the substance, and ignore the underlying problem.  Everyone needs an escape, but when the escape we choose takes over and becomes more important than the real world, we need to look at why we seek escape so much, not blame the escape we choose.<br>
