How do people interpret that.  Certainly it doesn't mean RP is mandatory at all times.

<br>
In practice, I think they might as well have just labelled this the crazy tradable loot server.  The existing rules-set is much more appealing to loot hunters / ubers than it is to roleplayers.  The roleplayers are here just cuz it's kind of a designated gathering area, and so you're more likely to find roleplay done (or at least tolerated) here.<br>
<br>
RPing on some of the blue servers you get made fun of, etc.<br>

Here's an interesting thought.  If they opened a new server, gave us all the frills of Legends, but promised to enforce RP there, would any of you pay extra to play there?<br>
<br>
And please, no dull comments on how hard it would be to police RP, we all know that so there's no need to point it out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1321<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/02 5:51:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1454.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Verant's take on RPing on this server</span><hr size=1> Nope.<br>
<br>
For starters, forced RP sucks, because then you're stuck letting Verant decide what is and what isn't roleplay.<br>
<br>
For seconds, 40 bucks a month is a lot.<br>
<br>
For thirds, I think the way they've handled Legends shows that they'd fail to provide service.  They promised those Legends players dynamic content &amp; tons of GM quests and such, and I'm pretty sure they don't get it.  All they get is the cheesy webspace and some kind of GM enforced raid calendar garbage.<br>
<br>
There are some things I'd pay extra for, if it was guaranteed that I'd get them, enforced RP just isn't one of them:<br>
1) Ability to play as other race/class/diety combinations.<br>
2) Ability to play as a monster (project M)<br>
3) A permanent &quot;quest GM&quot; who just ran quests all day... some silly, some more serious (a $3.00 per month price increase would be sufficient to pay for one of these 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and still give Verant a little extra on the side).  Especially if the quests were designed to help introduce players to more of the backstory of Norrath.<br>
4) Optional Zones (I'd be willing to pay a one time per zone fee to download special optional zones, like Broken Skull Rock or the Vasty Deep).<br>
<br>
The 40 dollar price tag on Legends is way too high, and too much of the benefits are felt outside of the game (world mapper, character webspace, etc).  I'd much rather pick and choose from a variety of special options that have a much lower price tag (some recurring monthly, others on a 1 time basis).<br>

If someone said anything blatently OOC/OOG on a public channel (/say, /shout) you could be /reported and have your character on that server suspended or banned.<br>
<br>
I don't think I'd pay more for that though.  I can play any Simutronics game and get &quot;enforced&quot; RP and a better RP atmosphere all around.  EQ just isn't designed around RP and will never be a great platform for it, no matter what they do to change things now.  I'm not going to spend more money just for the RP environment to improve a little.<br>
<br>
Edit: To clarify, when I say &quot;enforced RP&quot;, I mean an enforced policy against blatently out of genre references.  I think that such a policy is used to relatively good effect in GS3, it's not the fascist state that you might imagine.  It's not perfect for preserving the integrity of the roleplaying atmosphere in the game either, but it does a better job than no enforcement whatsoever I think. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

Lets face it, before the patches the population was pitiful. Still is in many places.<br>
<br>
I really think that people have to be a little more tolerant of others on this server.

<br>
I have mixed feelings about the recent patches. I believe removing alignment was a bad idea, but I think the alignment system should have been more dynamic... Instead of &quot;picking&quot; an alignment, I think alignment should have been handled a little more like faction (e.g. the more &quot;good&quot; faction you get, the more &quot;good&quot; your alignment would be&quot;). <br>
<br>
The reason for this is that I feel that the &quot;role&quot; being played by a person should be up to that person. If I want to play a dark elf, and Verant tells me I have to be a meanie and strive to kill High Elves, does that mean I'm *not* role playing if I want to be a nice/repentant dark elf?  Likewise, what's wrong with playing a powerhungry high elf wizard who forsakes his own kind for the darker secrets of the world?  Nothing. In both cases, you can roleplay who you want to be.   <br>
<br>
For me, role playing is playing the character you enjoy being, not what someone else thinks you should be. <p><center>

Anyways, I'd love if they reinstated the old rules, except possibly with the grouping rules because I imagine that one would piss people off the most if they put it back in.<br>

<br>
I personally would love to see alignment brought back in, but I don't know if that kind of retroactive change can be made (especially for characters made post-May 8th). <br>
<br>
I think it would have been interesting if, at level 10, you could &quot;shift&quot; your alignment one way (e.g. orderly to neutral, neutral to discordant, or vice-versa, or from good to neutral or neutral to evil, etc.) .. and then at level 20, had the same option... That way, someone who invested the time to take a character to level 20 would have the option of pretty much any alignment that suited their character.   <br>
<br>
I suppose, though, that the &quot;alignment&quot; option was largely in place to restrict grouping, and I wouldn't like to see that changed.  Of course, it was also used to restrict how your spells would affect others.  I remember one time in High Keep having to tell an injured dark elf that I could do nothing for her... <br>
<br>
Suffice to say, that I doubt any changes will be made to the server as it is now.  I sincerely hope that the /OOC channel is never brought in, and I wish that something was done more to restrict people using /auction or /shout as a form of OOC.  But... we can't have it all, can we?<br>

It might even push people to purchase Luclin just so they can sell their wares; wow, VI would really like that I bet!  /shout's range limit was perfect.  You can /shout a train when and where it mattered, and people across the zone wouldn't have to hear it since it didn't pertain to them.  By leaving it as zone-wide, all they did was NOT encourage RP... I mean come on, if my character actually shouted for a group, I don't think that barbarian shaman 2 mountain ranges away would be able to hear him.  And, as far as alignment goes, why not just include BONUSES?  If a group is all together of similar alignments, they get an XP bonus... that way if two characters really had to group and were of different alignments, they can, but won't suffer a penalty for it.<br>
<br>
The population may have been small before May 8th, but at least it felt more like a roleplaying game and less like Diablo.<br>

The last thing I want when tending to the young adventurers in Unrest is for someone to set up camp at the zone line and /auction WTS Ghoul heart for ghoulbane quest!<br>

It would be simple to just make /auction work only in the same zones where soul binding works...<br>

There's a lot that's unrealistic about this game, and I think zonewide shouting is useful as a warning.  The range on shout before was pretty pitiful, not useful in my opinion for warning about trains.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying is about communication.  I personally don't think that changes that inhibit communication are that great for roleplay.  I do wish that they would have put some effort into explaining everyone's innate ability to communicate across the world, across huge geographical regions, and even with people on completely different planets, either through some commonly available magical artifact, spell, innate power or just about anything else... but this is Verant we're talking here.<br>
<br>
I doubt you are going to see any changes made to Firiona Vie that would decrease the server population.  As long as they are committing roughly the same amount of resources (in terms of computers, customer service staff, bandwidth, power, ect.) they aren't going to run a server that caters to an extremely small subset of players, unless maybe they are players who A) wouldn't otherwise play EQ, or B) are willing to pay extra.<br>
<br>
My own suggestion was to split Firiona Vie and reinstate the old ruleset, that way people who came in after the alignment grouping restrictions could still leave for a &quot;normal&quot; ruleset server if the new rules didn't suit them, but I know that isn't going to happen.<br>
<br>
If you are serious about roleplaying and really want to get into it, best solution is to find another game to play. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

I came here because regular old EQ was pretty damn stagnant at that time.  It was fun as hell to join a group and just barely understand what all those elves and humans were jibbering about.  If they hadn't failed to code this server so that neutrals couldn't invite both goods and evils to their group and guild, if they hadn't removed the daunting task of learning foreign languages, if they hadn't removed the XP penalty for grouping with those incompatible with your character's philosophy, I wonder what sort of world we would have right now.<br>
<br>
I wish they could have viewed us as the &quot;tax write off&quot; server, the one place where they could monkey around with things, and not worry about FV's profit margin, and just gone ahead and gone even more nazi with their restrictions.  Instead, they bowed to the forces of capitalism, and removed a lot of what made us unique in order to turn a profit.  Would have been fun to be the market research joint, to see how many roleplayers EQ2 and SWG could really support.  I'd have been here until the bitter end, as long as my guild were also.<br>
<br>
Still, I am stuck in level 53, and have been here for a long time, because I, the player, refuse to join RAndom_XP_group_full_of_trolls_and_darkelves.  I don't mind that a bit.  I like that even if I have a full mana bar, and you are a dark elf that's going to die, that I can just sit there and watch it happen.  Certainly we could be friends on another server, and you might be the coolest person in the whole world, but I don't have to be guilted into healing you because it's the &quot;right&quot; thing to do.  We could probably go wreck house somewhere, and I would be 60 with many AA points if I had gone that route, but I just won't do it.  I would have stayed on Veeshan if that was the game I was interested in playing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uniyxqilarre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niyx QiLarre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/26/02 7:50:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1454.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FV</span><hr size=1> I think one problem there is is a lack of agreement about what constitutes 'roleplaying'. To my mind, roleplaying is about developing a solid character concept, with history and perhaps complex and evolving motivations. It involves characters having thier own take on what consitutes 'good' and 'evil', and making thier own descisions about who to group with and why. It involves characters who's alignment, religion and motivation may change as they evolve. Perhaps I'm spoiled by too much freeform storytelling style roleplaying, and not enough hack and slash, but in eq so often what seems to be called 'roleplaying' is 'me good, you evil' rubbish and fantasy cliches. Not that theres anything wrong with having fun playing a fantasy cliche, but that's not all there is to roleplaying! Otherwise, it's just like picking a football team, and just as dull! But there seem to be a lot of people who define 'roleplaying' as 'playing your alignment' rather than a character. <br>
<br>
Perhaps I am playing the wrong game and expecting too much, but I think the whole alignments thing is often distructive to actual roleplaying, unless you can change it every 10 levels as someone suggested, and restricting grouping based on alignment is crass.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the one thing they could do to add variety to the characters that are out there would be to allow people to change their religion. (Perhaps there are quests for this, but I havnt heared of any). Having characters with unusual religions and a good ic story to back them up would put a lot more colour into the game.<br>

They have justed turned it off. So, perhaps they could implement a .ini file switch which would allow us to turn them on for ourselves if we choose. So, for instance. if I turn them on I do not see auc in non-city zones, I see a restricted shout and I have grouping restrictions. Then if enough people turn on the switch we would have a solid base of people running the old rules. <br>
