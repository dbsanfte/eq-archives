<br>
This is actually a note for the poor citizens that have to be the victims of the invaders:<br>
<br>
1) Please be honorable - this is a game not a real live happening - it feels like it - it really does. It pisses you off and can even get scary - but it is a game. If you can't handle it - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>leave the area till you calm down</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
2) Training the guards on a planned event (I believe) is a game infraction and can be reported - not sure about that but either way its bad sportsmanship so please don't do it. If you feel like doing it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>leave the area till you calm down</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
3) If the invader(s) are trying to escape out of the city, town, area - <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">don't block the exit</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> - again I believe that is an infraction - and again I am not sure about that  - and again I DO know its bad sportsmanship - if you feel like blocking the invaders exit away to safety - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>leave the area till you calm down</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
4) When you challenge or are challenged in dueling - don't pull the invader into the guards - bad play - see above (sportsmanship) - also - if they die - offer to rez or corpse pull them to safety area. Maybe (wow what a concept) even heal them and buff them or if not - congratulate them for their battle - If you die offer them a handshake for the good fight and fun<br>
<br>
5) Insults done without rancor is fine - name calling and anger is not -- If you find yourself getting bent out of shape - you lost the duel-of-words and need to . . . . <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;font-family:times new roman;font-size:medium;">leave the area till you calm down</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> hehehe.<br>
<br>
This is just my opinion but has been the opinion of others in this situition as well and we have had a good time - and have been able to stabilize a situation that had gotten out of hand (walked into it after it had already gone bad) - <br>
<br>
RP often reflects real world events and RL moods often come into our RP so be aware of it and treat each other with care when battling other characters --- take a break if necessary.<br>
<br>

we got there pretty bad trained by someone who pulled the warriorgm on us.. we couldnt laugh with it...<br>

<br>
There are various reasons for not dueling. One, The character would not stand a chance against a certain class pare up. Or the Player mouthing off is higher than anyone else in the zone. Or your character plays a pacifist to all PC characters. Or your character just dose not want to fight with another person.<br>
<br>
Do thoses of us who fall in that catergory simply resign ourselves to being bad mouthed and insulted? do we simply let ourselves be walked over? this is a game, things like that happen to much in real life, and it can get you killed for it. Some people don't LIKE confrintations even if over a simple video game channel. What then are these people to do when someone comes along and belittles them and berates them? there is nothing i hate more then people saying &quot;I pnwed u&quot; I don't even know what that means! but EVERYONE who duels that i have met repeatedly talks trash. Maybe there are players out there who do not wish to duel, maybe they wish to escape the cruelties of the real world and be accepted into a game where everyone is 'nice'?<br>
<br>
I am sure there are many of you out there reading this saying &quot;Well tough, get over it, deal with it and some such, If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen&quot; or somthing to that nature.. no.. YOU realize not all people are your punching bag, we are NOT here for you to verbaly abuse. I have seen too many people leave because of people who Duel purely for the pleasure of rubbing it in their victums faces..<br>
<br>
personaly I was never good at dueling,  never good at being mean to people. But I always, ALWAYS, meet someone who thinks they are the greatest thing since sliced bread and that being an evil character give them the right to be a jerk to you. That makes me so angry I WANT to teach them a lesson, but it usualy turns out they are either a higher level or a better dueler than me and i am beaten, where as then they won't stop grinding salt into the wound. <br>
<br>
to sum it up.. If you think you can do anything you want to people and if they talk back and you /d knowing to can beat them, your no better than someone who trains, Ks, and scams. I play by the number one rule, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. you DO NOT know the life that half elf or vah shir is coming from,you don't know what suffering they have gone through, and to DON'T know what could suddenly set them off. Word hurt, its a fact. <br>
<br>
*puts his hands in his pockets*  sometimes Eq reminds me of highschool, popular kids picking on the weaker.. Don't expect any help from me if you do so..<br>
*turns around* but then again the people who do so probably don't care..<br>
*walks off flicking his tail back and fourth*<br>
<br>
Just thought i should add that, EQ isn't all about who is better.. its about fun.. you wreck someones fun for your own enjoyment.. you will pay for it later..<br>

<br>
If a person cannot back up their words, they should not open their mouth.<br>
<br>
I do not refer to those who are simply trying to stop the attack, or &quot;turn&quot; the attackers to the light, or what have you. I speak of the people that come up and talk about how they could beat the everliving hell out of you/me/them with one hand tied behind their back, etc., but then refuse to back it up.<br>
<br>
If you do not want to duel, do not taunt.<br>
<br>
If you have no dueling skill, keep your mouth shut.<br>
<br>
If the person you are throwing insults at is much higher level, be prepared to die, or keep quiet.<br>
<br>
Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions. Dueling is one of the only ways to roleplay the defense of a city and still abide by the PNP. <br>
<br>
To sum up, if you don't want to duel, don't start a fight.<br>
<br>
If you've made it this far, I'll also note that not ONCE have I *ever* &quot;rubbed salt&quot; in the wounds of someone I've defeated. In fact, I always send an ooc tell thanking them for a great bit of RP, and cheering them on. Christ, it sounds like you've run into the worst of the worst, but I've never once met any of them.<br>
<br>
I'll also add that I learned that behavior when I dueled a 54th level Paladin on my third day here, when Kullgen was a level 8 rogue. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He likely won't remember it, but you can thank Bakanome for teaching me proper dueling etiqutte. You NEVER ooc'ly taunt someone like that - it makes you an asshat.<br>

Very good post, to bad most won't see it, but I am glad that you did it anyways.<br>
<br>
I always laugh in Felewith when the yougins get mad that we killed the banker, well the banker is in a building WAY back there, when we attack we never go past the souldbinder, usually we never go past the bridge, so if the banker is dead you have one of your own to thank for it, there the ones who trained us.<br>
<br>
As far as the post about duels and some people not being in the game because of it, like stated before if you talk the talk walk the walk, as a Enchanter I have well over a hundred duels maybe even over two hundred, I duel alot I start alot of trouble, heck I am in Lust for Blood thats what we do, but I will tell you that out of all those duels I have LOST over 75% of them, I like fair duels, I don't go out of my way to fight those younger than me, but if they RP against me protecting their city then I will, season doesn't matter in RP to us, I don't care if you are season 1 or season 65, just ask any who know me, I will RP and fight them all.<br>
<br>
Many of us that attack cities do not go there to single newbies out, we go there to help get a RP battle going, if you want to play then play, if not nothing says you have to be involved, just don't open your mouth, even if you are are a pacifist, if you open your mouth to protect your city and get challenged then be honorable and and fight it out or leave, because you either want to be in the RP or you don't when you fight against us, we have no middle ground. We respect that maybe you don't want to duel, thats fine but if you decide to talk against then you are involving yourself in &quot;our&quot; RP then you should put up and fight, what we do does not stop anyone from leveling, doing trade skills, banking, they can just walk on by and go about their business.<br>
<br>
The worst thing to do is training people, I will and do report people who train then claim RP after the fact, anything that a PC does maliciously (sp?) that causes another PC to lose experience is against Sony's rules, thats just the rules (except on Sullen Zek).<br>
<br>
The rudest thing RP duel wise, is if you are one of the lamers who talk the talk get challenged then don't accept but hold the challenger up from haveing another duel, thats just lame and to me as lame as training people, I should copyright this hehehe, but I say &quot;Be kind, Decline&quot; it is easy to do and know ones knows you did it so they won't know that you where not willing to die for you cause or your city, just let the dueling RPers get on with their business, the sooner they duel the sooner they leave the city.<br>
<br>

<br>
1) Not duel you<br>
2) Not decline<br>
3) Go invis and train the guards on you from behind.<br>
<br>
Just because you've been around a long time to the point where you can talk trash to people doesn't mean I'm going to let you step on me.<br>
<br>
In real life people (even enemies) are civil, because otherwise even the weakest in our society is strong enough to punch you in the face.<br>
<br>
Lawyers are powerful, successful people, yet you never see a lawyer talk smack to the guy who works in McDonalds, because the guy will come out and punch you in the face.<br>
<br>
Same concept.<br>
<br>
From an RP perspective if I saw you killing a cop, a private citizen isn't going to engage you in mortal combat. He's going to run off and call the other cops, and you will either be prepared to deal with them or you will be prepared to shell out money for a coffin to get your corpse.<br>
<br>
So if you, the big and bad level 65 mage, walks into Nektulos and begin treating me, the level 1 necro, like crap and expect my only options to be &quot;Duel me or shut the hell up,&quot; then you are in for a very rude shock, like the lawyer who foolishly hurls a racial slur at a McDonalds employee.<br>
<br>
Sadly the whole affair would be totally In-Character, a case of the simple Dark Elvish citizen seeing lighties and dialing 911, and Karma going to work in-game as it always does in Real Life.<br>
<br>
The objective lesson here is : Be nice to the little people, for they pump your gas, serve your food, drive you to meetings, clean your hotel room and shine your shoes. In other words, they own your carnal world in very real ways.<br>

Thats fine but in RL you would not be there talkin smack as the cops you got came and got the killer, you wouldn't even be in the general area so that type of situation does not apply here <br>
<br>
And this is not Sullen Zek you train ANYONE for ANY reason you will get in trouble and you will be found, GMs can find out who did the training they have logs that they can check, and depending on who is doing the petioning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  they will, some say the GMs on our server are not that great, I disagree I have had nothing but great dealings with them and have seen them get things done.<br>
<br>
On this server no one forces anyone to be involved in their RP, so if you don't like it all you have to do is go about your buisness and ignore them, pacifists can do nothing against a enemy army when it attacks a city, country, castle, ect.<br>
this is Norrath not America, there are no sit-ins, this is a game that takes place in a wild world, people cast magic and fight monsters, it is my IG armies right to attack cities if we so wish, it is not your right to train us, what we do does not hamper anyones game play in anyway. If we attack your city<br>
we will ignore you until you start talking to us, it is your right to not talk to us, to not involve yourself in our RP, so if you decide to involve yourself and you don't like the outcome thats your problem not ours, what would you expect from a army attacking a city? That they would give up after getting a good tongue thrashing from a 1st season Necro? Not likely.<br>

if you are RPing training.. how do you explain beating your own guards to make them run after you?<br>

after the trains.. after the GMs came... (yes we petitioned, who wouldnt after being trained  3 times by the same one and lost several lives) after all were gone only 1 little gnome ( 20 mage ) left there sitting in front of the guards. then FINALLY after 2 hours of pissing us of we met someone who actually RPed with us, he insisted to duel us all although we were twice his age.<br>
we had a GREAT rping time then.<br>

choose what you want: The first method of RP with the trains when everyone is pissed off ( invaders ; GMs ; the guy who now has a flagged account)<br>

EQ is devoid of an over-riding governing body of law.  there is no police force and there is no justice that you cant hand out without the use of a sword or magic.  EQ and RL parrellels fall woefully short.  <br>
<br>
Whatever half-ass excuse you put to it, training is ALWAYS wrong.  Its no fun and it ruins what could be a good experiance for both the attacker and the attackee.<br>

<br>
You should actually play EQ and stop trying to make a RL parellel to everything.  There is nothing in character about punching a guard then running it over someone.<br>

When you call the cops do you need to take a few pot shots at their car before they help you?<br>

<br>
As a 21st Season Wood Elf Ranger, the Greater Faydark is my home in-character.  I feel it when I return there after long hunting trips in other zones, almost like getting home after a long days work, ah, good to be home.<br>
<br>
I have witnessed raids on Felwithe and have not taunted anyone, but instead, I cast buffs (not knowing if they help or not) on the guards.  The last raid being one that involved Lust of Blood, I actually got a tell from the leader of the raid.  He let me know that I could not stop them from doing what they were doing, to which I replied that is all well and good, but rest assured one day our paths will meet again.<br>
<br>
Does it bother me when I see a raid on one of the Elven cities?  Yes, not in a RL sense, but in a Roleplay sense.  I also realize that I am not strong enough yet to stop these raids, but one day, I shall protect the Greater Faydark to my best abilities.<br>
<br>
Till that day comes, keep up the good role play, as it's fun and sparks creativity in others by touching emotions.  Granted, there are some that need to seperate those emotions RL from IC, but that will be an issue we will continue to fight till eternity.<br>

Though I am now a &quot;Lighty&quot;. It seems most (not all) of my fellow lightys will not duel unless they are older than their opponent. And unfortunatly, have no problem with issuing random challenges to newbies.<br>
<br>
When I was evil. Seemed there was a bit more Honor. Most duels, (when you could get anyone to accept,) were with the very young or the very old. out of 30 odd duels. (not a record number by any stretch I know,) I fought a Dark blue con or white maybe 3 times. The rest were red cons. With a few greens mixed in for those who would not take the chance to leave with thier heads. (The guild I ran with would give at least 3 warnings that there was no hope of winning. If they still persisted then we gave them their deaths along with some respect.)<br>
Anyway, just an observation.<br>

P.S. As a side note. I reconize that in only a little more than a month playing a High Elf that I have not met a majority of the people who also play light races. And I conseed that there may very well be guilds that conduct dueling with a mind twards equality between opponents. I just havent seen them yet.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :f --><img src=http://www.spacespider.net/emo/fence.gif ALT=":f"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bantizar>Bantizar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/4/03 1:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=388.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just a brief note for those who raid other folks homes .</span><hr size=1> Read Most responces to this Post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :f --><img src=http://www.spacespider.net/emo/fence.gif ALT=":f"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I would Like to Point out to the Nay say'rs EQ has zones set so certain races are KoS in certain zones ( IE Dark elves in kaladim , Dwarves in Neriak ect ect If it wernt ment for charecters to go to these zones and kill sum gaurdes EQ has ways to make it where The Gaureds ,Merchants ,Bankers and anyone else you can think of would not be able to be killed or slayed you pick the phrase .<br>
Any ways I think most that have played the game for any time can relate to this low levels new to EQ wandering around exploring finding your'self in a new zone and being KoS and not knowing you shouldn't have been there to begin with I think Its cool that when you gaine the High levels it takes to do a raid on a city that you can go extract some revenge on that dark elf or that Gnome or even dwarf that you ran into when you wer level 1 To train others Is wrong lets say you wernt in yer charecters Home city Would you still do the Train? when people go to the city zones and kill gaureds or what have you they are there hunting and not serching you out have you ever thaught that for some this is the only way they can see the zone ? Not to be rude or condisending to anyone that might think I am But use your head and think about this Sebillis it is a city but it is also a dungeon how would it feel if you wer hunting there or even Kael and someone decided to Train you just because they had good faction there ? Be thankfull you dont have to fight to see whats inside that zone you call home and realize eventualy you could be the Invader to someone elses Home <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START |I --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tired.gif ALT="|I"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  this Is a Game Have fun and dont be a jerk and interfear with others Try'n to do the same <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :beer --><img src=http://www.spacespider.net/emo/beer1.gif ALT=":beer"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
