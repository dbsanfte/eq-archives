I work at a credit card auth company support line.<br>
<br>
Most of my calls are to referrer people to someone cause its mostly not our fault.  Most of the time i referrer people to there merchant service provider.  Ok yeah i understand if you dont know what that means, but come on when I say the people that deposit money into your bank account and I say its not me I do not know who it is than maybe I really dont know.  It your account you dont know who puts money into it? Hell if I am running a business I would want to know who is paying me.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for you people that beleive we support people lie to you.  Well we don't and we all are normally in the same building and record the calls so when you keep calling back ever 5 minutes to ask the same question than yes you are going to get the same answer and eventually someone is going to say you just called about this 5 minutes ago has anything changed since than to update this issue?  If your answer is going to be no than stop calling.<br>
<br>
Yes I know people are not computer savie but if you are going to call in and just tell me it doesn't work at least tell me what doesn't work and it would be wonderful if you could tell me what happens when it doesn't work.<br>
<br>
The sad part imo is when people say they are not computer savy that they cant not understand.  Well because we use a computer and you use a computer does not mean you need to understand computers to understand that you use a keyboard to enter in a number its not hard you can dial a phone right? Than why cant you enter in a number on a screen.  If your computer doesn't work I could understand not know how to fix it but we dont fix your computer we help you accept credit cards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rissenn>Rissenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/03 11:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4598.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: People who call tech support.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://uglydog.freeyellow.com/HD_Horrors.htm" target="top">Here is a nice link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> to a pretty funny site. be sure to read teh story at the bottom. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/sigs/Rissenn.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=simanmistrunner>SimanMistrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1069<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/03 11:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4598.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Not crazy about the responses</span><hr size=1> I agree with Llily.  The reason Tech Support people have jobs in the first place is because their customers are not computer savvy and need help with this stuff.  If your customers knew as much about computers as you, then you would be out of a job.  Period.<br>
<br>
Ranting about not being able to find the service tag is silly.  I have been using computers for over 10 years and consider myself fairly proficient in their use but would not know where to find my service tag.<br>

I am an attorney.  A lot of my time is spent advising clients on how documents work and often times these are answers they could have arrived at themselves if they spent a minute to go through the documents.  However, it is easier for them to simply call their attorney for that answer and that is one of the services we provide.  If they understand the documents better than I do and are able to draft them better, then I am out of a job.<br>

This would be true IF I DIDNT TELL THEM 50 TIMES where it is. Geez. How difficult is &quot; The white sticker on the back of the tower&quot;. Golly, thats hard. And if they cannot find it ( maybe the sticker is gone or soemthing, whatever) then just know WHAT KIND of computer you have. This isn't freaking rocket science. If a person calls in, and says &quot;My thingie is broken&quot; and refuses to say even what kind of computer they have, whats broken, whats not working, anything, do not even know if its a desktop ( aka personal computer that sits on a desk) or a laptop ( the small notebook kind that can sit on your lap)and then get mad when we can't help, it makes me want to pull my hair out. If you are that fucking stupid then have someone else who knows how to work at least a toothbrush call. Sad part is...the MAJORITY of people who call me are IT managers. Today, when speaking with one, after he couldn't find the service tag, I asked what kind of server he has. Expecting to hear &quot;Poweredge whatever&quot;, once again, I was completely floored, when he said &quot;Winxp&quot;. <br>
<br>
I am not saying all people who call tech support are stupid, and it is understandable that they dont know how to fix what is wrong, It is also understandable that they may not be able to find this tag, but there are limits to my patience. If you cant even read the words &quot;Optiplex&quot; or whatever else, thats ON THE BOX, can't even say WHAT is wrong or why you are calling, then for the love of god, have soemone else call. And when I explain to the caller for the 10th time that ~I~ Am not a tech, so could not help them at all, that my job is to transfer calls, don't say &quot;It's just a simple question&quot;. and proceed to tell me a 15 minute story, at the end of which, I just transfer you like I said I was going to do. Additionally, lots of these people CAN and do find the service tag, but sit there for 10 minutes trying to convince me that I need the reference/case number instead, even when I explain that I cannot help them with that number, to give the TECHNICIAN that number, which I will be glad to transfer them to as soon as I know what kind of  computer they have, and then they get mad at me and say FINE  take the stupid service tag if you are gonna be picky about it. <br>
<br>
It boggles my mind, that if these people would just shut the hell up for 5 seconds and answer my questions, even if it's with I dont know, ( to an extent) their wait time in the queue would be tons less. More time they spend whining at me, is more callers that get in ahead of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skylias>Skylias</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/co/snowboarding98/mah_ranjah.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tribulation Officer<br>

I work for a small-ish engineering firm (about 15 people). I build, fix, and maintain all of our computers here. I also manage our servers, the VPN, exchange server etc., etc. I have to be nice to these people because I work with them every day. Thankfully they're all smart enough to just let me do my thing with minimal hassle whenever something goes wrong. Something breaks, I fix it, The End.<br>
<br>
But even so, I get enough of a taste of the frustration of doing tech support that I know I don't have anywhere near enough patience/diplomacy to deal with that.<br>
<br>
My biggest pet peeve is this:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Valued Employee:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I was working with &lt;Application X&gt; when I got some error message and I had to close it and start &lt;Application X&gt; again.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Me:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Is it doing it now?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Valued Employee:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> No, it's working fine now.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Me:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Do you know what the error message said?<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Valued Employee:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> No. It said something about an error. I don't know what it meant.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Me:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ...<br>
<br>
Please for the love of all that is holy, if you have a computer problem that involves an error message, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>write it down</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. It's not just &quot;a bunch of gibberish&quot;, ok? Just because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't understand it doesn't mean that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> won't. If you can't tell me what the problem is, I can't help you.<br>
<br>
My other annoyances are mostly minor. I had this one guy (contract employee who thankfully no longer works here) who consistantly referred to the desktop PC we used as a file server as &quot;the mainframe&quot;. Whenever he would refer to using Power Desk or Windows Explorer to browse the F: drive (the file server), that was called &quot;logging on to the mainframe&quot;. Yeah, I know; it's not a big deal. But after hearing that every day for a few months, I was starting to go crazy. It would be like if you were a mechanic and you had this one cusomter who insists on calling his van an SUV. Eventually it's like someone running their nails down a chalkboard. And you want to correct him, but you know it's just not worth it.<br>
<br>
This was the same guy who never did understand why he couldn't just bring his laptop from home and have it automagically work with our Win2k domain. I tried explaining to him as simply as I could that joining our computer network would require me to either do things to his laptop that would make it not work at home, or I would have to drop all of our network's security; neither of which I was willing to do. I finally just had to tell him that joining our network wasn't like joining a country club - it's like joining a cult. Once you're in, there's no getting out. I don't think he really got that, either, but the questions stopped after that  <br>

<br>
I dislike that there are jobs that employees get so upset at, that they automatically begin to assume that the person calling them is a retard, like a large amount of ppl that call them are. <br>
Its extremely frustrating to try to talk to a tech who is ''talking *down* to me&quot; because they think i dont know what *i'm* talking about.<br>
<br>
Not saying everyone who has difficult jobs are like this. But it certainly is frequent.<br>
Pharmasists (sp?) and state employees (its almost impossible to lose your job as a state employee so they tend to get cocky) are also places were a snappy attitude is common. I understand your job is hard. I witness you dealing w/ ppl that are morons. But just because they are, dont you fucking treat me like i am.<br>
<br>
just my opinion.~ <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=357442">Kinelory Opiates</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> ~ 65 Prophet<br>

Completely agree.<br>

We were both on a conference call with our head office, his phone kept ringing - 4 or 5 times.  Now we only deal with internal people, we could see it was from the Marketing Meeting room, so we figured if it couldn't wait, they'd just walk down and see us (it's just around the corner ... literally 5 offices away).<br>
<br>
However, they didn't.  So we carried on with the call.<br>
<br>
After the call ends I check my email and find an email addressed to my assistant, BCC'ing me:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As per repeated voicemails, the Scanner is NOT working, you cannot log into novell, and selecting workatation only will let you log in, but the scanning program doesnt work.<br>

<br>
If you could look into it ASAP it would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
(and yes, I have attempted to reboot)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->And yes, there were a whole stack of increasingly desperate voicemails on his phone.<br>
<br>
So he walks around to the Marketing Meeting room.  Looks at the scanner.  Picks up the POWER PLUG which is clearly lying on the FLOOR, not in the plug, and plugs it into the wall.<br>
<br>
Funnily enough, the scanner worked after that.<br>
<br>
1. try getting off your back side and walking around the corner before sending bitchy emails trying to get him in trouble by BCC'ing his manager ... and ...<br>
2. try using the eyes, and maybe even brain, you were born with, and exercising the observational skills of a 2 year old?<br>
<br>
Oh, and I *SO* agree with the error message thing.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It keeps giving me an error message!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What did it say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh ... I don't know&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What were you doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh ... I don't remember&quot;<br>

&quot;What did you click to make the error message go away?&quot;<br>

This reminds me of the first computer I bought from Compaq, a 486DX2, with 2 megs of vram. Whoo! that was a screamer! I had it 2 months and the hard drive crashed, wouldn't boot and the drive was making clunking noises. I call up Compaq and tell the my hard drive crashed (after waiting on hold for the madatory 30mins)<br>
<br>
Tech: &quot;What's it doing&quot;<br>
Me: it won' boot, says can't find system disk Abort, Retry, Fail?<br>
Tech: &quot;Do you have a floppy disk in?&quot;<br>
me: no its the hard drive...it's clunking<br>
Tech: Clunking&quot;<br>
me: yeah, clunking. Here I'll let you listen to it. <br>
<br>
*starts up the pc...pc goes CLUNK, whir, CLUNK, whir, CLUNK...system disk not found...<br>
<br>
Tech: Yeah, it sounds like your hard drive crashed<br>
me: yeah, that's what I said...<br>
Tech: we'll send you another drive and have a tech out to install it for you, next week.<br>
Me: Thank you!<br>
<br>
And for what it's worth, I lost 3 drives in two different pc's in that house, in two years, and I've not lost a drive in the 3 year's since I move out of there. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=741435&amp;resize=true">My Gear</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garios>garios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/03 10:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4598.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: People who call tech support</span><hr size=1> Yes I went to school for computers but I quess they left out the mind reading class's.

<br>
1) the mute button is your friend... use it.<br>
2) venting everywhere else but at the customer is a -good- thing so you can be calm, collected, and nice to the customer.  THAT customer hasn't asked that inane question 50 million times, but you have had 50 million customers within a span of 10 minutes who have asked that exact same inane question.<br>
3) They go away.  When I was subteaching, this got me through some narly classes... 50 mins and they go away.  With tech support, it was even shorter.  Thus, I could be nice and pleasant for that time firm in the knowledge they would go away and not be heard from again.<br>
<br>
As for customers..... I worked phone tech support for a company that OEMed scanners, one of the 3 lowest priced in the market at the time (they are now out of business).  I have worked tech support calls with grocery store manages and grocery wholesalers for EFT (electronic fund transfer... using plastic to pay for stuff) software/hardware.  I have also been tech support to the tech support for EFT stuff.  The absolute worst of that was tech support for tech support.  You know you have specifically sent information to the individual.  You have confirmation the individual opened the document.  You sent it less than 10 mins ago (so it wasn't like they could have read it a month or two ago and forgotten) and they ask you the same exact damn question you have covered very sepcifically in the FAQ.  In fact, when you read the exact text of the FAQ to him (asking him to open his document so he sees it as well) he fully understands it and it answers exactly what he needs.  ARGH!!!  that coupled with the fact most of the tech support was pretty clueless on how computers worked, even how to format a floppy diskette (which they did need to do on occassion).  Worse, the one person who was -the- most inept at any computer knowledge was promoted and the one who actually knew stuff and worked his tail off getting things accomplished was laid off (long before I was laid off, so I am not referring to me). Gahhhhhh!<br>
<br>
BOFH = Bastard Operator from hell.  It's the series of essays written by a sysadmin of the things we would -love- to do but actually don't.  It is written for humor, to get through the harrowing stuff with a bit of grin while retaining a nice, calm, happy demenur to the customer.<br>
<br>
RTFM = Read the Fucking/Fine Manual.  99% of -all- problems can easily be solved with reading the printed material which came with the product and/or looking for support information on the website of the manufacturer.  <br>

And yet I'll wager that most people today spend more time in front of a monitor than behind the wheel.<br>
<br>
The other 50% comes from people who can't read and follow directions.<br>
<br>
I really don't expect people to know anything about computers, but I do expect at least a grasp of basic terminology. Not knowing the difference between the monitor and the computer, or between Windows and Excel is like not knowing the difference between a gearshift and a tire or between the engine compartment and the trunk. And I expect that a person can perform basic functions with a computer much in the same way that a mechanic assumes that you actually know how to drive a car. That's all. I have absolutely no problem explaining things to someone whose knowledge ends with the basics. In fact, I can actually enjoy it as long as they actually want to know the answer to what they asked.<br>
<br>
But that brings me back to the other frustration, which is when people have very strong &quot;beliefs&quot; about their computer without having even the slightest bit of knowledge about it. It easily takes 3 times as long to fix a problem when you first have to &quot;deprogram&quot; the customer and convince them that what they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>think</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is wrong with the computer is not what's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>actuallly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wrong with the computer. Of course, you can't just tell them that they're crazy and/or clueless. To wit:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The place where a friend of mine works was going through the process of upgrading all of their computers.
