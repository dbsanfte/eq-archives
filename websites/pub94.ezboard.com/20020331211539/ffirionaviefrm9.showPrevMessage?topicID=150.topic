<br>
I have been on FV for three weeks now and absolutely love it after trying to play on a regular server for a few weeks. I have a few questions in regards to roleplaying and I'm wondering if there are websites I could go to for the answers, or if anyone could help out with some information. This will probably be a long post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm playing a female Half Elf Druid and now that I've hit my 14th season, I'm running into more and more people and tend to stay quiet alot as I haven't really fleshed out my character or given her a history. I'm having problems with it simply because I can't seem to find much more information other than Half Elves are the product of a Wood Elf &amp; Human mating. We have no real home or city so there is no culture to draw on with that as well. Also, she is a follower of Karana and other than the small paragraph in my strategy guide, I don't know much more about him.<br>
<br>
The direction I'm going so far is that she has adopted Halas as her home city, falling in love with it the minute she stepped foot in it, the by-product is her having a slight Barbarian accent at times and an affinity for Barbarian men, hehe. She is generally quiet unless spoken to, I know she doesn't like the human part of her (which is really just a prejudice of my own because almost every single lewd come-on I've received has been by a human male, I'm starting to cringe at the sight of them if they are lower level). <br>
She is friendly and will go out of her way and accross zones to help friends out and will talk your ear off if you break her silence. She buffs and SoW's passers-by and those who ask and likes to help people. She also has a tendency to get into predicaments, a pretty big tendency, hehe. Mainly, I have no idea how to go about making her personality more in the forefront and less generic when I'm in conversation with someone new.<br>
<br>
I hope this is the appropriate place for these questions. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!<br>

Now debuting in her 14th season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/12/02 6:36:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New to Fv and Roleplaying</span><hr size=1> Well, I like to stick my nose into places where it doesn't belong, so here I am.<br>
<br>
Probably the best advice I could offer is pick an attitude and BE CONSISTENT!  Don't change your mind halfway through an idea, or, if you do, roleplay as if you are going through those changes.<br>
<br>
Take a look at Sarhea.  Once a goodie two-shoes (I believe guilded with Starspun, but I'm not sure), she has finally come around to seeing the true light of things on Norrath.  Or the true darkness of things, perhaps.  Her character is coping now with a difficult love interest, coping with her change of attitude, coping with making new friends and adjusting to the fact that her old ones would see her dead.  It's really quite an interesting story if you keep up to date on it.<br>
<br>
Roleplay with others, but roleplay with yourself too.  Roleplaying strikes the imagination, and there's no reason you should stop doing it just because noone is around.  If you hate humans, show your disdain for a human vendor just once when you run through Freeport or Qeynos.  If there is some creature like Aviaks or Kerrans or Frogloks or just anything that your character has a fondness for, don't attack them, and if you see one /wave at it in friendliness.  Little things like this, spread out, help reaffirm your character in your mind and will make her stick out in others minds as well.  My character carries a journal around with him and is quite fond of writing in it when he gets a chance (Which I really do, through courtesy of Livejournal).<br>
<br>
Try to make some friends that roleplay.  The worst hindrance you could find for roleplaying is to continually group with those that don't roleplay.  They won't want to hear it, and they might make you feel a little foolish about it if you try it in their company, which in turn will make you a little more hesitant to try it in other company.  So find some people that will roleplay with you.  Have an in-character discussion about the toils of tailoring or baking.  Or slaying orcs.<br>
<br>
Join a guild that highly-encourages roleplaying.  Try to find one that limits it's OOC over the guildchat channel.  When others are constantly in character, it encourages you to remain in character as well.  This also reinforces your character to you, and keeps her fresh and exciting.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest, if you like, keeping a journal of your characters exploits.  You can make a special livejournal (mine is at www.livejournal.com/users/firionavie/) or you can get your own ezboard, something that many of our best roleplayers have done.  They enjoy writing stories containing their characters or keeping journals of their thoughts.  This also reinforces your character concept, while letting others join you in your personal storylines and maybe even contributing something theirselves.<br>
<br>
Find one of those annoying surveys that everyone fills out and forwards all the time, and fill one out to the best of your ability from your character's viewpoint.  What is her favorite drink?  Weapon?  Where does she live?  What is her last name?  Who were her parents?  Brothers/sisters?  How old is she?  You should find that if you fill out alot of these questions with some thought and effort that you have a nice, well fleshed-out character that is consistent.<br>
<br>
Well.  I suppose I should get going.<br>

Don't think of this as a limitation. Think of it as a freedom for role playing. You have the best of TWO worlds to choose from. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
You could write yourself to have been born from any human/elven city -- Freeport, Felwithe, Kelethin, Qeynos, Highpass, Halas, Surefall, etc. And it's also possible that you find out there was some Barbarian blood in your human ancestors. There's nothing strange about that, since the Barbarian race evolved into Humans, and Humans evolved into Erudites. Since these three humanoid races are very close genetically, a lot of barbarian/human/erudite inter-marriage mixing is probably a fact of life in Norrath. <br>
<br>
Karana the Rainkeeper is the Norrathian God of the Plains and Rains. The vast plains of Karana are named after him. That's why it rains so darn much in the Karana zones. There are more than 2 dozen gods in EQ. Karana is one of the Major Gods, in terms of sheer power, and in terms of the number of followers he has. He's also one of the most powerful among the &quot;good-aligned gods&quot;. <br>
<br>
Karana is associated with nature, plains, the rain, the weather, thunder, wildlife, trees, etc. He's naturally a patron god of druids, rangers, possibly beastmasters and other nature type classes. <br>
<br>
He's a nature deity, much like Tunare the Elven Goddess (the Mother of All, aka Mother Nature). Mix the letters in Tunare and you get the word &quot;nature&quot;. hehe  Since you are part elven, even tho your main worship is Karana, it makes sense that you also have great respect for Tunare. <br>
<br>
Taken from the Verant official deities page:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
K A R A N A · The Rainkeeper <br>
Karana is allied with Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. Bertoxxulous is his enemy. Followers of Karana, the Rainkeeper, believe in the absolute power of storms. They worship the life-giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer strangers shelter from the elements. Many of Karana's followers live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana or of his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Also unless I've gone senile lately... I remember there is some kind of temple for Karana worshippers in the human city of Qeynos. I could be wrong tho.... or maybe that was the Temple of Rodent the Knife, Rat God of Life. Oh who cares, the Undead Temple of Bertoxxulous is the bestest place of all. Very very few EQ players have ever seen it....it's damn spooky! *grin*<br>
<br>
madrain made a good point about joining a guild.... you should take some time and find a good guild that has role players.... and make sure it's a guild that has a similar alignment and similar mindset as your character. birds of a feather flock better together. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
There are a lot of things to be said for playing a halfelf. First of all, and really most importantly, I think is that it's really a flexible thing. Sar's white haired/lavender eyed and I made her that way when I rolled her because I wanted to play her being half teir'dal. So don't EVER tell Sar she's half woodelf*bleh*.  <br>
<br>
I agree with however you play her, be consistant. Which isn't to say don't grow, many have that confused. &quot;A ranger should only act this way&quot;*bleh*. There are many options really.<br>
<br>
About Karana. This is all OOC because in character, Sar's going off at Karana would be long and tedious I'm sure.<br>
<br>
He's the raingiver. A generally neutral god, works with Tunare. Now the thing lots of folks don't mention when talking about Karana is that while he does bring the gentle life giving rains, etc, he's also the bringer of storms, hurricanes and other mass destruction. Sar was more a worshipper of the power of the weather than of the goodness and light stuff. <br>
<br>
At any rate, I've gotten all longwinded just to say this:<br>
Read up on any Norrathian lore you can get hold of...www.tomeofages.com has some good stuff, and get to know your character.  And once ya do, if she does something you didn't plan for, go with it.*grin* It'll be interesting if nothing else.  And don't change your backstory in the middle of things. That's just cheesy. Change where yer going all you'd like, things happen like that. WHen I started Sar I didn't PLAN to be a warrior, but that's where I am now and having a blast. It's all about being able to have fun and roll with the fact that you can't manipulate other players so things don't always go the way you want*grin* <p><p align="center"><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner"><b><font color="#710672" face="Black Chancery" size="-1">Sarhea</font></a><font

Let me use my character, Vall, for an example. He's one of those &quot;you're all primitive morons, I should be your leader&quot; type. Probably the only one who doesn't believe in the Gods (Not worship. He literally doesn't believe the Gods are there), he's out to form a small-time organization, then build it up from there. He's not what I call &quot;the hive evil&quot;, which I basically consider to be those soldiers/people who serve for an evil cause/deity/whatever and exist to wipe out good, ala a bee to a hive, nor the &quot;evil genius&quot; evil, like a caster. He's more of a chaotic neutralish (dodges the lawsuit) of a guy out for himself. That isn't to say that he won't take threats out of the way in a second. He'll kill all right, although certain things he won't touch. <br>
<br>
So you see, it's easy to create whatever personality you want for your character's race. You just need to flesh out what kind of storylines you'd like to go for and stick with it.

Remember of course that Half-elves share a background from two completely different races, with different temperatments, lifespans, and culture. Gyrhawk has two different sides to his personality, both of which are quite extreme, and he has yet to come to terms with himself. <br>

I played her last night and payed alot more attention to how she interacts with people and the things she says and does. I also made some conversational hotkeys for different situations she finds herself in. All of you're comments gave me a good idea on how to go about creating a more fleshed out personality, and you're different stories really helped in realizing how broad a canvas there really can be for a character.<br>
<br>
Regarding guilds, while I really would like to be a member of a guild for the chance to meet more people, have more goals in the game and to be able to help others as well,  I have only been playing EQ for a few months now and there is still so much to learn, that I worry at this point in my playing, I'm still a little too green to fully be a help to a guild and not be a hindrance. Though I have started paying more attention to players I meet that are guilded and plan to start asking questions about the different guilds soon. <br>
<br>
Again, thank you so much for your help, your ideas and the links. I'm off to go check them out now! <p>Narie<br>

According to the official 'lore', all half-elves are the descendants of human &amp; wood-elf parents.  Yet there's a lot of NPCs in game who claim to have different ancestry.  I know at one time (not sure if there still is), there was a dark elf in the Neriak Rogue's guild who wants you to assassinate a halfling in Misty Thicket and return her head because she was pregnant with his child (what a loving dad! ).<br>
<br>
   So don't feel that you HAVE to play your character a certain way just because it says something in the lore section.  The stuff there is really generalized and a lot of it makes no sense (if you look under the description of Rodcet Nife, it says that a large number of his followers are rangers, but you can't choose him as a diety for a ranger regardless of which race you pick).<br>
