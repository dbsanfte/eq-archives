 OOC: I am posting this story, chapter by chapter, for those recruiting for guilds to read.  This is my &quot;advertisement&quot; that I SEEK a guild and have also posted this in the GUILDS secction.<br>
<br>
My husband and I are roleplayers, play everquest casually, and will not level quickly. We do not seek uber guild, or uber materials. We seek the companionship of story tellers such as ourselves, to weave our stories into, like threads in a larger blanket. We seek a guild that will be our blanket to weave ourselves into and among. We roleplay in storyboard and in guild chat, as well as in /say as we train and hunt. <br>
<br>
If it pleases you, continue reading the story of Jadzya Keyes and her barbarian hero, Denlough, and may the gods of Norrath be with you. <br>
 <br>
<br>
  Chapter One<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Jadzya picked her way carefully past the broken branches her prey had left in his path. She knew the poacher was hiding in this copse of trees, for though she was only of five seasons, his trail was easy to track. Rounding a large rhodedendron she suddenly comes face to face with the little gnome, smiley widely as from behind her a gnoll smashes the back of her head with a club.<br>
<br>
Waking with a start, she tries to stretch cramped muscles and finds herself chained to a string of other prisoners being guarded at the edge of a camp. Looking toward the fire she sees many gnolls of varied sizes gathered about, but in squinting her eyes, her blurred vision reveals that some are, in fact, gnomes. Food is brought to the group of slaves and they all eat hungrily as a very large human in a skirt enters, ah, a barbarian, walks to the fire and begins bartering with the one of the gnomes. An agreement is made and as bags of gold are exchanged, the slaves are taken one by one to relieve themselves. When is it Jadzya's turn, it occurs to her that she's never seen a female gnoll while the guard watches her squat to pee. &quot;Hard to tell if you're scowling or smiling with a face like that,&quot; she tells the guard sullenly when she finishes. The guard slaps her hard and yanks hard on her chain as he returns her to the other slaves and reattaches the lead. Soon she is marching a path with the other prisoners. &quot;Can't tell what direction we're going in the darkness of this place,&quot; she mumbles to herself as she trudges along, although she strongly suspects she's in Blackburrow. <br>
<br>
Mud and grit make way for snow and the sound of birds die out to the sound of howling wind and still they trudge on. Gathered onto a ferry, she sees the first of Halas with the other slaves, wondering what their future holds.<br>
<br>
 <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Chapter Two<br>
<br>
It is dark when the slaves are dragged off the ferry. They are chained together in three lots of four slaves each. A miss-step by one of the slaves in Jadzy's lot sends all them all into the shivery water before they can make the dock and the four of them sink, thrashing in the deep. The one thing that can terrify Jadzya without fail is deep water. Deep, and dark water sends her to panic and she fights to climb her way to air over the tops of the other slaves. Mercifully, the chain tieing them together is caught and dragged up onto the pier, the slaves choking and coughing. Jadzya coughs out a thank-you and a reply comes in the form of a boot to her kidney's and the sound of men arguing about almost loosing live bounty.<br>
<br>
The slaves are brought to a large round building with a bonfire in the middle. A barbarian they've not seen before approaches their lead captor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well now, Dun, yu've dun goot this round. Ah'll teek those four a'shivrin' and the rest are yur's ta sell as ya like an keep the purse. These four'll be more ' n enough to cover your guild-fees for a bit, man.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, thank 'e Lord McTarnigal. Twas thinkin that li'l yella haired wun wuld do goot service to yur young son, if'n ya knows what ah mean. At least till she turned 'erself into a down'd rat.,&quot; their captor replies with a sly wink.<br>
<br>
&quot;Might do at that, he's been moping too much after that girl of MacMillan's that spurned him. A bed-warmer might be jus' what the lad needs,&quot; he laughs heartily and slaps Dun on the back. <br>
<br>
Eight enslaved prisoners are walked out of the hall and the four with Jadzya are taken the other way in the direction of Cappi McTarnigal's estates.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
  Re: Chapter Three<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Weeks have gone by since Denlough saw the last ferry of slaves brought into Halas. He is one of many who argue against the rogues dealing in selling of slaves. &quot;One of them, that little blond woman, now there's a firecracker,&quot; he thinks to himself. &quot;One day one of those beatings is going to kill her.&quot;<br>
<br>
He could not help but cheer the day he saw her yank so hard on her neck chain that she pulled young McTarnigal face-first into the snow. She was covered in bruises and welts the next day, but no doubt she knew that was coming when she pulled on that chain. Curiosity gets the better of Denlough and tries to strike a conversation with the girl at the watering-well under the glaring eye of one of the McTarnigal servants. <br>
<br>
&quot;The human girl looks older up close, early twenties maybe. Hard to tell under that black eye, but definitely not a teen as I thought,&quot; Denlough says to the servant, and to the human, &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You just keep your own eyes to yourself young Denlough or my master and his boy will be after you for sure,&quot; replies the servant. <br>
<br>
Jadzya watches the exchange and replies &quot;Jadzya,&quot; as she turns away with her buckets of water and hefts the carrying pole up onto her shoulders and she marches off toward the McTarnigal grounds.<br>
<br>
Denlough makes a point to meet the slave, Jadzya, and the McTarnigal servant every day at the well. He faithfully begins his visit with the slipping of coin across the servant's palm. Jadzya is hesitant to talk with the big barbarian man, knowing only cruelty and beatings from the barbarians that keep her captive. Denlough tries to show her that not all barbarians, in fact, that MOST barbarians are kind and good people. A little rough around the edges, but good. He flirts with the McTarnigal servant for good measure and to keep in her good graces so he can continue talking with this young human woman, still unsure at what it is that has peaked his curiosity.<br>
<br>
One day, Jadzya is late to the well. When she arrives, he sees she grimaces with each step, but stubbornly keeps the pole carrying the water pails across her shoulders. After sliding the coin into the servant's palm and some small talk, he turns to talk with Jadzya who has her back to him, filling the pails from the well. The usually lithe, golden back is covered in lash marks, fresh and bloody and uncared for. Denlough clenches his jaw in anger and makes a decision. He must find this girl her freedom. If he can get her past Blackburrow, she can make it home on her own, and he can return home to Halas with none the wiser. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
  Re: Chapter Four<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 After much study and bribery, Denlough has the path through the McTarnigal compound to Jadzya's cell memorized. He knows that the cell is unguarded as the compound itself is very secure in its perimeters. If no one can get in, then no one can get out. At least, that's the theory. The chink in their armor is found via the dog kennels, and Denlough is a young man training in the art of beastlords, and so, has not a bit of trouble getting past the canines who continue to sleep lazily.<br>
<br>
As a kitchen slave, Jadzya has a small cell that shares a wall with the massive oven that goes day and night and so keeps her quite warm at night. He finds her sleeping there and luckily has his hand over her mouth before the light sleeper can squeek and he shushes her as he moves his face close to hers so she can see who she is. He whispers, &quot;Tis time to get you out of 'ere, lass.&quot; <br>
<br>
Jadzya's eyes widen as she sees a light appear through the door behind Denlough. The drunken son of Cappi McTarnigal sways in the doorway with a lantern in hand and snarls, &quot;Whas goin' on 'ere!&quot;<br>
<br>
Denlough spins, knowing the Laird's son is more seasoned than his own measely training, but hopes that young McTarnigal's drunkeness will even the odds. He leaps towards the rogue and the drunken man sidesteps deftly, his dagger out ready to backstab Denlough. Jadzya, hidden by the bulk of Denlough is ready and yanks the tattered rag of a rug out from under the rogue as his feet shift and it throws him off balance. He spins as he falls and lands upon his own dagger, the lantern smashing to the ground and quickly setting the filthy rug ablaze.<br>
<br>
Quickly, Den and Jad look to each other, grab hands, and begin the long run across the couryard. The dogs start barking loudly at the sight of the fire. An alerted dog keeper shouts out the alarm of fire while a kitchen drudge runs into the cell and drags out the burning body of their Laird's heir, rolling him in the snow to put the flames out, rolling him over to find a dagger in his chest. More screams of fire, and an accusing finger points their direction adding screams of &quot;Murder, stop them, murderers!&quot;<br>
<br>
The servant in charge of Jadzya has made it to the courtyard just as Denlough and Jadzya are about to get safely across it and they hear her shout, &quot;It's Denlough and the slave Jadzya! Stop them! Stop the murderers!&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
  And now.....<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 You have read the first four chapters of the barbarian beastlord, Denlough, and the human ranger, Jadzya. <br>
<br>
Know that they escaped, returning Jadzy to her family in Surefall where they honored Denlough as a hero.<br>
<br>
Know that they have become lovers.<br>
<br>
Know that they are still young in their training (he is 5th and she is 6th at this time)<br>
<br>
And know this....Denlough can never go home.<br>
<br>
<br>
They each have their fears and strengths. Jadzya hates gnomes and fears water for reasons shown in the story. <br>
<br>
We seek a guild where this couple can grow together, help other's in their own struggles whether it be finding their lost parents, kidnapped children, lost treasure, or discovering the connection between the gnomish slavers, the dark elves, and the gnolls, who with the other gnolls of Norrath seek to bottle up Halas and control the major trade route between east and west Antonica. <br>
<br>
A war is brewing upon Norrath. We will be a part of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jadzya Keyes<br>
Ranger of Firiona Vie <br>
