I enjoy tradeskills.  In various incarnations I have been a master of Fletching, Smithing, Tailoring, Baking, Pottery, Fishing, and Alchemy.  In general you will lose money on any tradeskill you take beyond a certain point, exceptions being Jewlcraft, and maybe, just maybe tinkering.  Some tradeskills require literally 10's of thousands of  platinum to grand master.  To max alchemy to level limits at 55 (previous life) took about 25,000 platinum, and virtually no chance of ever seeing that money again.  Alchemy past about 70 skill (can make invis undead, sow and shrink) doesn't have many sellable potions. Many useful effects, but in general just to expensive to be practical.  To whit, 300pp or so to make gate potions, 200pp a dose for breeze potions, 20pp damage shields... 40pp heal potions, 100pp regen potions.. the list goes on.  Smithing can be brought up to banded levels for only 200pp or so.  If you are patient you can make money off banded, but to bring your skill to 200 again will cost you many thousands of platinum, and no chance of recouping the expense.   Tailoring is interesting because all the materials are dropped.  So instead of spending money you can loot items to train your skill up. This takes an incredible investment of time.  I am now to 90 skill, I can make handmade packs with some failures and this is where you often make your money in tailoring.  You buy hq bear skins from young characters make packs and sell them to mid and upper level characters who have bursting bank vaults.  In a previous life this worked well, but it takes alot of work.  First you have to find hq skins for sale, then you have to find buyers.  I used to auction while passing through zones and in this way eventually you could  recoup the money you would have made if you hadn't camped spiders and lions for your first 22 lvls or so <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Obviously this is harder on FV.  The market (mid to high players) is smaller, and the marketplace is mostly in one zone (FV boards) where you won't see all that many players.  So, even more than on regular servers, tradeskills are not very cost effective.  Please note I will continue to train them anyway, I enjoy doing them, it adds depth to my character, but also leaves only lint in my pockets!<br>

I used to play casting classes a lot. Have you ever tried getting armor for a casting class? Not a lot of selections, and most are pretty expensive. So, I just ended up hunting spiders and creating my own silk armor. I made armor as I levelled up. Pretty nice detail. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

Isnt there supposed to be a paragraph break here somewhere? Im asking because i dont know eheh.<br>

Ok now down to the rant.  I agree Lorec.  Trade skills are tough but doable.  The one thing that I think hurts them the most is that there is an imense amount of lootable gear out there now.  People &quot;need&quot; made stuff less.  BUT....there are many new player made items out there that relate to gear and to quests so it is important that people learn to do these things...especially as Im not eheheh.  I am lucky that my slave is a master smith and the wife is a master tailor and both have other skills that alow us to complete quests and make items we need.<br>
<br>
There are more and more people playing on FV.  A month ago there were no people in certain zones now there are 10-20 all the time.  Doesnt seem like a lot but in 6 months you wait and see....there will be a full servers worth of people dashing around and we will all be sitting back reminising(sp) about the good ole days when the zones were empty.<br>
<br>
AND if you can make 10 slot backpacks or sewing kits I think everyone can use those to fill their stuffed banks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Except for jewelry, very little from any tradeskill is used at the upper levels.  With the addition of acrylia-reinforced, you might see some monks and druids using odds and ends of that higher up, but even that would be replaced as soon as you start doing the Vellious quests.<br>
<br>
For a tradeskill to be viable, it needs to be useful at the level you can afford to raise skill to use the items.  Time and cost of raising skill for tailoring, for instance, makes even Wu's not worth the effort for a monk.  You'll have better dropped armor in your low 20's -- long before you can likely make Wu's.  Smithing does better due to cheaper skill cost, but even that is only useful for a few levels before you can get bronze.<br>
<br>
If Verant wants to make them viable, the results need to be more usefull or it needs to be easier to raise skill.  IMHO, better results is the only fair method -- easier skill-ups would completely invalidate a ton of hard work by a lot of people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 289<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/4/02 7:21:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=321.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tradeskills...

The pieces needed should just be sort of difficult to get.  That makes much more sense to me.  Make it so that if it takes a level 50 to get it, it should be appropriate for a level 50 to wear.  <br>

However, tradeskills are obviously way harder on FV, because one character per account. So, as with all things, the market will saturate for crafted goods as much as eight times faster than on other servers. Nevertheless, I am 250 jeweler and have reached 200 in baking, brewing, smithing, tailoring, and pottery. I didn't do it for the market, or to make money, just did it to have done it. I use the skills to benefit myself and my guild and my friends. What can I say, sometimes I go into tradeskill frenzies, and just have a blast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But, damn, tailoring takes so much time.  It really does.  I'm stuck in Cured Silk right now, and my skill's not going up very fast at all.<br>
<br>
Make Heady Kiolas for field, buy Mask Patterns, head out into East Karana, kill Crag Spider, sew Silk Swatch, sew Cured Silk Mask, rinse, repeat.<br>
<br>
Good thing the experience is good.  (In fact, the experience is great.)<br>
<br>
As for the market, I've made some good cash here and there on lower-end tailored items, but it's intermittant.  On weekends, I get flurries of orders for various items and can make enough cash to keep me going for a little while longer.  Of course, tailoring is almost pure profit, if you can make a sale.  Patterns cost very little, and the rest of the materials cost next-to-nothing if you get them yourself.<br>

I actually haven't seen that bear itself out.

I found that out the other day: spent an hour in Unrest in a group, without much downtime between blue /con creatures, and moved my experience bar up just slightly, then spent an hour in East Karanas, with a lot of downtime between blue /con spiders, and moved it one yellow bubble.  In fact, I've made two levels off primarily Crag Spiders.  So, I'm killing two birds with one stone, and in the long term, it'll pay off when I go to make Reinforced or Imbued Mithril Studded.<br>

<br>
Besides, it's already paid off in the Studded I'm currently wearing.  Mostly, I tailor for myself.<br>

That changes a bit higher up once people stop being afraid to hunt inside dungeons.  There are lots of lower level dungeons that are typically completely empty and give great xp and cash; much better than EK.<br>
<br>
Unrest is often the first real grouping effort for many people; ie. it's like grand central station for trains.  If you can get inside the basement or in one of the upper floors, you can usually do quite well.  One group can easily clear the entire basement or entire 2nd/3rd floor.  If you have more than one group in those areas, the spawn rate isn't enough to support it.  I've seen that happen lots of times in the more popular areas.  Runneye on FV is so crowded these days it's not even worth going there.  The dungeon can only really support 2-3 groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ublakkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/6/02 11:43:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=321.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   considering all this....</span><hr size=1> I am considering lowering prices on Handmade packs.  I have sold a grand total of 1 at 100pp.  Unfortunately, to buy pelts you still need to pay 20pp per, so with failures I can't see going below 50pp to more or less break even, 75pp or so to make a moderate profit.  But with other cheap containers available for banking, and HQ rockhopper hides useable to make these packs.... I just don't think the market can long bear prices of 100pp per.  And I also think 20pp for HQ bear/rock hopper hides can't last either.  If pack prices go down, they naturally have to follow.  On my last server these skins went for 8-10pp and packs sold for 60-75, and this was before the luclin and velious expansion.  I had already stopped selling them when Velious came out so not sure the impact that expansion had on the prices for packs.<br>
<br>
I really hate to do this.  Other tailors will be pissed, Joam seems to be able to sell his for 100pp, or at least he is auctioning them at that rate.  I have seen this happen with alchemy potions, and armor, cured silk is very hard to sell, with wu's available (another chanter trade boost), banded can barely ber sold for more than cost.  One person sells for less and eventually most have to follow suit.  It can be annoying, since the expense of learning trade skills will show less return in the long run as a result.<br>
<br>
I am open to debate.. And probably flames as well....<br>

Can we say, extramly hard to raise your skill in tailoring.  Sure tailoring dosn't take as much money as other skills but man they made it a pain to raise. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/7/02 2:33:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=321.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: considering all this....</span><hr size=1> For what it's worth, tailored backpacks sell for 75-100 pp on Mithaniel Marr.

Neither of those was an option a year ago -- back then the only way to get 10 slots was a tinkerer's or a tailored (or a couple dragon-drop boxes).  With the addition of 1p 10 slot packs, the only use I can see for 10 slot tailored are for high STR classes that don't care about weight (as inventory expanders); eg. if I had an ogre warrior, I might buy a few.  Before these new packs, I'd normally stuff all my bank slots with tailored. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=321.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=321.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=321.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=321.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=321.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=321.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
