<br>
the response was &quot;weve been here for 6 hours&quot;<br>
<br>
my response &quot;ok well im gonna pull the unclaimed mobs below you&quot;<br>
<br>
and i will every single time.<br>
<br>
im friends with lysanthes and nothsa, and im sorry you guys didnt hear the full story about what happened. I will give you a tell next time to try to work something out rather than that ass of a guildmate you call coriolis. Im sure we could have reasonably worked it out if i had not given him the tell first.<br>
<br>
I gave my spot up in the group so that nothsa could have a group after the incident.<br>
<br>
that is all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uqixxfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QixxFV</A> at: 4/8/02 3:37:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uguanofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GuanoFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guano the GnOgre</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/02 5:47:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> TRAIN? thats wasnt a train that was my pull, so it was 6 mobs...<br>

Nothing like a group with a pair of pullers like that to keep the ol exp bar heading in the right direction. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry if the pulling caused any grief, I know it was not intentional, we were just trying to speed up the exp flow a little with a few extra mobs.<br>

<br>
I dont know what happened in Velks, but I hope you guys get it worked out. One thing I do know though is that the more animosity and tension that builds up between folks the more likely they will do stupid things. Once people get it in their heads that another group is &quot;the enemy&quot;, &quot;the bad guys&quot; or &quot;dishonorable&quot; the more likely they will treat that group as such.<br>
<br>
Self full filling prophecy and all that sort of stuff.<br>
<br>
Our guilds rarely interact now. We seem to be staying out of each others way and generally just don't bother each other except on these boards. Thats going to change as both guilds start migrating towards the same encounters (until PoP is released anyway). HoT is gonna be ugly if we can't learn to play in the same zone with each other so instead of folks stirring up stuff and causing tension between the guilds on these boards I would like to suggest this...<br>
<br>
If someone in your guild has an issue with someone in my guild they discuss it with your leadership and if the leadership feels its necessary they send bako an e-mail and vice versa for coinfist. These boards are really not the place to work out disagreements because the discussions quickly degenerate into ugly name calling and finger pointing. That turns into tension and hard feelings in the game and then people start acting on those feelings and go and do stupid stuff.<br>
<br>
As for someone going to legends and coming back I have this to say. How in the world are you coming to the conclusion that this action is dishonourable? Seems to me that if someone was willing to go through all that trouble, jump through all the hoops and rules verant put out (and they did go through the rules) then thats their choice. You may not approve of their actions but just because YOU disapprove doesn't make it &quot;dishonourable&quot;. Especially since they did nothing illegal and broke no rules. <br>
<br>
If your arguement is that they are upsetting the balance and sanctity of this server well I got a newsflash for ya. The balance and sanctity of this server went out the window the second folks discovered and started using the alignment bug. The balance and sanctity of this server was flushed down the toilet when we saw level 10 folks with planar gear.<br>
<br>
If you ask me those two issues will do more damage to this server than a few folks bringing over items from legends.<br>

Why not try working together... Sounds CRAZY? well i have grouped with ALOT of reso and neary Every FF you both have  many skilled players. Why not try grouping  with  each other more often, helping with epics, doing some raids together. With the odd times we all play,  you know how easy it would be to get epics done working together. Doing some coop would be good for us all i think, And possible help ease some of the tention...

It keeps everyone on their toes.<br>
<br>
Finger pointing and name calling on these boards can lead to hard feelings which turn into actions in game that only escalate the tensions. For example, I am sure that the situation with Qixx would have been handled much differently if Qixx and Cori thought highly of each other. I am betting that since they might not see ach other in the best of lights that they both wound up treating each other differntly. Wether they knew they were or not just because its human nature.<br>
<br>
As for working with each other... I am not oppossed to it. In fact we were with a reso group on (friday?) and got asked to join reso in a raid through Akheva. Unfortunately I had to log soon so I passed, but its gestures like that that make me think there is stilla chance for us to play on this server togethor and not be constantly at each others throats.<br>
<br>
The thing is, I think both guilds see each other as competition (which is fine) so I don't know if folks will want to make a habit of &quot;joint raids&quot; etc. On the other hand I do know that reso and FF folks do alot of pick up groups with each other all the time. I also have suchi, pizza and beer (not at the same time) with some folks from reso everynow and then too. =)<br>

I said I wouldn't help with reso epics. Look, we have our own raids to do, our own members to help with improvement. FaF didn't invite me to their guild and help me get nice equipment so I could go twink complete strangers in other guilds.<br>
<br>
After that, coinfist, the guildleader of reso, wouldn't group with me and talked smack about me to other reso members. He would barely talk to me. I honestly can't remember much that coin did for me besides being in my exp groups, but I can remember going an extra mile for him plenty of times. Hell, I sent Samm his direction because I knew the two of them were similar level while I was 10 levels higher already. I said go talk to coin , he's in paw. His common sucks, but he's a good guy. I would dare say alot of people met each other that way through me...<br>
<br>
anyway, my point is, I've done alot for people, I don't care what you come here and lie and say. IF you can't tell a friend, &quot;no&quot;, and they won't be your friend after, there is a serious problem. The issue mushroomed. <br>
<br>
Now, I'm disgusted. I'm disgusted with coinfist the most and some random and asundry reso members next. This is how these people are, and there is not going to be any changing them. They will grow up to be level 60's just like this.<br>
<br>
man, I'll tell you. God forbid, in the future faf is no more, I wouldn't join reso. If reso is dying of thirst in the desert, they can have the sweat off my rigomortous buttocks post mortem.  I'd rather give up EQ all together than support coinfist.<br>
<br>
That's my opinion, and that's the reason. Take it to the bank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umezzmorizerr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mezzmorizerr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/02 7:54:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> Just like to get something off my chest,<br>

I'm not that mad considering i have no jewelcrafting skill and i have fixed things with those peeps u have told i steal their customers from.  What makes me somewhat frustrated with is you refuse to talk to me about this &quot;problem&quot;.  Also about me not paying you 500platnum and a BD for the 5th shawl combo, sorry I did not think that was a good deal so i took my buisness elsewhere...everyone is not going to pay what you demand.
