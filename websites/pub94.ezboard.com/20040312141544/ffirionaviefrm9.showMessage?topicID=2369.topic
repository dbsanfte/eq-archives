********************************<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Childhood Dreams and Daring Deeds<br>
<br>
Half Elves have never been the most trusted folks in the land of Wyrdrake.  Since they are the children of both Elves and Men, they belong neither to one race nor the other, though, technically, they are a hybrid of both. I’m a Half Elf myself, the conflicted daughter of a Human father and an Elven mother, a wandering singer who traveled the world. Both of my parents were very well-respected in their own communities, yet the news of their betrothal displeased both their families. I can imagine my kinfolk saying: <br>
<br>
“You’re marrying a what? An Elf? Rhadmir, you’re out of your mind! Who is she?” <br>
<br>
“Annushka—you know that we Elves have to keep our lines pure! It’s our heritage!” <br>
<br>
“Now, I do understand you want to get married, old friend—but, Rhadmir, an Elf?!” <br>
<br>
“I’ve always loved you, Annushka, but this decision of yours may lead us to ruin!”   <br>
<br>
Racial prejudice has always been stronger on my mother’s side than my father’s, I think. Humans are pretty much tolerant of anyone, as long as they don’t cause trouble. Elves, on the other hand, can be picky when they’re approving partners for their children. They have to be Elves, first off, and secondly, they have to have such pure hearts that they’d never even think of treating their spouse badly. Once upon a time, Elves used to be totally pure, incorruptible and chivalrous to a fault, but now, through the influence of Men and all the other races in Wyrdrake, they’ve started to know the great lure of evil.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for the Elves—how some of them have abandoned their hearts to greed, hate and corruption—but then I can’t help thinking that’s not the way all the Elves are. Most of them are still good, although now they have to fight the same battles that Humans do—the eternal battles between good and evil, virtue and vice, in their hearts and souls.<br>
<br>
I don’t know how pure my heart is. I’ve tried to find out, but so far the local priests have always acted like they’re hiding something from me. Maybe I’m just naïve, or maybe they think I’m an ignorant little girl who can’t tell the difference between true faith and wishful thinking. I don’t know what to make of this. Somehow I hope that the Maker of this universe will have mercy on me, if he or she does exist. I myself think so.<br>
<br>
Is this faith? I don’t know. Such questions are best left up to the priests, I guess. <br>
<br>
Oh, my goodness! I’ve completely forgotten to introduce myself, what with all my rattling on! My name is Ytra, daughter of Annushka, the Elven bard, and Rhadmir, the dashing, valiant Human warrior who stole her heart. I know my name looks weird, but it’s pronounced “EE-truh,” or sometimes “IH-truh.” In Half-Elven slang, a hard-edged and rough combination of the Human and Elven tongues, my name means “perfect companion.” This makes me laugh. I certainly wasn’t a perfect companion when I was born! My mother and grandmother have told me many tales of how I howled and screamed. Mama said I was like one of the wild beasts, a little lioness cub, while Grandmama said that I simply had to grow into my lungs! I was very small for a baby.<br>
<br>
In fact, I was too small. My siblings and I were to be born in the wintertime, around all the Yuletide festivities that our village had. Our poor, dear, excited parents, Annushka and Rhadmir, were expecting the best holiday gifts they would ever get! Unfortunately, we came three months before Yuletide did, when summer was giving its last warm and hearty kiss to the lands of Wyrdrake. I was tiny and frail, weighing only three pounds at birth. No one thought I would live long. The Maker must have smiled upon me, though, for now I’m a lass of thirteen, waiting for life to begin, yet very impatient for it to start!<br>
<br>
I spent my childhood playing in the fields outside of our stone-walled town. Countless adventurers wandered in and out of our gates, looking for food and sleep at the inns or a drink at the local tavern. I wanted so much to be like these adventurers, clothed in various armors of metal and leather and chain, who strode confidently and boldly into circumstances unknown. I wished that someday I would be like them, and be one of them, but back then I was content to be simply a young girl, playing tag with my brothers and sisters on the grassy hills of the land that our sovereign owned. I was a happy child.<br>
<br>
I suspect one of the reasons I was so happy was because I knew my future was secure. Once a child reached the age of thirteen in our town, all the priests and the knights who served them would reveal the child’s destiny. No one was allowed to choose their own occupation or path, for the priests knew best, and, after all, the world was controlled by the Maker and his devout servants. I had little doubt that the priests would choose me to be an Adventurer, one of the highest classes or occupations that a child could ever get. <br>
<br>
My heart yearned for exploration and new knowledge. Did the priests know that?<br>
<br>
Our town was built upon six strong foundational classes: Warriors to protect us, Peasants to farm and work the land, skilled Artisans to build our homes and tools, Priests to heal us and guide us in spiritual matters, Adventurers to explore and conquer the wild, and, last and certainly least, Servants to help the other classes with their menial tasks. <br>
<br>
I thought the life of an Artisan wouldn’t be bad if I couldn’t be an Adventurer. Anything but a Servant. Servanthood was a position without honor, without glory, without respect. Only the priests gave the servants any special recognition, for they said that the lowest of all would someday become kings. I didn’t believe it. Many Servants in our town, I thought, with their kind and humble attitudes, would be wonderful kings, but in reality our leaders always came from the Warrior class. No Servant stood a chance when it came to gaining the throne. A Priest once tried to become king, but then a proud Warrior, challenging him to a duel, won the fight. The Priest left our town to wander the world, seeking spiritual guidance through self-denial and meditation. I admired him. <br>
<br>
My brothers and sisters were as varied as the colors of the rainbow. Jonathan, my oldest brother, resented his Elven heritage and wished he were only a Man. Strength was not one of the key attributes of the Elves, and Jonny was afraid that the priests were going to make him a Peasant instead of a Warrior. Nothing detested him more than the smell of manure in newly-plowed fields, or the wielding of a hoe and rake. He wanted to be a Warrior, young Jonny did, and I certainly hoped he would achieve his dream since birth.<br>
<br>
“If I were a Man,” he said, “instead of Half Elf, the Warriors wouldn’t call me weak!”<br>
<br>
I told Jonathan that he was never weak, no matter how strong he was, but Jon rarely listened. What would the opinions of his sister matter when he stood before the Priests?<br>
<br>
My sister Yelina, however, was very proud she had Elf blood. Not one for strenuous physical activity or the agricultural life of a peasant girl, Yelina strove for the Priesthood. Not that she’d be a bad Priest—her wisdom and loving advice were often sought by our family—but I felt her talents as a woodcarver and seamstress would be wasted. She could make dresses like no princess had ever seen, and as for her carving skills—my! Wood seemed to melt at her touch like butter upon hot, fresh bread. What nobleman wouldn’t give his right arm to have her elegant statues in his dining room or great hall? An Artisan was the path for her, and even though Yelina thought it lowly, she was a great one.<br>
<br>
Ornith—now he was a tough lad. Warriors had to have discipline. Ornith had none.     <br>
<br>
He was the practical joker of our family. Once, or in fact, many times, he would balance a full bucket of water on the top of our doorframe, waiting for Father or some other patsy to open the door and get soaked. He was also the king of snakes, frogs, and mice, grabbing them and putting them on our chairs or beds. He’d make a fine rat-catcher, one of many possible Servants’ duties, but I knew his fierce pride wouldn’t let him do it. Servanthood was not for him, Ornith sneered, and if the Priests made him one, he’d run away from our town and live in exile. Good gracious, I hoped not! Ornith was my closest brother! What would I do without his jokes, wit, and honest views of life?<br>
<br>
Aiya—now she was the sister I worried about. Her frailty and anxiety did not lend itself well to the six classes our town had. If anyone would be a Priest in our house, it would probably be Aiya. She had a spiritual awareness that even the knights who served the priests marveled at. Yelina was jealous of her. In fact, she was so fiercely jealous that she threatened to reveal what happened to Aiya to our town’s Warriors. No one could join the Priesthood if they weren’t pure, and Aiya, on a dare from her foolish friends, had stolen gold from one of our town’s richer merchants. If she were found out, Aiya would spend five years in prison, and there would be no chance of my sister being a Priest.<br>
<br>
And then there was me, Ytra, Adventurer-to-be. Five children, quintuplets, we were. <br>
<br>
Destiny was in our blood, although what destiny, none of us could ever figure out!  <br>

I see Ytra as a Ranger.  She seeks to explore, and to refrain from being a servant.  Rangers tend to serve theirselves and nature.  <br>
<br>
2. What's your first impression of Ytra and her kin?<br>
Very colorful family<br>
<br>
3. Should Ytra be the gold thief, or her sister Aiya?<br>
I like the idea of Aiya being a gold thief.  It adds suspense.<br>
<br>

I'd like to hear about this Priest declaration and the reactions involved.<br>
<br>

What you think?</span><hr size=1> 1. What class should Ytra get when she sees the Priests and why?<br>
Hmm, I'm torn here. One one hand, I really like Ytra and would like to see her get the appointing she wanted - the adventurer class - but on the other hand, giving her something she hates will provide some interesting places for the story to go too. Conflict always makes an interesting story<br>
<br>
2. What's your first impression of Ytra and her kin?<br>
Sounds like a busy family.  I like the introductions you've given for her siblings, but I'd like to know more about their individual personalities.<br>
<br>
3. Should Ytra be the gold thief, or her sister Aiya?<br>
Hmm, either one really. Aiya doesn't really strike me as the troublemaking sort yet, but I don't know how you view her in your head. But she doesn't come across as the type of girl to accept foolish dares like that.<br>
<br>
4. What would you like to see Ytra do next?<br>
I'd like to find out the priests' decision on her class, but I also like the suspense of not knowing how it's going to turn out. Maybe she could have a little mini-adventure or something that will reveal more of her character and bond the reader to her even further. I really like her so far.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. What members of Ytra's family interest you most?<br>
I like Ytra herself. She seems strong-willed and independent, and I can relate to that. I also like Aiya, although when you first described her as spiritual I was thinking spiritual in the witchy/gypsy sense rather than the churchy kind. I think all your characters are good, and with a little more developing of their personalities I think it'll be a great story.<br>
<br>

<br>
**********************************<br>
<br>
Speaking of destiny, the 25th day of Novena, the month we were born, would soon arrive. None of us knew what occupation or class the Priests would choose for us, but we all knew we were nervous. None of us could escape that heavy feeling in our stomachs that meant sometimes things didn’t work out the way we planned. Some of us might not become Priests, or Adventurers, or the class that we wanted. What would happen then? <br>
<br>
I suppose we could all refuse our classes and become exiles, but what good would that do? Annushka and Rhadmir, our parents, would be heartbroken. So would Sasha, Sidney, and Stump, the cats that lived in our cottage to catch mice. (Ornith caught a lot of mice, too, of course, but he preferred to let them live and put the mice on our chairs than kill them!) So, if we couldn’t choose a different class if we didn’t get the one we wanted, and we couldn’t become exiles, then what could we do? Such a situation scared all us children. <br>
<br>
“Aiya?” asked Ornith as we lay in the fields chewing tall grass. “What will you do?”    <br>
<br>
“You mean about the gold thing?” she answered. “I don’t know. A part of me wants to confess, serve my time, and get it all over with, but the other parts want to keep it a secret so I can become a Priest. I’m beyond that stage of stealing and foolish dare-taking, and if I knew back then that what I did when I was eight would impact me when I was thirteen, I never would have done it. Such things are unbecoming to me, and stealing is no longer a part of my nature. I’ve never taken anything since then, so I don’t want to mention it.” She flopped on her stomach and asked me, worriedly, “Ytra, can the Priests read minds?” <br>
<br>
“I don’t think they can.” My gut instincts told me I was right, but I wasn’t quite sure. <br>
<br>
“Are you sure? If the Priests can read minds, and they see my guilt, then I’m ruined!” <br>
<br>
“I don’t know if the Priests can read minds or not,” I explained, trying to tell my sister that I was no clairvoyant myself. “However, if they can, then I’d say confess to stealing.” <br>
<br>
“I’d go to prison! I can’t confess! Ytra, do you realize how much that would hurt Mother and Father? I want to tell someone everything—I really do—but only if I was assured that person would take into consideration that I only stole the gold on a wretched dare! It wasn’t my intention to spend the gold on candy or hoard it—it was only my plan to prove to my friends that I was brave enough, and keen enough, to get away with it!”<br>
<br>
“And you were,” praised Ornith with a smirk. “If I were you, I’d have stolen more!”<br>
<br>
“Shut your big mouth, stupid brother!” Yelina snapped. “Our sister is in danger here!” <br>
<br>
“If I was in any danger,” sniffed Aiya, hating the damsel-in-distress role, “I would have fled long ago. Ornith, you, sir, have no brain. As for stealing more gold—hmph!”<br>
<br>
Yelina suddenly saw an opportunity to turn the situation to her advantage. She smiled. <br>
<br>
“Aiya,” she began, her voice purring like Stump’s when he wanted some attention, “you know how much I wish to become a Priest. I’m awfully jealous of you because of your faith and your wisdom, for I think the Priests will pass me over and make me an Artisan. That’s a lowly occupation, at least in my opinion—second only to the Servants, who can never rise to anything better. I want to be a Priest, and I think it would be advantageous to admit to a sister’s crime. Such an action would prove to the Priests that I’m honest, want only the best for the kingdom, and will help in enforcing our laws.”<br>
<br>
Jonathan, our oldest brother, turned to Yelina and snorted. “With a self-righteous and hypocritical attitude like that, Yelina,” he told her, “you’ll never be a Priest! They’ll all see that you only revealed how Aiya stole the gold in order to make yourself look good!”   <br>
<br>
Yelina made a low, growling sound in her throat. “I may be that way,” she replied, “selfish and wanting my own advantage, but I’m in danger of becoming an Artisan here! Many of the townspeople have seen my works, including a few Priests, and if they’ve decided that that’s to be my lot in life, I’ll just die! Artisans are Artisans, no two ways about that, so the only way to earn some recognition around here is to become a Priest!”<br>
<br>
“Is that why you want to enter the clergy?” Ornith asked, sounding concerned instead of critical, which endeared me to him. “To get recognition and honor? Priests must be wiser than that if they’re to guide others in spiritual things! One must be humble and kind, like our Aiya, and strong and courageous, like Jonny and me. Dear Yelina, the Priesthood is the most demanding occupation of all our classes. Even Warriors don’t have a life that hard! I’d hate for you to become a Priest, only to find out the tears and the pain of the people are too much for you to bear. You give the best advice we’ve ever heard, Yelina, to the five of us, but lately your attitude seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Is it a desire to please our parents, or something else, that makes your mind so cunning?” <br>
<br>
Yelina lay there in silence, in shock. She’d been stung to the quick. The words that her brother had spoken made her—and me—see that Ornith had a side of him that we’d almost never seen before. He was wise and discerning, and here we girls had thought that this mischief-maker only wanted to play games! He wasn’t wise in our minds, nor was  he able to see what made people tick very well. Goofy Ornith, said Yelina and Aiya and I, was only built for mischief and for jokes, and not for perceptiveness like Priests had. <br>
<br>
Aiya rolled over on her side to face her brother. “Ornith—I’ve never seen you do that before. I wonder how you did it, looking at Yelina and guessing what was in her heart!” <br>
<br>
As Yelina glared even more darkly at Ornith with her dark eyes, she stood up and told us, “That’s all Ornith is doing—guessing. He only sees that I’m jealous of you, Aiya, and that’s what makes him judge me. If he’d look more closely within himself than at me, he’d see some flaws of his own that need to be corrected. Aiya—I’m not only interested in the Priesthood for honor and recognition. I want to be able to help people, because sometimes the Priests and the knights give very simplistic advice, like ‘Never kill’ and ‘Work hard’ and ‘Make sure you’re pure before you wed.’ Everybody knows that, at least if they think about it. I want to be a Priest so I can know human nature, both the good and bad sides of it, in full, and advise people according to their true natures, not pat answers.”<br>
<br>
Ornith looked at his sister again, and he saw that the cutthroat gleam in her eyes had disappeared. She was telling the truth, and he thought he could be sure of that, because of her sincere tone of voice. Yelina could be a bit selfish at times, but this time Ornith saw she only wanted to use her talents in the best way possible, not waste them carving tools. Artisans rarely had a say in the life of the people, for they were the town’s doers, and not the thinkers. The Priests did our thinking, along with specially-chosen Warrior leaders.<br>
<br>
“Aiya, I’m sorry,” Yelina said. “I don’t really want to be so jealous. It eats me up inside, and I wish this envy would just go away. However, it seems like every time the Priests look at you, their eyes are filled with admiration and respect, while when they look at me, they see only a good Artisan who makes beautiful statues and dresses. They’re friendly to me, as Priests should be, but it seems you have more potential than I.” <br>
<br>
“Don’t say that, Yelina,” said Aiya with gentle humility. “We could both be Priests.”<br>
<br>
“In a blue moon!” said Ornith, remembering our town’s history with his usual wit. “There has rarely been a family where two children have the same occupation. Class is a very individual thing, even though there are a great many townsfolk in each class. The Priests like to spread everything out. As much as our Maker allows, the clergy like to have a separate occupation for each child in a family. There once was a set of twins, I think, named Phoebus and Phoebe, who were both picked to be Peasants. That’s quite unusual, though, because if the Priests started giving every kid in a clan the same class, then there wouldn’t be any variety in this town. You know what I mean?” We all nodded. <br>
<br>
“So, my hope is that Yelina and I will be Priests, Ytra will become an Adventurer, Jonathan will take his place at our father’s side as a Warrior, and Ornith, um, what do you want to be?” Aiya didn’t know Ornith as well as I did, so she couldn’t guess his dreams.<br>
<br>
“I want to be an Adventurer, just like Ytra,” smiled my mischievous brother. “I want to go out and see the whole world, sailing ships and fighting dragons, solving quests and rescuing fair maids. An Adventurer’s life is a good one, and it’s never boring, either. Only when you lay down to rest is your life peaceful, and you’re too asleep to care!” <br>
<br>
“Seriously, though, Ornith,” said Jonathan gravely, looking at his brother with the stare that my mother used when giving us a big lecture, “Adventurers have serious duties. They have to claim for our town all the lands they’ve discovered, and when they get old, Adventurers usually settle down and live rather uneventful lives like the rest of us do. They’ll purchase houses, have children, and when they finally die, each one of them will be burned on a magnificent funeral pyre! Adventurers are like Warriors. Each one is only good for so long, and when the ravages of time start to turn their hair gray and their muscles and joints don’t have the strength that they used to, all Adventurers come home.”<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t mind that,” said Ornith, kicking a ball of dirty twine from one of his heels to the other. “I want a wife of my own someday, and children. Only—does it have to be so—I don’t know—dull and conventional? Sounds like aging Adventurers want to live it up until the time they begin pushing up daisies. Adventuring’s the life for me, even when I’m forty-three!” All of us laughed, including Jonny, for that was quite old in our town. <br>
<br>
“Something’s for sure, though,” said Aiya, all of a sudden not smiling at all. “If the Priests find out that I stole that gold, or if somebody tells them—!” I thought Aiya would glare at Yelina with an accusatory, warning look, but it turned out that her large, liquid eyes were far more full of fear than of anger at her sister’s jealousy. They were concerned about something else, and soon she told us all what that was. “If they find out, some of the Priests might tell the Warriors, and then I’d go to prison for five years! If that happens, then I won’t be anything, and when my term is up, I’ll be lucky if someone takes me on as a Servant!” Aiya was terrified of that happening, and I wanted to help her. <br>
<br>
“Something in our law code says,” I told Aiya, “that if you confess any crimes you’ve committed before the Vigésima’quinta—the 25th day of this month, and our Destiny Day, when we officially turn thirteen—then you have a chance to give back the gold that you stole. You won’t have to go to prison for it. You’ll be considered a juvenile, and no one sends any juveniles to prison in this town.” Aiya nodded. “At least that’s what I think.”<br>
<br>
“What if that’s not true?” asked Jonathan. “Ytra, are you sure about this provision?” <br>
<br>
“No.” I could see Aiya’s expression turn even more fearful, and I felt guilty and sad. <br>
<br>
“If it’s not, and there is no provision for juvenile crimes, then I’d say keep your mouth shut. You’re sorry for what you did, that’s for sure, and to my knowledge, you’ve never stolen anything after that, so why should the Priests go after you for something you did when you were only eight? That’s unfair, in my opinion, and if I were a Warrior, I’d convince all my comrades to change that law. There are things you do before you turn thirteen, and things you do afterward. Before your Destiny Day, you are only a child, and childish dares should be forgotten if the person involved truly regrets she took the dare.”<br>
<br>
“I see your point, Jonathan,” said Aiya, trembling, “and your words are wise. However, I still don’t know what to do. What about Mother and Father? They’d be so ashamed of me if I told them that they’d never look me in the eye!” Tears began falling down Aiya’s cheeks. “They’d look at me as a thief, a common criminal, and I’d never earn their trust again!” She sniffled, wiping her nose with her hand. “Servanthood’s the best lot for me, if, that is, I never go to prison!” Seeking comfort, she ran into my arms. <br>
<br>
As I held my dearest sister close, hugging her tight, I said, “When one of us has been in any trouble, or had some thinking to do, what have we five children always done, eh?”  <br>
<br>
Ornith grinned. “We’ve gone on an Explore—uh—I mean an adventure!” he cried. <br>
<br>
“Explore” was the word we’d always used for “adventure” back when we were little tykes and couldn’t say “adventure”. Each one of our “explores” would take us far into places unknown—mostly the Woods of Wonder and sometimes the Woods of War. Jonathan would want to practice his fighting skills in this second forest, and we others would watch him battle hostile creatures like boars, large and poisonous snakes, wolves and bears, and the occasional goblin. Everything in the Woods of Wonder, however, was peaceful, and the wild animals there would come up to us, curious, or at least ignore us. This was the perfect woods in which to do some thinking, and we all had a lot of that to do before our Destiny Day! After we all put our hands together and agreed to go on this “explore”, our last before the Vigésima’quinta, we went to ask Mother for permission. <br>
<br>
“So, you all want to go on an adventure before your Destiny Day?” Mother asked. “Oh, how glorious! Your father did the same thing when he was your age, he says, and it was there, in the Woods of Wonder, that he finally decided he would become a Warrior. The Woods of War were his favorite place, of course, his favorite hunting grounds, but this time he didn’t want any shrieking goblins or charging boars interrupting his thoughts. It is my opinion that this time of deep reflection before his Destiny Day allowed your father to gain the courage that he needed to stand before the Priests with confidence.”<br>
<br>
“Did the Priests see his soul,” asked Johnathan softly, “and know what to make him?”<br>
<br>
“The Priests always know!” said Annushka, our dear mother. “They knew him well.”<br>
<br>
“How will the Priests know us so well?” asked Yelina. “They’ve barely seen us five children, since we’ve spent most of our time frolicking in the fields outside of town.”<br>
<br>
Aiya answered that question. “The Priests are the servants of the Maker,” she said in a humble tone, “and that means they know how each stage of spiritual life should progress. They know when to call us to prayer; they know when to give counsel; they know when our days begin and end; and, most of all, they know what kind of path each one of us should follow. It is their gift from the Maker, and we should never doubt their wisdom.” <br>
<br>
Yelina scowled. “I could have figured that out,” her scowl said, “and, besides, Aiya is not as pure as either you or Father think she is! She stole some gold from a merchant on a stupid dare when she was eight, and now her foolish actions could ruin her future. You may think she’s so wise, the way she talks about the Maker and everything, but I know her soul and her secret. I could have told both of you long ago, Mother and Father, but I did not want to sound like a tale-teller. Besides, if I had told you, Aiya would probably have called me a liar to defend herself. If there’s one thing I hate, it’s a lie. I may be selfish, seeking my own gain, but at least I admit to this. Aiya, however, won’t confess!” <br>
<br>
I hated Yelina for that look. Right then, I wished for the Priests to make her a Servant.<br>
<br>
I know it’s awful to have such bad thoughts about your own sister, but—uggghhh!  <br>
