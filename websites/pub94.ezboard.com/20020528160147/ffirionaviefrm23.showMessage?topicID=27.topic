A story of Sunhawk.</span><hr size=1> The hustle and bustle of the Lion’s Head Inn quiets for a moment as a man walks through the door. Slipping inside quickly, for he does not like the clear target his silhouette places against the outside sky, the man in green and brown quietly crosses the room toward the common board. Conversation resumes as he begins flipping through the pages of jobs going begging, bounties to be had, and graffiti trash that liberally strews the board’s surface.<br>
<br>
He is a man of medium build, slim and sure, though much of that can be laid to his telltale heritage. It doesn’t take a genius to see the half-elf, especially as this man makes no effort to disguise his blood; two pointed ears are a dead giveaway to any interested observer. Any comments that this heritage might provoke in the onlookers of this most human of cities, however, are silenced by a vision of the man’s sword, worn with use and hanging easily in its scabbard. Also of note, and instantly marked by even the most obtuse, is the great bow strung across the man’s back. It has a look of loving craftsmanship not often seen in human stores.<br>
<br>
“Ranger of Tunare, and no mistake”, mutters one grizzled man into his ale. His companion at table, sitting across from him, nods in agreement, but wisely makes no answer. Those of elven blood, and Rangers of the Glade particularly, are well known for their almost supernatural hearing.<br>
<br>
The man in green and brown picks one scrap of parchment out of the mass and, inspecting it, turns for the door. Suddenly he pauses, nose crinkling in disgust. He turns to look at the grizzled man’s companion and those watching can see as his face slowly changes from disbelief, to comprehension, and slowly, to resignation.<br>
<br>
His target’s face is changing too, but this change is from shock to terror, with a narrowing of the eyes suddenly, and a mad dash for the door. The man in green and brown slips to one knee, his bow already in his hand, as his target lunges toward the door. No tavern patron witnessing these events will ever be able to say exactly when the Ranger unlimbered his weapon. All they will remember is the waiting stare, the gleam of the hunter’s eye, and the way in which Time itself seemed to wait in hushed anticipation.<br>
<br>
The Ranger waits patiently, as if stalking forest game, and, as he knew it would, his moment comes. His target flings open the door and, for just an instant, is clearly outlined against the rising sun.<br>
<br>
An instant is all that is required.<br>
<br>
The arrow takes him at the base of the skull, and explodes out through his eye in a gout of feathers and blood before rising over the city wall, and gracefully arcing into the harbor beyond. The dead man rises on his tiptoes for a moment, hands reaching forward as if to embrace the sun, and then, with a sound like a collapsing bellows, crumples to the threshold. The Ranger lowers his drawing hand in a motion silent and beautiful. A traveling bard, enthralled from his stage in the corner, understands the entire nature of poetry in a flash of intuition.<br>
<br>
A woman screams in terror. The grizzled man feels his bladder tighten, and then let go in relief as the Ranger evaluates and dismisses him. As if the sudden dripping wetness is a signal, time once again begins to flow. Settling his bow across his back, the man in brown and green walks calmly forward toward a mass of charging guards.<br>
<br>
<br>
“You there! What is the meaning of this?” challenges one young man, leveling his sword at my chest. Poor posture. No recognition in his eyes. Must be a new recruit. I spare a brief prayer for the foolishness of youth, and think of all the ways I could make this poor idiot eat his sword, but with a glance at his fellows, content myself with taking the boy’s weapon away from him before he hurts himself with it. Dismissing the boy’s protests and threats I shake my head sadly and kick the dead man onto his back. The guards have all arrived now, gathered in a circle about me, and I see their faces change as they are drawn to the sight of my prey. The stupid one has shut up. Finally.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is never a pretty sight, seeing the handiwork of my arrows upon human flesh. Skin is so fragile, so malleable, totally unlike the thick hides of my animal brothers. The wonder is, really, that any of us survive until adulthood. And they call us the “dominate” races. Right.<br>
<br>
Bending down, and ignoring the ravaged face so close to mine, I pull the dead man’s cloak back with the tip of the recruit’s cheap sword, and there, hanging from the man’s belt, plain to see, a lump of dead flesh hangs. Even these nose-dead humans should be able to see it for what it is now. It is attracting flies quicker than the body it is attached to.<br>
<br>
“Servant of Bertoxxulous”, breaths one of the older guards. I look up at him, nodding, and see his pale face fighting for control. It is one thing to fight the living, but quite another to fight disease, as any follower of Rodcet will tell you, after a few ales. In the distance my sensitive ears pick up the clear sound of the young guard puking his guts out into the harbor.<br>
<br>
“Aye m’lord Guard”, I say. “All of those rabid animals running the hills lately? Well, here is one of the mysteries explained. We of the Glade knew weeks ago that it could be no mortal agency causing such an outbreak.” With a sigh, I stand, and flip my borrowed sword into the harbor. The gentle action of Prexus will cleanse the tainted steel long ere some fisherman draw it out again.<br>
<br>
“Look ye, m’lord”, I say forcefully, “on this matter I speak with the authority of the entire Glade. Will ye be guided by me in this thing?” Without a word, the man nods. A sharp one, this guard, quite unlike the boy. My actions with the sword have not escaped him, and he has well grasped the possible consequences. He looks very grim.<br>
<br>
“Those others inside, m’lord Ranger? Will we have to….” The guard trails off.<br>
<br>
“No m’lord,”, I reply. “This one alters only animals, but all articles of clothing made of animal flesh that may have come near this man, including those worn by those people in there,” I say, pointing back toward the inn, ”must be gathered and burned.”<br>
<br>
“Take the body,”, I continue, &quot;to Priestess Caulria at the temple of Nife. Use heavy gauntlets and take care with the blood. All those clothes you wear in moving him, likewise burn. Do you have all I have said?”<br>
<br>
The guard nods curtly, and motions to his fellows, who enter the inn behind him. “Aye m’lord Ranger, and what of yeself? Where do you be off to now?”<br>
<br>
Looking down in distaste, I grimace at the odor coming from the already decaying body, and turn to take my leave. “To the Glade I go,” floats back my reply as I walk toward the gates. “Word of this must go out instantly. If such agents ever invade the Faydark it would be the end of an entire people. This isn’t over milord. Not by a long shot….”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Several hours later many partially naked people are hustled from the Lion’s Head Inn under the watchful eyes of several hard faced guards, and an entire battalion of healers from the Temple. Unnoticed in the general confusion rests a small piece of parchment on the floor, very near to where a man in green and brown knelt with his bow and awaited the end of his human hunt.<br>
<br>
After the inn has emptied, and all about is silence, the piece of parchment sparkles and shimmers, and then slowly lifts from the floor, and, without any fuss, reattaches itself to the message board. Thusly it reads:<br>
<br>
“SEEK YE ADVENTURE?”<br>
“Those of true heart, and bold, are invited to present yeself to the War Room of the 1st Fist of Light!”<br>
“No creature of evil intent need apply!”<br>
“BY VIRTUE AND VALOR WE SHINE BUT DO NOT BURN!”<br>
<br>
<br>
--Ends<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope ye enjoy my tale, tis related to a quest I do be pursueing e'en now!<br>
