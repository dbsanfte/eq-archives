Before she is able to fall a human hand extends to her and offers her strength. She knew who the human was before she saw his face. She could smell the earthy odor from him and saw the tell tale green leaves he left laying about. It could only be Elder Beornn.  Feigning anger she snarled at the handsome man.  &quot;I do not need your help human.&quot;  He did not reply, but he did not stop his assistance either.  Such is the way of this druid.  <br>
<br>
Laney regains her posture and looks into the face Beornn, slowly she removes her helmet for she has nothing to fear.  Shaking her head her hair falls freely across her shoulders and she beams a smile to the patient human.  Still he says nothing, he smiles and gives her a reassuring look.  She is not sure why she was meant to meet this extraordinary man but she is not sorry that she has been introduced.  As she makes sure she has all her belongings, she rummages in her bags and finds what she was looking for.  A small envelope sealed with a hand holding a sword in a bit of wax.  As she turns to re enter the windmill and fight some more robots of gnomish tinkering she drops the note.  She does not know if Beornn will find it, but she hopes he does.  Before she can object she is surrounded by an avian spirit and a bit of strength infuses her body. With no one watching this time, she smiles a brilliant smile and quietly thanks the druid for helping her once again.<br>

Beornn,<br>
<br>
I had hoped to see you again, and I am not surprised you are there at the precise moment I needed you the most.  Thank you for your kindnesses to myself and my family.  You are truly remarkable and patient. I do not wish to say too much, but please accept this token for what it is worth.<br>

It was a familiar scent as he had often accompanied her in the hunt these past few days.  Unsure of why he was here, he sat calmly in meditation awaiting her presence.  There was something about the dark elf's presence that pleased him, or perhaps troubled him.  He didn't know which to believe.<br>
<br>
Suddenly with a flash, the dark Mistress steps out of a portal along with her friends of battle.  He playfully tapped the little one on the shoulders then looked up into the eyes of Laney.  Her face was still hot from battle, but he could see a calmness in her expression as her eyes met his.  This was, however, immediately replace with a snarl as she jokingly tried to hide her pleasure in seeing a human.<br>
<br>
See departed as quickly as she came.  Hardly a word was spoken, but it was enough to keep him content until their next meeting.  As she and her friends ran back into the Wind Mill, a note fell from her hand.  He went and picked it up with interest, but before he could say anything she was gone.  Seeing the seal, he quickly tucked it away within his tunic.<br>
<br>
Under his favorite tree within the Glade he took out the note and broke the seal.  A tear came to his eye as he read it.  It seems he had brought light to the dark heart of the Mistress.  However, to fully understand her would require much more patience.<br>
<br>
He suddenly felt eyes upon him as he realized the Glade might not be the safest place to expose his interest in the dark race.  Opening a gate, he quickly put the note in his pocket and stepped through.  &quot;Until we meet again,&quot; he whispered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~msamuel/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/rust/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="rage81292frm22">What we do<option value="rage81292frm1">General Discussion<option value="rage81292frm2">Guild Rules<option value="rage81292frm3">Applications<option value="rage81292frm19">Roleplay if ya wanna!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/brage81292>Fire and Fury</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19>Roleplay if ya wanna!</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org">Fire and Fury </a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
