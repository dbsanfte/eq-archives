<br>
   For the barnacle breastplate, you have to kill a diseased shark, and then kill it's babies.  The diseased shark is around level 11, and the babies are around level 1.  Even a full group of level 4 players (assuming you could form such a group in Erudin) couldn't handle that (add to this the fact that there's a hammerhead shark around level 15 who shares the pool with the diseased one). <br>
<br>
   Can you do the quest?  Yes, but it generally requires hanging in the area as a newbie, begging higher level players to kill the diseased shark, or vice versa, which, when all is said and done, is really stupid.<br>

So let me put it another way. When verant built FV they had rules and a framework laid out that would basically describe the progression of this server. To do this they would need to make some assumptions. This isn't any different than how any business would operate. Some call it forecasting or projections.<br>
<br>
For Verant's premise to work, that is for FV to work, some of these projections would need to materialize. For any EQ server, the most important projection that would need to materialize is the player count. Not just for revenue, but to create and maintain the social and economic dynamic of the server. In FV's case this also has an impact on quests. I am not privy to these forecasts, but I do not believe FV has met its projected player count. I don't think anyone would dispute that. The unexpectedly low population count is making it unreasonably difficult to accomplish a number of quests.<br>
<br>
Now some would argue that, missed projections or not, Verant is not going to change anything because a &quot;handful&quot; of quests have been adversly affected by TLC. They might even be right. But this is a problem that will continue to grow as new expansions and new quests are released. So at what point does Verant need to do something? How many quests have to become &quot;unreasonably difficult&quot; or impossible to do before they take action? <br>
<br>
Now before anyone accuses me of being a power gamer or impatient please consider where I have just come from. I have just spent the last year on the Test server.  When you come from an environment where they can bring down the server at anytime (no notice), wipe gear from you as you zone or worse with NO recourse, well... I think thats about as patient as you can ask a player to be. I didn't whine when they broke all the fear and Feign death spells on test a little while ago. I didn't whine when I zoned into NFP and discovered all my equipment had been wiped. I didn't even whine when I entered my username and password but wound up logging into another persons account. I just pointed out what I thought were problems and thats what I am doing again now.<br>

That's all really nice, but you really didn't address the issue of who gets to determine what constitutes &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;unreasonable&quot;.  You didn't even lay out your own criteria of what constitutes &quot;reasonable&quot;.  You just made the jump from &quot;unreasonable&quot; to &quot;broken&quot; again, without defining either of these terms.<br>

Here's a snippet from the patch message when TLC first appeared (I love news archives):<br>
<br>
&quot;The first issue addressed in the Warrens is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that 'outclasses' a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP. All other loot will drop. 'Outclassing' a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill. This can happen if, for instance, the foe is 'green' to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
Everything else (that it increases interaction between high/low level players, encourages grouping, etc) is just a side effect.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against TLC (I'm a fan of it).   And I do like that it encourages interaction between high and low level players (when some level 40 guy goes &quot;DOH!  I forgot I need some bandit sashes to raise my temple of life faction&quot;).  But a quest, in an of itself, shouldn't require high level mobs be killed, in order to spawn LOWER level mobs, with such a difference between levels that no one person or group of people can complete it.<br>
   If the diseased shark were level 1, and the babies level 11, then you could do it.  You'd kill the diseased shark as a newbie, save the item you needed from it, and could then come back 10 levels later and whack the babies.  A lot of multi-stage quests work this way.  The Lower level mobs should come FIRST, followed by the HIGHER level mobs.  When they're run in reverse (Killing level 35 gnolls in order to spawn a level 15 one), it's stupid, and means you have to go draggin a newbie all over the place and into places they shouldn't be.<br>

<br>
I did not address what was &quot;reasonable&quot; in my last post because I acknowledged that &quot;reasonable&quot; is subjective and tried to approach this issue from another view point. If you would like an example of what I thnk is unreasonable here it is.<br>
<br>
- I am a new player to EQ.<br>
- I make a Dwarven paladin.<br>
- I fight evil creature and do several cool quests turning in these bird claws, bone chips and orc shoulder pads. All in all having a good time.<br>
<br>
- Soon enough I am in unrest, battleing undead as paladins were meant to do. I am quickly approaching my 20th season as the creatures in unrest present a wide level of challenges.<br>
<br>
- I kill a carrion ghoul and loot its heart. I am told that it is part of a quest for a holy sword called Ghoulbane, which I will need for my epic. Being new I don't know what an Epic is so it is gleefully explained to me. Then the person says, &quot;so ya, your epic. You went to FP and killed that level 9 guy for your first part didnt you?&quot;<br>
<br>
- Of course not. Not one NPC in butcherblock gives any clue to the paladin NPC in FP. How could I have known? How could I have planned for this? This hardly seems fair but I shrug it off and struggle on.<br>
<br>
- So I go to FP and try to hire a group in the level range appropriate for this NPC. I soon realize that no one can understand me because I speak dwarf and everyone else here speaks human. What a great oppourtunity to learn human! <br>
<br>
- I try to learn human, I am having trouble because I only speak Dwarf so trying to explain that I want to learn human isnt easy. after &lt;&lt;insert time between 15 min and 1 week, as posted on this thread&gt;&gt; and becoming a master of miming &quot;I want to learn human&quot; someone finally clues in and agrees to teach me human.<br>
<br>
- ZOINKS! Languages are broken. No one can learn a language past skill 5 till verant gets it fixed, that is when they finally acknowledgd languages were broken in the first place which they wouldn't do. Now I have to try and find a group of dwarves to come help me do this, which really limits me since I can only solicit help form one race now. I can entice them with a 20 minute boat ride where they can do, er..nothing! Whee!<br>
<br>
- Good News! Verant acknowledges languages are broken and fixes them. I try to learn human, after &lt;&lt;insert time between 15 min and 1 week, as posted on this thread&gt;&gt; someone finally clues in and agrees to teach me human. I thank brell that its not 1 point per hour &lt;like Verant has posted on the FV info section&gt; or I would be level 30 or higher by the time I could belt out a coherant message.<br>
<br>
- I auction and auction for someone to help me with this NPC. I am having trouble because auction only works in city zones which is mostly populated by folks level 5 and under &lt;if there is anyone even in the zone on this server&gt; so I decide to move out to west commons/Nro where there are folks hunting that are in the proper level range to help with this NPC.<br>
<br>
- Auction doesnt work here,  no such thing as /ooc and shout has a limited range so I run around to the different camps of humans trying to get some help. After &lt;&lt;insert time between 15min and 1 week, as posted on this thread&gt;&gt; I find someone to help me.<br>
<br>
- Unfortunately, they want my bronze BP that I got in unrest because they know its for my Epic and know they have me by the beard. (You didnt think I was going to say balls did you? I am a paladin after all).<br>
<br>
- Success! They have aquired the piece I need for my Epic! I happily hand over my bronze BP and thank Brell for blessing me with this item!<br>
<br>
Thats pretty much what I find unreasonable. Especially for an item that doesnt have any stats, real worth and isn't ever farmed on any server period.<br>

<br>
I have spent over a year and a half playing one character on a server and never was able to get J-boots.  There were many times that I spent nights trying to find the AC, but I never found him.  Does that mean that the quest is 'unreasonable' and should be changed to a more predictable spawn?  Is the AC Bugged?  No.  It is just difficult.<br>
<br>
So just in real life, you learn to work with the tools handed to you.  On FV, the TLC exists and the Devs have provided additional methods (ones that where not available on regular servers with the TLC).  <br>
<br>
Most people are not going to change their opinions about the TLC, and the debate will continue on and on.<br>
<br>
The topic of this thread is &quot;TLC BUG LIST&quot;, yet there have been no 'bugs' listed, only opinions.  <br>
