<br>
But really ...  I like roleplaying ...  and I think I do roleplay reasonably OK usually, sure we all slip up when we're tired or whatever, but I have fun, and I think the people around me do too.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, to me, this is a game first.  Sure, I normally hang out with evil types.  But if I have OOC friends who need a summon corpse or something, it's still just a game.  Of course I'll help.  Or even, if it’s rare, a goodie friend who needs a tank or a hand on a quest.  Normally I'll turn Anon on, so as not to disgrace the guild, but I'll happily be there for a friend.  Would I get in a pick-up group with lighties?  Hell no.  But friends and fun come above being a hard-line roleplay demon.  I PREFER to roleplay, which is why I’m here.  I don’t want my roleplaying to stop me from having fun.<br>
<br>
If it bugs you to see me talking to someone you think is a paladin ... what business is it of yours?  Assume I'm using him for my own personal evil ambitions and move on.  OOC, maybe I just want to hang with some friends and relax.  Or, IC maybe I AM using him.  If you must , come challenge me, and I’ll snarl something about using them for my own ends.  But geez … there’s enough inconsistent things to worry about in this game (/loc, /auction, languages, etc…) without getting bugged by who chooses to group with whom, at least it’s possible to think up RP explanations for that.  You’re only ruining your own fun by assuming the worst of everybody, when it’s not necessary.<br>

I disagree with this. It is precisely my business, because it's my game too, and your example spoils my immersion. I won't approach you and flame you OOCly, in-game or on the boards, but I'll probably remember who you are. I might contest your actions through roleplay, which you don't seem to have a problem with.<br>

<br>
I see a friend online (another dark elf) and i go and join them for some fun, however they are with another friend who is with his 'lightie' friend, so i join.. i didnt join with a 'lightie' because it was good for em.. i joined because i wanted to spend time with a friend, and to do that it required me grouping with a race i would not normally group with.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when i am in greater feydark i kill guards in Felwithe then try to give the swords away. (killing guards in Karana and giving Guard bracers away is more fun.. you know they have been slaughtering your guards) and when i give the swords over i make sure they know how i got them and how much fun it was to kill the high elven paladins... Being evil can have many options, and you 'can' interact with the good races a lot if you can work something amusing to both groups in.<br>
<br>
It's give and take, some you gota win, some you have to loose... if i said i could win every dual that would be so dull... i am a good fighter and played a few shadowknights, i have fun with that class and it suits my timezone and i will prob always be a shadowknight. I COULD go round killing anyone, but truth is i prefer looseing fights than winning them, me loosing a fight usualy means it was a damn fun event, and the trouble with that is i Dont always use the 'best' tactics, or spells or wepons... I like the challenge and will often dual multiple opponents.<br>
<br>
It's the same with rollplay, give and take, not every situation i 'should' win... it is just dull if i roleplay that i never loose a fight, if i loose i often Roleplay that i dont believe it happened.. and other times the winner just needs the credit due.<br>
<br>
Most of my 'Fav' Roleplaying moments were talking to 'lighties' however, even more fun is pack of evils Vs pack of lighties ... can really get some tension sorted. <br>
<br>
I Did like the grouping resitrctions, some made sence, some did not... overall i will live with the results. <br>
<br>
But let me finish with:<br>
If YOU are haveing fun, and roleplaying. And the people you are rollplaying have fun, and you group with lighties and you both have fun and both rollplay............ Where is the harm? SO what somone saw you group with a lightie - they should speek to you incharacter, confront you perhaps.. or not.. But it should spawn off some conversation wich is MORE Rollplay.. wich isnt a bad thing.<br>

However, as I grew used to them, I realized that they did do a fairly good job of keeping roleplayers honest, and they truly were not that rigid.  It just meant that you couldn't share experience in a group with someone who was &quot;evil&quot; if you were &quot;good&quot;, or vice versa (without exploiting a bug).  You could still fight alongside someone of opposing alignment if you wanted to, in fact I had done this on rare occassion before the rule was lifted.  It's just that it was the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> exception</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rather than the rule (which is as far as I can tell, is what people want: a generally coherant and consistent set of guidelines about who is opposed to who, with a few rare exceptions).<br>
<br>
Are there players who come up with great, ironclad storylines behind why they associate with the &quot;type of people&quot; that their race or class is normally opposed to?  Sure.  However, those who are genuine about it tend to be the sort of diehard roleplayers who are willing to sacrifice a few conveniences for their unorthodox roleplay point of view.<br>
<br>
There was a time when the FV server was my absolute favorite, and I couldn't imagine playing anywhere else.  Now Firiona Vie is a normal server with a 1 character per account limit and TLC.  Considering the fact that I never was a big fan of TLC (and now I outright hate it now that I'm of a level where it's simply closed off a few quests I wanted to do), all that Firiona Vie that really has going for it now is a something of a community atmosphere that's lacking on most other servers.  I guess that's nice, but it has really very little to do with roleplaying.<br>
<br>
I think the alignment grouping system we had before was just fine for encouraging and sticking to roleplay.  I think that with that, and the 1 character limit, we'd be fine, even without the easily surmountable communications barrier, even without TLC (which never really had anything to do with RPing), even without forced /rp, even with zonewide /shout and an /ooc channel.<br>
<br>
I don't see the rules changing (except perhaps to make Firiona Vie even more &quot;normal&quot; as Verant realizes their experiment has failed) so I guess this is just sour grapes.  Firiona Vie is what sparked my interest in EQ again, and now it's changes to Firiona Vie that have been slowly smothering and killing my interest in EQ. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

I see evil and good characters grouped all the time now.  Most likely, it probably is out of convenience, not for roleplaying reasons.  It may not be realistic, but I leave those groups to themselves.  If they are having fun, that is all that matters.<br>
<br>
         When I created Cronadan back in January, I purposely made him agnostic and neutral evil (the closest to true neutral that the game would allow).  I knew that at some point, I wanted Cronadan to break away from what was typical Teir'dal behavior.  The alignment restrictions made it difficult for him to hunt with some people, but I welcomed the challenge.  Cron's life was designed to be difficult.  The alignment restrictions coupled with the fact that he is Teir'dal made roleplaying him MUCH more challenging.  Unlike most characters I have had in the past, there was room for this one to grow.  Whether the alignment restrictions were in place or not, I would have followed the same course.<br>

       From the beginning, I roleplayed the difficulties presented to me as a Teir'dal who walked away from his people.  Uinin, Isharra and Siava are some of Cron's closest friends, but alignment restrictions, and good roleplaying made it difficult to forge these friendships before May 8th.  After May 8th, I went out of my way to roleplay these difficulties, rather than rely on game mechanics.  Since then, Lasgalen (the character) has confronted Cronadan a few times, usually resulting in an argument of some sort.  Shintou has made several death threats to Cron for betraying his people.  I take it in stride because the players behind these characters take the time to roleplay their alignments whether they are in place gamewise or not.<br>
<br>
      I have heard others say that characters like mine are a dime a dozen now.  I agree.  Everyone wants to be unique in some way.  However, unlike many so called &quot;good&quot; Dark Elves, Cronadan totally destroyed his faction in Neriak.  As a player, I took great pains to faction farm in every &quot;good&quot; city that I could.  I am 47th level, and I STILL spend a majority of my time faction farming.  Yes it is tedious, but it is true to character.  I know there are other DarkElves out there who are doing pretty much the same thing as I am.  I'm sure the other &quot;renegade&quot; Teir'dal face the same adversity that Cronadan does, or did before he became well known.  The difference is, without alignment restrictions, it makes the life of a renegade a little easier.  I know how difficult it is in proving yourself to a skeptical, and in some cases, a hostile crowd.  I love the challenge.  That is why Cronadan still exists.<br>
<br>
      Everytime this topic comes up, Cronadan is mentioned at some point, but I rarely post.  I am not one to draw attention to myself.  Still,  I just wanted everyone to know that my character actually took the time to work the game mechanics, past and present, to truly become one of those who &quot;stepped out of the box.&quot;  Roleplaying is very important to me, and I will continue to do it till this server becomes just like any other blue server.  I have been here for almost a year now, and I some of the changes that have taken place recently damaged the roleplaying environment to some degree.  Still, there are many of us left, who play the game the way that is was played from the beginning.  Fear not.  We are out there.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 <br>
Dilution of the traditionalists (Pre May-8th) continues,and in the end,RPing will be exactly what it is on every other server.<br>
 <br>
A curiousity. A freakish one,at that.<br>
 <br>
What remains allows for slightly more polite play than most blue servers,simply because with only one character per account,there is no &quot;alt&quot; to hide on or start over with.<br>
 <br>
Roleplay,to truly work on a large scale REQUIRES artificial limitations that change a world from the &quot;norm&quot; and create worlds that do not conform to reality.<br>
 <br>
Teir'dal are evil. Iksar are xenophobic. Paladins of Mithaniel Marr are goodie-two-shoes. And so on.<br>
 <br>
Would this be limiting your roleplay? Sure. But if you want to play in the happy world of co-operation,may I suggest Candyland? Given no restraints,the game pushes people to co-operation...even if normally the &quot;history of the world&quot; would have their avatars trying to kill each other on sight. We're all humans under the avatar,and do far little to really RP otherwise without the interface forcing us to.<br>
 <br>
Is this a restrictive view...?<br>
<br>
HECK YES. There's a fine line between no restraints and too many,but Fironia Vie pre-May 8th was far closer to that balance than it is now-which is WAY on the side of &quot;no restraints&quot;.<br>
 <br>
It's now effectively a blue server with one character and TLC.<br>
