In old NWN it was common for guildmembers to put the guild initials in the beginning of their names so that you could see who all was on from your guild.<br><br>MECH decided they wanted to RP cyborgs, so they made the icons that represented their characters all carry crossbows and they darkened them using the coloring schemes so they looked like they were carrying blasters. Then they made a story that they had basicly been created by this empire to fight in their world, and rebelled against their slavers and returned to their homeworld which had been destroyed by massive quantities of radiation from the wars.<br><br>Magic was nothing more then bi product of radiation and those who know how to manipulate it. Orcs, elves, dwarves, were all mutant offshoots of said radiation, and of course needed to be &quot;cleansed&quot;. <br><br>At first it made one hell of an uproar but over time they eventually were accepted as they stayed in their character and brought an element to the game that no one from old Neverwinter ever forgets, even tho the original game is long gone.<br><br>But on another note, I don't think its the klingon stuff people would complain about so much.<br><br>Find your favorite story and then add another element to it which just wouldn't seem to logically fit within its context.

It is full of humourous touches akin to the &quot;easter-eggs&quot; found in more serious product. <br><br>It is therefore rather sad that the aforementioned RP-police whose ideas of RP are cast in stone and possibly derived from some fairly limited exposure to the breadth of fantasy feel entitled to harass and belittle those whose interpretation is different.<br><br>Having said that, lifting stuff wholesale from an entirely different genre - ie Space Opera - is a jarring influence and would need some A1 RP to justify <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Given that there are characters running around named after video games and SF characters already how much harm can one more do, especially as you do seem to have an RP angle mapped out. Just don't start trying to teach Vulcan<br><br>I think the response that said we just treat you as raving mad had it about right.

I think it stems from an old AD&amp;D module I once played. It involved an alien space craft crash landing in an AD&amp;D world. As it started out it was pretty normal, find a creature, kill it, get it's stuff. But it got better and more bizarre as it went on. There were memory banks that told of the ships origin, and troubles. Puzzles were built into the plot, which was pretty interesting. The weirdest part was I started the module in standard D&amp;D armor: splint mail, bastard sword, bow and some arrows. By the time I finished it I was weilding a Plazma rifle, bioscanner, infrared goggles, and anti gravity boots. This was an actual module put out by TSR for the AD&amp;D universe. I just wish I could remember what is was called.  Needless to say, I couldn't play that character on any other campaigns.  Imagine the scene<br><br>DM: you enter a room and find a carrion crawler<br>Player 1: I attack the carrion crawler with my mace<br>Player 2: I cast fireball at the carrion crawler<br>Player 3: I attack with my bow and arrow<br>Player 4: I set my phased plazma rifle to incinerate and fire...<br><br>So Mal, In closing I say do what makes you happy, I'm sure I'd get a kick out of seeing a lost Vulcan on Norrath. So long as he played the character well.<br><br>-Traxxus<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2555.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2555.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2555.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2555.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=2555.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2555.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2555.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
