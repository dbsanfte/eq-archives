<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A bit of background, EQ and otherwise:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Most of us have played together in various games dating back to early UO. Individually, most of us have been top players in everything we've played and we place an emphasis on only recruiting skilled players. As a guild we have been successful (meaning top guild in many cases) in every game we’ve played under one tag or another. Our EQ experience varies quite a lot from player to player. A couple had never played until now and some have played on their own with top guilds like Afterlife and FoH and and worked their way up all the way to Plane of Time. <br>
<br>
We just started playing EQ on FV a couple of months ago and most of us are level 65 and grinding AA now. It's been agreed upon that we want to be a raiding guild, however we don't have the manpower to raid on our own and so we've decided to try recruiting via these message boards. Obviously we have to be less selective than in the past given the situation; the situation being that EQ is an old game that requires a large guild and we’re just starting on this server with relatively small numbers. Just to be clear, joining the Dark Coalition tag in EQ does not make you a  member of SiN. You are on the tag for EQ and that's it. Anything more is up to Bone Dancer, the GM of SiN. SiN is extremely selective in who they make permanent members so don't bother bone about this. If he wants you, he'll let you know, but i wouldn't count on it unless you're an extremely gifted and dedicated player...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of concern to the applicant:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'm sure that anyone who might be thinking of joining our tag on FV will be wondering if this will ever get off the ground... Well, if it is going to work we're going to need dedicated players that can commit to building a good guild who won’t quit if things aren’t perfect right away. We are building from scratch and trying to create a capable raiding guild, it will not happen overnight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why join us instead of some other raiding guild?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Well basically, we're the shit :P Seriously though, if we can get the numbers and commitment from players on FV, we will be successful, just like in every other game we've played. This isn't some idealistic recruitment speil, it's fact. Some of our members are newer to EQ than others, but every one of us has the gaming skill required to be among the best at their respective class. We have solid leadership that has led us to the top spot in many games. Very few guilds can claim this. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.afraidyet.net/history.php" target="top"> You can read SiN's history here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  And for the record, no we aren't a bunch of l33t dewdsp34k types. Most of us are mature gamers (meaning over 1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    just like the rest of the people on FV. The only reason I bring this up is that i'm sure some of you would read the SiN history and wonder (since we usually play pk servers and they have a negative stigma attached to them). And don't worry, the egos only come out on PvP servers. Most of us are very level-headed and think of the guild first, because even on a pvp server, that's what you need to do to win. Also for the record, we play nice here, as anyone who's grouped with me will know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
As a potential applicant, barring the other raiding guilds, you have a choice to make for yourself, you can join Resolution or Fire and Fury and ride on the coattails of others, or you can join the underdog and help us build a guild that will hopefully be able to compete with the two aforementioned guilds at some point in the future. In all honesty, I considered going the FnF/Reso route. It certainly requires less work and commitment on our part, but I think that building from the ground up will lead to a much bigger sense of achievement than joining an already very good guild, having them back-flag us for elemental planes, etc. and basically just riding along. After all, it’s not all about phat lewt and getting there tomorrow… I intend for the guild to get to the elemental planes and time, but again, it will take some time. <br>
<br>
If you want the quick guided tour, by all means, join Resolution or FnF, they’re great raiding guilds. If you want to work your way up to hardest zones in EQ and do everything along the way, with the sense of accomplishment that comes with doing guild firsts etc, then we might be the guild for you. <br>
<br>
I’ll reinforce what I already said. We will not transform into a top raiding guild overnight. Raiding high-end content requires lots of players and it should be expected that our roster will be changing quite rapidly in the beginning. It will take a little while to iron out the many details involved in running such a guild. Don’t join expecting everything to fall perfectly in to place the moment you do. I’m hoping that players who join will stick around long enough for us to get rolling as a guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Our current recruiting policy:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As far as recruitment is concerned, we aren’t being too selective about who joins. Our first priority is to get enough people guilded to start doing organized stuff as a guild on a regular basis. People who are not up to snuff (see more about this in the guild policies post, stickied under this one) and who cause problems will be weeded out very quickly. Once we have a stable roster, the method of recruitment will change. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The goals for the guild are as follows:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1) Recruitment stage. Can't do anything without enough players. Feel free to refer your friends to this post and our forums (links at the top of this post)<br>
<br>
2) Until we get enough players for raiding, I’d encourage people to form guild groups for LDoN. Learn to play together and improve your gear. <br>
<br>
As soon as we have a minimum number of required players and classes, we'll start finding stuff to raid on a regular basis. This will involve a schedule and members being there on time, just like any other raiding guild. Start time for raids will be around 6:30PM EST although it's a moot point until we get enough players. At this time, the leadership will decide how many times per week we raid, depending on how much time we think members need to dedicate to leveling and AA. Once a critical mass of members has attained the “required” levels/AA for hardcore raiding, we will switch to raiding 5 times per week. Obviously not everyone can attend all of the time, but it will be expected of you to attend most of the time and to let us know in advance (as much as is possible) if you won’t be able to make it.<br>
<br>
3) Once we get the initial numbers to start taking down big mobs, we will make significant changes to our recruiting policy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Recruitment Process:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1) Check requirements, read the guild policies (follow link for Applications board at the top of this post), register on the SiNister boards (again, links at top of this post), post application or intent to apply on the SiN EQ Applications board.<br>
<br>
2) Get guilded after I PM you on the SiN board. I will be guilding people once per night at about 6:30PM EST. You will be expected to meet me in the center of Nexus. This shouldn’t be a problem for you since this will be when we start raiding.<br>
<br>
3) We try you out. Idiots/annoying people/gimps/clueless newbs will be removed asap. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>New members will be asked to remain /anon until a short trial period has expired. This is so that the guild doesn't get a bad rep from someone new to the guild that is a complete idiot. Once you've grouped with longstanding members and gotten the ok, you will be asked to remove /anon. At this point, if you need to go &quot;anon&quot; for whatever reason, go /roleplay instead. Always show your tag. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
4) You’re basically a member, assuming you don’t do anything that falls under #3 on a regular basis. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Requirements:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:x-small;">(leeched some of this from reso site, thx guys, saved me some typing)</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
If you meet the requirements below and want to apply, fill out the form at the bottom and post with your <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&lt;Class, level, Name&gt;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->as the subject of your post on the applications board. <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Please do it in that format since I will be moving the approved applications to a members board to help me keep track of the roster. If I can sort things by class it makes it a lot easier for me.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> <br>
<br>
Once I see your app. I’ll either approve it or not. If it’s approved I’ll respond to the app on the message board and you can message me in game and I’ll get you guilded assuming you’re not on our “do no group with” list ;p We then decide if we like you or not. Basically, if you’re a good player there shouldn’t be a problem.<br>
<br>
If you do not meet the requirements (but are close) and still want to join, you can post an intent to apply, in the format &lt;Intent:Name, class, level&gt;. Please keep everything up to date. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>EQ Expansions</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Obviously, higher is better and I’ll adjust the requirements as the recruiting process gets underway. Note that while the minimum requirement is level 60, it is expected that you make steady progress in both levels and AA. This should be possible since if you’re applying you play a lot of EQ. I might make exceptions depending on class and how recruiting is going. Give me a PM on the message board (my board name is Scytale) and always state your class and level when PMing me in regards to this issue. <br>

Read both of them before sending me a /tell.
