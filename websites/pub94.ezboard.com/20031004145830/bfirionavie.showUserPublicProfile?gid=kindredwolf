I was born a poor High Elf Paladin in Felwithe. Where I learned to ways of noble combat. I went on many adventures with another paladin ye may know by the name of Hojas. One day he asked me about joining the Council of Mithril Dreams. After hunting with him and many other council members, I twas most certain this be a guild for me. While in me 20th season of Tunare I met a female Paladin by the name of Saffryn. Twas love at first site. I vowed to Tunare and the Council to follow and protect Saffryn always. From that day on we were nay ever seen apart, till that horrid day that Lord Lowky twas imprisoned in Befallen. After the events that transpired with in Saffryn did fall from grace and left the light and warmth of Tunare. She begged Innoruuk to make her one of his children, and he did. I after making me vow had to keep it or be lost to Tunare forever. I preyed to Tunare for guidance. I knew not how to keep me vow when I twas unable to enter Saffryn's new homeland. Tunare being the goddess that she is did take pity on me and allowed me to walk The land as a Tier'dal knight. With me being happy now, that me could be with Saffryn. Innoruuk, the demon that he be, did slay Saffryn and laid her at me feet in a pool of blood. He hath then begun to try and sway me from Tunare to him to no avail. I will nay ever leave the light and warmth of Tunare. So now there be me story. I hope ye all do understand why I am now a Dark Elf Shadow Knight. Also know that though I hath change in appearance I hath nay fallen from the grace of Tunare and do still follow her divine teachings. For this he then cursed me to remain a Tier'dal for the rest of me days. That day me did vow to one day slay the vile beast Innoruuk and me shall one day. Me was then forced to live in fear of me once friends, and roam Norrath alone and sad. One day a noble druid named Deasie adopted me. She saw me loneliness but saw the good within me that me birth parents did nay see. By chance me did come across a Fier'dal maiden by the name of Moonember Barra'Linath. Though me be a Shadow Knight I hath found Love once more. The beauty that does hang Luclin in me eyes be Moonember Bard of a Thousand Songs.  Me did set me sights to be with her always. Now she be me wife, and we do share a love eternal. We did have a son one blessed morn, to which we named Lupinemoon. He twas a druid like his grandmother. He twas a very respectful child. Till one day he came looking for me in the wood known as Nektolus. He knew not the dangers that befell him within the wood. Innoruuk, forever watching me to ruin what happiness me finds while cursed, did once more take the life of one who be dear to me. Me son in his 12th season, twas slain by Innoruuk minions, and taken from me. Now me finds solace within the shadows of guildhall. Now with me first love and son dead, and me wife imprisoned by the gods for nay paying tribute to their shrines, me once more be alone.

Many seasons pass


Me hath once more had to say goodbye to another love. Me beloved wife Moonember hath nau returned to me. Now me days be spent venturing mostly alone. There be days that me do find council with the beautiful Lady Lyricalmuse, which be the days me longs fer. She doth have a soul that be a shinning light in the darkness that hath encompassed me, and me thank Tunare fer he friendship.
