<br>
Years ago when I first started playing EQ, me and some friends started a guild on the Prexus server. It was not a traditional roleplaying guild per se, but we did tend to act in character. Although we were more than a little loose in our RP interpetations. We had a troll that was raised as an elf and still considered himself an elf (he was named Flowerpetal). We were a hard drinkin', partying kind of guild with high aolchol tollerences and low levels. We folowed the &quot;Great Flower&quot;, the forgotten god of Norrath and valued fun above all else.<br>
<br>
I was the guild leader (Ryshat Annklebiter) a dwarven warrior or dubious heritage. I was also the guild webmaster and scribe. Seeing as how our chosen deity had been overlooked by the chronicles or Norrath, it was up to us to bring his word to the world.<br>
<br>
For the sake of keeping old tales alive, I present to you the first in a (very short) series called &quot;Seeds of Wisdom&quot;. Please take them with a gain of RP salt. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
And please feel free to tell me to peddle my wares elsewhere if you don't like them.<br>
<br>
[edit] Oh heck, there are only three of them so I posted them all. If they don't go over well, we can always delete the thread.[/edit] <p>-----------------<br>

The Great Flower rolled over and looked at his Great Alarm Clock (as all things Godly and owned by Gods are Great). Wiping the Great Eye Crust from his eyes he sat bolt upright and exclaimed <br>
     &quot;Holy Tunare! I've overslept!&quot; From his bed of roses, held aloft by entwined vines of grapes and figs, the Great Flower leapt. He quickly brushed his stamen and ran a comb through his petals before heading downstairs to the Great Kitchen of the Gods. <br>
<br>
All of the other Gods of Norrath were already putting their Great Breakfast Dishes in the sink and looking at the Great Flower with a great deal of distaste. All of the Gods except Erollisi Marr, The Queen of Love. <br>
     &quot;Good morning Flower&quot;, Erollisi said to the Great Flower. <br>
     &quot;Did I keep you up too late again last night?&quot; she queried as a playful smile crossed her lips. <br>
     &quot;E.M., you're da bomb! We were all like 'plickity pla-KOW' and shit last night. Girl, you rocked my roots.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Language Flower!&quot; Tunare spoke up in that motherly way she did at times. &quot;Let's not go into details at the table, ok children?&quot; <br>
<br>
The Great Flower was about to sit down to a late breakfast when he saw the other Gods moving about and leaving the kitchen with their hands cupped, as if holding something. The Great Flower walked up behind Innoruuk and looked over his shoulder. <br>
     &quot;What ya got there Inny?&quot; the Great Flower asked. <br>
     &quot;Go away. I hate you.&quot; Innoruuk hissed at the Great Flower, spraying him with spittle. <br>
     &quot;For Tunare sake Inny, you hate everyone. You're the God of Hate. That's what you do. Now how about you pretend to be the God of Answering Questions.&quot; the Great Flower replied, tilting his great flowery head towards Innoruuk's hands. <br>
     &quot;They are my followers. Tunare made them for me. And I hate them.&quot; Innoruuk hissed again. The Great Flower peered into Innoruuk's hands and saw a throng of small beings the size of ants moving about in his hands. The tiny beings were tall and short, male and female, pink and blue and all manner of shapes and sizes. The Great Flower watched them move about as he said, <br>
     &quot;Well if they follow you, you better not back up or your likely to step on them.&quot; <br>
     &quot;You don't understand. They are my followers. They will spread my influence across the whole of Norrath. I hate them, and they hate me.&quot; Innoruuk spat out. <br>
The Great Flower started to walk away when he replied, &quot;Yea, we'll I'm sure you and your followers will have many lovely, hate filled, dysfunctional family picnics. And be careful about that spitting, you're likely to drown 'em all giving them a pep talk.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Great Flower started to cross the kitchen towards Tunare and her cooking pot. The rest of the Gods were becoming more and more interested in their &quot;followers&quot;, especially Quellios, The Tranquill. &quot;You like me, you really like me!&quot; he was saying into his cupped hands when the Great Flower walked by and approached Tunare. <br>
     &quot;O.K. Ma. Where are my ..uh... &quot;followers&quot;, are they?&quot;, the Great Flower spoke as he cupped his leaves. Tunare looked at the Great Flower and made a 'tsk tsk' noise with her tongue. <br>
     &quot;I'm sorry Flower, there aren't anymore followers.&quot; Tunare told him. &quot;I've divided them up evenly between all the Gods.&quot; <br>
     &quot;WHAT?!&quot; the Great Flower exclaimed. &quot;What do you mean evenly? I'm a God. Don't I count?&quot; he asked with more than a bit of annoyance in his voice. <br>
     &quot;I'm sorry Flower, I counted the heads at the table and divided by that number.&quot; <br>
     &quot;What about me&quot;, the Great Flower's lower lip trembled. &quot;You forgot about me?&quot; <br>
     &quot;Oh honey, I've forgotten an entire continent until only recently, so don't take it too personally.&quot; Tunare said to the Great Flower as she pulled him to her arms and tried to comfort him. <br>
<br>
As the Great Flower rested his head on Tunare's shoulder, his mind swimming with disappointment he noticed something. <br>
     &quot;What's that? In the cooking pot?&quot; <br>
     &quot;Oh, those? Those are just leftover followers. They stuck to the bottom of the pot and I couldn't scrape them off. I figured I'd let the Great Dog clean the bowl.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Well can I have them?&quot; the Great Flower looked up at Tunare his eyes wide with anticipation. <br>
     &quot;I don't know Flower. They are a bit off since they were undercooked. Plus there aren't that many of them. Only a dozen or so.&quot; Tunare hesitantly stated. <br>
     &quot;Fine by me!&quot; the Great Flower said. &quot;Can I have em, huh?&quot; <br>
     &quot;Well, ok. Just be careful. They look like trouble if you ask me.&quot; Tunare reluctantly agreed. <br>
The Great Flower reached into the pot and scraped out the bottom, scooping up his half-baked followers in his leaves. His face beamed with excitement. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower went to the Great Kitchen Table to get a closer look at his new followers. As he sat down he had to cover his followers from Bertoxxulous, The Plaugebringer, who was sneezing into his cupped hands and apologizing profusely. <br>
     &quot;Sorry Flower. I just ...ah...ahCHOOO!&quot; he sneezed into his hands again. &quot;Gee, mine seem to be pretty listless. I hope they make it through the night.&quot; he murmured as he shuffled off. <br>
The Great Flower spread his followers out on the Great Table and looked each one over. He noticed a rather fat one running across the table, apparently intent on attacking the Great Salt Shaker. He picked up the fat one, since it was the easiest to see. <br>
     &quot;Hmmm. What are you?&quot; the Great Flower queried. <br>
     &quot;I'm an elf.&quot; the fat, green creature stated. <br>
     &quot;Your sure are aggressive.&quot; <br>
     &quot;I attack because I love.&quot; <br>
      &quot;Then I shall call you Flowerpetal. The avenging but loving disciple.&quot; the Great Flower decreed, and set him back on the table. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower then picked up one of the smaller creatures on the table. As he picked the creature up, a foul odor emanated from it. The Great Flower covered his &quot;nose&quot; and spoke to the creature in his leaf. <br>
     &quot;What is that terrible smell?&quot; <br>
     &quot;What smell?&quot; the creature looked around innocently. <br>
     &quot;That smell. Can't you smell that. It's horrible. Even Cazic-Thule over there smells better.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Oh, that? Well...that is my...uh...it's..it's my defense mechanism. Yea. Defense.&quot; the creature blurted out. <br>
     &quot;More &quot;offensive&quot; then defensive I would think.&quot; At this the tiny creature laughed and offered the Great Flower a beer. &quot;Here, have a swig of this. It's what gets me goin in the mornin'.&quot; the creature said as it offered an almost microscopically small goblet. The Great Flower accepted the teensy cup and put it in his mouth. <br>
     &quot;Hmmm. Not bad. I think I would like this liquid in greater amounts.&quot; <br>
     &quot;You and me both, brother.&quot; the tiny creature let out with another roaring laugh. <br>
     &quot;I like you tiny one. I will call you Ryshat, after our fun loving, but smelly dog here.&quot; the Great Flower declared as he placed the tiny creature back on the table, being careful not to startle him and cause another &quot;defensive outburst&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower took notice of two creatures talking ... planning something it seemed. One kept saying the words &quot;tracking&quot; and &quot;organization&quot; as the other kept trying on different pieces of armor and clothing. Seeming to constantly be upgrading. The Great Flower leaned close to the table and addressed the two creatures. <br>
     &quot;You two look like you know what your doing.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Hail beeyatch!&quot; the blonde one said. <br>
     &quot;We're here, want beer, get used to it.&quot; the other one began to chant. They quickly organized the others to join in and soon all the creatures were organized and singing. <br>
     &quot;Well, you two seem to be quite the little organizers. I shall name you Sdaasiil and Tensai.&quot; <br>
<br>
Just then the Great Flower took notice of another creature. This one caught his attention with his talking. <br>
     &quot;You, funny looking one. You sound different than the rest. Why is that?&quot; <br>
     &quot;Well, I'm not originally from where the others are from.&quot; he stated. <br>
     &quot;How is that? I got you all from the same pot.&quot; the Great Flower challenged. <br>
     &quot;Well actually, I'm from all the way on the other side of the pot. It's very snowy on my side of the pot and we don't like to fight, although we are known for making knives. My people are a puzzle.&quot; he rattled on in a funny accent. <br>
     &quot;Well, that is interesting. I will name you Armathion, which means 'weird one' in Godspeak.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Great Flower began to pick up another creature when he noticed one creature grabbed onto the other creature's feet. He lifted them both up and addressed then in the palm of his leaf. <br>
     &quot;You, you have been standing down there making a hell of a racket. What are you doing?&quot; <br>
     &quot;I'm singing. I'm a bard.&quot; <br>
     &quot;I'll say your bad.&quot; <br>
     &quot;No! A BARD. I'm a bard. A musician.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Well don't quit your day job.&quot; the Great Flower laughed. &quot;And who is this little hottie, one of your groupies?&quot; <br>
     &quot;This is my mate. We go everywhere together.&quot; <br>
     &quot;I'm got his big ass on 'track', shall we hunt it down and kick it?&quot; she asked her mate. <br>
     &quot;Ohhh, she's feisty. I like that.&quot; the Great Flower smiled down on them. &quot;You will be Eloquinn and Banwen, my little love lumps.&quot; <br>
<br>
For the rest of the day the Great Flower named and got to know the rest of his followers. Feykyn, Gregorio (yet another &quot;organized&quot; one who had his act together), Scard (another smelly, small one), Yulsek, Caelx (another hottie), and Gremkin. He learned all about them and formed a bond with them. As he scooped them up in his petals he walked past Innoruuk and slapped the bottom of his cupped hands, sending Innoruuk's followers flying in all directions. <br>
<br>
Innoruuk looked around at his scattered followers and said, &quot;I hate playing '52 pickup'.&quot; <br>
<br>
All of the other Gods were already on their way back up from putting their followers on Norrath. Who knows how long it was in Norrath time from when the Gods had started to spread their word to when the Great Flower eventually got around to placing his followers on the land. Ages probably. Anyway, the Great Flower spoke to his new friends one last time before placing them across the face of Norrath, ready for adventure and to spread the word of the Great Flower. <br>
<br>
&quot;Live well my children. Remember this, life is like a game, so have fun. Spread the cheer and make friends with the other followers and eat, drink, kill, and be merry. You are now the holy warriors of fun. You are the ... Flower Jihad.&quot; <br>

He appeared to them during a festival whereupon he asked for the increasingly excited crowd to settle down and listen to what he had to say. He also asked for someone to bring him a brewski. The collected Flower Jihaders gathered around the Great Flower and sat at his feet ... er...roots. After a long quaff of a frosty brew, the Great Flower spoke to the assembled masses. <br>
<br>
&quot;My children, you have found each other and have united in the name of fun. The time has come to choose a leader from among yourselves. Someone who will uphold the ... uh ... moderately high standards of the Great Flower. This leader will be the voice of the Great Flower here on Norrath. When he speaks, it is as if I speak. You know ... like a sock puppet.&quot; <br>
<br>
A murmur ran through the crowd, the last of his kind since his people had been wiped out by the Trolls. <br>
     &quot;I gots em!'&quot; shouted Flowerpetal as he shambled off after the murmur. Flowerpetal easily subdued the murmur and quickly devoured him. The remaining Flower Jihad members looked at him, mouths agape in shock. <br>
<br>
&quot;What? They are a delicacy where I come from.&quot; Flowerpetal retorted, picking his foul teeth with a foot bone. Flowerpetal then whipped out a roll of Mentos® and held it up for the crowd to see. Eventually the crowd all gave Flowerpetal that &quot;Mentos Smirk/Smile&quot;® as if to say &quot;I'd bitch slap you into next Tuesday if you weren't such a sassy bastard&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower rolled his eyes and cleared his throat as Flowerpetal took his seat again. <br>
     &quot;I have a challenge for anyone who dares to be leader of this group. Who is up to the challenge?&quot; The Great Flower looked around at the assembled masses. Darting glances were exchanged amongst the members. Soft words were spoken, inaudible to the gathered crowd. <br>
     &quot;Oh come on,&quot; the Great Flower continued. &quot;Someone must want the job.&quot; The Great Flower looked around again. Finally the Great Flower sighed and said, &quot;You get all the free beer yo...&quot; <br>
     &quot;I'M UP TO THE CHALLENGE GREAT FLOWER!&quot; Ryshat shouted. <br>
     &quot;ME TOO!&quot; Eloquinn said as he jumped to his feet. <br>
     &quot;Hey, you beeyatches! I was going to volunteer!&quot; said Sdaasiil. <br>
     &quot;Imafuh fer bat foo!&quot; Flowerpetal mumbled through a mouth full of Mentos. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ok my children, those are enough volunteers.&quot; the Great Flower addressed the guild. <br>
     &quot;Here is the task I have set for you.&quot; <br>
The Great Flower gestured to a mountain range far off in the distance. &quot;That is the highest peak in all of Norrath. I want each of you to go to the top of the mountain and bring me back some evidence of your journey.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Great Flower lined the volunteers up facing the mountain as the rest of the guild looked on eagerly. The Great Flower then raised his leaf, paused to look around, and then dropped it down suddenly, signaling the start of the race. The volunteers immediately took to standing around, looking confused. Ryshat raised his wee hand and wiggled his fingers in a wave. <br>
<br>
&quot;What are you all doing?&quot; the Great Flower asked. &quot;Why aren't you running?&quot; <br>
     &quot;Oh,&quot; said Ryshat. &quot;Is that what you were doing? I thought you were waving at me.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Huh? Sorry, I wasn't looking.&quot; said Sdaasiil. <br>
     &quot;I thought he was trying to swat a fly away from his head.&quot; explained Eloquinn. <br>
     &quot;No. When I drop my leaf, that is the signal to 'go'.&quot; the Great Flower explained, with more than a touch of exasperation in his voice. <br>
     &quot;Ok, is everyone paying attention? Good. Now here we go.&quot; the Great Flower said as he once again raised his leaf, stared intently at the volunteers to make sure they were all looking at him ... and dropped his leaf. <br>
<br>
The contestants took off at a sprint , making a bee line for the mountain, and of course by bee line I mean something more akin to a moth. They zigged and zagged this way and that until they eventually made it over the horizon. After a spell, the Great Flower and his followers went about their business while they waited for the return of their proposed leaders. <br>
<br>
After about two hours had passed, Flowerpetal returned to the festival, wheezing and short of breath. After a while Flowerpetal was able to collect himself and addressed the Great Flower. <br>
     &quot;I have brought back a flower, from the vast fields of flowers found in the rolling foothills surrounding the mountain.&quot; Flowerpetal wheezed. <br>
     &quot;A flower?&quot; the Great Flower asked. &quot;I was thinking of something a bit more ...oh I don't know... ON the mountain.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Well, I was making good time once I got myself turned towards the horizon, but I came across some roving bandits. Of course I had to kill them. Then rest. I was on my way again when I came across some marauding Gnolls. Obviously I couldn't let them live, so I killed them. Then I rested. Once I got going again I came across a ferocious horde of fluffy baby ducks and ... well, you get the idea.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Yes I see.&quot; said the Great Flower. &quot;Well, good job ridding the land of evil ... and ... ahem ... cute little duckies. &quot; <br>
Flowerpetal immediately whipped out a half eaten roll of Mentos® and beamed a cocky smile at the Great Flower. <br>
     &quot;Yeah, right. That was cute ...once. Let's just wait and see how the others fared, sassy boy.&quot; <br>
<br>
After about three more hours had passed a small speck appeared on the horizon. The speck quickly grew and came closer, revealing itself to be Sdaasiil. Sdaasiil leisurely sauntered into town and stopped in front of the Great Flower. <br>
He sniffed over at Flowerpetal and said, &quot;Let me guess, did tubby here get mixed up and jump in the ocean?&quot; <br>
     &quot;No, I brought a flower.&quot; Flowerpetal piped up. <br>
     &quot;A flower? What a suck up you are.&quot; Sdaasiil snorted. <br>
Sdaasiil looked up at the great flower and reached in his pack. From it he pulled an evergreen branch and laid it at the Great Flowers feet. <br>
     &quot;Ok, look. This is a branch from a type of tree that grows about a third of the way up the mountain. Now I know it's not much, but I would have gotten further if I hadn't ... hadn't been ...&quot; Sdaasiil's stammer turned to silence. <br>
The Great Flower looked at him quizzically. &quot;Hadn't been what?&quot; the Great Flower asked. <br>
Sdaasiil gathered himself and spoke. &quot;If I hadn't been overrun by a retreating horde of fluffy baby ducks. It was horrible, they just kept running over me, biting me as they went. They were afraid of something. I've never seen baby ducks afraid of ANYthing! Their raging tempers were only fueled by their fear. They just kept coming and coming! A snarling, peeping wall of yellow terror! Oh the horror!&quot; <br>
Sdaasiil collapsed exhausted at the feet of the great flower. <br>
     &quot;I told you.&quot; Flowerpetal said matter-of-factly to the Great Flower. <br>
     &quot;Oh shush, you.&quot; the Great Flower snapped at Flowerpetal. <br>
     &quot;You have done well Sdaasiil, considering the circumstances. This branch is a fine trophy.&quot; the Great Flower said as he consoled Sdaasiil and offered him a beer. <br>
<br>
Many more hours passed as twilight danced across the sky. Torches were lit and dinner was served at the festival. Someone screamed at the edge of the gathering and the assembled Flower Jihaders jumped into action, preparing for a fight. <br>
     &quot;Woah, chill out!&quot; a shout from the darkness came. The guild members held in place as a figure stepped from the shadows. The firelight from the torches played across Eloquinn's face as he moved into the light. <br>
     &quot;Sorry about the scream, but Elo pinched my ass.&quot; Branwen said as she turned and backhanded Eloquinn in the chest. Eloquinn snickered as he rubbed his chest. He moved over to the Great Flower and reached into his pack. He handed the Great Flower a small bush. <br>
Eloquinn began &quot;This is a shrubbery...&quot; <br>
     &quot;NI!&quot; came a cry from the crowd. <br>
     &quot;Shhhh.&quot; replied another voice. <br>
     &quot;A shrubbery from the side of the mountain, where vegetation grows sparse.&quot; Eloquinn continued. &quot;I had to wrestle it away from a tired and wheezing baby duck. Tired as he was, he put up quite a fight. I finally had to use my musical abilities to subdue him. I hit him with my drum.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Very good.&quot; said the Great Flower. &quot;You almost made it to the top of the mountain. What stopped you?&quot; <br>
     &quot;I broke my drum.&quot; Eloquinn stated. <br>
The Great Flower looked at him quizically. Eloquinn rolled his eyes and continued, &quot;Do you really think I'm gonna run my ass up some mountain with no Selo's Accelerando? I think not.&quot; Eloquinn responded. He then went over to Branwen and sat down. <br>
     &quot;That leaves only one left.&quot; proclaimed the Great Flower. <br>
<br>
Many more hours had passed as the festival went well into the night. As the revelries began to die down and most gave up hope for the final contestant, the Great Flower gathered the Flower Jihaders around himself. <br>
     &quot;Well my friends, it looks as if everyone who is going to return, has returned. Before everyone goes home for the night I think it's time to announce a winner. Since Eloquinn so bravely wrestled a shrubbery from a tired, albeit vicious baby duck, high atop the mountain, I declare him...&quot; <br>
     &quot;HOLD IT!&quot; a voice boomed from somewhere. The crowd parted to reveal Ryshat, standing defiantly in the center of the gathering. <br>
     &quot;I think I'm the man you're looking for.&quot; exclaimed Ryshat. <br>
     &quot;Oh really Ryshat? Please, do tell.&quot; the Great Flower said. &quot;I don't see you carrying anything?&quot; <br>
     &quot;I have been to the top of the mountain, where nothing can grow on it's rocky face. I have seen the whole of Norrath laid out before me. I have seen the sun set on the mountains in the distance. New mountains, representing new challenges. Each one bigger than the last. It has taught me that though our journey will forever continue, there will be mountain highs and valley lows and there will always be beauty and enjoyment to be had.&quot; <br>
The crowd stood in stunned silence. Applause from the crowd grew slowly and eventually became a wave of sound. The guild members picked Ryshat up on their shoulders and carried him around in triumph, whooping and hollering. Eventually things quieted down and the Great Flower was able to speak. <br>
     &quot;Well done small warrior. You have proven you are indeed the man I am looking for.&quot; <br>
Ryshat beamed a smile and looked around at the crowd. <br>
     &quot;EXCEPT ...&quot; continued the Great Flower. &quot;For the fact that in the rather staggering start of the race, I watched you stagger yourself right into that tavern over there. Jeez, I could even hear you belching and laughing from way the hell over here.&quot; Ryshat looked around again at the stunned crowd, their mouths agape in astonishment. He shifted uneasily from side to side, looked up at the Great Flower, and cleared his throat. <br>
     &quot;I brought you a keg.&quot; he timidly said as he produced a wooden barrel from behind his back and held it up to the Great Flower. <br>
The Great Flower stared him long and hard. A small smile formed at the corners of his mouth and spread across his face. <br>
     &quot;DUDE, THOU ROCK!&quot; the Great Flower exclaimed. &quot;You sure know how to bullshit. I think I have found the right man for the job.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Thank Tunare.&quot; said Ryshat with relief in his voice. &quot;No way in hell was I going into those mountains with all those ravenous baby ducks roaming about. That is one little yellow blood bath I could do without.&quot; <br>
     &quot;How about a regular bath? Ever considered one of those?&quot; the Great Flower joked as he poked Ryshat in the ribs. <br>
<br>
After sharing a laugh with Ryshat and wiping flecks of beer foam from his face, the Great Flower stood and proclaimed to the assembled masses, <br>
     &quot;From this day forth, the voice of the Great Flower shall be known as Ryshat. From his lips will pass my wisdom.&quot; At which point Ryshat let loose with a rather reverberating belch. <br>
<br>
     &quot;Dude, say it, don't spray it.&quot; the Great Flower responded.<br>

He strolled along enjoying the peaceful view. Ryshat savored these moments out of doors, since he was not one of those Dwarves who liked to live underground. Open skies and fresh air were what called out to him. Besides, there isn't much air that COULDN'T be considered fresh after living in the damp caves of Kaladim with dwarves who rarely bathed and had a rather &quot;combustible&quot; diet. <br>
<br>
He enjoyed the smell of the knotty pines, the song of the birds, and the perpetual shamble of decaying skeletons. Yes, over time he had come to accept the perambulatory habits of his fallen comrades. &quot;Old friendships die hard,&quot; they say in Kaladim. &quot;Old friends die harder still.&quot; It was not unusual for Ryshat to spy an old deceased friend of his shambling through the woods, apparently intent on getting somewhere in a hurry. These rotting, decaying husks of dwarves were always rushing off to somewhere or another, but were always quick with a laugh or to share some &quot;love taps&quot; with an old comrade. Ryshat had spent many happy days in his youth trading blows with his moldering buddies, but now had found that he had outgrown that pastime. <br>
<br>
He now spent his time in the woods, enjoying the uninhibited &quot;naturalness&quot; of it all. Short of actually hugging a tree or foraging for cabbage, some might actually mistake him for a druid. Ryshat shuddered at that thought, of a life of scampering through the woods all nekkid like while picking berries and kissing bears. In Ryshat's mind, the only thing bears were good for were to put his sword in for safe keeping while looking for bigger things to whomp on. <br>
<br>
As Ryshat wandered along, pondering the possible benefits of being able to teleport on top of a giant's head to deliver a killing blow, he heard a voice call out to him. <br>
     &quot;Hello Ryshat.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ryshat stopped in his tracks and looked around. A little further down the trail sat the Great Flower, cross-legged on a stump. <br>
     &quot;Whaaaasssuuuppp!&quot; Ryshat heartily greeted the Great Flower. &quot;What you doin'?&quot; <br>
     &quot;Just sittin on a stump. Waitin' for you, bud.&quot; <br>
     &quot;True. True.&quot; Ryshat replied. <br>
     &quot;It is time to begin your education young Dwarf. If you are to be the leader of the Flower Jihad, there is much you must learn.&quot; the Great Flower told Ryshat. <br>
     &quot;Oh jeez. This is exactly the reason I'm not a magic user. All that book learnin' and nonsense.&quot; Ryshat replied. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower led Ryshat down the trail a little further. Eventually they stopped and the Great Flower went off of the path and started off through the forest. They walked for a while until they came upon a clearing. Ryshat's eyes adjusted as he emerged from the dark forest into the sunny meadow. In the middle of the meadow he saw a grand building, towering into the shy. Elegant wood carvings adorned the building and vines entwined throughout the lattice work to create a building that was imposing as well as warm and inviting. <br>
     &quot;What is this place?&quot; Ryshat queried. <br>
     &quot;It is the Great Guild Hall of the Gods. You have been brought here to learn what it means to be a leader.&quot; the Great Flower said in a very ominous voice. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower led Ryshat up to the guild hall and pushed open the massive doors. Inside Ryshat saw hundreds of tables, with even more hundreds of people eating dinner. There were great heaps of nachos on the tables and kegs of beer and wine flowing from the ceiling. Everyone seemed to be having a grand old time, laughing and carousing. <br>
<br>
Until Ryshat looked more closely. What at first seemed to be general merriment turned out to be frustration and anguish (Ryshat was not know for being very observant). Every person in the Great Guild Hall had a spoon with a ten foot handle to eat with. The diners could easily scoop up food with the spoon, but try as they might they could not bring the ends of the spoons to their mouths. Some tried stretching their arms as far as they could while others tried bracing their arms on the table for leverage. Food spilled, eyes were poked, and tempers were running high. <br>
     &quot;This is terrible. No one is getting what they want and everyone is getting upset and frustrated.&quot; exclaimed Ryshat. <br>
     &quot;What do you think should be done?&quot; the Great Flower queried. <br>
     &quot;I'm not sure. Eat with their hands?&quot; Ryshat answered. <br>
     &quot;Well ... no. That's not quite the answer I was looking for.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Uh.. oh! I know! They should grip the spoons closer to the head. Make the spoons closer to their mouths!&quot; Ryshat said very excitedly, as if he had figured out the answer to a great riddle. <br>
     &quot;Hmmmm. Well, no. I'm sorry. That won't work.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Yes it would. Here, let me show you.&quot; Ryshat said as he headed to a table and started to pick up a spoon. <br>
     &quot;No, no, no. Not like that. I'm trying to teach you something here.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Well, ok. But I still think holding the spoon...&quot; <br>
     &quot;Stop it! That's not what I'm talking about. Follow me.&quot; At which point the Great Flower led Ryshat into another room of the Great Dining Hall. <br>
<br>
In this room Ryshat saw more people eating. Each one of them had ten foot spoons, but something was different this time. Everyone was using their ten foot spoon to feed each other. Everyone was paired off and getting food on their spoon to feed to the person across from them. The Great Flower looked down at Ryshat and beamed a smile. <br>
     &quot;See Ryshat. This is what I wanted to teach you.&quot; <br>
     &quot;What, how to spread germs? Ewww. I won't let anyone drink out of my flask much less eat off my silverware.&quot; Ryshat said with a disgusted look on his face. <br>
The Great Flower continued with great exasperation, &quot;No... look at them Ryshat. They are using teamwork. Everyone gets what they need because everyone works together.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Hmmm. Good point. I see what you mean. Working alone may work occasionally, but to truly get a fulfilling experience, you need to be able to depend on others.&quot; <br>
     &quot;Exactly.&quot; The Great Flower said with great satisfaction. <br>
<br>
Ryshat and the Great Flower looked at each other. A feeling of understanding passed between them. The Great Flower felt confident in his abilities to teach this rather thick dwarf how to be a great leader. <br>
     &quot;Hey, can we go in the other room now and I can show you what I was saying about choking up the grip on the spoon?&quot; <br>
The Great Flower rolled his eyes and said, &quot;I think a better idea is to get out of here before you start a food fight.&quot; <br>
     &quot;A food fi...? GREAT IDEA! Hang on.&quot; Ryshat exclaimed as he headed for the biggest pile of drippy, gooey nachos he could see. <br>
<br>
The Great Flower grabbed Ryshat by the scruff of the neck before he could do any damage and dragged him out of the guild hall. <br>
     &quot;Jeez. And I thought you were supposed to be a fun God.&quot; Ryshat said with the demeanor of a petulant child. <br>
     &quot;I think I've had enou ... er ... you've learned enough today young dwarf. I'll let today's lesson sink in and we shall learn more at a later time.&quot; <br>
<br>
With this the Great Flower spread wide his petals and disappeared into the heavens in a blinding flash of light. <br>
<br>
As Ryshat sat there in the clearing, pondering what he had been taught, he heard a cackle off in the distance. <br>
     &quot;I'd know that laugh anywhere. That must be Stumpwater Jack! He must have died ... oh ... at least three years ago. I should go over and beat the crap out of him for old times sake.&quot; <br>
<br>
And at that, Ryshat headed off into the woods, secure in the knowledge he would be a great leader of men. Or at least a great hitter of things.<br>
