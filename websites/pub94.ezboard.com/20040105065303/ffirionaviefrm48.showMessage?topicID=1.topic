Ok, there are some idiots (aren't there always) and there are many things that we would all like to see done to the ruleset, but these are minor problems in my opinion. If you're looking for a bit of a change and a challenge, and want to find an relaxed atmosphere, then FV is the place for you.<br>

Some of the best I've ever seen. Gyrhawk, above,is one of my favorites, even though I wwon't have much interaction with him now, unless we fight.<br>
<br>
The game is completely different here. I honestly believe that. With the ruleset(all of them), it makes for a brand new game, and for lots of room for really great character development.<br>
*shrug* I'm here for the duration. I love this place. <p><center><b><A href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner"><font color="#710672" face="Black Chancery" size="-1">Sarhea </font></a>

Read here first</span><hr size=1>  I have moved several times in the past. I started playing on Quellious almost 2 years ago as a wood elf ranger. I think I made everymistake possible, including not really knowing the game before I gave up and decided to atart over on the next new server. I was always looking for something rather ellusive.<br>
 On the Luclin server I thought I had found what it was I was missing. Purpose. So, I set out to recreate a guild I had started in UO there. Well, one good reason I left UO was because I had burnt out as a GM, all work and no play they say... So another move  this one to Torv. That was around the time Kunark went live.I was always expecting to find the magic answer to my purpose goal, always thought hey lets see if I can find it here.. I always found greedy, self centered, non-roleplaying folk who would rather farm Crushbone belts than help someone out in even the smallest way.<br>
 On Thouluxe I came close, 8 levels close. But with the ultimate prrize that close the best guild I have ever been apart of crumbled around us, founding members gone off to greener pastures which soone enough withered there as well.I knew or thought I knew most of the reasoning behind the fall, and when I heard that the RP server was finally being made I knew this would be my home. <br>
 I have roleplayed more here in 7 days played then all of the 50 plus hours on all other characters I have ever played. There are fine folks I have never intereacted with here because as an elf I simply do not understand them. I am sure there are some royal pains here, but there are not too many of anykind and those who are will have to suffer their own company as they advance, I will not put up with them here.<br>
 There are alot of really good folk here and this is where I can finally put down some roots.The rule set mandates planning, it rewards guilds and team work. It sets realistic linguistic obsticals in your way. It supports a world where most folks would choose to associate with their own kind. The economy is how it should be, and the challenges are greater because you have to EARN almost everything.<br>
 I can hardly stomach logging into an &quot;old&quot; server any  longer. The banded mail I where is home crafted(1st time smith), I love it here and plan on staying. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BakoFV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Ladies Leezard</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/7/02 6:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Moving to Firiona Vie?

<br>
Coming to Firiona Vie will be a very challanging task for anyone who wishes to join, You have alot of Obsticles to overcome such as Language Barrier, Trivial Loot Code, Low population. But once you get over these small problems, The Joy in wich you will feel is like no other in the game.<br>
<br>
I am not much of a Roleplayer because I am not very good at it, and in Turn I have created the only Guild who doesnt actively roleplay. We do However Try to roleplay to others outside of guild, and many members do Roleplay frequesntly. Its a joy just to walk around and talk with people because everyone is so nice and polite, This server has the greatest dencity of GOOD people as I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
So If you thinking of Joining Firiona Vie, and You like a challenge, I think this would be the place you want to be. The Reward of this server as your character as a person, Will be 10 fold the difficult journey you have to travel. <p>Bako Emberfist<BR>

Leglios, we have to have met at some point, I ended up quitting luclin after being made guild leader when the old leader quit and moved on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
It is very important to keep in mind the TLC when you start a character on FV.  Quests should really be done in the levels that they are meant to be done, this, and many of the other rules will hamper your leveling speed.. But thats part of why you are here isn't it?<br>
<br>
Languages too, require a substantial amount of time and thought.  I reccomend finding a friend or group of friends to play with early on.  Religiously work on languages, every hour, or every zone, get taught a point of something, anything.  I expect it will be well into the 50's before I am fluent in everything I want to be.<br>
<br>
The server is filled with friendly, helpful, roleplaying types.  The few times I have run into a dewd, I just switch to another language and type a bunch of question marks and /boggle /nod /smile and /em shakes his head in bemusement.  End of problem.  <br>
<br>
The lack of a real player market does hurt.  Prices seem to be lower in general though, if you can find what you want.  Maybe because the plat is distributed more evenly.  If you really want something you will have to post on the market here, and hope that the 2% of players that also read message boards has what you want, otherwise plan on camping it yourself or with friends. <br>
<br>
I am guild shy, being twice or is it thrice bitten, but I have mostly heard good abhout the guilds I have read about, even the &quot;ubers&quot;, we will see how that develops though, as the big crowd hits the 50's, maybe 6 months from now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...<br>

The lack of 7 other characters full of places to stash items mean that the pixel collectors stay home, and the people who play are here for the exploration and the company.  The fact that you have only one character also means you tend to be more recognizable as well - there are not 8 incarnations of &quot;you&quot; to confuse the issue.<br>
<br>
I think as well the low numbers has a small town effect. As you are not continually crowded and jostled, it is much easier to be friendly to the people you do meet.  Guilds are smaller and less people get lost in the cracks.  You do however as a result have to plan your activities more, you cant just count on going to a zone and joining in with people already there.<br>
<br>
And most of all I love that when I role play people do not look as if I have sprouted a second head and begun to babble <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

There are a few weird things that may be bugs, but the ruleset has made the game &quot;more realistic&quot;.<br>
<br>
1.  All classes can bind only in towns.  It never made sense (for me) to have different bind rules for melee vs. caster.  It never made sense for a caster to reincarnate in a non-friendly zone.<br>
<br>
2.  No common language.  Although the merchants seem to be masters at all languages, even the language of the races they abhor.  The language barrier is a very realistic aspect of roleplaying.<br>
<br>
3.  Trivial Loot Code.  You'll find my arguments in this forum.  I just wish they took it away from quest-component and tradeskill-component items (and the only thing preventing them from fixing those is the amount of time it would require).<br>
<br>
4.  Alignments.  I like this A LOT!  It certainly reinforces the view that the dieties of Norrath have a far more active hand in the characters' lives.  It doesn't matter if a paladin fell in love with a shadowknight, they can't hunt together because the gods prevent them from doing so!<br>

Quit about a year ago, tried AO, got fed up with the bugs and decided to try EQ again.  First thing I did was peruse the server boards for the smaller servers.  FV seemed to have the most fun people and that's why I'm here.<br>
<br>
Second thing, of course, is the new ruleset.  In some ways it's an impediment to both normal play and role-play.  In other ways, it likely contributes to keeping this server small.  Small is very good.  It means no one can be anonymous for long and thus griefers won't like it here.  'Course it also makes it hard to form pickup-groups.  I'd say that if you don't plan on joining a guild sometime before your class hits it's personal &quot;solo-wall&quot;, FV probably isn't for you.<br>
<br>
In general, FV brings back memories of how EQ was just weeks after release.  Everyone at least makes a stab at role-playing and people here mostly want to have fun grouping together rather than rushing like mad lemmings from one hot-loot spot to the next.  Read the rule-set on Verant's web site and if the deviations from normal servers sounds tolerable to you, come try FV.  It's a lot of fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/13/02 8:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Do you have questions about how to learn a language here?</span><hr size=1> Well then, you're not alone!

The language barrier alone makes learning the game from within the game extremely difficult, and learning any other language usually requires you to be at least level 9 to understand most anything.  Add to that the low population and the tendency to speak in roleplay (vice speaking OOC) makes it that much more difficult.  Complete strangers will not twink you at the Kelethin newbie lift like on the other servers.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, Firiona Vie has plenty to offer those who willing to put up with a little difficulty.  Most ogres and trolls that practice d00d-speak don't bother other races simply because they don't speak the same language.  Roleplaying is something that other players look up to, rather than look down on, and will spontaneously join in on just for the fun of it.  And the market on Firiona Vie is, in my opinion, more friendly for those who wish to tradeskill for profit at the lower end.  Not always a great profit, but still better than what i've seen on Cazic-Thule.<br>

If you do play Firiona Vie, don't complain about the different rulesets, enjoy them! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zaremonk>Zaremonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/11/02 6:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Not for most newbies</span><hr size=1> I enjoy the roleplaying, and I go on with it and everything, but most of all, I love that you can only have one character per account on thise server!

<br>
as many above, i came to Firiona Vie for the roleplay. And to be honest, i am both surprised and disappointed. Surprised at the amount and quality of roleplay i find, and disappointed since there seem to be many who just dont care... or dont do it.<br>
Dont get me wrong - everyone can play there, but i wonder why people who dont even attempt to roleplay.<br>
Luckily, those are few.<br>
<br>
I agree with most posts before. Newbies will find Firiona Vie a lot more difficult than other blue servers. On the other hand, it is also more interesting. There are very few zones which give a similar feel as they do on other servers. It is a rare thing not to find something suitable to hunt, at least once you realized what you *can* hunt safely.<br>
<br>
Language barriers, alignment barriers, trade restriction and the lack of &quot;alts&quot; on the same server all place a higher value on things you obtain or do yourself. It is an experience, and one i personally enjoy a lot.<br>
<br>
Friends are also a lot more valuable in my eyes. The chance of running into a zone and finding a group just by shouting or adding the LFG tag is low (At least for my dark elf it rarely works). Finding friends can be a pain - but  the ones you do find tend to stick around a lot more than on 'normal' blue server. They most likely are just as glad having you as friend, as you are to have them.<br>
<br>
There is a lot less twinking, and yes, a lot less farming too, because the player market is a lot more difficult to handle. I rather like that. It makes special items special. Not every second necromancer runs around with a harvester (Just an example - i dont know if they do truly). I personally did not manage to sell a single piece of equipment, and rarely am able to purchase anything.<br>
<br>
So, my bottom line is - If you look for a challenge, roleplay, and having a good time with others who do the same, Firiona Vie might be for you. If you look for an uber guild, fast leveling, the best possible equipment, you'd probably be better off somewhere else. <br>

In fact, I never even touched *ANY* MMORPG before and started out right here. And I feel perfectly at home already, and am considering putting all my characters that developed around Lunaire in face-to-face and play-by-email roleplaying onto that server. Why? Because it's fun. Because there seems to be space for a Tolaris Sterling, for the Ceillune family, and a few others to live and develop. Because there are roleplayers around. All the difficulties make it just that much more rewarding in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/29/02 8:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The charms of FV ?</span><hr size=1> In all seriousness, if you're starting off the game straight out, I recommend starting a druid on another server first, and doing it for 15 seasons or so, in other words, not long enough in order to get attached to it.  It will help you get a feel for the environment of the game, the spells, the system of travel, the expectations, in an environment where you're extremely likely to be twinked from birth.  In other words, you can learn the ropes, basic grouping skills, and anything else, such as corpse running, in a place where you can most likely get help easily through /ooc.  Of course, if you're confident, have read the manual cover to cover, then by all means, dive straight in.  There's a nice community of people here that are more than willing to help you.<br>
<br>
If you chose to take the druid leg-up way of getting to learn the game, after you've had your dose of the normal blue, come to Firiona Vie.  You'll be more than pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alyndrael>alyndrael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/23/02 5:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm48.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The charms of FV ?</span><hr size=1> The following is mostly ooc because I have no clue how to role play and come begging help so that my Norrathian friend can flourish in your homeland.<br>
<br>
Since July, have played on Torv - highest alt 46. Have 2 accounts but rarely 2 box. Was always interested in <br>
D&amp;D but knew no one who played. My alts have a story line, are related in some fashion and I do a dab of rp with guildmates and the odd stranger.<br>
<br>
I have been surfing this board because my lvl 6 alt is a blast - on FV. I haven't settled on a story or even which class to stick to so no introductions as yet.<br>
<br>
I have gathered that role playing is very individual, complex and that no hard rules exist. It seems I should just slowly step into it, develop my story and character, etc.<br>
<br>
But....I know no one and starting a troll means the zone is usually deserted, lol. In real life, no one I knows does roleplay of any kind. I know there is a trade channel but I hesitate to ask for rp tips on it. Is there an in game channel where rp questions could be asked? Is there some place, in or out of game, a complete fledgeling like me could go?<br>
<br>
How does one use the emotes? I know the fun stuff (salute, dance, sighs over his wounds) but is there more? Are they only for actions that our graphics can't render? Can other things be expressed?<br>
<br>
Is there a way to signal that I am a newbie in rp terms? And that I'm eager for some rp experience to strengthen my skills?<br>
<br>
I want more than - you are Evil/Good and I must duel you. While I will probably never develop a complex story and journal it, I want more than exp grind and tradeskills, sigh.<br>
<br>
Forgot to ask....is there a list of links to find more information on the history and gods of Norrath? I have access to the pok books and the bit of god information on sony's site.<br>
<br>
Thanks and back to browsing the posts,<br>

<br>
there will be i want to duel u cause yer a &quot;fill-in-blank&quot;, and some ppl can be mean to a race but its roleplay so if it was real it would prob happen. but dont worry about that cause it is so fun on this server.<br>
<br>
as for starting a troll do it cause u will only a few, but it was well worth it. hehe be a troll beastlord, i made one on sullen zek and even though a stupid druid would come and dot me and then run like a pansy, it was still fun. if i had another account i would have a troll beastlord.<br>
<br>
just listen to other roleplay, but u will need to learn languages cause all u will kno is troll and dark speech, there is no common.<br>
<br>
what i did for roleplay was make a little background then build on it, u can be a mute or a really dumb troll or even an advanced troll brought by high elves or even humans. just make something small. there are guilds in here that do not roleplay and they are boring cause come on, why come to this server if u have no interest in roleplay right. the roleplay is what i kept here anyway, even sence i havent been on for a long time. i still want to play back on this server.<br>
<br>
i hope i helped u in some way, have fun if u think its for u.<br>

I had given up on EQ as I had on every other game played. This was due to the usual greedy buggers with nothing better to do than waste both thier and my time. The game was fun, but the enviroment was lacking and boring.  After a six month reprive, I needed a fix. I came back to find FV, a supposed Roleplaying Server. In my opinion, there has never been a better fantasy enviroment for somebody wanting to RP.<br>
<br>
I have met an amazing bunch of people, all of which roleplay thier characters. Some better than others, but it is the attempt that matters to me. I am truelly dissapointed when I run across somebody on this server that does not care to make the attempt. This does not happen very often, thank goodness.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in joining our community, but are concerned about how well you roleplay, quit worrying. Most of the people I know feel as I do, it is the attempt that counts. You will get better with practice.<br>
<br>
As for this being a difficult place to learn the game....<br>
If you are a roleplayer at heart, you should find alot of people to help you out. You just need to ask, in character of course, and I would be very suprised if you not only learn what you need, but you will probably make some friends along the way. It is true you may learn faster on a normal server, but you will learn how to not enjoy the game as well.<br>
<br>
All in all, I have found a home and plan to stay. Thank you everyone who has made this possible.<br>
