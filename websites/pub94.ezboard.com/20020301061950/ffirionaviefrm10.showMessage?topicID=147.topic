The howling of gnolls. A slashing of claws. A lion's roar. A splash of red. Darkness.<br><br>-----<br><br>*tick tock tick tock*<br><br>Kais awoke slowly, roused by the loud sounds of gnomish clockwork.<br><br>It felt like he had fallen down the cliffs outside his home of Shar Vahl. Every bone in his body ached. Especially his left arm.<br><br>The last thing he could remember was a glorious battle with his most hated enemies, the gnolls of the Torn Ear tribe. Over a dozen lay dead at his feet before they had finally overcome him. But where was he now? This certainly wasn't what he thought the afterlife would be like at all.<br><br>The smells of grease, alcohol, and many other unknown items assaulted his sensitive nostrils. The room was dark, but his keen eyes allowed him to take in his surroundings.<br><br>He was laying on a cold, hard metal slab. A table cluttered with tools and odd looking devices stood against one wall. Cables, gears, and shelves full of boxes lined another wall. On the opposite side of the room was a small metal door, light from the outside slipping underneath.<br><br>Sitting up, Kais slammed his head into the ceiling. &quot;Rowrrrl!&quot; he growled loudly.<br><br>It dawned on him where he was. This must be a gnomish tinker's workshop! But why in the world would he be here instead of sharing drinks with the spirits of his dead ancestors? <br><br>From the other side of the door Kais could hear the sound of clanging footsteps. They stopped just outside of the door, a figure obscuring the light slipping under the door. A number of latches popped open on the door and it swung open. Standing in the doorway was a clockwork gnome.<br><br>*tick tock* &quot;It is good to see you awake,&quot; the clockwork said in a mechanical tone. It stepped through the door way and began to activate small flameless lanterns around the room. &quot;I will notify the master that you are awake. Please wait here.&quot;<br><br>Kais watched as the clockwork hurried out of the room. How odd that he would be in a tinker's workshop and not at a healer. Suddenly, the weight of the situation hit him.<br><br>With the new light of the room, Kais was horrified at what he saw. His left arm was made of gnomish clockwork!<br><br>&quot;Ah ha... so the big cat finally returns to the land of the living, eh?&quot; A cheerful gnome strode into the workshop. &quot;I'm Nidbin, one of the many master tinkers of Ak'Anon.&quot; Kais didn't even give the gnome a glance. He was completely absorbed in looking over his arm.<br><br>&quot;I, ah,  see ya've already noticed yer new arm. One of my finest creations I tell ya,&quot; the gnome beamed with a smile. &quot;Although ya don't look like yer too happy to even have an arm.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What... what happened?&quot; Kais held up his new arm. &quot;Tell me now how this... this thing happened to me.&quot;<br><br>Nibdin turned a bit more serious and took a seat at his workbench.<br><br>&quot;Ya were found over by the druid shrine not too far from Ak'Anon. Some of the younger gnomes hunting nearby brought ya here.&quot; Nidbin chuckled slightly. &quot;It was quite a sight seeing half dozen gnomes and small elemental companions dragging ya through the Steamfont.&quot;<br><br>&quot;After much debate at the gates, ya were brought inside of Ak'Anon to see if there was anything we could do for ya. Unfortunately, ya kinda came at a bad time.&quot;<br><br>Kais looked over at the gnome. &quot;A bad time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, all of our finest clerics and healers are on journeys to and from Ak'Anon. The guild masters are all in Felwithe fer some cleric meeting or something. Yer arm was mangled up pretty bad and there was nothing our young cleric apprentices could do other than keep ya alive. Ole King Ak'Anon gave us tinkers a nod to test out our new clockwork arm on you.&quot;<br><br>Kais sighed heavily.<br><br>&quot;Yer lucky to even be alive, um... what's yer name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kais. My name is Kais.&quot;<br><br>The gnome chuckled. &quot;Ah, Kais. Yer the one that wily rogue, err... I mean cleric, Sabbik talked with us about.&quot;<br><br>The mention of his gnome hunting companion brought a long overdue smile to Kais' face.<br><br>&quot;Anyways, ya should be honored to have that arm. It's one of kind and I think ya'll find it most useful.&quot; Nidbin picked up a tool and walked over to the Vah Shir.<br><br>&quot;Well, I am grateful for my life. I thank you and your kind for that.&quot; Kais examined the clockwork arm again. It seemed that the tinker had done what he could to minimize the odd look of the arm. A coat of white lacquer coated the arm in an attempt to match Kais' white fur. It even had black stripes.<br><br>&quot;I'm not an artist,&quot; Nidben commented. &quot;I tried to make it look like a part of ya, but there is only so much ya can do when it comes to machines.&quot;<br><br>Kais smiled. &quot;It looks fine. Just will take some getting used too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, this is much better than any arm on anyone ever was.” The tinker grinned from ear to ear. “Just wait til I show ya what it can do.&quot;<br><br>Curious about the capabilities of his new arm, Kais brought his fist down hard towards the workbench. The metal bench creaked and clanged in protest, giving way to the force of the hit.<br><br>The small gnome cringed at the sight of his now dented workbench. &quot;I suppose we'll have to make a few small adjustments before I let ya loose again.&quot;<br><br>Kais chuckled at the gnome. This clockwork arm would take some getting used too. A metal arm is better than no arm. Not too mention that fact that if he was still alive, then the spirits had a reason.<br><br>Hopefully he would find out that reason someday soon. <p><TABLE>	<TR>		<TD>			<IMG SRC = "http://www.clanrav.net/tatanka/images/SharVahl_Logo.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="90" BORDER="0" ALIGN="left">		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="225">			<IMG SRC="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/classes/c_warrior.gif" HEIGHT="90" WIDTH="36" BORDER="0" ALIGN="left"><BR>			<FONT FACE="verdana" SIZE="-1">			<A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=117314" TARGET="_kais"><B><U><I>Kais Ratahl</B></U></I></A><BR>			35th Rank Khala Dun<BR>			The Clockwork Tiger<BR>			Firiona Vie<BR>			</FONT>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhatha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/4/02 1:23:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=147.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Clockwork Tiger</span><hr size=1> Ratha looks up from the parchment he is reading, and stares at the wall for a while.
