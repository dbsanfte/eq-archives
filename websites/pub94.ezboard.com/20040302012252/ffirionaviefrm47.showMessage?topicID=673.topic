<br>
I am a rising magician from the grand capital of Odus, who is just now earning her keep in the lands. I have learned a great deal by travelling and adventuring on my own, although magicians are never truly alone.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :thumb --><img src=http://www.spacespider.net/emo/thumbsup.gif ALT=":thumb"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However, I  am starting to recognize the need for family and friendship and have a burning desire to help others achieve their goals and attain happiness.<br>
<br>
I am a fast learner and am from a wealthy family so I seek no hand me downs or training, just a group with whom to share adventures with and explore new parts of the world that I would never see by my lonesome.  I have learned that there is nothing more satisfying than to help others acheive what they desire in the world of Norrath.  It is the only thing that brings happiness to this Erudite's face.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
<br>
Lady Kimberly<br>
Of the Gate Callers<br>

<br>
Hi everyone. Kimberly was born on October 21, 2001, a long long time ago when the server first opened.  I only played her a little but then moved back to my main character (a cleric) on my server's resident end game guild until I decided to retire shortly before PoP came out. (I have experience in all zones and fights up to Shei, Cursed, Emperor and Seru pre-POP).<br>
 <br>
As a player I learned a long time ago that getting a good drop isn't nearly as fun as helping out someone else, and from the general feel of the community I believe a lot of you feel that way.<br>
<br>
I'm leveling steadily, but am enjoying a relaxed pace. I have sufficient gear and am not looking for any kind of 'twinking' or 'powerleveling' as I am trying to learn my new class as best I can with the means at my disposal. (/thank join mage and Jarlork in particular)<br>
<br>
I think its best to learn about guilds based on the members of that guild and how they act in game while grouping with them, but I am afraid at my lower level (mid 20s now) I will not meet enough people to make a sound judgement.<br>
<br>
I am more than willing to level up to a required level but in the meantime would like to do some research on guilds that are a decent size ( I find a good sized guild tends to more grouping possibilities), who values roleplaying (why else would you be on Firiona Vie?) and who raids regularly but does not focus exlcusively on raiding, and generally is at the HateFear/Kunark/early Velious level of the game since that is where I will be soon and am very comfortable with.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if I can be of service to your guild and feel free to send me a /tell in game. I love meeting new people and will always answer a call for help.<br>
<br>
Thanks ever so much for reading.<br>
<br>
Kim<br>
<br>

<br>
One of my friends on the Erudin High Council (whom you'll understand I may not name) recently passed along word from Markus Jaevins that one of his students was seeking a new &quot;family&quot; to keep her company and join in her adventures as she traveled the world.  I hope that I may be able to help you in this regard.<br>
<br>
I am a knight of Quellious, and servant of the Temple of Divine Light.  I have been in this world since the first day that the High Council allowed us to leave and seek our fortunes.  Fondly do I recall those early days, and it may even be that long ago we fought side-by-side.  Alas, time moves ever on, and our world changes.  I meet fewer and fewer citizens of Erudin in my travels, and cherish the opportunities when they arise.<br>
<br>
However, there are many other good and caring people in the world, and I am proud to say that I represent a &quot;family&quot; full of such people.  If you are interested, I invite you to stop by <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub189.ezboard.com/bringofthelight" target="top"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the guild hall of the Ring of the Light</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

Welcome Kimberly,<br>
<br>
The Court of the Crosswinds is a small to medium guild that values Roleplaying, family, and fun. We try to maintain a balance of all the things that make Norrath such a exciting place to live. We are very open and do not force any person to participate in any activity they do not wish to. We have no strict RP requirements, but we encourage staying in character for day to day conversation. We are also a good aligned guild, but allow &quot;converted&quot; evil characters that have met certain strict requirements involving faction and RP storyline. We very much value helping others and try to ensure that our interactions with people in guild and out of guild reflect that.<br>
<br>
As far as raid strength goes, the Court has members of all levels, as we have a low level requirement. However, the core of our raid force consists of people between 40-62. We have completed many of the easier epics, and are working our way toward some of the more difficult ones. We hope to be capable of venturing into the halls of testing within the next one to two months. Our scheduled events usually consist of one weekend event and one weekday smaller event. However, pickup events are fairly common for any that wish to attend. We are basically learning as we go, and take pride in accomplishing things with smaller numbers of people then is normally suggested. We are not a Zerg guild.<br>
