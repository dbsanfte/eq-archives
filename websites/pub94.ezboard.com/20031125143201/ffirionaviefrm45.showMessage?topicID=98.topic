I've never bothered with epics before, and now that I'm a cleric I think it might be worth my time.  That being said, I'm very overwhelmed by the whole thing.<br>
<br>
I'm 52, can I solo the first part?  Will it triv to me?  Should I just bring a bunch of friends to make it easier?  Whats the level cap aqua goblin?  Or the fire goblin in Sol B?<br>
<br>
I have a guide, yet... I'm still feeling overwhelmed.  And the fact that I need to go on big raids to get the stuff is also overwhelming.  I don't raid much, and when I do it's just with other people... all I do is heal.  I'm not much on setting things up.  It doesn't help that I play at odd hours.<br>
<br>
In any event, any help would be appreciated <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=521659" target="top">Lantaana Ravenflight-Click me</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=destrea>Destrea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Kiss-It-Better Queen</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/15/03 5:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/destrea/ustwo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A little advice for a cleric starting her epic?</span><hr size=1> Hiya I'm looking at starting mine too.  Lord Begurgle's room was easy to hold with our group of 4 -- most times we wouldn't need that many, but occasionally you get a swarm of adds and with KEI dropped, it was nice to be safe.  The only problem was that we camped his watery hole of boredom for 4 hours and he didn't spawn.  It was always the corrupt, and never the Lord.  We called druids for miles around to come loot their epic stuff from the corrupt.. but mine just never showed up /cry!  So get a couple of entertaining friends and be prepared to spend the night there - lol.<br>

<br>
This is what worked for me...<br>
<br>
SolA - I was about 52 when I soloed him.  Hard part is getting there and clearing.  Be prepared for a long camp.  Mine was about 19 hours (57 spawns I think).  I got friends to come in with me (1 melee about your level and you is enough to clear.  You can probably do it yourself in a pinch, but, easy with a good tank)  As part of the clearing to get there, stagger the pops in the room so you will be taking them on one at a time.  I camped in the E corner of the room next to Gimblox so I could see into room, but, not get aggro - camp just north enough to see both pops, but, not too far north cause you might get aggro from room to the north.  Go into the Gimblox room to fight when they pop so that you don't get aggro/adds from the room directly north of where you are watching from.  I do not know about TLC for Gimblox.  I have heard it is not a problem, but, after 19 hours, I was taking NO chances.  I shouted for help when he popped and a couple people I had been buffing/healing swung by to kill him for me, refused payment, and went back to doing their thing afterwards. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Something else I did at one point was brought 2 34ish friends along and healed/buffed them while they had a grand old time terrorizing that area of SolA.  There is some pretty good loot/exp for that level there and if you have a rogue, they can sell to goblin merchant nearby.  (Also reduces boredom factor if you have friends along).<br>
<br>
Aqua goblins I also did about at your level.  I had a L52 rogue and myself and he was easy.  You can solo him, but, if a couple things go wrong on you, you might get into trouble.  (My theory on epics is to take no chances.)  I pacified two around him (or PH) and pulled to the nearby island and fought it out there.  I put celestial on myself and nuked at extreme range to pull him - he will nuke you back.  Other people I know fight in water, but, I thought that was a pain and didn't bother.  Do NOT aggro deep or whatever the name of the red con is...  Bergurgle is not a green at your level, so no TLC issues.<br>
<br>
Also, get started on fragments if you ever have somebody to group with - avoid chromodracs cause they have debuffs.  Just pull the weaker stuff if possible.  Drakes are immune to stuns.  I also did shouts/auctions for looting rights - think I got one or two that way in addition to what my group killed.<br>
<br>
I have seen you on a couple raids already, there are a lot of people willing to help that you have probably met in the few raids you have already been on.  I had the same problem, I am kinda shy and not good at getting 20 plus people to help me...lol...  However, although I am not there yet, I am pretty sure at this point I have enough friends/people I have helped on epics that my time will come.  You are a very friendly, like-able person and although it is intimidating to ask for help, you will succeed at it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  Send me a tell if I am on and I will be more than happy to give advice/help if you need it.<br>

He was a long camp 4 or 5 days of 6~8 hour camps. On the upside that area is decent xp at that time. ( Note : this ring is No Drop, and can be multi quested but only at the end of the quest multi quest this with  care, ie the person has a final peice of your epic )<br>
<br>
On Bergugle, I was lucky  I always checked him when I went to my guilds arena events, and one time he was up. I've ended up finding him 3 time for various clerics and camping him for 2 more. The  tower is simple you can level pull burgugles place holder at 54 ( perhaps lower ). I've duo'd him with a 54 sk / cleric and done he's pretty easy with fear or stun I've the cleric nukes with knock back make him a bit of a pain to fight under water but he's still doable there.<br>
( His crown is droppable, so you might be able to find one for sale, or have your friends pick one up )<br>
<br>
The last thing a low 50 cleric can do in a group is get to skyfire and get your shards, this can likely be the most frustrateing part of the quest. Keep a group there, and keep auctioning / shouting/ telling anyone else in zone that you're looking for the shards, most times there are just folks soloing there for spells so the shard is useless , no drop, and not multiquestable ( well sorta again this depends on how much you trust the person )<br>
<br>
After that it's more of a guild thing as to weither or not you get your epic, or a huge level thing and you can do most of it single grouped.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rundonundodundo>Rundo Nundodundo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ghetto Cleric</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/16/03 9:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> shards</span><hr size=1> Ok yeah you can solo Gimblox and Begurgle for the start.

Oh no!! Ah hope tha Grim is no gonna make me delete EQ!!<br>
<br>
Ah soloed Bergurgle at 45 an kicked his ass. Ah used a Celestial Healin on meself twice - used lots o stuns, an Holy Mights on him to keep him from healin himself mixed wit Bash from me shield an wailed away wit me Hammer o Divinity tha had no process (don't till yer 50th season). Bastard dinna know what hit him.<br>
<br>
Fight lasted three minutes - underwater. Man an Elf - Ah was exausted!!!<br>
<br>
Ah Pacified both side gobbys then pulled Bergurgle down the passage to the two green gobbys (they won't attack or heal). Then when Bergurgle got to 10% Ah Instilled his ass an proceeded to kill him while he whined an flailed at me.<br>
<br>
Mana was at 72% and health was at 64% by t'time he fell. HA!!<br>
<br>
PS - Ah was really pissed too - Ah screwed up me first turn in - did it wrong an aggroed t'wench an had to gate out so had to go after Bergurgle two times grrrr. Don't use AoE anything when trying to kill the fire elemental  hahahahaha <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gravely>Gravely</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/03 6:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely_face_60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: shards</span><hr size=1> /comfort Elsbeth.  Hehe, my skyfire ordeal was over 2 months or so.

If you can, DO IT WHILE IT'S XP.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Seriously, it's far more demoralizing when it's all 95% green, 4% light blue and 1% dark blue, and your AA XP bar moves 2% in like 5 hours.  Don't put it off if it's not too late.<br>
<br>
King in Chardok - this part (the singed scroll) is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>droppable</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on FV.  I actually have an extra one, and I'm debating what to do with it.  Might sell, might find a deserving person who can't get guild support, who knows.<br>
<br>
No part of this quest is so hard a single group can't do it at the right levels.  So, if you are having a hard time getting people to help you, my advice is level up, and come back to it later.  Chardok is duoable at 60+ with faction (killing in droga a LOT) for an enchanter and cleric, but you have to protect the pet from having charm dispelled by the king's AE (junk buffs, can be tricky) and use pacify to get a clean pull.  Plus you have to clear 5 roamers in the hall first.  Without faction, I'm pretty confident a full group of 60+ can do it just fine, if you pull carefully on your way (pacify everything).<br>
<br>
I wrote a guide because all the guides I saw out there were either out of date or low quality or both.  Another thing I hated about the guides is they numbers of people they said were needed (mostly from being written in the Kunark era).  It might be of use, especially to people who want to do the cleric epic without huge raids.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely/epic.html">www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely/epic.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Btw, I'd say Ixiblat is probably the hardest mob to kill in the whole quest, but Ragefire is harder for people who use charm to kill stuff, since his AE dispels and there aren't really any good pets in the zone for tanking him (guardian wurms are immune now).<br>

<br>
He pulled Seeker to zone then Ranger snared Seeker while I did turn in and then all hell broke lose . . .<br>
<br>
I did turn in - Seeker turned into Plasmatic Priest and then he died like real quick - easiest kill for five 50 - 55 level group I have seen.<br>
<br>
WATCH for pull - there is a chance for tag-a-longs . . . we got a lord who decided he didn't like us going after Seeker. Pally zoned out and the Lord dropped aggro and puffed back to his resting spot WHEW<br>

I now have my Plasmatic Priest Robe<br>

Then go after Bergurgle OR raid with anyone who is willin to who is at or below 45 an go get him in Rathe Lake.<br>
<br>
The gobbys thar are easy kill at yer level but will drain yer mana quickly if yer no careful. Leave the ones on the bottom of the tower alone - They hit hard, regen quickly and offer no benefits at all. Pacify the lot - pull one at a time an kill them away from the crowd (down the east tunnel) - the two green guards won't do anything. Leave the DE npc alone - she will eat you alive.<br>
<br>
Anyway - If Berg is up - use stuns, a HoT on yerself an a 1h Divine Hammer w/Yaulp an root an shield bash (time the bash to his heals) - no sweat no strain.<br>
