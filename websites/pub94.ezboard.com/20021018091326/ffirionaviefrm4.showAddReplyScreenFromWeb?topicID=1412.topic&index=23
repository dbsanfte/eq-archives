I don't know which dwarf you're talking about, unless you mean the one that died on an island.  Had it been in the water, they could have dragged it to land, but that's about it.<br>

<br>
Guides are not allowed to Guide on their play server.  Also, think about it a sec.  No power?  If that were true, I guarentee you that 1/8 of the server would still be stuck under the world, epic pieces would be lost, corpses would be gone forever, and thus cause people to leave...<br>
<br>
Here's how Guide characters are made.  The Guide is given an account flagged as free.  They make a character normally, on their assigned server (which is not allowed to be one where they have characters), and then have a GM summon them up, and flag them as a Guide.  Yes, it's all checked on their play accounts, and they're not allowed to transfer there.<br>
<br>
Also.  Guides have to spend 6 weeks as Apprentice Guides.  If they look like they'll abuse the program, and help friends who have moved there because of them, they will be removed.  The Apprentices have no power.<br>

<br>
Damien never said Guide abuse never happened.  Unfortunately, there are very few Guides who do abuse the system.  Fortunately, these are few and far between.  Guides are screened during their Apprentice training.  Should a Guide be caught breaking the rules and policies set by Verant, such as Severine was, then the consequences are typically severe and could lead to dismissal from the Program.  One must, after all, be accountable for one's actions.<br>
<br>
I've seen both Thrads and Elli, as well as other Guides grant GM ressurections, rescue helpless players from beneath the fabric of the world, resolve camp disputes as well as KS issues.  I've seen Senior Guides grant surname changes, and do all of the above.<br>
<br>
Didi-  Elli says &quot;Thank you!!&quot; and sends a BIG HUG! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW-  Speaking of, I had an interesting conversation with Elli last night.<br>
<br>
She told me that she had come close to resigning from the Guide Program after she had read that post.  I asked her if she had really wanted to quit.<br>
<br>
She was silent for a few moments then she responded.  &quot;No.  I do not want to quit.  If I quit, then they win.  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ENJOY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> being a Guide.  I enjoy helping and interacting with the players, especially here on Firiona.  It is, after all, why I became a Guide in the first place.  I am not going to quit something I very much so enjoy doing just because a few disgruntled ex-guides, seniors, elders, and GMs want to ruin things for the rest of us.&quot; <p><p align="center"><font color="indigo" size="+1"><i>Keridwen Darkblade</font></i>

All the major guilds across most servers have this kind of support.  It's regarded as fairly normal.  As far as resolving camp and KS issues, guides can't DO anything.  They can beg and plead and yell for a GM, but if the players ignore the guide, the guide has no power to halt the KS'er.<br>
<br>
That last one happened right here on FV at the skeleton ruins epic monk camp that TLCs at level 10.  Damn TLC turning a dumb level 6 skeleton into a KS'ing free-for-all.  Guide came, told them to leave me alone, watched them swear and cuss and yell at me, KS me more, train me, etc. etc..  Guide kept telling them to stop and they ignored her.  Nothing ever happened to them.  Players have to recognize the guide as an authority in order for a guide to be effective.  GMs don't need any such approval from players.<br>
<br>
A GM can and will: kill the KS'er, summon him, rebind him in OOT, suspend him, and ban him.  I witnessed a GM do that once, though I only heard about the suspend and ban because the idiot whined about it on the boards.  God that felt good to watch.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
IMHO, guides are a waste of my time, since I typically don't petition unless I need a GM.  However, not everyone is like me in that respect.  There is a vast body of truly dumb petitions out there that make guides very necessary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udamienlogos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damien Logos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.jsspace.com/lommtwt/attackrlocke.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/20/02 12:37:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://razza.org/ephestione/Download/Pictures/Fantasy/WomenandBeasts/images/strahd.jpg width=93 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I think you'll find ..</span><hr size=1> Gaven:<br>

No.  Go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="https://guideapp.everquest.com">/guideapp.everquest.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> (or was it <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp)">/guide.everquest.com/guideapp)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and you can be one for free.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That last one happened right here on FV at the skeleton ruins epic monk camp that TLCs at level 10. Damn TLC turning a dumb level 6 skeleton into a KS'ing free-for-all. Guide came, told them to leave me alone, watched them swear and cuss and yell at me, KS me more, train me, etc. etc.. Guide kept telling them to stop and they ignored her. Nothing ever happened to them. Players have to recognize the guide as an authority in order for a guide to be effective. GMs don't need any such approval from players.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Then that Guide didn't do what they could have.  Every time they curse they could have gotten a warning.  Every time they killed an engaged mob, they could have gotten a warning.  These are official, and are added to your account.  When your account has 4, a GM comes in a bans you.  So the Guide isn't allowed to summon you, and bind you in the jail, but they can fill out the paperwork to get a GM to.<br>

1)  That doesn't seem very humble   2)  I'm sure the Guides are going to feel great, and be glad they spend their time helping out, with that sort of comment and/or attitude<br>
