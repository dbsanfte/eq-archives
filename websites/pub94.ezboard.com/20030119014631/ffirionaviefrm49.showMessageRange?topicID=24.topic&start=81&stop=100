<br>
<br>
wow how long its been sence we have seen a flame like this one.<br>
<br>
This one is only missing a few things tho....<br>
<br>
first of is HEAGAN..... where are you on this one guy?<br>
<br>
Second is a larger range of people.. weve seen consant post by sevral memers lets get some other folks in on this action.....<br>
<br>
Third not enough History.... so come on dig for things to dish out if u want to keep this post going..<br>
<br>
<br>
all kidding aside killing the Glass Dragon is a great acomplisment.  <br>
<br>
however i can understand fnf entering , HoH? what zone are we talking about, with out killing. <br>
<br>
like rolen said the Jones have it so we must.... leading reso in its semi early days in to ST wating for hrs befor any one is on to get warders... ahhhh the good times a war his bot and a a monk sitting in ST hehe.<br>
<br>
that was done by bolth sides till they were made no drop... <br>
understandable why it was done no one in reso that i saw disagreed with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
back to kidding....<br>
<br>
<br>
some nice flame starte has been thorwn out lets highlight<br>
hummm agnest fnf there has been<br>
<br>
ASs holes err i mean fnf....  was quite comical considering how fnf talked about AS in guild chat, atlest whale i was in fnf.<br>
<br>
Coin said<br>
&quot;Seeing how we are ranting here and being all unhappy again. /grin. I saw you guilded Xarpolis Dungslinger and what? 3 weeks later he sells his character. Was there a character flaw or a judgement flaw? Seems you all aquire so many who like to fling shit then run off and hide when it comes time to anti up.&quot;<br>
<br>
quite comical seeing as how some might think the requirements to get in to fnf has sliped sence the lvl 60 of no prayer of a chance of getting in.  kida perionly funny<br>
yes i know xarp was 60 but WAY back in the day.  it was said they did not let just any ass hole in... and to spare me time of rebutal and save u time... yes they let me in... but hey thats a perk of being the only 60 raidng paladin.... to save my self again i was there 3/4 the time or at least at raids as much as a regular member.<br>
<br>
Just an ingorant coment on her part Xand said this<br>
<br>
As far as the old As goes... they applied to FnF aye this is true just like the rest of us did... did they all get in FnF? ummm nope... and if I am not mistaken some also applied to Reso... Ohhhh I get it you are just miffed that they came to FnF and not Reso... thanks for clarifying that... &lt;insert rolling eyes here&gt; and as far as the flaming thing goes... I really dont recall many of FnF flaming them at all...But I may be incorrect on that one... But of course the majority of FnF typically does not go out of their way to flame others for things, We have much better things to do with our time  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reso was not miffed as far as i could see in game... tho i cant see there MB<br>
As far as applying just like the reso of us did? well that is to be in contintion....<br>
Sorry to druids on this one but....<br>
ask how your sisster xand (sp) got in.. at the time she applyed we had 3 druids at that time druids did not do much on raids with out new healing spell. DONT get me wrong i voted for bolth of yall.... HOWEVER.... in fnf there are alwse excpetions like if we NEED this cleric and her husband or cuzs sisters ants ex husband wants in to and the cleric wont join with out him. well guess what..... things are over ruled..<br>
if u doubt me on that one.. ask old mebers no longer in the guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   then look at how many droods wanted to aply but were told to &quot;keep lvling&quot; and reapply.  So sorry to bust your buble on that one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry kurley but this was a miss inforned coment<br>
&quot;Griffe - it's exactly like ST. Are you implying that your leadership didn't know that zoning an entire force into ST with one key was not &quot;working as intended&quot;? &quot;<br>
<br>
Reso had 2 keys Get it strate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AND THE TOPER AGENST FNF<br>
/drum role plz<br>
when Cataline Draagun said<br>
&quot;And what happened to your &quot;small elite guild&quot; ?? guess that didn't make it and then you woke up. where did all the good players that we all knew and respected go? they left or quit and I dont blame them one bit, I wouldnt want to absorb another guild after talking down on them openly&quot;<br>
<br>
JEEEEZZZZZZZ i thought that was the point of fnf?  why in the hell do you think you drew shuch good players? CUZ thats what good players wanted. if things were differnt and .... this is speculation.... A certin player was not booted maby histroy would have changed and fnf never lost its edge... maby thats speculation....<br>
<br>
Small fnf is not any more Elite... well i have not seen them raid but small elite they are not...<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok on to reso<br>
<br>
This will be shorter mainly cuz im tired...<br>
<br>
Hyprocritical is right<br>
Reso used STkeys same way as fnf... if i rember right Getting in to ST with one or 2 keys was disucses FAR befor it acutly append. now i know things have changed sence early may but ..... Honestly man who throws out BS that he will come back and find him self standing in?<br>
<br>
<br>
some what of a strech but<br>
<br>
Kzan said <br>
<br>
<br>
You cheated when you killed the dragon because without exploiting the PoV trial in the first place you wouldnt have had the force to do the dragon. The encounter ended with a handful of your raid force<br>
<br>
so if 1/2 the mebers did not do the intal trial take the away would you have won?<br>
/shrug not my anscer to make<br>
<br>
they keep slaming yall for getting dreadstorm<br>
if they really thought hard you could go back ti IV.... claign yall killed it but had dreadstorm there... but they dont want to dig to much.<br>
<br>
hummm the coin coments were low blows cuz he is a nice guy...<br>
<br>
the rollen coments or rollens actions coments were prety lame. <br>
<br>
<br>
/ponders<br>
<br>
well thats about all...<br>
as far as round one of flame war well Reso 1 and fnf 3/4<br>
<br>
close round. <br>
<br>
<br>
like all my posts that are exceptionly to long and have no real point. im not going to spell check it. <br>
<br>
Rollen and Thraall are probly the only 2 folks well... fuvi also... that can read this meaing people who read this might do one of 4 things<br>
A- Pass out from all the intance lines of misspelligns and poor gramer and not rember any thing about this thread.<br>
<br>
B- Become so mezed by this that they will zone out forgetign all about eq in its entireity not ever visiting this board again.<br>
<br>
C-Read who left it and say off fuck i know this is going to be a bitch to read ill mark it and coem back later and never come back.<br>
<br>
D- Read who wrote it and say Ahh fuck this guy is a loon lets not even fucking bother with it wate for some one else to post then relized every one is Spaced out from reading and not haveing the foucs,cuz of the intaces hrs of reading this, not to reply. and soon they will read it and become entranced also<br>

PS all that is stated above is bystandard babling facts and observations.<br>
<br>
Its mainly a joke except for a few things but those are made quite clear through out this long poorly written post filled for of junk.<br>
<br>
<br>
on a final serious note i was hopeign the leadership could acutly put behind the differnces and work togater insted of fude like dam childern.<br>

From what I have read its about 70% success rate.<br>
<br>
Btw Reso also has a 250 smith.<br>
As well as several others very close to that mark.  SO yes we could have forged the box ourselves.<br>
<br>
As for Coin.  He's one of the best ppl on this server hands down.  Its rare you meet someone as helpful and considerate as he is.  And everytime you bad mouth him it just shows your jealousy for the things he's done come through.<br>
<br>
Ellu  btw I would love to engage you in a bout of reasoning.<br>
My arguement was flawed how so. <br>
It was very simple.  <br>
Fact quest has minimum 30 minute time frame.<br>
Fact 14 or so members of FNF came through the parchment camp within minutes of passing through the first time.<br>
Fact you guys are bitching at us for exploiting the mark when you did the same thing.  And continue to do the same thing. SO if it was so wrong, why do it again and again and again.<br>
<br>
I just have one question, who was your first member to get keyed for HOH?  How was it done and who was that person with when they did it?  I know the answers to all these, your own member told me how it was done.<br>
<br>
See I don't speak for anyone in Reso here I speak because YOUR OWN MEMBER who has been an in game friend of mine since I started here spoke to me during that asking me about the quest and saying that its great the mark wasn't no drop and he was waiting to get keyed to get in. <br>
<br>
Now all that being said this whole arguement is bullshit and should just end.  There are some  good people I call friends in FNF, hell I may be the only person on the server who thought AS had alot of cool ppl.  I'm glad to call ppl like Nikka/oggy etc friends.  Thats why I hate this shit.  But when I hear comments saying We shouldnt' be proud we killed Aerin'dair whose probably the toughest mob downed on this server so far cause we had 4 ppl call from DS along for the ride, sounds bitter and jealous to me.  ALL I know is since I've joined Reso I'm been there to see ALL of SSRA with the execption of EMP/HP/Cursed dropped.  Also have seen AOW and Aerin'dair dropped, not to mention the countless dragons. Thats what this game is about seeing things and overcoming challenges, that it takes a group of ppl working together to do.  <br>
<br>
And one point your all missing is yes certain members of reso did exploit the mark JUST as FNF did.  However Kzan the point your missing is pretty much all of those members have done the trials at least a few times each since to get other guildies and even applicants keyed for POV.<br>
<br>
And considering that its known as the Trial Of DPS and to kill Aerind'dair you need mega dps I'll pretty much guarantee you 99% of our raid force the day we took down the dragon had at least done the trials once.  Hell coin/rollen have done them countless times each.  <br>
<br>
As I said I have no problems with anyone who wants to do the quest to get into HOH by all means it was put in there as an alternative route.  My point is your calling us hypocrites for saying you exploited the mark,  yet here you are doing the SAME THING for HOH.  IF it was so terrible why not just stop at POJ.  Know you did it for COD and now your doing it again for HOH.<br>
<br>
Well if we're hyprocrites whats that make you?  <br>
To the 6 ppl who did the single quest like Z job well done and I'll see you up there hunting.  I just want to know if only ONE group did the quest why was more then 6 ppl from FNF up there?  Thats it, a simple question.<br>
<br>
Oh and Kzan I'll be there the day you guys do Aerin'dair the first time I'll hang by the cemetary and take some pics too.  You'll see how easy he is. <br>

As far as tradeskilling goes.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for someone like xylox who has achieved the feat of GM smith.  I myself could never do it, I just don't have the patience or dedication for a task that time consuming.<br>
<br>
I know the hard work it is cause I help Penrif get to his where he is in smithing by doing everything from helping him get silks and pelts to swirlingmists etc.<br>
<br>
So no slight at Xy whatsoever. <br>
Being a Gm in any skill is a rare accomplishment and something to be really proud off.<br>
<br>

<br>
btw-Thrall I'm really not full of myself at all bud.<br>
Just got really annoyed by Beorn's post downgrading us killing the glass dragon.  Just came off as very bitter and jealous to me.  Met and grouped with you once in POV and your a good guy.  So don't take any offense to this.  Just think that Beornn's post was really low and uncalled for.  Hell we didn't even tell anyone we took down Aerin'dair we weren't looking for a pat on the back by anyone.  But saying that we didn't deserve it and its not a real take down like I said just comes off as being jealous.<br>

I tried to remain ambiguous and have it just be a warning shot over the bow, but one of my loveable guildmates decided to grab the wheel and run the offenders down.<br>
<br>
I had been trying to work with the new leadership of FnF to better relations between our guilds. I had discussed that the only way for relations to truly improve would be if we treated each other as equals and not to taunt each other with success or failure. I should never have started this thread, but it has proved useful in someways. I still see the arrogance of FnF claiming that Reso needs help of others to accomplish things. I still see the long ago instilled anomosity of Reso members towards FnF rearing its ugly head. FnF will never see Reso as equals I believe so it will be impossible for Reso to shed this animosity and we will never get along because of it. <br>

<br>
I did not say it was one sided. I said that Reso has some deep seeded feelings of animosity towards FnF for your bashing us time after time. I will not claim Reso is not at fault for this. We are not perfect and I am sure we will make more mistakes. We will not get over our bad feelings if your members continue to tell us we are inferior. Maybe I am just acting like the herd leader and I am trampling over anything that threatens the herd, but open your eyes and read what your members continue to say about us. You bad mouth us because we had four Dreadstorm and Witherweaver with us on our Aerin'Dar kill. We bad mouth you because you exploit something and you bad mouth us because we had to get help to accomplish something. <br>

Stop being elitists. When Ramel left I thought that would change.<br>

No sorry Coinfist, I never said I was leaving, I am here for a very long time.<br>
<br>
Although I am happy I am in your thoughts enough to want me gone, as for you, I dont really concern myself with you all to much except when you have bullshit spewing from your mouth as in the above statement.<br>
<br>
As Far as I can see it.<br>
<br>
1) Resolution complained about how their accomplishment was diminished because FnF did a quest to get into HoH, and passed the key around. <br>
<br>
Firiona Vie, Where 99% of things are tradeable, including most keys. Its part of the rules you should know it by now, if Verant things its a bit to unbalanced then they will change it.<br>
<br>
2) FnF saying Resolution is a bunch of Hypocrits for doing same thing with PoV marks.<br>
<br>
True, Resolution has admited it, and so has FnF to a small degree. Thing is Reso has no right to claim what FnF did wrong, because they are just as guilty if this act is truelly *wrong*<br>
<br>
I can understand you feel that your accomplishment of killing the big nasty ole dragon is deminished some. But all in all if Resolution and Fire and Fury's positions were reversed they would be flagging people into HoH same as FnF.<br>
<br>
It would be extremely hard for me to believe that they would say, Gee o golly the key isnt no drop , but we shouldnt give it to our members cause thats just wrong. Fact is they did it with other keys, they would do it with that one.<br>
<br>
I dont really see FnF coming here and Saying Reso is wrong for doing the mark thing, they are just saying that its pretty shitty that Reso is basically calling the kettle black.<br>
<br>
Ill pull an old quote from early in the server that seemed to catch on for a while.<br>
<br>
Those whom live in Glass dragons, err Houses shouldnt throw stones.<br>
<br>
If this was such a crime, and such a dispute, and unballanced this server so much, Then Verant will do what they can to fix it, If not, then just let it go and play the game, yall are taking this game way to serious, something I have done for way to long.<br>

<br>
the trial can be repeated directly after being succesfuly done assuming there is no corpse left in the room (leave it to you guys to figure out the trick).<br>
<br>
and do i need to explain it again..... 14 people going through the parchement camp means JACK SHIT.  its not very hard for 2 or 3 groups of people to all go to the trials together.   get everyone a mark.  and then as a group of 14 people go to mauvin and get the flag for PoV.<br>
<br>
i will never say that a few members of FaF got access to PoV/PoS prior to completing the trial them selves.  but i still hold to the feeling that more members of Reso where flaged prior to looting there own mark.  i could be wrong but thats not the point.<br>
<br>
Gratz on killing the dragon.  anyone who has a clue knows hes a beast and quite a hard mob to kill.  i may be good friends with beornn but i dont know his exact train of thought, when he mentioned DS helping you with the crystal dragon (cant spell his name)  he wasnt saying you suck you suck you suck.  I think he was saying that you dont need to be talking about how you did eveyrhting.  He knows I know, as i said before everyone knows killing the dragon is a VERY impressive feat.<br>
<br>
First mistake you made was thinking you are always right, Aailin.<br>
<br>
and god rollen when are you gonna stop having to make an issue out of every god damn thing, hell sometimes you have a valid point, but you bitch and moan about almost everything.  in fact i am quite surprised you didnt bring up VS.<br>

First it’s not a group key quest that’s a single key quest that is a fact, second how big is a group for you? There were at least 30 different people to zone in hon yesterday this after I told you SOE going to make the key no drop hello? What the hell are you thinking?<br>

<br>
Again I don’t care about reso first reso don’t own the zone because we have killed dragon, nor do I care if it’s with the help of DS, yes it’s soe fault but after so many hints St keys, VT keys, VP keys change tribunal change it’s damn clear they don’t want key who take months for a guild on other server to be completed in a few hours by one individual.<br>
<br>
There are so called exploit who can be rather called cheesy or imaginative way found by players, your is not imaginative it’s not even cheesy it’s pure cheating.<br>
<br>
<br>
Find some post of me bashing fnf or jumping on shit for free.<br>
<br>
I come from a old European country where delation(sp) let a nasty bad taste in the mouth so nope I don’t like harassing gm nor do I like petition, hope you guys have some clue zoning into hon after I told you gm are watching is not the most intelligent thing to do.<br>

Thrall give it a rest.  You lost the argument.  You cant key 14+ people in 30 min period.&lt;--BTW thats a period.  Better you just stfu than dig a deeper hole.  But i suppose your welcome to pile the BS on more.  As Eskarina posted you are going to drown in your own bullshit.<br>
<br>
Heres what it breaks down to.  Rollen mentioned someone cheated the system again, and we only waited for the defense to come.  If your not guilty then why defend?<br>
<br>
Fact.  You knew keys were suppose to be single player.  Why? cause you all petitioned the decay key right after you all passed it around.  This is the root of the arguement. <br>
<br>
Tell me this is false.  Tell me you all didnt pass the decay key around then petition it.<br>
