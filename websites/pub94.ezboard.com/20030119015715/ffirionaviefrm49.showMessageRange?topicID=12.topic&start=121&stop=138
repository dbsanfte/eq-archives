Although it's impossible to prove what someone remembers it's still lying if you do, the King of Kudos does remember and lied about remembering.&quot;<br>
<br>
Did not study him in school, sorry.  Feel free to explain the reference.  The point is the statement &quot;I do not know if x happened&quot; can be a true statement.  That we can't prove it should make you think twice about labeling it a &quot;lie&quot;.  That its truth is unlikely should make you feel better about labeling it as such.  But I granted you that one, since it is highly unlikely Kzan would not know if we didn't do Exiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a lie, it wasn't damn close, it wasn't 2 percent. Kritical and Kerg screwed up, can't admit Kritical made a mistake so people were led to believe we just weren't ready for a mob and the Ssra basement was deserted again for some time.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't see how the latter is on-topic.  As for the former, &quot;damn close&quot; is not quantified, so I can't determine if him saying so is a lie, as it would depend on what he considers close or not.  He could just be outright wrong or deluded about it, though.  2% is a lot easier to debate since you can just put your mouse over the health bar.  I can't debate that 2% because either I wasn't there or I didn't look at the health bar.<br>
<br>
&quot;It can be because he was referring to the first attempt which would mean the next attempt would be the 2nd which had already failed, they since attempted a 3rd and failed.&quot;<br>
<br>
It can't possibly be the first attempt with the second attempt having happened if he used &quot;next&quot; in the present.  The incident in question would have had to referred to the latest attempt at the time of writing for &quot;next time&quot; to make sense.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes all the phone calls and emails and playing and the King of Kudos wasn't sure about killing a mob. I do believe the phrase is beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know that Kzan is there all the time.  I don't keep raid attendence numbers.  I don't know that he keeps tabs on everything.  I'm pretty sure he used to given all the Kudos, but at the present time I couldn't say so.  I think the doubt that Kzan could list off every mob we've ever killed in the history of the guild is reasonable.<br>
<br>
&quot;This one could actually be Kzan's lack of knowledge about the game as opposed to a lie, on further review this one can be chalked up to incompetence.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's nice but not relevent.<br>
<br>
&quot;The qualifier &quot;so I wouldnt really know&quot; makes it a lie, the implication at that point is that he doesn't die very much.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your response to his original statement: &quot;This is a lie, he dies a lot, he's very poor at playing his class and it's easy to check what a mob hits for it's called scroll up, the absurd concept that whether or not it's 425 Dain will show up in guild chat is a farce, aka another lie from Kzan.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you were making the point that &quot;so I wouldn't really know&quot; made it a lie, why are all the extra words there?<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes he did. Kzan now states it was his opinion all along to remain a small guild&quot;<br>
<br>
Quote the reference please.  I don't read that from his original statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;because that's what he is in now when infact he has always advocated having a larger guild throughout his time in FaF. His goals were always far more consistent with the guild Resolution is now but lies to say his goals match his current guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
So he used to want a big guild now he wants a smaller one (that's not my judgement of his position, that's my judgement of what you're saying his position is).  If he claimed he never changed his opinion he would then be lying, but where did he?<br>
<br>
&quot;No it's not Fire and Fury vs Resolution, Kzan said End Game. By the time Fire and Farming was in Vex Thal there would be how many new expansions? New one coming out next month and even Innoruuk hasn't died let alone Tunare, Sontalak, Burrower Beast, Rings'a'plenty, Shei, Cursed, Arch Lich, Creator, High Priest, AoW. New content and new standard for end game comes out within about 6 months of Fires of Heaven killing off the old content, there is no reason to believe Fire and Farming will ever be within 6 months of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
That Kzan holds illogical beliefs does not make him a liar.  It just makes him mistaken.<br>
<br>
&quot;Primarily yes, because I consider that his greatest failing. I realize other people think lying is OK because well not like you want to spoil Santa Claus to a child and keep making larger and larger exceptions throughout their life. But no it wasn't only, I saw Kzan spewing lies and decided to post and economy of motion I don't make seperate threads for every concern.&quot;<br>
<br>
What then, were your other goals?<br>
<br>
This is now off the original topic (I'm defining &quot;original topic&quot; to be &quot;Kzan is a liar&quot;), but I'm curious: is every instance of lying wrong?  If I was an undercover cop and had to disguise and a criminal (say, car theft) in order to arrest people, would I be immoral?  And before you answer please don't make any assumptions of my thoughts on the issue, as I haven't yet expressed any.<br>

<br>
Oliver North was the was at the center of the Iran Contra affair during the Reagan administration, his televised examination would see him reply to every question that he couldn't recall, the interragator would then direct him to physical evidence in order to jog his memory at which point he would remember only what was contained directly in the evidence.<br>
<br>
Adding a qualifier to work a technicality is no different from a lie, since Kzan is well aware of the truth when he types in the qualifier and point.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;This one could actually be Kzan's lack of knowledge about the game as opposed to a lie, on further review this one can be chalked up to incompetence.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; That's nice but not relevent.<br>
<br>
I was conceding you a point you said this wasn't a lie and on this one I agree with you.  How is agreeing with you on whether or not it's a lie not relevant?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; If you were making the point that &quot;so I wouldn't really know&quot; made it a lie, why are all the extra words there?<br>
<br>
To make fun of Kzan's total lack of skill at the game playing the easiest class to 2 box on the overwhelming majority of high end encounters.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes he did. Kzan now states it was his opinion all along to remain a small guild&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Quote the reference please. I don't read that from his original statement.<br>
<br>
You have been banned from this EZBoard.  Oops can't get the original reference, well I can, but I'm not going to.  Kzan's posts on recruiting on the Fire and Fury boards, not sure if they still exist, I can assure you he always wanted more people, if Kzan states otherwise you can decide who to believe.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; If he claimed he never changed his opinion he would then be lying, but where did he?<br>
<br>
The ability to create a house of cards of absurd possiblities does not equate to reasonable doubt.  It's just the same trash talking no skill gimp trying to figure out how to say he's better.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; That Kzan holds illogical beliefs does not make him a liar. It just makes him mistaken.<br>
<br>
Kzan is a liar because he lies.  Same as a thief is one because they steal.  It does not require to be continually engaged in the activity.  It's entirely reasonable to believe even he doesn't believe what he wrote making that another lie, regardless he is a liar.<br>
<br>
What then, were your other goals?<br>
<br>
Promoting World Hunger, Famine and the return of New Kids on the Block to the top of the music charts.<br>
<br>
But moreso for people to evaluate whether or not they are having fun playing the game.  If they aren't they should do something to correct that, having people trickle off in 1's and 2's isn't likely to promote enjoyment of the game.  The whole reason I never left the guild and was still guilded to be booted at the end of July is that Fire and Fury has the people to make a lot of things dead.  <br>
<br>
Beladona, Heagan, Restoria, Angie, Kholdar, Okane, (Dante), Faira, Fumle, Andlie, Xadria, Xylox, Paprika maybe others I'm forgetting all had extended periods of every day play of the cleric class something of tremendous value to a guild.  Rosiel, Thraall, Beornn, Elaira, Mezzmorizer, Caparelli, Auno, Mythyk, Reynn, Enheduanna, HUmle, Cuku, Fuvi, Illistrumn, Cama, Uliamarath, Witherweaver, Johanna, Gwenlynn, Cloude, Exxy, Eldraed, Lithis, Lolodory, Waii, Shazzy, Viren, Ramel, Xoraxis, Qixx, Sliver, Mumle, Kritical, Borgo, Krindel, Kholdor, Gore, Kerg all had extended periods of time they could be counted on to attend the majority of raids.  Maybe I forgot some here too.<br>
<br>
How many are current, how many are likely to quit the game if they leave FaF, maybe quitting the game is what's best for them.  Maybe it's best if these people get together in a new guild and start achieving closer to their potential, maybe it's best for them to use the backbone of Dreadstorm to make a guild that would be more fun for them.  But if they are gone, their options on this server are limited if they leave in 1's and 2's they are more likely to quit.  Basically you need to get rid of Bako who has his foot slammed down on the brakes of the Bangbus and since he CAN'T TRUST you people and HAD TO run the ship alone until the person WHO QUIT OVER LOOT returned it's not likely to be a change from within FaF.<br>
<br>
I'm really happy with Resolution but bottom line just a few too many Sorcerers and a few more people which are needed to replace more consistent attendance to get the force on day in and day out to kill stuff.  And where are they a lot of the time?  Trying to figure out some new Ssra named, N ToV, talking about AoW, like them to try a few more mobs as well because this accomplishes something two fold.  People in Resolution are having more fun, well presumably killing harder mobs is more fun, and so are people in Awakened Souls which include me because they have more mobs to choose from to kill.  Cut down and hopefully cut out bottom feeding and focus on mobs of your tier.  Resolution is moving towards this Fire and Farming is not.<br>
<br>
I'm well aware that my habit of ranting likely excludes me from a new guild, not a concern, I spent most of a year playing my last toon without advancing much past epic/planar stage.  My focus was never loot and frankly I've gotten just about all the useful gear I can get outside Vex Thal anyways (upgraded focus effects), I'll be having fun killing mobs and looting them somewhere, you can send me postcards from Vex Thal while I'm trying to kill Innoruuk and I'd be happy for you and I'd be having fun.<br>
<br>
The fact that the problems with FaF are predominately related to Bako is an added bonus to point out his many short comings, taking shots at some other members for what should be unacceptable behavior is largely letting other people chuckle at the same things I laughed at when I first heard about them.<br>
     <br>
My other motivation was that I know that Okane enjoys the fact that a thread he started has turned into such a long and lively thread and for some reason I can't pin down I actually like that guy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; is every instance of lying wrong?<br>
<br>
Yes, full disclosure is a seperate issue. Mommy does daddy make you reach climax?  Lying is wrong, full disclosure isn't warranted in that situation.  If you're going to answer a question answering with lies is so rarely productive in the long term that it's an in-advisable course of action. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; If I was an undercover cop and had to disguise and a criminal (say, car theft) in order to arrest people, would I be immoral?<br>
<br>
It would be illegal in my country if you lied answering a direct question which would result in the the criminals going free regardless of your undercover work.  Police are held to a higher standard and face greater scrutiny.<br>

Oh by the way Kudos on first Elder, saw Bimm a few days ago in Ssra, she still isn't Elder, thought Ramel would have levelled Servant a little more, my bad.<br>
<br>
Guess you come here for the no content flames about AS destroying the server by buying toons and stumbled across a thread with actual facts in it and got kind of scared.<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt; As for me I'm going back to having fun blowing things up in a video game, since this thread is now pointless and lame to continue reading.<br>
<br>
And the cat came back the very next day.  Personally you took your parting shot at me after I was gone but so did a lot of people, more generally I just make fun of people who make those cookie cutter posts saying this thread is such a waste and take the time to post to do so and rarely leave after they make that post.<br>

You edit out what you don’t like to pare things down to what suits your needs.  You edit “the truth” to manipulate the message or attempt to redeem yourself, all the while hiding behind your version of the truth.  You also contradict yourself, hypocratize and back-peddle.<br>
<br>
“You dissapointed me by playing politics to get loot meaning your knowledge of game mechanics came at a price of the happiness and attendance of others.”<br>
<br>
This is a good one, and I doubt even you believe this.  Yes, I have coffers laden with phat lewtz that I’ve managed to politic into my possession =oP.  Get real.  <br>
<br>
Also, a very hypocritical thing to say considering the political rhetoric you’ve spewed over the past months.  Likewise very hypocritical considering all the manipulations you’ve exercised concerning loot - withholding loot from persons to whom it has been awarded, making persons feel guilty about loot they’ve received or haven’t received…your record is crystal clear to those involved on this issue.  <br>
<br>
As for the “price of happiness”.  Turn the blind eye of ignorance to the enjoyment you’ve leeched from others if you like, but your record stands.<br>
<br>
“Kurley was into EBay instead it came out with that post.”<br>
<br>
Again, another manipulative jab.  Kzan bought me a non-conventional wedding present, albeit not through Ebay.  I’m as into Ebay as I am with the manufacture of Denby China or Kitchen Aid mixers using that absurd line of thinking.<br>
<br>
“I never said Kzan was bad for buying a character, I just told people that he did.”<br>
<br>
Haha, relying on the “I’m just the messenger” excuse…  Your motivations are transparent, and contradict your attempt to label them innocently as “for you information only”.<br>
<br>
“Because of the actual facts I was given a beautiful opportunity to transition an AS buys gear quote and everyone hates AS and EBay and pointing out that Kzan buys gear where AS doesn't.<br>
<br>
But yes I'm well aware of the general anger directed at those two and more than happy to have Kzan share that anger.”<br>
<br>
Your sole motivation is to make Kzan look bad, otherwise why are you not listing each and every Ebay, PlayerAuctions and Legends transaction that has taken place…since you are “here to inform”.”  Slamming Kzan is one of your goals, but slamming raiding partners isn’t conducive to looting content.   By being conveniently selective, you contradict your own stated view – call it whatever you like but you’re a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
“Wishing physical pain on Charles someone I have never and will never meet is not something I do.”<br>
<br>
Right…but you’ve stated over and over again:<br>
<br>
“Bako knows I don't like him and for that matter most people by that point knew I didn't like.”<br>
<br>
“Wah, I hurt my leg and all I can do is stay home and play EQ.” – remember that comment?  Bako the iksar monk was not involved in a serious car accident.  Charles the human being was – who were you referring to in this statement?  Charles glossed over your “break a leg” comment initially, but in retrospect the tone of the comment became clearer to him.  He can disagree if I am wrong.<br>
<br>
“pointing out the self-destructive behavior of someone who made so much effort to pull me down brings a smile to my face, because indeed I am an @sshole and a happy one at that.”<br>
<br>
So is that a virtual Fuvi /smile or Bryan smiling at the prospect of someone suffering because of RL discomfort?  Please refer to your “separation” quote below.<br>
<br>
Trying to back-peddle out of this line of behaviour because it makes you look despicable in the eyes of decent people is wise, but it’s a little late.  Hehe, and “self-destructive”, that gives yourself far too much credit.<br>
<br>
“Once you can seperate game and reality figure out the difference between Fuvi and Bryan you have a chance of understanding the difference.”<br>
<br>
Oh, so I guess you’ve been just roleplaying an asshole and a bunch of us have just been caught up in it?  A long time ago you and I had a chat where you intimated “I am Brian, I am Fuvi…” and went on a discuss about how you don’t use the guise of your toon or your msg board identity to hide who you are – or is your memory selective here?  Again, trying to separate yourself from a part of the impression you’ve left within FnF and the FV community is wise, however it’s too late.<br>
<br>
“Again you can't dissapoint me after all I tried to cut the brake lines on your car, no wait, I sent an email, but that was the same as cutting the brake lines on your car.   You still have no grasp of analogies.”<br>
<br>
Again, here you are manipulating a comment to discredit it and thereby discredit all arguments/analogies related to the source of the comment you are discrediting – “color by numbers”.  Either that or you have a selective/bad memory.<br>
<br>
The “cars and brakes” comment you keep repeating came out of a thread where you used a weak analogy of a dog crapping on a lawn and used this argument:<br>
<br>
&quot;There was my failsafe, you see if she considers the anonymous email meaningless, there is nothing to apologize for, if she is willing to attack Kurley about it it's also worth replying to, something she didn't do.&quot;<br>
<br>
I countered with my own ridiculous analogy paralleling your “crap on lawn” analogy:<br>
<br>
My words:<br>
”Here is an equally absurd interpretation. If I mess with the brakelines of your car…”<br>
<br>
I assume you understand what the word “absurd” means?  However it serves your purpose to choose to ignore my qualification of that analogy, which is a keen tactic, but transparent.<br>
<br>
“Bako's actions in game governed by the sense of self importance Charles gets from playing a video game.”<br>
<br>
The instances of you waving your virtual dick approaches Ron Jeremy’s RL record.  Try and tell me now that you don’t receive personal gratification from this.  I thought you said “because a few of us take PRIDE in what we do”, and you were happy to go on about how quickly you levelled, how you could go to any server and join any guild, how much damage you do, how many people you can TL…  So is that Bryan who takes the pride?  Or the Fuvi entity that you’re trying pin some of the above on?  <br>
<br>
What version of the truth suits you in any of these instances?<br>
<br>
BTW we’re approaching “page eighted” status – as per the recent Brell thread, so the revelations shall be forthcoming.<br>
