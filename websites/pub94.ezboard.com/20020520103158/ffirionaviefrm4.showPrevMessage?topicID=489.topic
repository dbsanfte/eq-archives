Is it too much to fucking ask for someone to yell &quot;train&quot;?<br>
IS IT??!!!!<br>
I just came back from croc hunting in Oasis of Marr, and I swear, there was a group of walking Darwin Awards training all of Orc Highway to fucking North Ro.<br>
Now, that isn't all that uncommon....<br>
BUT<br>
training them to the %$#@ing SHORE????<br>
<br>
amazingly enough, after palming Orc Warr.s and such off on other people, (SIX TIMES- I counted.), they had the courtesy to yell &quot;watch out for the SG&quot;....<br>
I don't think they were *intentionally* training, but...<br>
<br>
I haven't seen such retardation since the last time I was in the FP newbie zone. I saw these same fucking morons doing EXACTLY the same thing a few weeks ago when I was living in EC with the Orc Camps....trains- all the way the hell the WRONG direction. It's like they think that attacking something that has a camp and is at LEAST blue to them WON'T attack as a group when one gets aggroed.<br>
<br>
PLEASE, by ALL MEANS, feel free to wonder WHY I say &quot;no&quot; to you when you try and invite me into your group after watching this moronic display. PLEASE. I can't get enough of exp. loss and CR's.<br>
<br>
This is about as bad as the two dipshits I saw a while ago- they had a GREAT strategy for clearing out Orc2:<br>
1. Numbskull1 trains all the orcs to Sgt. Slate. (no &quot;train&quot; shout or a heads up, but- they were new...semi-understandable on that count)<br>
2. Lets the guard take care of them all (or try to) in hopes that it would make the camp more manageable<br>
3. wind up getting killed, and getting everyone with their face in a book killed.<br>
4.Orcs head back to camp, whack Numbskull2.<br>
repeat steps 1-3<br>
I say to one of them after watching this- &quot;do you think this is such a good idea?&quot;<br>
the response is <br>
&quot;well, you come up with a better idea, then, tough guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
This waste of air is doing pretty much the same thing, and worse still, he's in a guild now. Don't guilds on FV bother to mebbe...ohh...I don't know...GET TO KNOW YOUR RECRUITS?????<br>
<br>
Then we have another one (a level 11 in Oasis) getting trained left and right by every undead EVERYTHING, yelling for help for all of two hours, yet kept coming back for more...<br>
if I could speak Elvish...grrrrrrr....<br>
<br>
If something goes horribly foul like the above listed, one would think perhaps a NEW strategy would be in order?<br>
<br>
and is it me, or have others noticed a rather large slew of new guilds badgering for recruitment?<br>
it's like the fucking phone company!<br>

How about using your head! Move to a different spot, for God's sake...<br>
<br>
There are many places to play in this game where getting run over by a big fat train is a constant threat. The entrance to Unrest and Blackburrow, and the beach near the docks at Oasis are among the worst. Standing in one of these spots and then crying about getting killed is a joke. <br>
<br>
There's no denying that the world is full of stupid people, but screaming at a stupid person isn't going to teach them a thing. In your example above, the ones training orcs to Slate and getting killed repeatedly apparently asked you to tell them a better tactic. What did you say to them? Did you take the time to show them a better way or did you growl and call them idiots? If you did the latter, then you really have nothing to bitch about if a few levels from now you die again to one of their ill-planned tactics.<br>
<br>
Personally, I find arrogant know-it-alls much more annoying than clueless newbies.<br>

I was sitting up on the rock in the water, watching it, and got up and moved a few times.<br>

and secondly, I didn't yell at anyone.<br>
I asked him if he thinks this is a good idea, and he mouthed off, so, I just packed up, and walked away.<br>
you can't tell me that training an entire camp that you can't even handle, halfway across a zone to ONE guard is a smart move. I could see you doing it once if you were being chased, but that was clearly a tactic, and I guess they wanted to be heroes.<br>
<br>
I don't know how I sound like a know-it-all, when what I've seen isn't even an example of &quot;I didn't know HOW&quot;, it's just flat out being stupid. I can't believe someone would defend someone who's doing the same damned thing over and over again, when this clearly didn't work before.<br>
<br>
I guess it's not okay to gripe, then. Fine. you win.<br>

The track is any exp spot that is familiar to everyone, and typically has the highest concentration of players.  Examples include Oasis, Unrest, High Hold, Over world Kunark (not the dungeons), et al.<br>
<br>
What makes these track zones attractive to the average retard is the sheer number of players present.  That is, you can get into a group of 6 retards who fights one blue mob at a time.  No matter how unskilled these retards may be, sheer numbers will overwhelm the poor blue mob.  Now then, if one of these highly skilled retards pulls more than one or maybe even two blue mobs you have instant panic, which typically results in the group fleeing. If these retards had simply stood their ground, or executed crowd control they would have been fine... or at least only killed themselves, but instead they run and create a train (usually right into the nearest mass of other players in an attempt to save themselves).<br>
<br>
I on the other hand adventure in what I would call &quot;fringe&quot; zones.  These zones typically have a low concentration of players, most of whom are soloing.  This way I can meet players one on one, get to know people, and form duos or trios for hunting (much more effective than pick up groups).<br>
<br>
Remember, the strongest defense against retards is staying as far away as possible from their idiocy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .  It doesn't go away with levels.  These retards are just the younger versions of the high level players who think; &quot;We can raid anything as long as we bring enough people!&quot;.<br>

<br>
I am hunting in Unrest, and this Zapali guy REPEATEDLY picks up trains of several tormented undead, jacks, and beetles.  Rather than just running straight to the zone line and shouting (or heck, rather than just running straight to the zone), he would always scoot enough out of the way to slam ME (or whoever else was closest) with the train, to ease the burden on himself.<br>
<br>
I consider that pretty damn low.  &quot;Hey, I picked up more than I can handle!  Oh, shit, I might die!  Hey, I know, let me pawn off these nasties on the nearest innocent bystander I can see!&quot;<br>
<br>
However (big however here), I'm experienced enough to expect this kind of thing, and whenever I'm someplace like Unrest and soloing, I know better than to get too far from the zone (and I ALWAYS have divine aura mem'd).<br>
<br>
After witnessing his behavior several times, I just /ignored him and made sure to keep an eye out for him so I could toss on Invis to Undead at a moment's notice.  I rather enjoyed imagining the look on his RL face when he ran just behind me, only to have his train catch up with him instead of latching onto me.  *evil grin*<br>
<br>
And no, I refuse to heal players who repeatedly get others killed (and yes, I DID try to explain this to him, but he kept making lame excuses).  However, someone who's just genuinely caught in a bad situation and trying not to get others in trouble, I'll slap a couple of heals/buffs on them to help them survive, or at the least give them a rez.<br>
<br>
It's players like that who bug me.  (Even worse is when, several levels later, you learn that players like this are seeking enrollment in your guild...)<br>
<br>
Ah well, enough whining.  I'm done for now.  =)<br>
