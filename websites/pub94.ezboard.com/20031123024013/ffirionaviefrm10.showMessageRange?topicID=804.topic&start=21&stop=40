Even with the mask Kyri knew whose face lay behind it which confirmed her own suspicisions that Maelgroth was indeed one of the Waes'Harventhar. She sensed something when her &quot;uncle&quot; greeted him upon his arrival, some whispered conversation with meaning to only the two of them no doubt. Of course, as expected, Nystyre briefly looked towards her in case she did not recognize Maelgroth herself.<br>
<br>
   Mingling for a bit with the noblity to not be too obvious in her actions, a chore to be sure dealing with generally empty headed nobles who thought that mere birth granted greatness.<br>
 The matron of the Chath’elg’Caress was another reason why Kyri was glad she was not nobly born. As if a marriage bond interested her in the slightest, unless of course a great deal of platinum was involved. Kyri briefly felt bad for those noble daughters forced to wed because of some alliance or deal necessitated it. Soon enough she watched as the matron went to maelgroth next before the sounds of luaghter drove her from the field so to speak.<br>
<br>
   When the time came, Kyri decided to make her way to Maelgroth and discuss things. She knew he saw her for their eyes locked briefly as she watched the masked stranger  holding court with the member of house Ragar’Golhyrr. Soon after he went to see the lady Athava and chatted briefly which seemed to Kyri to have done well for Maelgroth left the guest of honor in a much better mood than when he first greeted her. Seeing him prepare to leave Kyri slipped out another way to meet him outside for a chance to speak privately. The time for comparing notes seemed to be right.<br>
<br>
  He saw her, she knew he did but oddly he appeared uncomfortable as she drew near. Before she could speak he vanished. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What spooked him?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought, knowing that her mere presence shouldn't have done so. It was one thing to have people say someone was intimidated by another's beauty but this was a bit much. With Maelgroth gone, Kyri knew she had best return inside before she was noticed to be missing.<br>
<br>
  Back inside she caught her &quot;uncle's&quot; eye and the two of them stepped out into another room briefly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, what did you discover?&quot; Nystyre asked<br>
<br>
  &quot;Nothing actually.&quot; Kyri replied &quot;I managed to find him alone but as i came near to speak with him he used his magic to vanish to who knows where. I didn't have a chance to say a thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hmm, that's very odd. This one did not seem the type to flee at the sight of a woman if he is indeed what he claims to be.&quot; Nystyre said. &quot;Well then if he is gone you may as well make some use of yourself the rest of the night and see what the other houses are up to since you scared off your main objective. But come 'neice' our guests are surely missing us by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Taking his arm, the two of them returned to the main hall. As Nystyre went back to his own duties Kyri found herself the sole remaining novelty of the event with Maelgroth having left. Several old women of various houses couldn't believe they had not heard of a branch of the D'vir clan in Mistmoore. The young men were even more attentive at her arrival, though most failed to raise their eyes above chest level when speaking to her, until she grabbed one from the Chath'elg'caress - perhaps the same one the matron spoke of earlier, by the hair and raised his eyes to hers while smiling sweetly with a cold glint in her eyes and saying &quot;When someone won't look me in the eye when speaking to me, I find it rather insulting. I would be happy to show you some of the techniques Mayong Mistmoore taught me to deal with insults if you continue this.&quot;<br>
<br>
   At the mention of the dark power of Mistmoore, the Chath'elg'caress's eyes grew wide as he stammered an apology and promptly thought of somewhere else he had to be. For some reason after this, the rest of the young men around her had pressing business to take care of as well and the crowd around her dispersed. To be sure some of the older noblemen smiled upon hearing the comment- the youth of today DID need to be shaken in their belief of their own superiority every now and then. This neice of Nystyre's seemed to be doing the job quite well.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps I should ask your uncle to lend you to my house for a time. You seem to be routing the Chath'elg'caress fairly well tonight.&quot; Ayon'daro stated as he drew close.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, to be honest they don't seem to be much of a challenge. I'm surprised they have risen as high as they have if this is the best they can muster.&quot; Kyri replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes, the old witch is on her way out I hear. You'd best be careful here Lady K'yari, its been said hired knives are cutting down many of the noblity. After tonight you may have an enemy or two.&quot; Ayon'daro warned<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hired knifes? My uncle's estates here are well defended. It would take a truly skilled killer to break in, and those would be expensive.&quot; Kyri answered.<br>
<br>
  Smiling Ayon'daro teased &quot;Oh really? What would someone so far away from the politics of Neriak know of the hiring of killers and their fees.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Cursing to herself at her slip Kyri quickly answered &quot;Well how else could a lone outpost in the middle of the weak elf lands stand? Military leaders need to be removed, strong rulers slain. Just because we are isolated does not mean we are ignorant my Lord Aton'daro.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;True enough,&quot; Ayon'daro admitted, &quot;It must be terrible being stranded out there so far from court. Perhaps you could convince your uncle to let you stay here a time. You'll find things are much more interesting here.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps, we shall see.&quot; Kyri said, then changing the subject. &quot;My Lord, what did you think of that stranger with the mask, a most mysterious sort he seemed to me, and vanished just as quickly as he arrived. When I saw his arrival I almost thought this was to be a costume party and me without my mask.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Chuckling Ayon'daro said, &quot;That one is an odd one, if I could see his face I am certain i could place him and his house. As it stands he does seem familiar but I can not tell from where. At any rate he appears to be a foe of the Fire Hags which makes him good enough in my book. Why do you ask?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh I had the same difficulty, I thought I knew of all the houses here but that one was unfamiliar, even my uncle mentioned little of him. I had thought that one who had been around neriak longer than I might be able to answer this question for me but it seems we share the same puzzle.&quot; Kyri answered.<br>
<br>
  At that Ayon'daro took his leave of Kyri and mingled elsewhere, lest some see the two speaking overmuch and think some sort of alliance was in the works. The rest of the night was uneventful a few folk spoke of the masked stranger in the halls, but none had a clue who he was or which side he was on. Eventually the guests departed and Kyri was again alone with Nystyre.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well I suppose I'll need this guise again for the actural ascension. Perhaps my good looks won't frighten him as much next time.&quot; Kyri mused after she passed along the tidbits of gossip she had picked up on.<br>
<br>
   &quot;A different dress of course&quot; Nystyre replied &quot; a lady of House D'vir would not be caught wearing the same dress twice to any formal gathering. But yes, this Waes'Harventhar does need watching, one who would take such pride in a whispered mention of his fallen house's name would certainly wish to make their mark here. It will be interesting to see what his next move shall be. But until then we shall continue to watch.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Soon after Kyri made her way from the estate, back in the comfort of her own gear, all that pampering in the estate would make her soft and vulnerable if she had to deal with it on a regular basis. <br>
<br>
   But the question of Maelgroth still remained. She was holding out on D'vir as it stood. Nothing had been said to him of the old woman or the priestess as yet. Plus Maelgroth seemed to panic when she approached him at the party. Was he lacking nerve? In over his head perhaps? Using magic to leave was a bit overdoing things, he might be less confident than she had first thought, thus the mask? To hide his fears?<br>
<br>
  Better to wait a bit longer, she decided, let him make his next play and see how it turns out. If his fear was a sign of weakness then he'll be devoured by his foes, if it was a temporary lapse then there is still hope for him. Still a helpful hint or two might be in order.<br>
<br>
   The next day Naelaelayle found a note in their old shack in the Foreign Quarter, as she still visited the old place from time to time to keep up the appearance of habitation to any watching eyes. It was sealed in wax but no house emblem was seen. A name was on the outside. Maelgroth.<br>
<br>
    Returning quickly to their quarters in the League halls, she gave the note to Maelgroth who openned it and read the brief note inside as a platinum coin fell to the floor as the note was openned.<br>
<br>
   &quot;A truth seeker can almost see the truth through the mask. Caution in word and deed might be prudent. A great house watches and waits but its chief eyes lay in the Shadows. Time has been bought, and further assistance might be given.&quot;<br>

It did not take long for Maelgroth to decipher the message. Discrete inquiries resulted in the identity of the author being revealed.<br>
<br>
“Tell me brother, what do you know of Kyri?” Maelgroth asked his brother Malingrad, they were meeting in the old shack where the note had first been found.<br>
<br>
“She is a talented assassin.” Malingrad replied carefully. Was his brother preparing to replace him after his failure at house security.<br>
<br>
“Better than you?”<br>
<br>
“Her skills are becoming legendary, as is her unusual devotion to platinum.”<br>
<br>
“So she is a mercenary?” the young necromancer growled.<br>
<br>
“Hardly, though she does work for pay, she is quite selective, from what I hear.” Malingrad was watching his brother closely, he had grown in power very quickly and the rogue doubted he would survive a fight with his younger half brother. “Would you like me to seek her out?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think your services will be necessary for this task, I have another mission for you, one more suited for your skills. It is time we prepare to move against House Sol’Calar (the Eye Eaters). As you know they live in 2nd gate inside our first ancestral home. They are a quiet house, rarely taking part in vendetta and politics.” Maelgroth carefully handed a scroll case to Malingrad.<br>
<br>
“Inside are the original blueprints to the house. I am sure there have been some changes, but perhaps a few of our secrets remain undiscovered. Scout out this house and return with information concerning their security.”<br>
<br>
“I will obey.” Malingrad replied in the old tongue. He was sure he was being sent to his death. The mission was too easy. As he stood up to leave his brother called out to him.<br>
<br>
“Be careful, we are close to our goal.”<br>
<br>
After his brother left, Maelgroth gated back to his quarters.<br>
<br>
“I have sent Malingrad to scout the Sol’Calar. That should keep him busy.” <br>
<br>
“Good, tell me more of this Vynna K’yari.” His mother chirped.<br>
<br>
She had not stopped chittering about how a cousin of mighty hose D’Vir had taken an interest in her son. Maelgroth was beginning to regret asking her advice on this matter, especially in light of recent events. He could tell the old woman was dying to gossip with someone about the doings of her house, they were so close and she had waited a very long time.<br>
<br>
“I am more concerned with our vengeance, there will be time for alliances after our victory.”<br>
<br>
“Of course you are right.” She conceded. “You have a task for me?”<br>
<br>
“The Fire Hags are loosing too quickly, the Ragar’Golhyrr are too strong for them.” Maelgroth began. This was a dangerous and risky mission. “I need you to get a carriage, similar to those used by House D’Vir and I need you to arrange an incident.”<br>
<br>
“A bold move.” Naelaelayle replied. “Do you intend to duplicate the blazon of house D’Vir as well?”<br>
<br>
“It won’t be necessary, we won’t be angering House D’Vir.”<br>
<br>
“I will have things arranged in a few hours.” His mother said, leaving the room.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was alone, he cloaked himself in shadow and headed upstairs. It was with some trepidation he approached her door.<br>
<br>
The door opened before he could knock.<br>
<br>
“Kyri?” Maelgroth whispered. The room was dark, but with his vision he could see the table and chairs as well as the battered targets on the wall, many still with throwing knives sunk into their centers.<br>
<br>
“Took you long enough.” A voice whispered back, from behind him.<br>
<br>
“Well, I have been busy, Vynna K’yari.”<br>
<br>
“If we continue to call each other by our aliases we will be standing in the hall all night, won’t you come in, we have much to discuss.”<br>
<br>
As he shuffled carefully into the room he saw, Kyri pop into view in one of the chairs, somehow she had ghosted past him as he passed through the doorway. He noticed she took the chair farthest from the door, it also had its back to the wall.<br>
<br>
“I have disarmed the traps you are most likely to trip, don’t do anything unexpected and you will be fine.”<br>
<br>
“So, which of us is caught up in the other’s business?” Maelgroth began, cutting directly to the reason he had come. “Are you working an angle with House D’Vir? If so I will not tip your hand.”<br>
<br>
“There is no angle with that one, at this time. He merely asked me to make some inquiries as to the identity of a certain house guest.”<br>
<br>
Malegroth had grown up in the alleyways of the foreign quarter. He knew what was coming next. “So, how much does he know, and how much do you want?”<br>
<br>
“He knows your house is attempting to make a comeback, he knows you were behind the fall of Vlos’Shannaal and he suspects your hand in the war between the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr.”<br>
<br>
“Who else knows?”<br>
<br>
“I have told no one else.” She could see the necromancer considering his options. He could attempt to silence her permanently. That was the least likely and possible. He could attempt to bribe her, but he must know there is no way his house could compete against the coffers of house D’Vir. Or he could simply ignore the matter.<br>
<br>
“So what do you want?” He asked again.<br>
<br>
“I don’t really know, at the moment I am enjoying my view of events. I will have to share some additional information with Nystyre soon.”<br>
<br>
“I am sure you will, what does he know about you?”<br>
<br>
‘Nice try, kid.’ Kyri thought to herself. “He knows more than you would think.”<br>
<br>
“As you know we are a poor house, with little to offer at the moment.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed.” She agreed, curious to see what he would come up with. A promise of future support would be valuable, but had no tangible value at the moment.<br>
<br>
“What would you say if we were to offer you the chance to examine, up close, and under supervision the workings of a greater house vault?”<br>
<br>
Kyri had been itching to get the chance to look at one for years, and seeing the Waes’Harventhar vault in the shack those many months ago had only whetted her appetite.<br>
<br>
“Under supervision eh?”<br>
<br>
“There is no other way for me to vouch for your safety. My mother will know if anything goes missing and, as you know the chest is sentient after a fashion.” Maelgroth knew he had her interest.<br>
<br>
“Well it is a relic of a bygone era, it might be worth looking at for novelty reasons.” Kyri smiled, the chance to spend some time studying one of these legendary chests, why the knowledge gained from such a visit would be invaluable. Sure there were few such chests left, but all were considered to be nearly impregnable.<br>
<br>
Now it was Maelgroth’s turn to smile.<br>
<br>
‘Nicely played.’ Kyri thought. Now she was going to offer something of value. “What do you want?”<br>
<br>
“I suppose it would be ok if you told Nystyre a bit more, perhaps something about my membership in the lodge of the dead, possibly my presence within the League and if you must my name.” Maelgroth replied carefully.<br>
<br>
“Yes, that’s really nothing, what do you really want?”<br>
<br>
“You can assist me tonight in our vendetta, it will be a small thing, easily done by one with your skills and present you with nearly no risk.”<br>
<br>
“Tell me more...”<br>
<br>
That evening….<br>
<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe I let him talk me into this!” Kyri hissed as she slithered out of the exquisite dress Nystyre had given her for the evening ascension. The equipment she had selected for this caper she had not worn in years, but she was glad it still fit. She had stashed the gear on the borders of the D’Vir manse and then submitted to an hour of pampering at the hands of Vil’Kev’s assistants. She had promised Nystyre she would have some information for him after the party, already the carriages bearing the D’Vir house crest and crewed by animated skeletons would be prowling the city collecting the guests for the affair. She would have to hurry.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth and Jabaner sat a few blocks away from the Ragar’Golhyrr manse, the carriage was a perfect match of the ornate teak carriages used by house D’Vir. It did not bear the all seeing eye crest of that house, instead it was decorated with the severed heads of  Chath’elg’Caress members. <br>
<br>
“Where did you get these?” Kyri whispered.<br>
<br>
“They are trophies of Malingrad’s.” Maelgroth replied distractedly.<br>
<br>
“He works for you?” Kyri giggled, suddenly understanding the attitude of the young rogue she had seen some time back at the Ebon Mask.<br>
<br>
“He is a member of our house.” Maelgroth laughed. “Ok, we only get one chance at this so we have to make it look good. Remember Kill Jabaner here not me!”<br>
<br>
“Not a problem.”<br>
<br>
Maelgroth cast a spell and the flesh melted away from his bones, leaving a giggling skeleton, nearly identical to the one standing next to him.<br>
<br>
“Problem.”<br>
<br>
“I will be driving, Jabaner will be hanging onto the back.” Maelgroth replied, climbing into his position on the coach. The other skeleton followed, climbing onto the place usually occupied by the footman. With a clatter the carriage took off for the Ragar’Golhyrr manse. Kyri trotted along, hidden in the shadows, awaiting her moment.<br>
<br>
As the carriage approached the front gates the guards recognized the carriage, they had been waiting for it, and saw what they expected to see, they cheered their delight as they opened the gate when they was the heads decorating the sides.<br>
<br>
“You will Pay for your Treachery!” Kyri hissed, blossoming out of the shadows and striking at Jabaner. She deliberately pulled her blows to give the skeleton a chance to fight back. She clambered onto the back of the carriage, still trading blows with the skeleton and attempted to force her way inside. Maelgroth quickened the pace and the horses galloped towards the mansion. The gate guards rushed to intercept the assassin.<br>
<br>
“Look out, the Chath’elg’Caress attack!” one shouted striking an ineffectual blow at Kyri who paused a moment to finish off Jabaner before vanishing once again into the shadows.<br>
“Damn assassins, don’t have the guts to face a real fighter!” another hissed, sheathing his sword and allowing the carriage to pass.<br>
<br>
Lord Ayon’daro watched the altercation carefully, he wondered at first why the Fire Hags would be so desperate to attack one of D’Vir’s carriages, when he saw the decorations, suddenly he understood. He snickered to himself as he strode out the front gate and slipped into the carriage. His house must be doing better than he thought if one of the great houses was publicly allying themselves.<br>
<br>
As they passed through the outer gates of his manor he waved to his guards. ‘Those men should get a bonus for driving off that assassin.’ He thought. As they took the road towards the Temple of Innoruuk he thought how nice it would be to arrive at the D’Vir manse in a carriage decorated with the heads of his enemies. Why he even recognized a few of them.<br>
<br>
The thought jarred him. He had paid for the deaths of most of the decorations on the cart. There was no way house D’Vir would take contracts like a common assassin. Something was wrong. Hurriedly he looked around, no where was the blazon of the D’Vir visible.<br>
<br>
“Driver, Stop the Carriage Now!” Ayon’daro shouted.<br>
<br>
The vehicle sped up, now it was racing along the road, he could see the temple approaching across its moat. He could hear chanting coming from the driver’s compartment.<br>
<br>
“You won’t catch me that easily! He screamed. With a series of powerful kicks he broke the door and leapt out, aiming for the moat, it was deep and would protect him from being crushed on the road.<br>
<br>
He landed with a titanic splash, the impact literally drove him to the bottom. He had nothing to worry about, he was a strong swimmer and close to the temple, he would survive. How typical of the Chath’elg’Caress and desperate.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he realized he was rooted to the bottom of the moat. He thrashed about wildly desperate to escape, after a while the moved no more.<br>
<br>
The chanting stopped, and the cart moved on, at a more sedate pace, as Lord Ayon'Daro drowned he could see the broken door flapping wildly as the carriage moved away.<br>
<br>

She should really be getting back to the D'vir estate before she was missed. Then again there was that guard's comment as she left that had to be addressed. <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Too afraid to face a real guard?&quot; I think not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself. It was annoying to have to fiegn flight before such ill trained guards. Of all the guards only one actually managed to even draw a sword before she had all but gotten into the carriage. Now they will have to be punished for their arrogance, after all she did have her reputation to think of if anyone managed to identify her. Drunken guards boasting of how they drove off Kyri Velkyn would certain lower the asking price of anyone seeking to hire her in the future. So the guards had to be dealt with.<br>
<br>
 There were four in all, the two at the main gate on the outside and two others just inside. The real trouble would be avoiding the bloodshed, after all D'Vir would get a bit suspicious if she returned all splattered in blood. <br>
<br>
  The two at the gate were congratulating themselves on a job well done and not even close to paying attention as they should. The assassin had been driven off and they were the heros of the night. The younger of the two, as Kyri suspected, had been a bit nervous about the prospect of a fight- no doubt why he was banished to exterior duty. So it was only moments before the guard wandered off to the bushes to relieve himself while his partner kept watch. Unfortunately he chose the place where Kyri was hiding, her garrotte itching to be used. Slipping behind him she strangled him as he was unable to call for help and the shaking of the bushes failed to alert his partner, who merely thought the youngster didn't have the stomach for the work and was puking his guts up in the bushes.<br>
<br>
 After the bushes fell silent and the guard failed to return, his companion now grew suspicious and warily made his way to the bush where his partner was last seen. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If that pup fainted on me i'll have his head.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the veteran thought to himself as he grew near. Suddenly he heard a whistling sound through the air and fell to the ground as the throwing star struck him cleanly in the throat. As he gurgled his life's blood away Kyri slipped out from the other side of the bushes and took some rope out of her packs. <br>
<br>
The inner guards would be checking up on their companions shortly, she knew from her observations earlier before the carriage arrived. So she only had a short time to prepare. Sure enough, a muffled call met by silence brought the openning of the side gate where a third guard stepped outside looking for the two who failed to answer his call. At the sight of the guard lying in a pool of blood near the bushes he made a quick call to within and his partner also stepped outside. The moment he did so a pair of nooses droppeded around both their necks from above where Kyri had balanced herself at the top of the wall while staying out of sight from the other side before she stood and readied the nooses when the second guard was called.<br>
<br>
  Before the guards could react, Kyri leapt off the wall inside the estate holding onto the ropes in each hand. Now while she wasn't heavy enough to drag the guards up the wall while she descended, the suddenness of her action and the the fact she gave herself half the length of the wall additional rope to work with drew the nooses tight around the guards necks and with two sickening cracks, the guards' brief struggles came to an abrupt end as Kyri's weight added by the time spent falling proved to be enough force to break their necks.<br>
<br>
   At the sound of the cracks, Kyri dropped to the ground and slipped out the still open side gate before anyone else could react. Checking the guards she found the two who were hung lying on the ground, their heads at odd angles , as dead as the other two she dispatched only minutes before.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So much for fear eh?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she gazed down at one of the guards at her feet, the one who had made the comment as she left the area after the 'assassination' attempt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well NOW I feel better. Guess its time to go back and get a bit more pampering before the ascension. If anyone says anything, well, i just needed some air.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought as she slipped back into the night, making her way to the D'Vir estates. After all this ascension would be one talked about for months to come she was sure. And Kyri had a front row seat for it.<br>

Everyone was talking about the bold assassination of lord Ayon’daro. Nystyre was in the corner speaking earnestly to several other house members.  The young necromancer directly approached the group.<br>
<br>
“I have some additional information about the attack on the Chath’elg’Caress.”<br>
<br>
“Speak quickly, we must redress this affront to our house immediately!” En’garoth Firehand hissed. He was the house wizard and a renowned duelist in his own right.<br>
<br>
“We would do better to speak of this matter privately.”<br>
<br>
En’garoth gestured and the small group appeared in the head of the house’s quarters.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Maelgroth felt very alone.<br>
<br>
“There is no slight on your house. Ayon’daro foolishly got into the wrong carriage.” He began. “Even there he would have been safe, no harm would come to him on a journey to your house, regardless of how he arrived.”<br>
<br>
“It was not the fire hags.” Nystyre announced.<br>
<br>
“I would not look too closely at the details of this action, we shall make our claim on the souls of the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr public soon.” <br>
<br>
“You will do so immediately!” En’garoth howled.<br>
<br>
“Don’t make the mistake the Vlos’Shannaal made in their dealings with us!” Mael replied coldly. Even if he died this night his house would be remembered. He continued more quietly. “Ayon’daro was only killed after he left our carriage, if he refuses our hospitality, we cannot ensure his safety.”<br>
<br>
Nystyre began to chuckly dryly.<br>
<br>
“There is another reason why your investigation should not be too aggressive, and why you should encourage others to ignore this matter.” He continued.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth could hear the sounds of the party somewhere else in the manse, it was a distant murmur like a small stream hidden in a thick forest.<br>
<br>
“Your house could be implicated if the search were thorough enough.” <br>
<br>
“Explain!” En’garoth ordered.<br>
<br>
“It’s not necessary, I know what he speaks of.” Nystyre replied.<br>
<br>
“Let me assure you, the deaths of the guards was no part of my plan. The link is tenuous and the only houses that might work hard enough to find it are soon to be lost anyway.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
“That is not good enough.” The wizard hissed, now more angry at not having an enemy to kill than at the imagined slight to his house.<br>
<br>
“It will have to be, I imagine a certain organization would take issue with any actions taken against its membership.” He made the secret sign of the League of Shadows.<br>
<br>
“I doubt they would stand so closely behind one of your years.” En’garoth replied carefully.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps not for me, but most certainly for another.”<br>
<br>
“You are right there.” Nystyre observed wryly.<br>
<br>
“Finally, to demonstrate my wish for continued good relations between our houses I will place myself entirely in your hands.” Maelgroth removed his mask.<br>
<br>
The elders of house D’Vir, excepting its Scion, laughed with delight at the young face behind the mask.<br>
<br>
“My true name is Maelgroth Waes’Harventhar.”<br>
<br>
The elders immediately stopped laughing.<br>
<br>
Nystyre and Maelgroth took up the laughter as it dropped off from the startled elders.<br>
<br>
“This has indeed been a rare evening’s entertainment.” En’garoth replied, recovering from his initial shock. “You indeed have the look of your parent’s about you, still appearances can be faked, it is your houses legacy that has value.”<br>
<br>
“I thank you for the compliment.”<br>
<br>
“How do we know we have more than a single individual standing before us, possessing only what he could glean from the League’s vault and scavenge from the ruins of Kunark.” En’garoth finished carefully.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was totally at a loss on how to respond. Fortunately Nystyre was able to provide the answer.<br>
<br>
“Take this in your hand and tell me the Waes’Harventhars have lost their touch.” The powerful necromancer handed his chief wizard the Feir’Dal skin reply sent to him many months ago. It was still warm, pulsing with a life of its own.<br>
<br>
“You have known for so long?” the wizard muttered. <br>
<br>
“Suspected at first, true certainty came tonight.”<br>
<br>
“We would assume that your agent’s actions, which forced us before you, meet the requirements you set?” Maelgroth asked carefully replacing his mask and slipping back into the old tongue.<br>
<br>
“That one has exceeded our expectations, despite certain difficulties that present themselves from those actions, we are well pleased.” Nystyre replied in the same tongue gesturing towards the door.<br>
<br>
“I suppose I should give my regards to Athava, after all it is her Ascension day.” Maelgroth replied exiting the room.<br>
<br>
After the young Teir’Dal left, En’garoth turned to his lord. “He has certainly tied us up in a nice bow. What would you have us do?”<br>
<br>
“Let the game play out.”<br>

A servant was waiting outside the door to guide Maelgroth back to the party. As he followed the young Teir’Dal manservant through the manse he sighed in frustration. It would take many lifetimes to assemble the wealth and influence that the D’Vir possessed. Still, it would not be long before there was only one house left. The servant stopped and opened a set of double doors, he was back at the ascension.<br>
<br>
Kyri was relieved to see Maelgroth appear at the party, but more than a little concerned to notice that he had come from Nystyre’s quarters. Could the pup be attempting treachery? She thought about that for a moment and finally decided that someone who had played the game so well for so long would not make such a foolish mistake so close to the endgame. Still, perhaps she should check out the lay of the land before making her presence known to him. A gaggle of maidens frolicked past her, she used them for cover and ghosted over towards the bar.<br>
<br>
The party was well planned, the food was perfect as was the entertainment. Maelgroth allowed himself to enjoy the festivities, mingling freely with the crowd.<br>
<br>
“Jindrun’Belbol?” A quiet voice asked from behind Maelgroth.<br>
<br>
“You have found us.” He said, turning about, expecting to see Kyri at last. Instead there was a young Teir’Dal maiden standing there. She was wearing a mask made of spiderling silk, in fact a significant number of youngsters were wearing masks, it appeared the old fashion was making a comeback. In this case the silken mesh was so fine he could easily make out the features behind it. She was beautiful.<br>
<br>
“It seems you might have been expecting someone else?” came the reply, amusement and disappointment resonant in her tone.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps, but an unexpected guest often times brings the greatest delight.” Maelgroth chuckled, resorting to one of his mother’s favorite sayings.<br>
<br>
“You can call me Chal’zur’Khel (Serpent Body).”<br>
<br>
“As you wish, young one.” In reality she must have been only a few seasons his junior. His experienced eye took in new details. Power flickered in a cold aura about her, she was a necromancer and she was breathtakingly beautiful. “Are you among the guests this evening?” He asked eager for more information.<br>
<br>
“I am.” She said with an excited giggle. <br>
<br>
Her response told Maelgroth a great deal, first that she was un-married since she had not responded in the plural, and also that her house was not allied with the D’Vir.<br>
<br>
“Well, that is most interesting, I don’t suppose your matron sent you here unescorted?” He looked about the room for her bodyguard, unmarried maidens of high houses might be free to do as they pleased on their own time, but at formal affairs tradition dictated an honorguard.<br>
<br>
“My house takes little notice of the affairs of others, being too engrossed in research.” She said dismissively.<br>
<br>
“You mean you snuck out to attend the party with your friends?” He could see her skin darken behind the spiderling mask, she was blushing furiously.<br>
<br>
“Who do you think will win the war?” Chal asked, eager to change the subject. The bold murder of Lord Ayon’daro seemed to balance the scales between the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr.<br>
<br>
“Neither will win.”<br>
<br>
Chal listened to the grim certainty that accompanied that statement and knew that she had found a man who possessed the two qualities she admired most, a mind of his own and the ability to ruthlessly calculate house politics.<br>
<br>
“You seem sure…” She wheedled, taking his arm in hers and leading him off towards the bar. Surely he would have to take off his mask to drink. She could tell by the way he walked that he knew how to handle himself despite lacking the powerful build of a shadow knight or warrior.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth was about to reply with some additional information about the war, but stopped himself at the last moment. As they wended through the crowd, he thought he caught a glimpse of Kyri, but it was hard to tell, she was wearing a different dress and was surrounded by admirers.<br>
<br>
“It seems to us that both houses are now evenly matched, the stalemate could continue indefinitely.”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a loud boom rattled its way through the ballroom. The noise had come from outside.<br>
<br>
“The Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr are battling in the street!” one of the D’Vir footmen shouted.<br>
<br>
Quickly people headed towards the front of the room and the elaborately manicured courtyard that led outside. Chal scurried out the front door with an excited squeal, eager to see some blood shed. Mael followed her.<br>
<br>
Once they were outside, and beyond the shielding that protected the D’Vir manse itself the crackle of eldritch magics filled the air. Allready bodies were littering the street. It appeared both sides had miscalculated. The Fire Hags had summoned their strength, hoping to defeat the Ragar’Golhyrr before they recovered from the death of Ayon’daro. The Truth Finders, angered at the death of their leader had emptied their manor eager for revenge. Both houses had committed all their resources to an assault on the other’s fortified manor, they had run into each other in front of the D’Vir manse. Both houses were trapped. Neither could yield or flee the field before their peers without a total loss of face. This would be a fight to the finish.<br>
<br>
“A wise woman would cloak herself at a moment like this.” Maelgroth whispered into Chal’s delicate ear. She smelled like vanilla.<br>
<br>
“Of course, can you see to my safety?” She replied, her eyes flickered with power for a moment then she faded from normal view.<br>
<br>
“So long as you have no ties to either of these houses, I will do my best.” He said, viewing her invisible form with his eyes of the dead. He also wrapped his body in shadow and faded away.<br>
<br>
The pair watched the fight carefully, it was like a choreographed dance, tonight there were no mercenaries, no hired mages, all members of both houses participated in the battle from the least to the greatest.<br>
<br>
Chal shuddered with excitement as four Chath’elg’Caress warriors dragged a Ragar’Golhyrr noble from his horse and butchered him in the street like a pig. An instant later they were slain by an Ice comet.<br>
<br>
The slaughter continued for an hour, blood pooled steaming in the streets, seeping from the shattered corpses. The cries of the wounded were quickly silenced as they revealed themselves to their enemies. The odor of burnt flesh filled the cavern. At some point during that time Maelgroth and Chal began holding hands, it was one of the most romantic moments in his life.<br>

Corpses littered the street, here and there individual retainers of the two great houses, ocassionally piles of corpses where powerful members of the Truth Finders or the Fire Hags had made a last stand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it over?&quot; Chal shuddered breathlessly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hardly, though it seems the Chath'Elg'Caress have got the worst of it, despite beginning the battle with their leadership intact.&quot; Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;You seem disappointed.&quot; The maiden replied turning to face the masked necromancer.<br>
<br>
&quot;I had hoped the Chath'Elg'Caress would have done better against the Ragar'Golhyrr.&quot; He sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have a wager on the outcome of this war?&quot; Chal chirped delighted.<br>
<br>
&quot;You could say that.&quot; Maelgroth chuckled, escorting her back towards the De'Vir manse. He looked for Kyri in the crowd, but saw nothing but the amused faces of other Teir'Dal nobles. 'Probably out looting the dead and prying secrets from the dying.' He thought to himself.<br>
<br>
Once they reached the safety of the De'Vir front gate Maelgroth reluctantly let go of Chal. &quot;I have business to attend to, but I should have it completed before the Ascension.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't take too long.&quot; Chal giggled, &quot;I can't stay out as late as I would like, after all I am representing my house.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he walked away, he chided himself for not asking whose house she belonged to. Still, he needed to concentrate. One of the dead in the street was a high ranking member of the Chath'Elg'Caress. He needed to speak with that corpse before its memories began to fade.<br>
<br>
“Well, what have you learned brother?” Maelgroth asked his brother Malingrad. He was curious to see if his scouting of the Sol’Calar manse had gone well.<br>
<br>
“Better than expected.” Malingrad grinned, he had begun the mission with the belief that Mael had sent him into an ambush, hoping to replace him with another skilled rogue named Kyri. The mission had not been nearly as dangerous as he had feared. “The secret passages remain secret.” He chuckled, “They are very few in number, no more than a dozen members including servants. I could have attended to the matter then, but I assumed you would want to deal the final blow yourself.”<br>
<br>
The rogue watched his brother carefully, for the first time since the war of houses had begun he seemed distracted. Sure, the fire for vengeance still burned like the cursed sun, but he appeared a bit preoccupied. “I heard the Ragar’Golhyrr and the Chath’elg’Caress are broken, spending their strength in a battle in front of the D’Vir manse.” He hoped to draw out his brother with the question. They were alone in the small shack in third gate where the family had grown up. His mother and sister being away from Third Gate on other business.<br>
<br>
“You were correct in that assumption.” The necromancer replied turning his gaze directly on his brother. He found his mind kept wandering back to the maiden he had encountered at the Ascension. He turned is attention back to matters at hand, there would be time to seek out a mate once this matter of vengeance was concluded. <br>
<br>
“It was quite pleasing to see our enemies destroy each other for our entertainment, I am sorry you had to miss it. Still it is for the best that we remain in the shadows for now. The Chath’elg’Caress still have their matron mother, until she has joined her family in Innoruuk’s embrace we are at risk.”<br>
<br>
“I shall begin the search immediately.” Malingrad enthused, this was the kind of work he excelled at. “Any clues on her whereabouts?” <br>
<br>
“Where do high houses go when they fall brother?”<br>
<br>
“That’s too perfect!” Mal laughed, rising from the table and heading out into the darkness. Finding a matron mother hiding out in Third Gate would be about as difficult as picking a drunken troll’s pocket, and about as dangerous.<br>
<br>
After his brother had swaggered out of the shack, Maelgroth strode purposefully towards the back of the shack, pulling aside a rotted curtain that served as a divider, he looked down upon the mutilated corpse of a Teir’Dal noble.<br>
<br>
Energy crept from the necromancer’s outstretched hand, glistening tendrils of eldritch power, which caressed the corpse lovingly. After a moment the corpse began to twitch.<br>
<br>
“Tell me more of you plans.” Maelgroth said conversationally.<br>

Slipping away from the party was simple enough, a fake show of faintness at the sounds of slaughter was enough of an excuse to slip away to the room where she was allowed to keep her gear during this exercise.<br>
<br>
   No one had noticed one more body out their going over the corpses. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guess Maelgroth, had this thing set up pretty tight, those old houses wouldn't be at each other's throats if not for whatever he's been doing to rile them up.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided as she slipped back inside the estate while everyone was preoccupied with the results of the fighting. As she came inside she found herself face to face with her employer.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah so good of you to grace us with your presence.&quot; D'Vir began a slight frown on his face. &quot;So tell me, when were you going to bother letting me know what you knew about this Waes'Harventhar who resides in the same halls as you?&quot;<br>
<br>
   Kyri replied, &quot;You wanted to know what he was up to, what resources he had and who he was. I've been watching him to make sure he is of no threat to you of course. So i had to gain his trust first. Seems like someone looking to get back what was his, as house D'vir was not one of those houses there was no threat to you unless there's something i didn't hear about. Besides one Shadow watches the other, that is the source of our strength&quot;<br>
<br>
   D'vir colly responded &quot;Fool! I not you decide what matters to house D'Vir. It does not matter if you think there is a threat or not. If there is information i want it immediately, I can not react without knowing all there is to know.&quot; then a bit more relaxed he added <br>
<br>
  &quot;Of course your loyalty to your house is to be commended, and such an association will indeed put you in the posisition to learn more. How far does this upstart plan to go? I must say he has done an admirable job so far in causing disarray to his foes, especially considering the size of his house. If you find out more i expect i'll be notified much sooner next time, or perhaps i will need to find another operative for this?&quot; he finished eyes narrowing<br>
<br>
  Agahst at the idea of losing out on the pay for this job and the hit her reputation would take from it Kyri assured him. &quot;No, fine, you don't want to give me any initiative or let me keep the minor stuff out of your hands then fine, i'll tell you what they had for breakfast to aid in your plotting.&quot; she added sarcasticly, wishing for once she learned how to control her tongue.<br>
<br>
   Oddly D'Vir seemed amused at the comment. Kyri not realizing that it had been quite some time since anyone dared speak to him in such a manner, it was somewhat refreshing to hear. &quot;Good enough, now that we understand each other, this Ascension is about done. The rest of the night is yours. Enjoy&quot; he said turning and walking back to his rooms.<br>
<br>
  Standing behind him Kyri thought to herself,<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>well i guess i should go find Maelgroth</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided as she made her way back to the league quarters. It seems there was a message she had to write... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/03 4:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> Maelgroth hurried back to the D’Vir manse, his interrogation of the Chath’elg’Caress corpse had indeed been fruitful, they had beggared themselves in this last assault, calling in all favors summoning even the dregs of their own house, those members who normally were not considered members of the house itself, the dispossessed, the incompetent and the disloyal, they all lay in heaps now, stinking carrion before the gates the the D’vir. Still preparations had been made for escape should the assault prove a failure. Maelgroth was now privy to those plans.<br>
<br>
The master of protocol, Vilkev, announced his arrival with the same ringing yet un-emotional tones that he had announced all the other returning guests to the Ascension. It might be one of the most dramatic and bloody nights in recent memory but the D’Vir would carry on as if the bloody battle in front of their gates was a part of the entertainment.<br>
<br>
He looked for Chal, but found another instead.<br>
<br>
“We need to talk.” Kyri whispered, gliding into his sight in a flawless dress. <br>
<br>
“Indeed we do.” Maelgroth replied grimly.<br>
<br>
Surprised at the cold attitude of the necromancer Kyri led him to a quiet alcove without comment. Once safely within the embrace of the alcove they began to talk in earnest. Still Kyri changed her body language to suit that of a young maiden sizing up a potential suitor, no one could hear what was said but a lot could be guessed, two guests hissing at each other in an alcove would certainly attract more attention than a pair of youngsters flirting.<br>
<br>
“I have spoken with D’Vir, he pressed me hard about information concerning our relationship.” Her face was hard and un-emotional, much like the mask Maelgroth wore, her back was to the crowd of guests, they saw a giggling bouncing maiden.<br>
<br>
“He knows more than you think, your action at the Ragar’Golhyrr manse against their guards has potentially drawn the D’Vir into the war of houses, especially since Vynna K’yari could be linked with the death of those guards.” Maelgroth hissed, he had picked up on Kyri’s ruse and his body language was of a male pleading for some “private time.”<br>
<br>
“What have you told him?” Her voice was like flint, the smile like summer wine.<br>
<br>
“I have revealed myself to him and to his top aids. I have also told him of our link through the league…” He watched Kyri’s hand slide unconsciously towards her hip, looking for her trusty dagger. Suddenly he was glad they were in a setting where such accoutrements were out of place. Realizing she could possibly kill him before he could react with some hidden weapon he pressed on. “I have assured him that I have no interest in entangling my houses vengeance with his, nor did I encourage you to take the actions you took.” He watched the hand leave her hip and slide to his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“You tread very dangerous ground.” Kyri growled, her hand found a delicate cluster of nerves between the necromancer’s neck and ear. From a distance her touch appeared gentle, but fingers trained in long hours of lock picking and pickpocketing were deceptively strong. Her grip would make a warrior weep with pain.<br>
<br>
“So do you.” Maelgroth replied icily, the pain in his neck was quite bracing, he was sure it would be quite impressive to someone who was not so deeply in league with the dead. To a powerful necromancer who made a living killing himself by inches in exchange for power, physical pain was something long vanquished.<br>
<br>
“Where do we go from here?” Kyri replied, relinquishing her grip, her fingers were getting sore, the gouge marks on Maelgroth’s neck were quite deep, and obviously ineffectual. “I am committed to staying close to you, to learn your secrets now.”<br>
<br>
“Well, it looks like D’Vir is going to pay you to work for me then.” He laughed, for the first time since his return. “I believe he favors our cause, at least indirectly, he could have ordered you off the job.”<br>
<br>
“What’s next then?” <br>
<br>
“I will have business very soon in Third Gate, a mutual acquaintance of ours has retired there, my house will be paying her a visit soon.” Mael chuckled.<br>
<br>
Kyri suddenly realized how valuable a position the Waes’Harventhars occupied, nearly all the noble houses were blind when it came to Third Gate, the less they thought about it the better. The very survival of this exiled house, under the very noses if its enemies attested to this lack of vision. No one could move about the foreign quarter more easily and without comment than someone who had been there for a century, newcomers would stand out. Mael’s contacts in Third Gate might even rival her own.<br>
<br>
“Anything else, you care to share?”<br>
<br>
“Not at this time, but we should speak again soon.” He replied, watching her saunter away from the alcove.<br>
<br>
“And Here I Thought You Only Had Eyes For ME!” Chal hissed, storming past him with a sour look.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Maelgroth realized this evening could not come to a close quickly enough.<br>

His mother was waiting for him at the entrance to his rooms.  <br>
<br>
“Tell me of the battle, was there much blood? By Innoruuks Curse I wish I could have seen those houses destroying each other!” She shouted.<br>
<br>
“Quiet, we must still be cautious.” Mael hissed, hurriedly closing the door. The ancient crone was in one of the most agitated states he had ever seen her in. Madness gleamed in her fevered eyes like heat radiated from hot coals. <br>
<br>
He examined the room carefully. All was as it should be. <br>
<br>
“Its true both houses have spent their strength in the street outside of the D’Vir manse.” The necromancer began.<br>
<br>
“I knew it, the day has arrived!”<br>
<br>
“The Ragar Golhyrr are shattered and leaderless, cowering in their house awaiting the end.” He smiled. “We must move quickly, other lesser houses will move against them as soon as they realize there will be no further assaults from the Chath’elg’Caress.”<br>
<br>
“I understand, your sister and I shall deal with the dregs of the Ragar Golhyrr.” Naelaelayle growled.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth looked at his mother carefully, surprised that she would offer to take such a direct hand, having orchestrated much of this war from the shadows. <br>
<br>
“Malingrad should also be available to help, he should have finished his task in Third Gate by now.”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?” His mother queried, already she was sharpening her knives, they made an evil hiss as they stroked the whetstone. <br>
<br>
“He is looking for the Fire Hag matron, rumor has it she has fled to Third Gate, I shall finish her myself.”<br>
<br>
“I suppose we should get moving then.” Naelaelayle grinned, the knives disappearing into her robe with a flourish.<br>
<br>
As the two made their way from the League manor neither noticed the figure shadowing them from a distance.<br>

As she flitted through the shadows she made a mental tally of the benefits earned so far from the house war. New contacts had made themselves known amongst the first houses; she would not lack for opportunities to practice her craft. Not to mention the more immediate rewards from working for Nystyre. <br>
<br>
The tables at the D’Vir manse had literally groaned under the weight of the gifts for the ascension, a good portion of which she was sure would go towards the upkeep of a certain heretofore unknown niece from Mistmoore. Indeed, there was much the ebon mask in general and Kyri in particular would gain from these long months of work. <br>
<br>
Naelaelayle and Maelgroth reached their old shack in third gate without incident. Malingrad was waiting impatiently.<br>
<br>
“It took you long enough,” Malingrad hissed, “She is lurking amongst the trolls, as if that would keep her invisible.”<br>
<br>
“It is as I expected.” The necromancer replied calmly. He stared at his brother, such behavior was not acceptable. His mother seemed not to notice his step brother’s lack of respect.<br>
<br>
“You will assist your mother against the dregs of the Ragar’Golhyrr.” He said finally, when the silence had stretched on for an uncomfortable period. “If you survive the assault, I will expect an improved attitude from you Malingrad, I do not have time to properly chastise you now.” Maelgroth growled. He had grown in power and now he easily eclipsed that of his brother the rogue. He had little to fear.<br>
<br>
“Of course, your will is my law,” Malingrad replied in the old tongue. “I apologize for my lack of respect, it has not been long enough to break the habits of a lifetime.” The two, mother and son, slipped from the shack and headed back towards Third Gate, leaving Maelgroth to his business with the Chath’elg’Caress.<br>
<br>
“I will have to work harder if I wish to keep my head.” Malingrad mutterd.<br>
<br>
“Indeed you shall, but not in the way you think.” Naelaelayle muttered.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean?”<br>
<br>
“We were a servant house of the Waes’Harventhars, did you ever think about how we came to that position?” the elderly Teir’Dal snarled.<br>
<br>
“I must admit I have not.” The rogue replied, wondering why his mother had decided to share this information with him now. <br>
<br>
“We were once a noble house in our own right, but we crossed the Waes’Harventhars and as punishment we became their slaves. Long had we plotted their downfall, but we were too slow, others struck before us.” She coughed delicately before continuing. “We have a score to settle with those houses that have forced us to wait for our vengeance. Only through destroying the last of the Waes’Harventhars at the moment of their glory will we reclaim our honor.”<br>
<br>
“So, he is not to be treated with respect?” the rogue chuckled darkly.<br>
<br>
“He is to be treated with all the respect he deserves.” Naelaelayle snickered. “Every day I had to care for that vermin, each sacrifice I had to make, denying my own family food and shelter, training and education in order to prepare for this day. I never forgot who we were. Oh yes, vengeance is coming, we will make those houses that stole our retribution pay first, then the Skinflayer.”<br>
<br>
“I had no idea you were so devious.” Malingrad snorted as they passed the third gate and entered the noble quarter proper.<br>
<br>
‘Neither did I.’ Kyri thought to herself as she ghosted along behind the scheming pair.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth had little trouble finding the sniveling matron of the Chath’elg’Caress, she was crouched in an alley killing rats for money. A tarnished table knife bearing her house crest trembled in her hand.<br>
<br>
“You have fallen far.” Maelgroth proclaimed.<br>
<br>
“Indeed we have, but we shall rise again, great riches can be yours if you aid us now.” The matron pled.<br>
<br>
“I already have all the wealth I require.”<br>
<br>
“We can help you, you can assume our position amongst the great houses, take us into your service, we will serve you well.” She wheedled.<br>
<br>
“I will be assuming a station very soon, one that your house long coveted, a position that took four houses to fill.” The necromancer replied. <br>
<br>
She stared at him uncomprehendingly. <br>
<br>
“It was our hand that turned the Ragar’Golhyrr against you. It was our blade that stripped the skin from your daughter’s face, our vengeance that brought the head of the Truth Finders to his grave. We have been the architects of your downfall.”<br>
<br>
“Why?” the once proud matron whined. All sense of pride and self respect withering away.<br>
<br>
“Think on it, fool, had you half the skill of your forebears you would have figured it out by now, it took four of you to bring us low, since our return we have not hidden ourselves.”<br>
<br>
“You are the one wearing a mask.” The matron snapped, regaining a bit of her former grit.<br>
<br>
“It is time to see the truth.” Maelgroth removed the mask, and grinned at her.<br>
<br>
“Your face, it is familiar to me…surely we have had dealings in the past?” she began. Her eyes widened with shock when she saw the flaying knife in his other hand. <br>
<br>
“Waes’Harventhar…” she gasped in terror as a spell paralyzed her.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, now you will pay for what you did.” Carefully Maelgroth began to peel the skin from the matron’s face, this time he paid special attention to the many muscles that enabled her to smile, to laugh, those along with her tongue would be coming with him. Blood spurted wildly, painting the walls of the alley. This face would be joining another. When he was done, he left the mutilated corpse for the rats, and the trolls.<br>

Waiting in place another fifteen minutes to ensure they did not linger near, she slipped away in the shadows on her way to the D'Vir estates once more.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That's unexpected , Maelgroths allies are anything but that, just people going the same way he is at the moment.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well i'll have to warn him about that later but this time its to my employer first. Maybe he knows more about this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  Making her way stealthily to the estate, Kyri slipped through the agreed upon places in the estates defenses which she and Nystyre worked out early on in her employment. Making her way inside she made her way to D'Vir's lesser office, where all previous contact had taken place and waited for her patron. In time she recognized his footsteps and stepped forth into plain sight in front of his desk.<br>
<br>
   The door openned and if D'Vir was surprised by her presence there he hid it well and instead asked, as he he had summoned her here to begin with, &quot;What news?&quot; <br>
<br>
   &quot;Nice to see you too.&quot; Kyri muttered as she stepped aside to allow Nystyre to reach his desk where he sat and looked at her expectantly.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Well it seems this game with the Waes’Harventhars has yet another unexpected player.&quot; Kyri began as she related the revelation she had overheard between Malingrad and Naelaelayle and concluded adding, &quot;So I figured you more than anyone would know what house they're talking about.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Indeed I am certain I could uncover this yet another missing house trying to gather itself from the dust. Perhaps I shall, perhaps not.&quot; D'Vir answered, &quot;How old is this news?&quot; he added with a meaningful look.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Less than an hour old.&quot; Kyri replied knowing the real question was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Did you once more delay news to me to warn your Shadow comrade?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;Once the coast was clear i came right over, i'll be telling Maelgroth as soon as i can get him away from the others. Doesn't do anyone any good to tell him with his betrayers standing right there after all.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Indeed,&quot; Nystyre added musingly, &quot;Very well, this is quite interesting news. It will be interesting to see how things turn out. If you have nothing else to report...&quot; he added as he prepared to get back to his paperwork.<br>
<br>
   &quot;No that's all for now, i'll let you know what else turns up but figured you wanted to hear about this twist right away.&quot; Kyri replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes and it is good to see your priorities are back where they should. You may go now.&quot; Nystyre concluded as Kyri, dismissed, left the room. After the door closed behind her Nystyre abandoned the pretence of his current work and looked over to the shelf where his Codex of the Houses of Neriak lay and walked over to the shelf. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Very interesting news</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself as he pulled the Codex out and began to study.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That went well</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself sourly as the interview concluded and she left the estates, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>at least he doesn't plan to be replacing me any time soon at least, that wouldn't help my reputation if people found out i got booted from a job, especially if it meant i'd most likely be found face down in the sewers as a result.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Now how to warn Maelgroth, there's always at least one member of his family around in his quarters, especially the old woman. Not to mention how he will react if he finds out his step-mother has been plotting against him from infancy. well only one way to find out i suppose.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri concluded as she returned to the League manor.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Hmm this should work</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself with a smile as she reached her quarters. Noting the woman who who was most upset at finding her and Maelgroth together the other night and discovering her identity, Kyri thought she had the perfect deception in case the wrong people found the note first but innocent enough that they would pass it on.<br>
<br>
  So Kyri wrote the following message to have one of the League servants she had bribed into her service deliver to the manor guards in disguise. Being an apprentice to the trade it would be a good test for the youngster anyway, a mere slip of a girl still, barely out of adolescence. The note was rather simple.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Chal’zur’Khel,<br>
<br>
        I apologize for my outburst the other night when i saw you with that woman. I am still young and tempermental as my house would say. I must speak with you right away to make amends if we could meet near where we first met tomorrow night after the gates are closed for the night.<br>
<br>
     Humbly Yours,<br>
                  Chal</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  As Kyri completed the note and called for the young theif serving her to deliver it she thought to herself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well that should get Malegroth there, young love and all that nonsence.  Too bad i'll be the one waiting for him not his girlfriend, ah well he'll survive, especially once i warn him of the vipers in his midst. Besides after all these notes he might recognize my writing by now anyway.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
    <br>
    Folding up the note and sealing it with a plain seal- the type a young woman might uise in a message to her paramour when she did not wish the tryst to be publicly known, she passed the note to the servant and explained to her the next &quot;test&quot; in her training. Smiling at the challenge the servant hid the note in her pocket and went off to work on her disguise while Kyri sat back and did the only thing she could do. She waited. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/22/03 5:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> Maelgroth hurried back to his quarters in the League manse. It had been a truly eventful night, one that he wished he could share with someone else. His thoughts drifted back to the young Teir’Dal maiden, Chal, perhaps he would seek her out soon. Thoughts of a brief yet tumultuous courtship kept him company as he worked on the face recently taken from the matron of the Fire Hags. <br>
<br>
“We were successful!” Panted Naelaelayle, her arms were stained with blood to the elbows. <br>
<br>
“It is as I expected, you three are capable enough to handle the remains of a broken house.” Mael replied distractedly, he was at a difficult part in the stitching, if the face were to animate properly it had to be done right, the first time. <br>
<br>
‘You are more right than you suspect.’ His stepmother thought to herself. She hated being so close to her stepson. He had grown in power frighteningly fast, and his skill with needle and flaying knife had finally eclipsed hers. Looking at him was like looking into the eyes of his parents, eyes that still haunted her sleep, eyes she had wished to pluck out of the owner’s skull and pickle in a brine of tears. <br>
<br>
“We shall move against the Sol’Calar soon?” She pleaded, eager to be done with this masquerade. <br>
<br>
“Indeed, we must not delay our vengeance over long.” He replied, carefully arranging the hair so it artfully covered the elaborate stitching that held the face to the tanning rack. <br>
<br>
“Did my half brother survive the night?”<br>
<br>
“He did, and already labors to make good his earlier mistake.” Naelaelayle replied. She did not trust her son to keep their secret longer than he thought necessary. He would remain apart from the clan until it was time for the assault on the last house. <br>
<br>
“It is my right to determine an adequate penalty, see to it that he presents himself to me soon, it will go hard on him if I must seek him out.” The necromancer replied, finally turning from his work. <br>
<br>
“It shall be done as you request.” His step mother replied in the old tongue. The face in the rack was perfect. Already the eyelids twitched with flickering eldritch energies. Soon it would fulfill its proper task.<br>
<br>
“Do we have any proper courting clothes in the vault?” Maelgroth asked hesitantly.<br>
<br>
“Probably, I never thought to look for any.” She replied getting up and shuffling over to the elaborate chest. Carefully she reached out to lift the lid, these things were sentient after a fashion, each time she touched it her loyalty to the Waes’Harventhars was evaluated, she shuddered to think what would happen to her were it to be found wanting. <br>
<br>
It was much harder than usual to coax the chest open this time. <br>
<br>
“Have you found someone suitable?” She muttered, as she sorted through an impressive array of artifacts. The chest would only allow her to remove items that would be of service to the house, some things could be removed easily, others, the most treasured items of the Waes’Harventhars, could only be taken at the express request of the head of the house. There were several items in the chest that would make lesser houses weep with jealousy. Some had once belonged to her own clan, now they only came into her hands at the will of another. Soon that would be rectified… <br>
<br>
Malingrad was watching his sister from the shadows. She was at prayer, reviewing all the indignities visited upon her during her life, hate smoldered in her eyes like lava, thick and heavy.<br>
<br>
He was unsure whether to share his new information with her. She had been punished by their half brother and no doubt would harbor a grudge of impressive proportions against him, but she was at heart one who followed, not one who led. He felt sure she would support her family when the time came. Bringing her in on the secret would only increase the chances of tipping off their prey. Deceit was never one of her strong points. <br>
<br>
He slipped out of the temple without attracting any attention. He had some business to conclude before the assault on the Sol’Calar. The Ebon Mask would be receiving quite a donation this eve. Poisons quick enough to incapacitate a magic user by blocking access to their mystical energies were not cheap.<br>
<br>
He did not notice the shadow that flitted along at his side. <br>

He had never received such a letter, and it, more than anything else spoke of the benefits to be reaped once his vengeance was complete.<br>
<br>
He looked around his quarters hurriedly, he might have time to see her before the raid on the Sol’Calar. His mother had with some hesitation picked out a rather ornate robe, it was entirely too colorful for his taste, being a vibrant blue, but he paid heed to her comment that the robe would alter its coloring to suit the mood of the wearer. <br>
<br>
‘I had better calm myself before, donning it.’ He thought to himself, it would not do to arrive for a tryst in a vermillion cloak. Carefully he set about preparing himself for the evening. He surrounded himself with protective magics and prepared himself for the battle to come. As his heart cooled he debated showing up at all, meeting Chal before battle would surely cause his concentration to suffer, ultimately he decided that not meeting her would have an even worse effect. <br>
<br>
He donned the garish robe and watched in wonderment as its color changed to a stately grey. Tiny skulls appeared in place of the mithral buttons and another larger one appeared on the back of the robe. This robe would indeed do for a young nobleman of the first gate. He affixed the mask he had worn to all the official functions he had attended in Neriak and strode out of his room.<br>
<br>
“Where do you think you are going?” His step-mother croaked at him. “You know we are slated to assault the Sol’Calar this very eve.”<br>
<br>
For a moment Maelgroth was transported back to his adolescence, when this woman had ruled his life. It took a moment to recover himself. <br>
<br>
“I have a small matter to attend to before the attack. I will meet the rest of the family at the appointed time at the secret entrance to the Eye Eater’s manse.” He replied uneasily, he knew she would not countenance a meeting with a maiden so close to battle. Indeed it was truly foolish. Still he rushed to see her. <br>
<br>
As soon as he was gone Naelaelayle chuckled, she knew a love note when she saw one. He would be an easier target than she hoped. She strode purposefully towards the chest. Tonight she would try to reclaim what was hers.<br>
<br>
She spoke the word of command in a harsh whisper. Nothing happened. She reached out to touch the chest, then stopped herself. She could always open it later, once the last of the Waes’Harventhars was dead, the magic of the vault would be gone. With a snort of disgust she left her quarters and headed towards the rendezvous point. Her dagger was warm against her thigh, the potent venom Malingrad had coated it with, was slowly dissolving the leather sheath, it would do worse to the flesh of her step son. <br>
<br>
Maelgroth cloaked himself in shadow soon after leaving his mother. He had no desire to seem to eager, or to walk into an ambush prepared by the last remainders of the Chath’elg’Caress or the Ragar’Golhyrr. He looked about carefully with the eyes of the dead, aside from a few aspiring rogues in the second gate area he saw noting out of the ordinary. He  hastened to the D’Vir manse.<br>
<br>
This thought gave him pause, could this be an ambush by the D’Vir? Would they prevent him from finishing his vengeance, destroying a rising house before it had a chance to flower? He wondered. After a moment he decided that it would not be in their best interest or their style. Still he would have to be careful. <br>
<br>
Kyri was watching Maelgroth carefully as he made is way across the cobblestoned streets of First Gate, he was obviously alone. She noted with some pride that he had taken the precaution of hiding his presence from the unskilled and that his aura glittered with powerful wards. ‘A fool in love, but no fool in life.’ She thought to herself as she glided out from behind the wall she had stationed herself at. Her skill was great indeed, but only a fool trusted skill alone when a stone wall presented itself.<br>

Clad in a hooded robe of some quality- the sort of thing a noblewoman might wear when off to some secret liason to hide her identity from the gossips, she walked into his view and waited for him to approach. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Poor guy, thinking his sweetie is here for him. I supppose he'll be a bit upset when he finds out its me and the girl knows nothing about this. But he's smart enough to understand the reason when i tell him.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as he neared. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Too bad Malingard wouldn't tip his hand regarding the sister, I hate leaving loose ends that might cause trouble lying around. Still no time to wait or else Maelgroth's step mother might make her move.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   Keeping her head lowered so Maelgroth could not recognize her right, Kyri waited until he drew near and whispered just loud enough for him to hear. &quot;Greetings Maelgroth, I have news for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Recognizing Kyri's voiuce, Maelgroth grew visibly upset before calming himself as he hissed back coolly &quot;What are you doing here? I'm expecting another.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Nodding, as she looked him in the eye Kyri went on, &quot;My apologies for the deception but i needed to ensure that you and you alone came to meet me. A letter from one you are fond of seemed the best method to allay any suspisions towards a solo journey.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;What suspisions do you mean? You could have sent me a message through the guild halls easily enough, no prying eyes dwell there.&quot; Maelgroth replied, then adding a bit wistfully, &quot;So she knows nothing of this then?&quot;<br>
<br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; Kyri said quietly, &quot;she knows nothing of the note, in fact i have not seen her since that night. But the guildhouse is not safe, at least for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Speak plainly, I am in no mood for your games tonight. How is the guild house not safe for me?&quot; Maelgroth demanded.<br>
<br>
   Deciding she may as well not bother to try to soften the blow any Kyri jumped right into the matter. &quot;It is not safe because I heard your step mother, your servant in the halls, speaking to your brother about taking her revenge on the last of the Waes'Harventhar for enslaving her family after some long ago house battle.&quot; Kyri stated firmly. <br>
<br>
     &quot;She has gone along with you because she was jealous that other houses brought yours down denying her the pleasure of it. Now that you are about to reclaim your place, she thinks her time to act against you comes very soon. Your brother is working with her, i haven't been able to tell if the priestess is as well. I trailed your brother to the temple yesterday after i discovered this but he did not make contact with her.&quot;<br>
 <br>
    &quot;D'Vir is aware of this plotting as well, in case you wondered, cause i'm not giving him an excuse to cut me out of this job after all this time. I did suggest he look into which house this was since i'm sure you don't have the entire book of the family history in the Third Gate, not to mention what may have been editted out of what you DID have. He didn't seem to curious though.&quot;<br>
<br>
    &quot;So that's why i needed this ruse to get you alone here. I'd knew you'd be upset when you found out the truth. A straightforward note might mean you would be followed. A young man meeting his would-be lover on the other hand would not arouse anything but perhaps amusement if the note was discovered by your step mother or brother, they'd think that you're seeking out love when you yourself were about to be brought down. If you had a better way of getting this news to you safely i'd be happy to try it next time.&quot; Kyri concluded<br>
<br>
   Maelgroth just stood there silently as he took all this in. His world suddenly going off on an unforseen tangent just as the moment victory was in his grasp. The assault on the Sol'Calar was this very night and now it seemed his allies were anything but that. Kyri leaned back against the walls of the estate and waited for Maelgroth to digest this all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/03 9:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> “They plot against me?” The necromancer hissed in shock.<br>
<br>
“Indeed, they have been planning revenge since before the fall of your house.” Kyri replied skeptically. She sensed the hand of the Lord of Hate in this matter, the twists and turns were too abrupt to be anything else. Not for the first time she considered cutting her losses and returning to her vagabond life. Lord Platinum required little in the way of emotion. <br>
<br>
They stood quietly together before the gates of the D’Vir manse, the dead air of the grand cavern was still and quiet. <br>
<br>
“Well, I guess I had better be careful then.” Maelgroth replied with a grin. <br>
<br>
Kyri was suddenly grateful that he was not the sort to punish the messenger for bad news. The smile was cold, as cold as velium and as dazzling. <br>
<br>
“Perhaps you could be of service to me, in a small matter.”<br>
<br>
“Of course.” Kyri replied already thinking of the considerable stock of poisons she had on hand.<br>
<br>
“If I fall, I would not have the treasures of my clan fall into the hands of some degenerate servants. Perhaps you could move the vault to Didi’s quarters, she has taken the lodging of the late Lord Gray, I am sure she has the space.” He began, seeing her look of betrayal, he hastily added, “Should I not return, you may take what action you will, but I would leave you the option of not becoming a target, my mother will be able to track the location of the chest, for at least a little while.”<br>
<br>
“As you wish, Waes’Harventhar.” Kyri replied slipping into shadows. As she flitted away she was calculating how long it would take to reach the league manse, move the chest and return to keep an eye on Maelgroth. She doubted his family would be overhasty in their revenge.<br>
<br>
“It seems many matters will be settled this eve…” Maelgroth mused as he turned towards the Sol’Calar manse, it was in Second Gate, several blocks from the D’Vir manse, and was the ancestral home of the Waes’Harventhars, being their seat of power for many centuries before their rise to the First.<br>
<br>
Many times in his youth he had passed this house, quickly, carefully, mindful of the part its current occupants had played in his current status. It was well kept, and its wards intact, save where the Sol’Calar had failed to detect the old secret door. His eyes of the dead detected his brother and mother lurking in the shadows near the hidden entrance.<br>
<br>
“How was your meeting?” Malingrad leered.<br>
<br>
“More interesting than I had expected, brother.” Malegroth replied.<br>
<br>
“You two can blather on about your conquests after this night is through.” Their mother hissed. She was eager to begin, and her knives kept creeping into her hands, like a cat’s claws lurked in its paw.<br>
<br>
“Where is Bliss?”<br>
<br>
“She shall join us once we enter, she was never one for stealth.” Naelaelayle chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Lets get this business done!” The necromancer growled, summoning a skeletal servant and striding purposefully towards the secret door. It gibbered eagerly at his heels, hungry for the life force of the living. His family followed in his wake.<br>
<br>
It seemed the Sol’Calar had not worked hard at the wards in their new home after the fall of the Waes’Harventhars, their defenses were good, but brittle. Easily breached. They started in the servant’s quarters and found them to be mostly empty, those few servants they encountered were easily and soundlessly slain.<br>
<br>
The second floor proved more of a challenge, Naelaelayle and Malingrad moved like wraiths killing family members as they slept, their knives wept blood on the ornate carpeting, indigo tears patterned the walls as a house silently fell. Malegroth left them to the butchery, and crept forward to the third floor, carefully dispelling wards as he went, though he left a few behind to warn of the approach of his brother, should he get sloppy enough to fail to check for them himself. <br>
<br>
He entered a hallway, festooned with the portraits of Sol’Calar ancestors, they all seemed to be scowling at him as he advanced towards the set of double doors that would lead to the master bedroom. There was a smaller door to his right, obviously for a child, he would leave that to his kin, he had business with the masters of this house and would not be delayed.<br>
<br>
Enchantments crumbled under the bony fists of his servant and in an instant the door was split in two and he stood before the heads of the household.<br>
<br>
Cael Sol’Calar had been the war leader of his house for centuries and careful plotting had led him to the bed chamber and later the marriage altar of the Matron of the Eye Eaters. He was no stranger to house warfare, yet, it had been easy to lapse into that somnambulant state that gripped many of the houses in Neriak. Many times he had debated plans for this very day with his mate I’rsalla, but she had preferred to spend time in her studies of rare plant life than to worry about the distant chance that someone might move against them.<br>
<br>
The Sol’Calar had made a practice of not participating in politics, in fact they had only rolled the bones once, and that time it had paid off, in spades. The fall of the Waes’Harventhars had yielded up many books of lore that had kept I’rsalla entranced for many a year. When no one came within the first decade to claim them by force, her guard slipped a little, now in the tenth decade of the fall of the Skin Takers, ownership of the books had become a moot point, no one was going to claim them.<br>
<br>
The figure standing in the wreckage of their doorway proved their claim was transitory at best.<br>
<br>
I’rsalla squeeled in outrage as the door caved in and began to frantically struggle to recall at least a shred of combat magic.<br>
<br>
Cael took in the measure of his foe at a glance.<br>
<br>
“You shall not have the pleasure of adorning your gates with our faces!” He hissed, drawing his sword. It had been an age since he had needed it, still he had practiced with it regularly. He knew he was well past his prime, but he would deny the Skin Takers their vengeance.<br>
<br>
He swung with all his strength. The blade seemed to be light as a feather, he could almost see it cut the air as it moved. I’rsalla’s eyes met his and understanding flooded into them, understanding and acceptance.<br>
<br>
Her head remained on her torso for a moment, so clean was the cut, then it fell, spilling blood over the ornate bristlesilk sheets from kunark. <br>
<br>
Maelgroth simply stared in shock.<br>
<br>
“You can claim what we have taken from you, but that is all of our’s you shall ever possesses!” Cael roared drawing the hungry blade across his own throat, it drank deeply.<br>
<br>
As the light dimmed from the older Teir’Dal warrior’s eyes, Maelgroth saluted him. He would not desecrate their corpses. He had other matters to attend to.<br>
<br>
He turned to head back downstairs, but saw that his brother and mother had settled their business on the second floor, they were headed towards him all smiles. <br>
<br>
“Is it done?” Malingrad asked eagerly.<br>
<br>
“Nearly.” Maelgroth replied, preparing a spell that would rip the very bones from his brother’s body. His servant waited, its eyes tracking Naelaelayle’s movements.<br>
<br>
“You will Pay for raiding the home of the Sol’Calar!” a small voice hissed, necromantic magic flooded from the small doorway Maelgroth had passed earlier.<br>
<br>
Mael’s concentration was shattered, the voice was Chal’s. <br>
<br>
