On my last server, I heard it a lot.  Let me explain why this is such a big deal to me.<br>
<br>
About 1 in 10 folks are attracted to members of the same sex.  When they hear things that are bad or stupid referred to as &quot;gay&quot;, is that going to make them feel good about themselves?  No!  It makes them feel like THEY must be bad, or stupid.<br>
<br>
Let's contrast it to, &quot;That's so blonde!&quot;  Yes, it's kind of insulting to folks who are blond.  But last time I checked, teenagers weren't committing suicide because they were blond.  And I don't know of any cases where someone has been beaten to death for being blond.  <br>
<br>
When the day comes where an American can be openly gay and not be in fear of losing his job, child, and life, I'll agree that this is a silly issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One Feisty Dwarf!</span><br>  Posts: 596<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/02 11:09:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: That is so str8!</span><hr size=1> Man, not this again.<br>
<br>
With all this attention brought about the subject, one might think Robin is self-conscious about being gay. <br>
<br>
Here's a little something to think about. Gay didn't mean stupid until the latter half of the 20th century, granted. Gay didn't mean homosexual until the 20th century either. You don't 'own' the word 'gay' because you're homosexual. <br>
<br>
Anyway, if everyone's supposed to respect your right to be gay, why won't you respect peoples' religious freedom to feel homosexuality is wrong?  It's not bigotry, it's a genuine, biblical belief. Don't feel bad tho. God hates the sin, not the sinner. <br>
<br>
I know I'll catch flack for this, but in a way I think homosexuality is kinda good, what with the way it keeps population down. Kinda the same way with plague, war, famine, natural disasters, etc. I guess it's the tinge of totalitarianist in me. So keep on providing for a brighter future for the world, with less overpopulation and more tax revenue from the cosmetics and home decorating sales. Your vanity and indulgence in your own sexual gratification shines like a beacon in this dark and troubled world.<br>
<br>
Here's to your conversion of troubled confused youngsters via high school gay and lesbian associations, hell why stop there, just hit the grade schools too. A toast. May you bugger as many men as you can and make your first million from starring in gay porn.<br>

I was over at my friend's house (who is black, by the way) eating some saltines (just snacking) while she was on the computer.  Her computer is in her bedroom, so I was sitting on the bed. <br>

Then she turns to me all pissed off and says &quot;Get the hell off my bed!  I f---ing HATE crackers all on my bed!&quot;<br>

<br>
If someone uses the word gay as to mean &quot;happy&quot; do you congratulate them for being outstanding citizens?<br>
<br>
On a second note, the word &quot;gay&quot; to describe homosexuals is a word that is TAKEN FROM ANOTHER CONTEXT!!  The next time you describe your sexuallity as &quot;gay&quot; try and think about all the &quot;happy&quot; people who take offense to your using this, because it was their word first.<br>

Gay was originally meant to mean happy. For whatever reason, it became another way of saying homosexual. If someone says gay, I immediately think of homosexual. It's just that way. If something is outdated and includes the word gay, I think of homosexuality first, then realize that it means happy.<br>

I don't see &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; among those meanings, do you? If it's not in Webster's, it doesn't exist. I don't care if you use the word gay the way that you insist, but I DO care that you're under the impression you can say whatever the hell you want to because &quot;your&quot; definition supercedes the public's.

Any type of derogatory statement is wrong and since we all have to live on this planet together I see no reason not to voice our opinion on what we hear that is wrong.  We shouldn't have to put up with others disrespectfulness.  Don't like it?  Walk away.  Simple as that.  I can't fault Lasgalen for posting this.  I'm actually glad he did since it has sparked such a debate.<br>
<br>
Saying something is 'gay' has been around a long time.  I remember it in middle school and I'm in my early 30's now to give you some sort of time frame.  I started asking them how they would know if something was gay.  Seemed to shut them up.<br>

I work in a store that sells **clears throat** adult related... things.  As you can imagine I see ALL types of people.  Now, I don't consider myself the authority on anything and I do usually more often than not stick up for the underdog as I've had to do it in my job for all sides more than I care to imagine.  I don't like it when others I see feel uncomfortable.<br>

<br>
People are always gonna view statements differently.  One person's compliment is another person's insult.<br>
<br>
My best advice is that if you know something is gonna offend someone, and you can make the exact same point phrasing it in a non-offensive manner, it's not a bad thing to do so.  If you think &quot;that's so gay&quot; is perfectly interchangable with &quot;that's so dumb&quot; why use the former (if there's someone around to be offended)?<br>
<br>
On the flip side, if you go through life getting offended by every little thing you're gonna have a hella sucky life.  You can consider yourself to be &quot;Political Correctness Superhero/heroine&quot; and look down on every person you feel has a flaw, and eventually you're gonna end up looking down on the entire world because no one's perfect (not even you, especially considering how many are glad to be prejudiced in the other direction).<br>
<br>
If you wanna discuss the semantics of &quot;that's so gay&quot; and how it can, or can't be read as an offensive term, feel free.  If you start wandering too far into trashing eachother over your differing views, or start lobbing accusations / insinuations at eachother, someone's prolly gonna lock this.  Consider it fair warning.<br>

Regardless, though, &quot;gay&quot; isn't a word I think should be hurled around freely. It's offensive to gay people, there're other ways to say &quot;dumb,&quot; and it's overused anyway. Come up with something classy, for God's sake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzeldagisravensoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeldagis Ravensoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/2/02 12:10:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> reply</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I don't see &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; among those meanings, do you?

Do you see &quot;cunt&quot;,  &quot;asshole&quot;,  &quot;fuck&quot;,  or  &quot;mother fucker&quot; in the dictionary?  Do they exist?  Guess not, huh?<br>

Let me be clear about his, if you feel for some reason you are a &quot;protected class&quot;, you deserve to be treated differently, or you somehow gain a magical right to not be offended by what people say because of your sexual orientation people have the right to criticize you.  And not respect you afterwards.<br>
<br>
I'll get flamed for this, but honestly, what the fuck difference does it make if you are gay or not.  Who cares?  It doesn't give you special rights, it shouldn't make people have to watch what they say around you because they might offend you.  You haven't come right out and said it, but the tone of your posts is that you feel you are oppressed by a culture that uses the same word to describe homosexuals that it occassionally uses to describe something stupid.  It's a ridiculous argument to begin with.  If someone wants to call me cracker ass motherfucker whitey it honestly wouldn't bother me.  They are just words.  They aren't inherantly evil... and even if they are used in a derogatory manner, which I don't think this necessarily was, it's not worth getting worked up over (even though you say you didn't, it's pretty obvious you did), in my opinion.   <br>

Perhaps a little defense mechanism at work there?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Perhaps a little bit of a sense of entitlement due to your sexual orientation here?  You're gay.  Get over it.  <br>
