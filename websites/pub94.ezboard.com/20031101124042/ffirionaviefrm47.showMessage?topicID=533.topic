<br>
The Noctre, a new thieve's guild has been officially and successfully founded. Members of the guild have received their tags. We are a very young guild at the moment, with a majority of members in the teen levels, we will need some time to grow BUT here is what we intend to eventually accomplish. We seek the cooperation of many RP-oriented guilds to accomplish our goals and am looking for a show of interest from such guilds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
The Noctre are a role playing oriented thieves' guild on the Firiona Vie server. Our aim is to enhance the role playing atmosphere of the Firiona Vie server and to vastly increase interaction between other role playing oriented guilds on the server. The Noctre seek to do so by creating, developing and being involved in wide spanning story lines encompassing a plurality of parties, and more importantly, making such story lines a continuous, interlinked and growing affair.<br>
<br>
At present, the many guilds on the Firiona Vie server have at best an ad hoc and sporadic interaction between each other, and a few guilds have a more formal relationship with one or two other guilds. It is uncommon, if not rare, however, to find a story line or event that spands the majority of the community and that fully involves several or more guilds in an ongoing event. The Noctre seek to change this situation.<br>
<br>
The Noctre intend to establish OOC contact with as many RP oriented guilds as possible, and to ascertain interest to such an idea. Following preliminary contact, the Noctre will work together with the interested parties to develop the beginnings of a story line. The only part of the story line that will be pre-created is the beginning, for from then on, the story IS/Will Be the actions and outcomes of the various events to come.<br>
<br>
Certain rules of conduct will have to be followed, and for each event, the possible outcomes and victory conditions for such outcomes will have to be decided prior to the event. It is expected that the guilds involved will abide by the rules as decided so that a fun and enjoyable series of events can be had by all. It is especially pointed out that if all involved play by the rules, then there is no loser. In contrast, all involved lose if and when the event ceases to be fun and enjoyable due to breaking of the rules.<br>
<br>
The Noctre, at its core, are a band of thieves, opportunists and entrepreneurs. Some may call the Noctre a band of mercenaries, but they are more than just a gathering of hired sword. The Noctre are a guild in and of itself, able to think and act as a cohesive unit to achieve a common non-trivial goal. The Noctre has its own motives and strives towards such. A band of mercenaries has no such cohesion nor goal among their ranks. In this capacity, the Noctre see itself as a neutral third party in a world where conflicting interests are abound. The Noctre are the &quot;do-ers&quot;, the &quot;go-between&quot;, the executors of a plan, the people who &quot;get the job done&quot;. <br>
<br>
It is expected that guilds/parties will seek the services of the Noctre for various jobs which, if successful, will benefit the hiring party and if unsuccessful will benefit their rivals. In such a context, the rival party may attempt to thwart the Noctre in succeeding. Regardless of the outcome, a multitude of endings and sequels are possible, thereby creating an evolving story that is dynamic, interactive and immersive.<br>
<br>
It is hoped for as many guilds as possible to be some how involved in the one general story line (albeit including many many sub-stories), the guilds involved either interacting with other guilds directly, indirectly through the Noctre, or a combination of both. Seeing as the potential for possible outcomes/results/consequences is almost limitless, it will be possible to schedule regular events, and perhaps even possible to schedule simultaneous separate events involved in the one general story line. This provides regular entertainment for those who prefer role playing (as opposed to regular raiding), provides a much needed change from experience grinding, and provides an opportunity for all involved to meet and play with new people, which otherwise would not be possible.<br>
<br>
The above, are the goals of the Noctre and for which we seek the cooperationg of other similar interested guilds on Firiona Vie. If you are in a guild that is interested in being involved in such activity, please contact us either at our bulletin board (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub62.ezboard.com/bnoctre" target="top">link here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->) or via email: noctre@yahoogroups.com<br>

<br>
I will include below a basic example of a possible starting of a story line. A detailed background/history to the story is not included here for sake of brevity, but should be present in the real event.<br>
<br>
Parties Involved:<br>
Knights of Flame (fictional guild)<br>
Black Skull Marauders (fictional guild)<br>
Noctre<br>
<br>
<br>
Scenario:<br>
A number of members from the Knights of Flame are holding a fort which is currently besieged by the Black Skull Marauders. The Knights are well equipped and are holding the Marauders at bay. However, they are fast running out of supplies. Food, water, arrows and bandages are fast becoming scarce. The Supreme Leader of the Knights of Flame (safe in Qeynos) has ordered that a caravan of supplies be sent post-haste to the besieged knights in the fort.<br>
<br>
Option 1:<br>
The Noctre are hired by the Knights of Flame to guard the caravan and safely deliver the supplies to the besieged knights. The Noctre are accompanied by several knights, some of whom are carrying back packs worth of food, water, arrows and bandages.<br>
<br>
The Black Skull Marauders send a small contingent to intercept the caravan.<br>
<br>
Possible Outcome 1a:<br>
The Noctre and the Knights of Flame successful get the supplies to the besieged knights (end of 1st event). And then join the besieged knights to try and break the siege (a new event for the next weekend).<br>
<br>
Possible Outcome 1b:<br>
The Black Skull Marauders are successful in intercepting the supply caravan. The besieged Knights, realizing that no supplies would get to them decide to try and break the siege against overwhelming odds (a new event for the next weekend). The knights lose and the Marauders gain control of the fort from which they can launch their next attack (subsequent event); OR; the knights overcome the overwhelming odds and break the siege sending the Marauders on a retreat. The knights resupply and regroup and perhaps chase the retreating Maruders (subsequent event).<br>
<br>
Along the way, any number of other guilds/parties may get involved, thereby further diversifying the story line.<br>
<br>
Option 2:<br>
The Knights of Flame send a contingent of supplies to the besieged knights. The Black Skull Marauders, not wanting to divide their force, send the Noctre to intercept the contingent of supplies.<br>
<br>
Possible Outcome 2a:<br>
The Noctre successfully intercept the supply caravan. Seeing as their original contract with the Black Skull Marauders was mere to &quot;intercept the caravan&quot; which the Noctre has successfully done, the Noctre now hold the supplies as ransom and contact both the Black Skull Marauders and the Knights of Flame to negotiate a new deal whereby the supplies will go to the highest bidder.<br>
<br>
Possible Outcome 2b:<br>
The Noctre are soundly defeated by the Knights of Flame. The Caravan arrives safely at besieged fort, and we continue along the same lines as &quot;Possible Outcome 1a&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jo1montgomery>jo1montgomery</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/03 8:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=533.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To All RP-Oriented Guilds (regarding Noctre)</span><hr size=1> *Stands over the scroll looking something between perturbed and curious.

     I can not say exactly that a band of theifs and such does not make one ill at ease, but it you do not hinder the Council of Mithril Dreams from our goals, then I suppose there is not much we can say. But with the possibilities of converting galavanting wanderers to our beliefs that not all people are evil based on their race or job, I am inclined to over an extended hand of welcome.

<br>
A quick thank you to all who replied either in this thread, or via email, to me. Regardless of your reply, I sincerely appreciated you taking the time to respond.<br>
<br>
To date, a lot of people have wished my guild &quot;good luck&quot; and so forth, but only a very few have indicated that they would be interested in working actively together to realise this. Surprisingly, from some of the supposed &quot;uber&quot; role-playing guilds, even to this day, I have yet to receive ANY form of response from. As it turns out, the &quot;not-so-uber&quot; RP guilds of FV have shown more interest so far than the traditionally famous RP-guilds of FV.<br>
<br>
Can I take this to mean that a wide-covering RP story line encompassing the RP-oriented guilds is not really sought after by the majority of RP-oriented guilds of FV? <br>
<br>
The Noctre will continue to work with the individuals, guilds and informal alliances, that have expressed a form of interest so far. It is still hoped, however, that the bigger RP guilds of FV will live up to their reputations and show some interest.<br>

It is my understanding that there things afoot within this new clan that perhaps we should discuss. In fact, many things.<br>

The parchment was carefully folded, and sealed with the black and red wax that denoted House Black Oath, and sent along with a trust servant and guards to be seen to by the Leader of those ranks.<br>

there own events and ideas like yours take time to get to.<br>
Almost all the RP guilds of this server interact, the lightbringer guilds would be very careful with a guild like yours<br>
as it is usually against there beliefs to interact with thieves and mercenaries, give it time, don't try and build the whole<br>
thing in a week. I like your idea alot and will come to you when the time is right for my guild, but right now we are very busy with our own RP events and we have to hold off on other offers from other guilds so we do not get swamped, nothing is linear in Norrath. So keep at it and grow it will come to you in time.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sulissaurnvelve>Sulissa UrnVelve</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/15/03 4:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=533.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To All RP-Oriented Guilds (regarding Noctre)</span><hr size=1> Sulissa rubs her forehead and groans, just what she needs to deal with more  trouble in her area.

&quot; Dear Kraye,<br>
  While your offer for as mercenaries for hire is quite intrigueing, your other ventures may cause us some issue. If you begin to opperate from Prime Nightmares domain please expect to pay a portion of your profit to our coffers. Violation of our protection rachets and other such things will bring us into a more hostile relationship. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your time, and your offer will be talked over.<br>

Dear Sullisa,<br>
<br>
Please rest assured that a percentage of any profits from activities conducted in a domain formally recognized by the Noctre to be under the Prime Nightmare's sphere of influence, will be duely tithed to the Prime Nightmare's charity for the needy. The Noctre understand the need for respect between owner-operators of such domains of influence and are committed to working with the flow rather than against it. In like manner, the Noctre expects due respect to be paid by Prime Nightmare to all of Noctre's interests.<br>
<br>
Humbly yours,<br>
