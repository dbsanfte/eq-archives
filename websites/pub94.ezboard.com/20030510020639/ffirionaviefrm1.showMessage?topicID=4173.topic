<br>
Its a windows messenger box and says &quot;message from BlahBlahFakeCompany to my ip address&quot; and tries to sell me things like fake degrees, rude stuff and recently has been trying to sell me a cure for itself.  It even sometimes addresses me by my first name which is very scary.<br>
<br>
Does Ezyboard sell your personal details to other companies and has anyone else been having this problem and found a cure for it?  According to some message I got, its very hard to remove unless I pay this company to stop sending the messages.<br>
<br>
The bad part is if i'm in the middle of a fight, my EQ window minimises and I can't play till I close the message and maximise my window again which is obviously very bad for my IG health.<br>

<br>
Start &gt; Programs . Administrative Tools &gt; Services<br>
<br>
Find the Service called &quot;Messenger&quot; and double-click on it.  Change Start-up type to 'Disabled&quot; and click the Stop button to stop the service from running.<br>
<br>
Unless, of course, you have some sort of thing going on at home in which you need the Windows System Messenger.  I used to get those things in streaks, sometimes never a one, sometimes lots ... until I turned the service off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I don't believe that Ez-Board has anything to do with it.  Basically, a messenger spammer runs portscans across ip sets on the internet, checking to see if the messenger port on a given ip is open.  If so, they'll send a message.  Disbaling the service closes the port.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps some. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://carim.home.mindspring.com/thenidge1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
What probably happened is that they got an IP address from you somewhere with your real info attatched.<br>
<br>
Sounds like you are using windows XP/2000, and are not behind a firewall.<br>
<br>
If this is the case.<br>
<br>
1. Install a firewall<br>
2. Turn off the stupid message service in Windows XP eg MSN<br>
<br>
Just doing 2 will fix the message popping up but you defenitly need to get a firewall.<br>
<br>
Control Panel, Admin Tools, Services, Messenger, and Startup Type change to DISABLED<br>

Messenger Spam - Part 2<br>
Jamie Coates<br>
March 9, 2003.<br>
<br>
As written about in last week's column, a potential security threat exists for all users of Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating software. While this could be considered a flaw in their basic designs, it's not a bug so there is no &quot;patch&quot; to fix the problem. But the problem has everything to do with the Internet, I.P. addresses and an exploitation of a Windows software design feature.<br>
<br>
Whenever you connect to the Internet your computer is assigned an Internet address, known as its I.P. address, as in Internet Protocol. Each address is made up of a four part numbered identifier, with each part made up of one to three digits. This allows for a unique address to every user of the Internet at any given time, anywhere in the world. There are today millions if not billions of these numbered addresses in use. It is through the use of I.P. addresses that ensure it's you who receives your mail, chat messages or web page requests.<br>
<br>
While larger corporations may have assigned to them their own specific I.P. addresses, home users like you and I, as well as small businesses, are typically assigned a temporary address each time we log on, an address that you may or may not utilize again, not that it matters. It only matters that your address is unique to you at the specific time you're online.<br>
<br>
Here in Vallarta, for example, Internet service provider Telmex Prodigy, being the large corporation it is, has a large range of I.P. addresses permanently assigned to it. In turn, each time you log on from home, Prodigy temporarily assigns to your computer one of their permanent addresses for the duration you're online. Knowing that not all Prodigy clients would be online at the same time means that Prodigy doesn't need to have a unique number for each client, only a sufficient number to satisfy all potential users at any given time. The same holds true for Vallarta's other Internet provider, PV Net, who shares its own block of permanently assigned I.P. addresses to its clients on an as-needed basis.<br>
<br>
The Internet protocol is typically made up of four groups of numbers separated by periods. For example, 200.64.117.157 is the current I.P. address assigned to my computer from Prodigy while I'm connected through them to the Internet at this time of writing. All my Internet activity in this duration will be directed to me, and only to me, via this address. When I reconnect later, in all likelihood I'll have a different assigned number to direct my Internet traffic.<br>
<br>
To find your current I.P. address the next time you log on, should you be so interested, go to grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2 and then follow the Test My Shields! link. It will respond back with your address.<br>
<br>
The Internet is divided into geographical regions by consequence of I.P. numbering assignments. The first number is specific to a region as they are controlled by companies or other entities for the purposes of reassigning blocks of I.P. addresses beyond the first grouping that is.<br>
<br>
Windows has a run command called &quot;net send.&quot; If you know the current I.P. address of a friend or colleague, and wanted to send them a quick message, you could type for example, net send 200.64.117.157 Hey You!! Get back to work!<br>
<br>
The message is guaranteed to get the person's attention as it pops up onto their screen overriding all other opened windows. Chances are you don't know of many I.P. addresses, if any, of friends on the Internet. If you work in a business in which exists a local computer network connected to the Internet, then those machines too will have their own I.P. addresses, and so you may get to know someone's address that way.<br>
<br>
A variety of new software companies have surfaced in the last six months, including Direct Advertiser, found online at www.directadvertiser.com/, which seems to have pioneered this latest stunt of spamming Internet users with nuisance ads. They have designed software that will send Windows Messenger ads to blocks of I.P. addresses, numbered in the thousands in any given region, at a rate better than one a second. Not all I.P. addresses will be in use at the time they're spraying their wares, but many will be connected to the Internet.<br>
<br>
Those using either Windows 2000 or XP will notice these pop-up ads because they are being sent automatically by software that exploits the default Windows setting that allows these messages to come through. Tucked far, far away in the Services panel of the Administrative Tools section of the Window's Control Panel found off the Settings menu of your program Start menu, you can disable this feature should you find yourself bombarded every 15 minutes or so with these super annoying ads.<br>
<br>
In Puerto Vallarta of late, and elsewhere within the 200 I.P. allotment that Prodigy users connect to the Internet with, and perhaps those of other regions, too, and who use either of those two operating systems, are sitting ducks for some suspicious trip being offered to Orlando, Florida, after first needing to call long distance to claim your &quot;prize.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you're getting these messages, you need to disable this feature Microsoft has enabled into 2000 and XP by default. Go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. At this panel you'll notice a long alphabetical listing of various programs your computer could use to communicate with the Internet or to computers on a local network. Go down to M and find Messenger.<br>
<br>
Since you're getting these ads popping up on your screen, you'll notice under the Startup Type column, Messenger is set to Automatic. With your mouse cursor over the word Messenger, double click it to open its properties box. There, change the Startup type to Disabled and, below that, press the Stop button to turn the service off. Finally, click Apply, and then OK. Now, you should no longer receive those bothersome ads. Whewwwww.<br>
