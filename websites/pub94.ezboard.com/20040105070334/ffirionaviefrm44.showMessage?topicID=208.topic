<br>
I'm happy soloing Ulthorks in the Eastern Wastes, but you send me a tell wanting to do something together, so I figure fine ... the company of a friend is nice, and a warrior should be useful.  But where shall we go?  The ulthorks are barely a challenge for me, so together I think there would not be enough; perhaps we can go to Crystal Caverns. <br>
<br>
Certainly, you say!  You'll be right there once you finish up what you're doing.  Excellent, I respond.  Send me a tell when you get down to the Great Divide, then I can run out and meet you at the Eastern Wastes zone for invisibility.  Sounds like a plan.<br>
<br>
I continue hunting ulthorks for a while - for a long while - and start wondering what's happened to you.  Suddenly, a tell out of nowhere.  You're wandering around the Eastern Wastes, lost!  Hm .... weren't you going to send me a tell so I could meet you?  But oh well .... I spend 5 minutes giving directions and eventually you make it back to the EW/GD zone and we meet up.  I make you invisible, and we proceed towards the Ry'Gorr fortress.  Make sure you tell me if invis wears off, I caution you!  Of course you will.  <br>
<br>
I have to pause a few times along the way because you manage to lose me, however, once you've auto-followed all is well and I run up to the Ry'Gorr fortress.  How fortunate that I turn to look at you before approaching, because you've gone AFK without telling me, your invis has dropped, and I'm about to run you through a mean bunch of orcs.  Hastily I back off, dragging you with me, re-invis you, and we head into the caverns.<br>
<br>
Inside, I summon a levitation ring and make us both float.  I re-invis us and pause for a moment to make sure it does not drop immediately.  Miraculously, we both survive the drop down with invis intact, and we head towards Coldain town.  My invisibility breaks just before we make it out of the orc tunnels, but you are able to tank the orc who jumps me while I summon a pet, and we slay it.  I tell you to stay at the top of the ramp with my pet while I go back into the tunnels and pull out more.  It's not that I don't trust your skills, but ... well ... I don't trust your skills.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I've forgotten that my pet obeys instructions slightly better than you do ... and as you see me coming with the orc, you run down the tunnel and start hitting it.  Back up, back up, I say, but it's easier just to hit things ... or maybe you've gone AFK again?  I give in and send in my pet to kill it off quickly, but inevitably a second orc pops nearby and starts thumping me.  Of course, at this point, a warrior's job would be to ... let me tank the add, and keep thumping the original orc, apparently.  Fortunately, my pet is obedient, and he saves me.  <br>
<br>
I feel that perhaps you seem a little disappointed that you ended the fight down at 20% health, wondering if this place is too hard for us.  I reflect that no doubt I should have been busy nuking more instead of running for my life.  However, you graciously accept summoned bandages and bind your own wounds.  As I ended up with even less health than you do, I ask you to loot while I finish bandaging myself and meditate up.  You run down into the tunnel and loot the bodies, then come back up to sit by me.  <br>
<br>
After a while it occurs to me that one of the bodies was a Ry'Gorr Herbalist, and surely he should have had that nice weight-reduction pack on him?  I ask you whether the Herbalist dropped a pack, thinking perhaps I missed the loot message, or perhaps he doesn't always have one.  Oh, you assure me, he did have a bag on him, but you have all your bag slots full, so you didn't take it.  Of course, the corpse has decayed by then, so neither of us get it.  Perhaps, I politely suggest, you could let me know next time you can't loot an item, in case I might find it of use.<br>
<br>
Around this point a small group returns from Coldain town and informs us that they were actually camping the orcs before we arrived, they just had a wipeout and needed a rez.  The caverns are pretty empty so we decide to leave them to the orcs rather than debate, and I lead you over to the far side of Coldain Town.  You get slightly lost in the town itself, but no major problems.  I jump the broken bridge (you fall in) and we proceed up the steps to where two stalag terrors sit on either side of the pathway.  Rather than invis us and lose my pet, I suggest we just kill them.  You agree.  I send my pet to kill the one on the right.  You shrewdly run to assist my pet, while the one on the left side chases me around in circles.  How fortunate my dodge skill is maxed.<br>
<br>
I ponder the wisdom of expecting you to wait in the cave while I pull crystalline spiders, but fortunately at this point you announce that you have to go for the night.  So I invis you again, lead you back up past the geonids to the Eastern Wastes, and see you off on your way.  So far it has been about an hour since I went to meet you; we have killed 5 dark blue mobs during this time and earned about 2pp each.  As I return to the ulthorks, I begin to understand why it is that mages solo a lot.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sulissaurnvelve>Sulissa UrnVelve</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Almost dangerous<br>
