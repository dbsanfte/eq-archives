And dangerous way to respond to amoral unethical people.<br>
<br>
I agree with EchtelionFV. Also i agree on half the sentiment expressed by some. Do not harras. Do not call at odd hours. Do not call swearing and ranting. But If this where my child i would like to know him conducting rampant unethical behavior and going through lengths to brag about it. I would appreciate a calm intellegent call at a reasonable hour informing me much as i woudl like to know if my child was seen dealing/talking to known drug pushers.<br>
<br>
If i got a calm reasonable call and my child was the red herring of someone elses unethical behavior id also appreciate the call for i would like to have the opportunity to address being put into harms way.<br>
<br>
Back to the keep it in context mentallity. So if i mailed a bomb to someone the reprocutions should be only be recipricated via mail. Or if i hacked into HR computers and got you fired, you should only try to get my ISP to drop me? Now i admit the majority of his behavior is not unlawful just unethical. But then im not asking for him to serve time, im just suggesting that he be made accountable for his actions and as a MINOR as you like to point out so oft that is his PARENTS that you are to bring his behavior upto.<br>
<br>
As far as Zid/Anna. His entire circus seems to be bent on getting cuaght. It all plays out nicely as a classic case cry for help/attention. And that leaves me to agian conclude he needs parental intervention.<br>

While I myself would never call this kids parents (especially at 4.am) I feel that someone ripped off by him has every right to call his parents at a decent hour and inform them that their son is a virtual pirate and is doing horrible, immoral things.  Hopefully they will remove his computer privelages and give an appropriate punishment.<br>

If SoE was actually competent at punishing/removing scammers like this, it would not be necessary. But sadly, the in game Customer Service is about as useful as scuba gear in a desert.<br>

<br>
And to those that think 4 am is such a big issue... If someone I am answerable for is doing something bad, I don't appreciate being told much, much later, after people have concluded Something Must Be Done without any of my input.<br>
<br>
For one, I might prevent some harm from being done if I'm told sooner. Sometimes you can save your child by promising you'll torture him really badly, and just keep him/her inside the house for a while, completely incommunicado.<br>
<br>
Something must happen to prevent mob justice. If nothing happens, mob justice will. Law enforcement is not just to keep people safe from criminals. It is also much the other way around. You can't get a second chance after you're lynched.<br>
<br>
It is in human nature to retaliate when offended or hurt (or both), and the only way to convince people NOT to retaliate in whichever way they damn well please is by doing something which looks effective, or at least mean enough to satisfy the spite.<br>
<br>
I really hope his parents realize what he's doing, and put a stop to it. This may mean that they have to feel the heat for a while. Guess who they will be mad at about that? Those horrible, horrible amoral soapboxers?<br>

Shit, if I were you, knowing his address I would just have mailed him a letter address to his parents, with some sort of legal warning enclosed to scare the shit out of them that their son has been causing trouble in the virtual world.<br>
<br>
If you call, then talk to a parent, and address the parent with respect and be clear about your complaint and the extent of their son's exploits/damage.<br>
<br>
The kid is a junior in high school.  Just a year or 2 from being considered a legal adult, but he is still a minor nonetheless.<br>
<br>

I think the phone calls and letters are cool, he deserves that. But by no means should ANYONE make attempts to meet this kid in RL somewhere to settle the score.

Thats if some sick twisted internet dumbass does not take it into his own hands and visit the kid in real life.

<br>
1)  &quot;You know what makes people decent?  Fear.&quot;  yay for Dogma quotes. <br>
<br>
2)  calling someone at 4:00 and screaming &quot;ASSHAT&quot; into the phone may be harassment, but screwing someone over and then coming to taunt them is the same.  an equal punishment to an equal crime, no?<br>
<br>
3)  i'm not going to censor myself or my feelings just because some mental invalid out there could take those ideas and turn them into somthing sick (ie: beating/hurting this kid, physically).  should your country never go to war against a foreign power because you're worried that your citizens might attack people who look like the enemy?  it happens, afterall.<br>
should we tie our hands and therefor let the crazy people of the world dictate what we can and will do?  i say &quot;no.&quot;<br>
<br>
basically it comes down to responsibility, once again.  who is responsible if this kid gets hurt?  himself?  this board?  or, is it important to remember that individuals make their own decisions?  the only person who would be responsible would be the person who committed the assault, and no other.  otherwise, you could trace back the chain of events to whomever you wanted.  why not just blame his mother for giving birth to him?  it's all the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garios>garios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/2/03 12:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: make amends</span><hr size=1> Why does everyone believe that people are calling him at 4am.

And my job is creating CDs for lawyers of phone records.  You do not want to make harassing phone calls to a person. It takes about 1 day to get those records back from the phone company. And they will prosecute for it.   On average, I do about 5 to 10 subpoenas a week. <br>
<br>
<br>
In some states harrassing phone calls fall under stalking or assault charges. <br>

I will not try to even bridge the gap you have created by making a comparison of your contry going to war because of their beliefs and some innocent bystandard getting hurt over it and someone getting a few pixels stolen from them and posting RL information with the malicous intent.  Maybe this is not why he / she posted it in the first place but i really cant think of any other reason.<br>

Obviously, the poster thought it was the right thing to do. Now that Ana/Zid/Whoever is not anonymous anymore the tune is changing, because now, all of the ill wishes that litter the Soapbox now has the potential to become very real. It seems like some people here are miraculously starting to have a fucking conscience. <br>
<br>
Yes, I do feel somebody could be psycho enough to literally pay this kid a visit, but if he got hurt, I wouldn't hold the poster of his info guilty. You, and only YOU alone, are responsible for your own actions. I am so sick of people wanting to blame others for shit they do. Who is to say somebody didn't already have his information and simply chose not to post it? We don't know and probably never will.<br>
<br>
What I do know is this whole mess is sickening. Being a mother myself, I'd absolutely want to know what was going on, not find out that ADULTS were harrassing a KID to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot;. <br>
