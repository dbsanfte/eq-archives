but mainly because I'm curious to see what excuse they would put forth, if they bother at all.  From my experiences with them, they simply do not care about others.  Training, KSing, RP bashing.  Reputation meaning what it does, I've little real need to even hear a second side to the story.  Blayze is one of the more respected characters around and AS is rapidly becoming notorious for being a guild of selfish jerks.  I have little doubt it happened as illustrated.<br>
<br>
What I am most curious about is why people would ever want to stay in a guild that seems to go out of its way to be inconsiderate and rude.  Is &quot;phat loot&quot; and the false bravado of taking down uber mobs worth it?  Maybe it's just me, but my characters mean far to much to me to sell out.  And characters aside, there is still the person behind the box doing the actions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/13/02 10:36:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=993.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://noirdaila.homestead.com/files/ZDoll.JPG width=83 height=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rare mobs and decency...</span><hr size=1> Maybe before the bashing of AS begans let them respond.

People who lable (think) there Uber or whatever and dont care about others on the server are just hurting themselves.Why? cause even with all the zerg guilds you cant do everything by yourselves and if you blacken your name you will not get help ,Or when you leave said *uber* guild to join other said *uber* guild you'll have less chance at getting in cause of past experances.<br>
<br>
I have heard nothing good about AS since they crawled out from whatever rock and some crossed my family members so i wont help them out ever.But sadly the need for greed is stronger than honour.I am very proud that we of dreadstorm havent done shady crap and burned people at the end game cause in the long run its really not worth it.Hell i only group with guildies and help guildies and even i know this but it is lost on most people. <p>Attuma Evilknight

We even had one set up on EQVault for a time.  It fell apart because the top tier guilds refused to acknowledge it and many mid tier guilds took their leads from them.<br>
<br>
The top two guilds had a rotation system, you see.  Basically every time one of the top guilds became capable of killing a mob, they farmed the hell out of that mob as often as they possibly could before they had competition.  When the second guild to kill the mob finally was able to, that second guild pretty much always tried to farm that mob non-stop as well.  They figured hey...guild 01 got the mob for the last 2 months non-stop, now we should.<br>
<br>
That's when guild 01 pounded them into the ground until guild 02 came to them and worked out a deal.  Pretty much every single major mob went that way.  (Pounded them into the ground as in...raced them for every single spawn, regardless of timezone...if they were second to the mob, following directly behind during the raid lagging the hell out of everyone...jumping over corpses after a wipeout...pulling past a raid that was buffing...etc)<br>
<br>
So what happened when a third or fourth guild became capable?  Well, they obviously didn't fit into the rotation, and so that mob became a free for all.<br>
<br>
Basically that's how our server worked.  If you were buffed and ready, and the mob hadn't been pulled, you pull him and kill him.  If the guild racing you wasn't ready...too bad.  There were times when the difference between getting a mob and not getting one was literally seconds.  I remember a time when a guild pulled Severillious as the other guild was giving the pull order.  15 seconds later you could see the second guild shouting...he's gone...who pulled him???<br>
<br>
This happened unless you had worked out an arrangement with another guild.  Arrangements worked out between two guilds never extended to anyone else, and working out arrangements didn't guarantee you a mob...only that the guild you were working with wouldn't compete for that mob during alternating spawns.  There were times when two guilds who agreed to rotate spawns actually would work together when a third guild started gathering to take that mob to ensure that those two guilds got that loot and that noone lost their turn in the rotation.<br>
<br>
In my mind, that's the only way a non-calendar system can work.  You cannot say...well, we'll respect the people who are in the zone and trying for the mob.  The bottom line is, your guild cares about your guild members more than you care about someone else.  When that someone else is level 52 and trying to scrape together a pickup raid...well it's very easy to think to yourself, &quot;I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some level 52 newbie scrape together a pickup raid and deny OUR cleric who is level 60 and has done yadda yadda yadda for MY guild HIS epic.&quot;  The dominant guilds will always underestimate the capabilities of the guilds under them.  They will always justify reasons for moving past people who are already there.  They will even get to the point of ignoring others in the zone and just going about their business in &quot;retaliation&quot; for some triviality in which they feel wronged by the other guild.  (We actually had one guild charge past another guild to kill Sontalak because months before the two guilds had raced for a miniboss in Hate and felt disrespected.)<br>
<br>
FnF and Reso can work out all the arrangements they want, but that's not going to help anyone else in any way, shape, or form.  In fact, top guilds working out arrangements amongst themselves even be detrimental to smaller guilds, as walking away from a spawn for a smaller guild can mean that you give up your turn in any rotation you've worked out.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for Blayze.  I feel bad for his guild.  I know what having even one epic in guild can mean for a guild.  Wipe recovery time goes from over an hour down to under a half hour.  It can mean the difference between being able to make only a single attempt at a mob in a night, to being able to make two or three attempts at a mob.  That can be a huge help towards learning how to place, pull, and fight a mob without having to resort to just surfing the web for the spoiler on how other guilds kill it.  I also know that cleric epics provide diminishing returns and not every cleric in a guild needs one, yet every single cleric in a guild feels compelled to have one.<br>
<br>
The people of Firiona Vie make it what it is, but unfortunatly when the top flight guilds declare the server first come, first serve, that's what it becomes.  The guild that was in Skyfire with lethal force buffed and ready to go first, was the first to get served.<br>
<br>
Blayze, if you were actually able to get a pickup raid together within 20 minutes of Ragefire poping, you'll get your epic.  It's just a matter of time.  Best of luck to you and hopefully the pain of camping that son of a bitch will be over for you soon.<br>

I too have the inability to acquire the epic, being in a mid-sized guild, short of the manning.  I am the only cleric in my guild over level 50 and to have the epic would be helpful to not only my guild but to the countless people who send me tells to come and rez them.  <br>
<br>
I'm not going to make this a pitty party for myself or anyone else by no means.  Like Blayze, I've helped countless people with their epics, and many unfortunate souls along the way, taking away from my own game time.  I call it my community service work.  It's my hope to gather assistance from many when/if I can find Rage up.  I wish something could be worked out so that it doesn't appear to be a monopoly or KSing.  It's getting very very discouraging!  All I'm seeing are opportunities to hunt epic mobs scheduled on these boards and guilds going in a killing the mob the day before.  (Sad!!)<br>
<br>
I have all but resolved myself to getting my epic.  I'm sure there are guilds/forces out there who have epic camps down to a science, if so, gee...how's about giving the rest of us a chance or atleast offering to help by sending us a tell when Rage (or whoever) is up and lending assistance in killing it?<br>
<br>
Please let me know if I can help any of you with your epic.  I can provide you the 96% rez.  Hope you all don't mind the time and patience it will take to get the job done though.  Take care.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yes Ragefire sucks, but as players we need to come to an open aggrement, AS probably has a few Epic clerics, so why not let other guilds in there.

I still think AS should leave the server since they do not promote RP, but thats my opinion. But if they wanna help there situation they could start by helping those clerics that need Ragefire....and that means non-AS clerics.<br>

I am not interested in joining AS because a few of their members have 'found one of my pet peeves', so to say.<br>

<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
Sure, they followed the rules and were within their rights.<br>
<br>
However, the key to being civilized is to recognize the difference between rights and responsibilities. Which is where they, and those who support their position, have failed.<br>

   Next time just pull aggro and start kiting the damn thing till the force is up.

Whose definition of civilized are you talking about? In some parts of the world it's 'civilized' to eat or not eat cows, puppies, kittens and whales. In some parts of the world it's 'civilized' to chop peoples appendages off as punishment for crimes. In some parts of the world it's 'civilized' to insult the poor.<br>

At what point is a force strong enough to kill something? When nobody dies and they can kill it? When there is but a last man standing, and the mob is dead? At one point Blayze had more people, but wanted a cushion to take it out. At that point, start the attack, and as the others show up start them in on it too. Acceptability went out the window when the second force showed up and took the mob. We are not talking about Blayze standing there asking for 8 hours, he was assembling while it was all happening. What if it had been Gore, 5 clerics and they could stand there and pound away till the nukers showed? On a raid on Fennin Ro the nukers showed up halfway through the raid, nuked, ported out, gated back in, nuked, and left. They were there for about 30 seconds total. But long enough to kill Bristlebane. If another group had been there they would never have thought that the raid would succeed, but they would have been wrong. If it comes down to first come first served, then ANY tactics used are acceptable, wether you like them or not, as long as it takes down the mob.<br>

<br>
1) most of you instantly took the side of the 'little oppressed fella' after the cry for attention post, totally disregarding any opinion or skewed views he/she or his/her friends may have.<br>
<br>
2) Most of you totally disregarded Xarpolis's post stating they had been checking on ragefire a lot, and quite possibly longer than Blayze.  Why is this tossed out as unimportant?<br>
<br>
3) I see a lot of talk about the 'uber guilds' smacking AS down.  Yes of course that is the solution, lay a good pimp slap on them and all will be better..*sarcasm off*.  Eye for an Eye solution from the 'gentle roleplaying server', how ironic.  You are advocating actions that will only make the community on FV worse off.<br>
<br>
I play on a pretty high tempo blue server, with 6 NTOV/ST capable guilds, 2 AOW guilds, and probably 20 guilds capable of Kunark and the harder epic mobs (Sev/Gore/the incredible ass sit that is Ragefire).  Ragefire is probaby the single most contested mob on every other server but this one, and by guilds that can put 40 people into skyfire in a few moments notice. To get ragefire you literally have to have a force camped in skyfire to win a race.<br>
<br>
In summary, you have made a mountain out of a mole hill.<br>

<br>
To even say that AS is one of the *uber* guilds on FV is a joke hell DS is 100X more *uber* than AS could ever wish to be and at least FnF and reso were here from day 1 got to know everyone made their intensions known to all,AND if they go to a zone to kill said mob they know what guilds are capable of killing said mob and will send a tell asking if they are there to kill it.Can they just storm in a kill it faster and leave? dam rights! but do they? Not that ive seen yet.<br>
<br>
Everyone is always saying that with a small server like FV you are what you make yourself to be and they are in noway strong enough to push around any of the topend guilds,if they tried they would be singled out and crushed.Im proud to know or know of almost all of the 55+ on FV but its very wierd that i have never seen or heard of many of AS members /shrug<br>
<br>
I am still very proud that DS hasnt been rude of pissed people off over stuff (to my knowlage anyways) as of yet we help each other out and friends outside of guild and know when to back off.I dont have a week to live so if we dont get it this week theres always next week right?I think maybe those should be words to play by makes sense to me cause swopping in a killing whatever mob will only hurt your future here. <p>Attuma Evilknight

If ASS had any courtesy at all they would have backed down and given you first chance to fail or succeed. They have brought the blue server mentality to this gentle roleplay server, because it's under-populated.  I'm afraid they are just the first wave of inconsiderate ASSes that will invade FV.<br>

Didn't your mother ever teach you manners? Common courtesy? Since when did might make right? Yes, technically it is legal, but it is still WRONG!. I can see if it was a misunderstanding or lack of communication, but ASS pretty much told Blayze to STFU I'm  the bigger bully in the schoolyard, and it doesn't matter that a little peon like Blayze gets his feelings hurt. It's the same as any bullying, it's not right.<br>
