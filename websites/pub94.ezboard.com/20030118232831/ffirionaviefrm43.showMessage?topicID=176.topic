Do not forget that Feign Death works , if the person is pet kiting you , just FD and off goes the pet , usually catching the caster off guard.<br>
<br>
Against other melee:<br>
<br>
Monk vs. Warriors: Pound away , do not joust if they are using 2HB unless you think you have the dodge and block skill to do so without being hurt seriously at every pass. Circle your enemy , make it hard for them to find you. Use your natural swiftness against them.  Disarm , it works extremely well against non monks , because most people cannot attack with their fists.  Pound away as fast as you can , if you are losing try and sneak in a /discipline , if they dont notice. then you are in the clear , especially for /whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Monks vs. Rogues: This is usually an extremely uphill battle for monks as Rogues tend to be the best PvP melee class.  You cannot win unless you have a see invis item, if you dont have one , accept defeat brother and move on.  If you can see them , place your back to a wall (Note: this doesnt work well if they have the frontal backstab AA *smiles)  If they refuse to engage you when you have your back to a wall , then start throwing Shurukins or other things at them (Note for monks : Train in throwing its a PvP gift). If you can engage them in frontal combat, then you have won the battle unless the odds are stacked such as them having high end gear / higher than your level.<br>
<br>
Monks Vs. Monks: Beat eachother to a bloody pulp is all i can say ,  try to sneak in a disc. Use disarm to catch them off guard in case they have not trained their fists.  Use the circling tactic to annoy them and confuse them.  Place your back to a wall if they are using circling , this makes you only have to watch a 180 degree area.<br>
<br>
Monks Vs. Hybrids<br>
<br>
Monks Vs. Rangers:  Definately one of the hardest to win if you are equal level.  If they have a good bow and good bow AA skills , they will snare you and ...its over.  Use resist discs , and anything to not get casted on.  In combat refer to fighting warriors.<br>
<br>
Monks Vs. Paladins and Shadowknights:  Paladin will go down fast unless they have good gear or are higher level than you. If they use 2HS , joust with them , if you are blind , run total circles around an area , just avoid , if you get rooted or stunned you need more resist gear.  Use Pumice to dispell them, and really its a beat the clock battle against Lay on hands. Against shadowknights , resist is what you need , Harm Touch will hurt , but you mend after it hits you to demoralize them and to heal up.  Refer to against paladin tactics , and in fights fight these two as warriors , but when they cast you better have Resist gear.<br>
<br>
Monks Vs. Beastmasters:  Feign Death the pet off.  If you can keep this up and hit when they cast, and then FD as pet Agro's , you will win after a long long fought battle , because you will keep getting mend back.<br>
<br>
Monks Vs. Casters (Casters have been known to constantly beat melee)<br>
<br>
I will put these together because i feel that there is a specific set of rules to fighting with casters<br>
<br>
Rule #1: If you cant beat them , join them , buy pumice , snare items , root items , potions , anything to get the edge.<br>
<br>
Rule#2 : RESIST GEAR , have all resists extremely high , because you will get deresist spells cast on you.<br>
<br>
Rule#3: Disease / Magic / Fire / Cold are your worries , poison is bad , but those 4 are the main ones.<br>
<br>
Rule#4: You get rooted by a int. caster, say goodbye now and pick up your ashes later.<br>
<br>
Rule#5: well...not really much more to say other than persevere , fight hard, resists rock , and use what you have , monks have the most skills in the game , use them.<br>
<br>
Monks! DO NOT FORGET YOUR DISCIPLINES , they are your greatest advantage.<br>
<br>
Edit: Left out monks Vs. Bards. : Well , i have fought a few bards at least.  I find they do 0 damage , since we just get mend back , and really  battles against them are very (pardon me but) dumb. They will just keep running around and you will just stand there and think...what is that person doing? Pumice them , try and snare em , they will most likely dispell song. Bards are pretty much the anti PvP <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Hope this helps you all out , if you have any tips to add here (i have probably forgotten many jewels of wisdom) Please do not hesitate to share them with our melee community.<br>

I disagree.  As soon as you FD, I can poke you, and pet will be standing right there.  Especially if I use /pet sit first, once his aggro list clears he will then sit in place right next to you, and either I'll hit you with a spell and break FD, or I'll hit you in melee.  The general point about reusing mend is valid and would be able to run a bst out of mana, depending on their wis and FT.  But FDing off the pet really seems (at least to me) to be incorrect.  If you want to test this sometime, I'm more than willing.

You can mend, I have chloroblast.  (Or greater healing, for a 57-61 bst).<br>

Dunno.  It is worth trying, but that alone is hardly going to ensure that you'll beat a bst.  But if you want to try sometime I'm open to it, and I can certainly use the 58 pet, or whatever season you are at the time *shrug* <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438">Rhatha Sha`Naya</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and Swiftclaw<br>

Mend is a killer on classes who can't heal.<br>
But for me a Paladin I will use only 1 spell when fighting a monk Celestisal Cleansing.  The healign i get from that pretty much fully nullifies what you will do in dmg. ITs cast time is also 1 second so your not going to interupt it.<br>
<br>
Also DS owns monks drink a potion an dcall it a day.<br>
I would just sit there and let you kill yourself on my DS and heal as needed.<br>

<br>
Vs a Shadowknight - just send tells for a res now...<br>
<br>
Firstly you will be fighting a shadowknight 2-3 stacked damage shield spells, more depending on item clickys.<br>
<br>
You will be faceing a large set of 1.5 second debuff/buff - so pumice wont work. Also these debuffs will take your Str, Stamina, Ac, Atk.<br>
<br>
you may be faceing a pet, and you have the choice to kill the pet or leave it, FDing my pet will not work because i have something called &quot;/pet attack&quot; that i will just click the second you stand or the second you hit me pet will attack on it's own, my pet can lifetap you also to heal and you will not resist the pet's lifetap.<br>
<br>
You also wil be faceing either:<br>
1k+ dots<br>
or 400, 600 DD that you will not be able to resist, even pvp nerfed they are trouble and i will critical blast you with them to... they are not far off Dot efficency for mana, they are a 0.5 second cast time so you will not interupt them.<br>
<br>
Every time you mend i will be poping one of these 400-600 DD's off in your face, wich will pretty much negate the worste of a mend - meaning i could still HT you.<br>
<br>
I will use my healign disc wich will top up half my hp's for no mana in most good circumstances, either way it's a free heal.<br>
<br>
I will have inate wepon procs up either lifetaping once or mana ones - mana ones will basically let me nuke you for 400 every time the spell refreshes per proc...<br>
<br>
So in reality you would be faceing a pet owner who can dot or nuke you down, who can jouste or just beat your ass toe to toe who has a damage shield you can never fully dispell and both him and the pet will be procing on you, who can heal a good 1-2k without mana and then harmtouch you for 1k instantly when ever he likes.<br>
<br>
I think your only hope is to get a nice 2h blunt or some sticks that have a nice AOE on - the AOE will kill the pet and interupt casting, you can jouste with the 2 hander so should minimise the damage shield - dont bother wasteing time pumice it will get you no where.<br>
     Thats the only way i see you being able to live long enough that the SK will go low Hp's<br>
<br>
Same for the paladin, Aoe proc or rain spell would be ideal vs a paladin..... otherwise you are going to be takeing the average 2-3.5k paladin down around 10 times...... i am pretty sure they can heal to full a lot of times on mana alone and throw in LoH thats another free 2-3.5k hp on average paladin.<br>
     I dont think you will be able to do 10-20k's worth of damage faster than the paladin can take you down.<br>
<br>
Rangers have the spells to put distance between you and them and get off heals - even ranger heal spells are fairly usefull and i think fighting a ranger with dots/snares/dd and bow and arrow could prove leathal for you... i just dont think a monk could kill the ranger fast enough.<br>
<br>
I have seen monks die on ranger damage shields before, and if a ranger manages to slow you with there epic sword - well, i hope you have some backup plan or can run faster than them...<br>
<br>

<br>
Just wanted to add to that the fact that an SK can shadowstep, which is pretty lethal followed by lifetaps, especially against pure melee.  It also puts them out of range if you decide to use a damage discipline (innerflame?).<br>
<br>
Despair, a level 9 ATK debuff, overwrites monk epic effect and does not allow it to stick.  The loss of ATK and haste is crippling.<br>
<br>
On the monk side, I hope you have a bio orb for blind attempts, and a very nice 2 hander.  Damage shields become less of an issue with more jousting, it would be the only way to survive until another mend attempt.  I used to duel Calvin all the time with my Wizard, and he was able to do some very good damage in one round.  And he got HP back every 6 minutes, whereas I had to try to yonder away and reskin.<br>
<br>
Never forget Disarm.  And throw when the SK is not in range.<br>
<br>
Would be a good fight, but equally equipped monks and SK fights would almost always go to the SK.  There's always room for skill though, as a horrible SK PvPer would lose often to a good monk, but even then it would be close.<br>

<br>
In all my experience SK's are the hardest foes(I don't count bards becasue when a bard challenges me to a duel I laugh and tell them i have better things to do over the next 2 hours)<br>
<br>
Jaehun your mistake here was looking at just what your class can do and forgeting what others have the capablitity off.<br>
<br>
Paladins are two different PVP wise depending on lvl.<br>
At 59+ Paladins get Celestial Cleansing. It heals 200hps a tick for 4 ticks.  Its very low in mana and has a 1 second cast time.<br>
Basically it acts more as a massive regen spell then as a heal.  <br>
Lets take me for example Unbuffed I have 3100hps or so.<br>
I can also cast CC about 10x without KEI before I go OOM.<br>
<br>
Add in lh and your go throwing about 15k in hp's<br>
<br>
Bottom line is if you want to be a Pally in a duel you better be capable of killing them before they go OOM.  If your going to let a pally go oom while dueling them your gonna lose.  Just too many hp's to cut through.<br>
<br>
Sk/pally duels are very strategic due to the fact that HT will roughly take 1k or so in hp's off you.  SO know its a race to drop your target below 1k in hp's, so they are trying to drop the pally below 1k while the paladin is healing almost nonstop to stay above that.<br>
It all becomes about how much dmg the sk can do straight melee against the paladin.  Dot/dd/lifetaps are very limited against lvl 60+ paladins as they will just click their sancticty disc. And they have 3 minutes of protection from them.  Also on a Paladin with 20+ AA Sk's don't even bother summoining a pet the mana is better saved for debuffs. SU 3 &gt;pets<br>
On the other side of it Paladins don't have a whole lot of dps as is, so some of those SK att/str/ac debuffs will REALLY hurt a paladin.  And sk's have the ability to make a pally go oom very fast due to the fact that we're always worried about keeping our hp's over 1k.<br>
In my experiences Pally/sk duels between equal players and equal gear tend to go about 60/40 Sk's........I will say of all the duels i've seen Paladin/Sk are about as close to even as can be.  And alot of them are really awesome to watch.<br>
<br>
All that being said I'd like to see aht differences POP makes in dueling.  I know the new dots and such that SK's got but some of the new pally heals are just awesome.  I mean 1125hp for 300 mana is great especially with a 3/4 second cast time.  <br>
<br>
I think this is a pretty cool thread.  Lets keep it going.<br>

As a ranger ..<br>
<br>
I have to assume that an equally geared sk /pally /warrior /monk will have more hp than me. I don't want to actually get into melee with you, if i can stay at range and snipe you i'm winning i just need to do more damage than you're able to click away ( i assume every dueler has a velious bp ) with my bow.<br>
<br>
killing a ranger is actually rather difficult outdoors you're best movement buff is a sow potion, very early on rangers wolf form makes them move faster than that. So you need to move to horses to be able to kill a ranger outdoors.<br>
<br>
Anyway Sk's snares wil instantly kill a ranger that doesn't have the mr to resist them.<br>
<br>
Blind circle continue to  fire ranged weapons  alter your movement patterns make it look like it didn't stick, then go buy some mr gear =P<br>

<br>
that's why i stated the horse bit. I think Sk / pali horses are the eqivelent of the 100k store bought ones right ?<br>
<br>
so to be on equal footing any duelist at that level must assume that they need to have a horse of that caliber.<br>
<br>
*nods* you're archery is buggy. You can use those bugs to &quot;take cover&quot; however that fixes your position and allows the ranger to use long cast clickies, or if it's a team thing allows there wizzard/whatever else that has long deathly cast junk to pick you off.<br>
<br>
If you don't know who you're dueling you have to assume that they have all the toys and be pleasantly suprised if they don't it's much better that getting beating into a bloody pulp because you underestimated them.<br>
<br>
I know i can beat a pally that tries to stun/root/blind me doesn't heal, doesn't know how to joust, doesn't have a soulfire =P, however what's the fun in that ?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1730<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/13/02 11:54:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The big difference between ..</span><hr size=1> .. caster/hybrid perspective on dueling and pure melee is that the pures are far more gear-dependent.

For monks, get a tranquil staff.  Proc it, hit innerflame, and your target will be dead.  The other tactics are all just methods to stay alive long enough to get a t-staff proc.  If you don't have a t-staff, you can try to root or snare using a clickie, but assuming their resists are setup for dueling, getting it to stick will be hard.<br>

I've seen mana a Paladin lose a duel going OOM trying to blind/stun/root etc when if they had just sat back and spent that mana celestial healing themselves they would have won easily.<br>
<br>
The archery bug is bad.   But its really one way to take advantage of a ranger trying to bow kite you.<br>
Esepcially since at higher lvls (my resists all top 140 or so unbuffed) you going to have a tough time landing any spells.<br>

Against a melee opponent break out the drum and selos and lay 3 or 4 very powerful dot's down.  Against a ranger the 50 percent slow should take the edge off that bow.<br>
