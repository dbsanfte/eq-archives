Why?  Because waking the sleeper screws us over, long after the bigger guilds don't need to go there any more.  And yes, it does screw us over (some loot is lost, the zone becomes far less fun).  And you gain nothing from it but the right to say hey, we got to do it, nya nya!<br>
<br>
Second, the sleeper does not have to be wakened.  As I recall, the major guilds on test capable of waking him agreed not to.  And he's still sleeping.  <br>
<br>
I think the true test of a person is to give them the power to do harm, then see what they do.<br>
<br>
Please pass that test.<br>

<br>
You're right in one respect, I'm not high enough level to be in the zone to fight Warders(not even close) &amp; waken the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
I do take exception to calling the rest of the server &quot;non-factors&quot;.  We all pay the same amount of money a month to play &amp; enjoy this game(yes it's a game), so I hardly consider us to non-factors.  I'm sure everyone would like the opportunities that you &amp; your guild-mates had to experience the Warders &amp; get the rewards for that fight.<br>
<br>
That said, I reference my statement that it's &quot;just a game&quot;, so I could really care less what you do, just let me know so I don't have to die that day for FnF pride.<br>
<br>
One last thought fo you:  What does waking the Sleeper reward you with?   (A notch in your belt of infamy is about all I can come up with)<br>
<br>
Enjoy the game folks....that's what we are here for!  Everything else is details.<br>

I don't know the story. I do know when I was in FnF Fuvi was one of the backbones of FnF. I disagreed with Fuvi on numerous occasions. However, I never truely wished Fuvi out of FnF or off the server as some FnF people are saying here. Fuvi put in 9 months with FnF, the least FnF could have done was let Fuvi air his grievances on thier private message board. I spent a lot of time with Fuvi, it is not like Fuvi to drag shit here that should have been kept private. <br>
<br>
Give the guy a little credit FnF, he gave many hours of his life to you.<br>
<br>
About Sleepers: Very poor script on VI's part.<br>
However, VI has admitted Sleepers is bad script and is correcting this. This Friday on Stormhammer there will be an event that will re-establish Sleepers in some way. <br>
We don't know if the same loot will be dropping, but we all assume it will after the event. This post-awakening Sleepers Tomb revamp is suppose to go to all the other servers also.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I truely miss Fironia Vie. The maturity and fun level of FV server is not prevelant on other servers. All though from reading the bashing of Fuvi here, I'm wondering about the maturity level thing.<br>
<br>
Best Wishes to Fuvi, Fire and Fury and all of Fironia Vie.<br>

I would personally love to see a server-wide agreement, as was done on test server, not to wake the sleeper. Really though, does it serve any good purpose? Does it do anything constructive or good for the server? Or its players now, and players of the future? I dont think you can answer any of those with a &quot;yes&quot; can you??<br>

&quot;totally disturbed..&quot; and &quot;.. a psycho that should be locked in...&quot; Your best EQ friend said that.<br>
I never said I was Fuvis best eqfriend, I said he was my best friend in eq. All I know is that me and Fuvi want the same things in the game, out of the game. And we get along perfectly and we have damn fun while playing. Then it is something special about Fuvi, he is totally fearless. He stands up to the leaders/officers when he thinks something is wrong. He has conversations with other people first who agree that we are making a misstake as a guild and then he speaks up, and gets all the shit by the leaders. Him alone. I call it courage, you call him a troublemaker. /shrug.<br>
<br>
You are right, its pretty good quotes you got there. <br>
Since everyone who got interest in this probably know its quotes to provoke me or provoke Fuvi to like me less, I might aswell join in this little game.<br>
Ive said them both, I agree.<br>
Ive said them as: Sure you are right, he is probably totally disturbed and sure he is a psycho that should be locked in.<br>
In my defensive speaches for fuvi however. Against people who was attacking him those sentances came up. I agree.<br>
If you could just fill in the rest of that conversation it wouldnt look like so much BS as it does now. Clearly you are aware of this.<br>
<br>
This is a roleplaying game incase you didnt know this Kzan.<br>
Fuvi could be banging your wife and I wouldnt care as long as he is a nice guy in game. Thats why I play this game, if I wanted to get to know the real people I would be going to all the RL meetings or FunFaires or whatever they are called and just skip out playing. Hey do you know that Rollen is convicted for 8 murders and is currently on the US most wanted list? Well he aint (probably<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but he could be. You would never know, and I wouldnt really care. He is one damn nice guy in game, and thats what I care about.<br>
You guys keep judging Fuvi for stuff he does off the game, like sending emails and shit to people. Dude how hard is it to ignore a email?<br>
Wanna start talking about how much Fuvi done for the guild? As the toon Fuvi. Well lets just be nice to you and say you did 1/3 of what Fuvi done to this guild. Then I dont count you turning your back to the guild because you wanted to spend time with restoria/kritical when they guildremoved. They didnt even get guildremoved, they just quit.  <br>
Less then a week later you seem to be damn good in knowing whats best for the guild. Applauding the decission to boot fuvi. Posting Kudos on how great this matters where handled. Strange how me and many many others thought that booting you, and start building a new guild without backstabbers like yourself was tossed away pretty fast. Better to get rid of fuvi and /plead the people who left on their own free will to come back.Since some of them dont agree with Fuvi. Another decission who wasnt made by the officers. And none of us supported it. Still the decission was made without discussing it.<br>
Lets talk a little bit about the timing aswell. I said multiple times that removing Fuvi from the guild based on some emails would make more people leave. I said 4 to 5 others will go with him. I dont know how many the real number is now but I know that the way he got booted was so ugly that you will probably lose even more members because of the way it was handled. Since we lost 5 members in a week, 3 quiting guild and 2 others quit EQ I dont think sacrificing a handful more to please 2 of the people who quit and maybe get them back is a good trade.<br>
About how Fuvi was guildremoved, he didnt get any chance to say goodbye even, just a tell then /guildremove.<br>
He could be posting a goodbye, if his account wasnt banned emediatly. Same as mine. I had to say my goodbyes in tells to every single member instead. Luckily 95% of the people i spoke to agreed on my decission and they will remain as dear friends as they did before.<br>
Ive had my fun in Fire and Fury, and its not a bad guild. Most of the members are awesome people. Weve accomplished things that no one else on this server has. The last 9 months Ive had a familly that I could ask for help if I needed, help out when they needed, and raid with. Killing harder and tougher mobs all the time, man it been 9 wonderful months and I dont regret a single day of that time.<br>
However the way things where handled the last 2 weeks was aweful and that combined with removing my best friend in this game due to some emails he sent, and the fact that I got lied to in a very important matter by another one of my best friends was the reasons I left.<br>
<br>
To end it up I will add another little quote that I got to hear 3 minutes after I guildremoved from another person who wasnt in the guild at the moment.<br>
&quot;Have fun in AS with the other assholes&quot; Out of the blue.<br>
Thanks for that one, I definatly deserved that comment and you where the perfect person to say something like that.<br>

<br>
However that is what happens when you abandon a good core of players.  I don't know about the internal workings of FaF, but I do know one thing, something that is blantantly obvious to anyone with their eyes open.<br>
<br>
Over the past month FaF has allowed basically anyone breathing of certain classes into their halls.  With those added numbers comes added security and less tolerance for the sometimes controversial opinions of the old.  With less tolerance comes a forgettful memory of what &quot;the old&quot; truly did contribute...<br>
<br>
This isn't a flame of FaF because I think as think they are a great guild capable of wonderful things.  There are also many many wonderful and helpful people amoung your halls.  And I truly hope you guys can all just calm down and work through this.<br>
<br>
Best of luck,<br>

Oh I thought the discussion was about loot -/  misread on my part.<br>
<br>
The waker of The Sleeper is adding the content of having a rampaging dragon run through the lands of Velious.  Sure it only happens once but most things in the game aren't as good as the first time you experience them.<br>

Downward spiral. Is it going to be Awakened Souls and just us if this continues? Competiton/adversaries, whatever. Been some major &quot;ball-dropping&quot; lately, and flaming your last ally that walked out of the door. I know we had Ogah/Shoug and they became instant pariahs for the affairs that took place, but what are you trying to do to Fuvi? <br>
<br>
You talk about you wont say what was in private Bako? Everyone knows this mindgame. Simply mentioning it makes it worse then what it was. <br>
<br>
You talk about Fuvi in this manner here Wither and Kzan? What happens when you are out here and you feel &quot;jilted?&quot; What happens if you go online today, and you are next? Are you two just that sort of monkey, to go throwing feces at Fuvi, and forget that all that stops you from being him are a few choices? <br>
<br>
Fire and Fury has lately been a pair of shoes. I saw one drop about hrmmm..when we started going in the Tomb if I remember. Now you have another shoe to drop, and I don't wish bad things to come to you. <br>
<br>
However when you spend your time biting everyone that comes from your ranks for what they said, you just add to the thread, and then add to what everyone else assumes about us.<br>
<br>
I don't know about all of Resolution, just most...but we talk. I can tell you two things that you may find secretive but hey, everyone knows it.<br>
<br>
It won't be Resolution in there waking the Sleeper. Quote me on that. <br>
<br>
It won't be Resolution giving up members for something so dumb as one zone because guess what? Loot is important, but screwing others is not. Quote me on that as well.<br>
<br>
Lets just say it in black and white please, so that this whole Server and understand where you are coming from. Then we can all get over it and move on please?<br>
<br>
&lt;Serion deciphers the text of Fire and Fury Jargon  that he's seen in the many threads, and much like ancient cuneiform, came to this conclusion:&gt;<br>
<br>
-&quot;We want to wake the Sleeper, because we are scared that others will take our chances of taking our loot in the future. We don't want competion, and we came here to this server to be number one. Oh no...they are catching up, they are all catching up. They talk about it, they want it, they are going to look like us! Oh no...wake the damn hybrid dragon, stop the loot madness!&quot;-<br>
<br>
Don't worry folks. We think the same thing as well. But, we add something else to this little script here.<br>
<br>
-&quot;Oh wait. We like the challenge and its cool to be cool to others. Game on!&quot;-<br>
<br>
Don't sweat so much. To you it may only be a &quot;game&quot; but to others that do want to see the dragon? Hell let them. Then you can go to sleep at night, happy.<br>
<br>
Now all monkeys please put down the feces... <p><img src= "http://www.tshrew.net/serion/Arch%20Battlemagus%20of%20Tunare.jpg" border="0">

Never said those words, Humle. You are probably confused with someone who did say those words or I am just mis reading your post.<br>
<br>
I don't believe I attacked you, believe it or not I have a certain amount of respect for you. All I said was Fuvi's own best friend in Eq, (or however you want to word it) understood why he was ejected and it clearly wasn't over the sleeper.<br>
<br>
If you still have access to the boards Humle, you will see in one of my posts I actually say I understand why you left. That you choose to stand by your friend no matter what he did. I speculated that perhaps you were trying to save him from becoming something truly evil and that I hoped he didnt drag you down with him.<br>
<br>
Fuvi, you are a liar and much worse. You will most certainly not receive an apology from me. How kind of you to reveal what you did to the rest of us on these boards in your other post. Very nice spin on it. Very controlled. Nice of you to leave out some of the details and just gloss it over for us all. Perhaps you did so in the interest of our readers to try and keep your post short and easy to read.<br>
<br>
You intentionally with held loot from the guild. You set out to destroy relationships of several people who had given you access to personal information about them because they trusted you. What really sickens me about all of this Fuvi is that you have admitted that you did all of this...  and not because you were angry, or jealous, but you did all of this for your amusement.<br>

<br>
Then I assume you are going to let everyone know on the server so they can be online and in the correct zones to watch this 'one time server only' content?<br>
<br>
And what if some guild up and coming would rather kill the warders then to see The Sleeper awoken?  You would be determining, in a way, what they can get out of the Velious expansion.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm with the other posters who said wakening The Sleeper is not a nice thing to do to the up and coming guilds.  <br>
<br>
Just because you got to the pool first doesn't give you the right to piss in it.<br>
<br>
And to the people who said if you aren't in ST then you are a non factor is a bunch of BS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzianu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zianu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 12:38:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.mchsi.com/~robangel/Zianu.gif width=71 height=177></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> wuld mes like ta kill warders in st when mes biggie nuff?<br>

You take that little joke that Fuvi made as a serious threat to any relationship? Or even as intended as an attempt to 'destroy a relationship'? <br>
And what spin did he put on it? Unless you'd like to state otherwise, what he posted was in fact the email as it was?<br>
I got no beef with you Kzan, and I know you wouldn't intentionally try to convince people that Fuvi was a relationship destroying monster just to get even/ save face ... I mean, I believe Bako would do that for those reasons, but not you. So i'm telling you, even looking at it from an impartial point of view, you are over reacting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=5.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=5.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=5.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showMessageRange?topicID=5.topic&start=81&stop=92>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showPrevMessage?topicID=5.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showNextMessage?topicID=5.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49>Apep's Dead Horse Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
