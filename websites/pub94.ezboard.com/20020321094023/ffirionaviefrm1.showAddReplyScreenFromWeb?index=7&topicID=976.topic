<br>
I know for a fact that a 2 group guild can experience 95+% of the game. This includes killing dragons, doing epic quests, etc.<br>
<br>
There are 2 main positive things that big guilds do: they increase the CHANCE that you will have the right people online to do a given quest or task and they increase the CHANCE that you will be grouped with someone who is accountable to player authorities.<br>
<br>
Large guilds have terrible problems however, that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Loot Whoring, Whining, Cronyism, Nepotism, Internal Politics, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
I say this: if you are 40+ and have 12-15 people that you trust on the server, make a guild with them, and enjoy the game. Go slowly and see everything. The game is huge and a lot of people just pass by things because they don't know they are there. <p>Nakath<BR>

For those guilds who want to preserve their uniqueness but enjoy the benefits of broader opporunities it could be a great option.  But a mass guild of various things mashed together probably isn't in the cards.<br>
<br>
If you want this to happen that's great, start talking to leaders and arrange something.  But like a lot of ideas that get posted on this board, most starting with &quot;It's time to...&quot; this isn't going to go anywhere on the strength of just saying what should happen.  It takes someone willing to put in the time and effort to organize it and take responsibility for it.  That isn't me.  Is it you, Feneant?<br>

Most come to be because the smaller guilds cannot compete with the &quot;Uber Guild&quot; and team up to put themselves on the same level.<br>
<br>
Druzzil Ro is the only one I have a link for:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.druzzilroalliance.com/">www.druzzilroalliance.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
FV won't have that problem, I think, since the few &quot;Ubers&quot; we have seem fairly well-natured and the population is so low that there should be no real reason to compete for spawns (I hope, anyway - we'll see what happens when several clerics need Ragefire).  <br>
<br>
The guild alliance idea could help here to coordinate the smaller guilds in raids, but this message board would seem to be more than sufficient for that task.<br>

My original thought was to have a guild with no real leader and the officers being the leaders from other guilds and a few others.  But even the guild alliance is not only a plausible solution, its needed.  Like pretty much everyone else, I have a list of item I wish to obtain but require more strenght then what I can muster, some items requiring rather complete raids.  From what I've seen, there have been very few raids, even of smaller and weaker zones, for some, the idea of forming a guild is just to say 'Hey, I run a guild', but then if nothing is done, the guild is basically just another chat channel and nothing more.<br>
<br>
As for what helmgest posted, see, it does make sense, they are 6 guilds formed together to have a better chance at getting what they need.  I've not heard of anyone getting an epic on this server, but I do know mine requires killing the queen of Chardok, 2 dragons, a spiroc lord and the Maestro and how many guilds on the server can say 'Hey, let's raid Chardok so our warriors can get their epics'.  Even if this is an RP server, I don't plan on being in Karnor from 45-60 killing the same mobs over and over wearing crafted till it rots off my body.<br>
<br>
There's a difference between being a small knit group of players and just waiting until you hit a wall and can't get any more gear, complete any new quests or hit any new zones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ustormtower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormtower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Travelling Circus</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 11:05:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=976.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ahem.</span><hr size=1> <br>
There was a large alliance on the Prexus server known as &quot;Genesis&quot;.  The member-guilds changed a lot, and while there were a few alliance-level events, there was a lot more friction than there would have been if there wasn't an official alliance.<br>
<br>
There are a few problems with guild alliances.  The primary one being that there is still an &quot;Us vs Them&quot;.  And right next to that is the issue of communication -- the guild channel does a lot toward binding people closer together.<br>
<br>
If the purpose of a guild is to get people together for groups and item-hunts, then just drop the pretenses of roleplaying and do it.<br>

I noticed that you were still guildless, hehe.<br>
<br>
Actually, I talked to a friend yesterday in another guild, and if I can get out leaders to liaise (oh yes, blue collar lingo!), it could go places as both our guilds have around 30 members or so.  Even if the uniting guilds doesn't work, I'll try to work an alliance.<br>
<br>
I have seen people whom my idea interested, but most of them, like me, had no power in their guild and were just members, but some do see the need for an increased number of members in the guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unimiane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimiane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 12:36:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=976.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My Two Copper</span><hr size=1> A friend of mine, who led a large-ish guild on Drinal, attempted to set up a &quot;United Guilds of Drinal&quot; for the same purposes - to let the smaller guilds unite to tackle the epic-level encounters.   There was no one leader, and each guild in the alliance had representatives on a &quot;council&quot; (generally the guild leader and one officer) and I believe they met montly.<br>
<br>
Like Stormtower mentioned on Prexus, there was a LOT of friction in the alliance.  For whatever reason, people couldn't seem to get along or make compromises on even minor issues - there was squabbling about everything from when the meetings would occur, to every rule that discussed, to accusations flying around whether the larger guild and my friend was just trying to absorb smaller guilds and destroy their rules and &quot;families&quot; (they weren't).  With no alliance leader, decisions were rarely made and when they were people would threaten to pull their guild out of the alliance.  <br>
<br>
When the raids did occur, they were disasters for the most part - people felt slighted on the signups, and even with loot rules in place nobody could decide who would get the loot (no OUR ranger deserves that Thorny Vine tunic!!  Why is it that YOUR guild always gets loot?), raid leadership was notibly absent and they almost always ended up in mass wipeouts with insanely long CR times.<br>
<br>
In contrast, the guild I was in had about 25+ low to mid 50s, and we were not aligned with the United Guilds of Drinal.  My guild leader instead focused on building alignments with other like-minded guilds. We ran successful raids and had a lot of fun with our aligned guilds, with no bad blood, no loot arguments, and no hassle.  I think having alliances with like-minded guilds rather than trying to put a bunch of dissimilar guilds in one alliance works a LOT better.  And even as a member of a guild, by getting out and getting to know other guilds, you can help forge these alliances. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unimiane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimiane</A> at: 1/3/02 5:06:41 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
