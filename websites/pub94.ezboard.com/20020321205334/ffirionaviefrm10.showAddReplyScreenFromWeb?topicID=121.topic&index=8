<br>
Neutrality. They stand in the middle ground simply because they are afraid of Conflict. They won't stand with the so called 'Extremes' because they do not want to fight. They want to sit about, praise Tunare, get Fat and Leech off of the Fighting Between Good and Evil.<br>
<br>
Making Choices for yourself? Yes, and you called Me Selfish, right? Selfish, looking out for self?<br>
<br>
I look out for my Cause and my purpose, something that is much bigger then my 'self'. Neutrality is the one that is Near sighted and blind, they cannot even see past their own bodies to see the Larger picture of Conflict and War that is waged day in and day out on Norrath.<br>
<br>
They have 'better' things to do. Like use those Poor Trolls to gain their loot, or Darkelven fighters to bust in Alter Planes and gather their armor. Thats all fine for now, soon Neutrality will have no choice but pick a side or die for..<br>
<br>
Die for nothing. The Death of a Dog.<br>
<br>
But you are right in one aspect. I am mean. I am Cruel, heartless, and cold.<br>
<br>
But I am not Cruel, heartless, and cold because I am evil. I am evil because I am cruel, heartless, and cold.<br>

You say those of neutrality are weak and afraid of battle. When the truth is far from it. Those like I could simply care less of your delusions and your gods. I for one have no quarrel with anyone and what they do. Their business is their own. As is mine.<br>
<br>
However, I am afraid you will become very learned soon as to how afraid of conflict I am should you or anyone be foolish enough to put forth a challenge.....You will be met full force with the skill of a ferocious tiger and maybe have the chance to ponder why your so called gods have forsaken you as I split your skull into.<br>

<br>
“Vile one, you haven’t the faintest idea of what  you speak. You talk of Conflict? And neutrality being for the weak? Let me educate you, foolish child of Hate. The conflict, the battle, the killing, these do not discriminate between good and evil. The most righteous cleric of Tunare and the most despicable thief in the service of Innoruuk can both be brought low by a sword through their abdomen, or their neck or mouth if a quick kill is desired.<br>
<br>
“Some of you, you have the choice of whom to serve, of what cause you choose to defend with your life. But there are others of us who do not have such luxuries. We are commanded to seek out the battle and give ourselves to it. This order does not come from an earthly commander, but from a fire that burns in our hearts and cannot be extinguished.  We may attempt to give our lives to another cause” – <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> at this, the elf sighed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> – “but find that in the end, we cannot change from how the gods originally made us. And…”<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> At this, the elf was brought up short by the sounds of fighting off in the fields. His interest aroused, he ducked low among the tall grass and sneaked quietly up to the combatants. It seemed that a young wood elf, far away from home, had fallen afoul of a troll lurking in the swamps nearby. Aradil watched the fight with interest, observing the skill with which the elf avoided the heavy blows from the troll’s club. But the elf tripped on the root of a nearby tree, and went down to the ground. Seizing the moment, the troll swung his club down toward the elf’s head…<br>
<br>
…and the elf saw Aradil, hiding in the grass. Though his fate was already decided, a plea for help went out from the young elf’s eyes. A brief sigh escaped Aradil’s lips…<br>
<br>
 …and the club crushed the elf’s skull, and the eyes were no more. The troll raised his head and howled to the sky, proclaiming his victory to whatever vile god he worshipped.  He bent down to feast upon his fallen foe.<br>
<br>
But Aradil had crept up behind the troll while the monster gloated, and within moments, the troll slumped down on top of the elf’s corpse. The warrior wiped the green blood off on the troll’s rags, and then sheathed it.<br>
<br>
As Aradil continued his journey, his thoughts continued as well.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

“I have no love for the monsters in the swamps, or the dark skinned murderers in their underground home.

A man in shiny steel fullplate stands up, says his peace , salutes Shintou and leaves the area.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite an amusing conversation. Atleast Shintou has honor and a cause, even though its the wrong path.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Societies, families, and individuals alike should be willing to do what is right, and to set what is right down as law. Some might be asked to make sacrifices for the good of others. Those unwilling to do so, those who say that rules are too constraining and are unwilling to abide by them because it discomforts them to do so, are selfish. Selfishness often leads to evil. Evil is intolerable.&quot;<br>

Do you not see the corpse of the lone tier'dal within your woods?  Did your people not hunt him down and slay him?  Why?  You call us evil for doing the exact same thing.  Its hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
And you druids and rangers who say we are evil for killing your wolves and bears... what are they for attacking our children for no just cause?  They are fit to live and our children are not?  You would hold a wolf or bear's life in higher regard than a person?  You cry out when you see the corpse of those beasts rotting in the sun yet you buy armor made from their pelts.  I call you a hypocrit.  <br>
<br>
Innoruuk is our Father, yes.  He fuels our hearts with hatred, yes.  Is this hatred unjust?  I think not.<br>
<br>
I am not a pawn of evil, I am not evil.  This is not a child's game.  This is survival.  Kill or be killed.  Fight or die.  You hunt mine and I hunt yours.  Survival of the fittest.  The meek shall inherit nothing.  Hypocrisy is the true evil. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/6/02 7:15:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *sad sigh*</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kimaya just looks at Anrae with a short, sad sigh.

Oh sweetie, you listened to my voice but I don't think you understood a word I said.  I don't know if you even can, but since you asked questions I'll answer them.<br>
<br>
Are your children hunted and slain by my people?  <br>
<br>
I have seen other elves who have fallen in the woods.  I have also seen tall elves, tree elves, humans and all sorts of other people in the same state.  And I am as sad when I see them as I am when I see the unskinned wolves and bears, because they weren't killed because someone needed food.  They may not even have been killed because someone needed to defend themselves.  They may just have been killed because of fear or of hate.  But whether I like it or not, both the murderers and the murdered are still my family, still my people.<br>
<br>
And your next question... Is a wolf's life more valuable than a person's?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She tilts her chin and pauses for a moment.  Her brow is slightly furrowed as she looks into Anrae's eyes as if searching for something.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I value all life.  Norrath holds the city you grew up in as close to her heart as she holds the city of the dwarves.  Tunare gives growth to the trees of your forest as surely as she does those of the Feerot, and of Toxxulia.  And if my Mother and my Grandmother find worth in anything enough to feed and protect, who am I to question them?  Who am I to love anyone any less than they?  Who am I to hate…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She suddenly blinks and breaks her eyes away from Anrae's, her eyes a little shiny.  She almost seems to shake a moment, then returns her gaze again with all the fire and passion she showed in her first speech to Shintou.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And even though I know you already have your own answer to your last question, I’ll answer it just the same.  The hate that Innoruuk inflicts you with IS unjust.  But the injustice is to you, not me.  He forces this hate on you with constant attacks, constant pain.  He needs you and your people so desperately that he fights every moment to keep you in as much torture and torment as he forced on your ancestors.  And like them, you’re not strong enough to fight the endless onslaught.  Maybe someday you will be, and maybe someday you’ll come home again…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kimaya realizes she’s trailing off, and that her speech isn’t going to do much good.

<br>
It’s okay if you don’t, I understand.  It’s hard to be strong.  So instead I’ll be strong for you.  And maybe if you wear this, and see how lovely it is on your beautiful blue skin, it will remind you of me.  And maybe, for just a moment, knowing there’s someone who cares will help you hurt just a little less.<br>

I am the only daughter of the granddaughter of the second brother  to the King of Neriak. I grew up well cared for, but not spoiled or drowned in opulence. My needs were met, but not grandly, if you gather my meaning. My mother was a cleric of Innoruuk, fanatic in her motions to please her god. My father fell when i was very young, and my memories few of him. As I grew, my mother brought me with her to the temple in the third gate, to bring me to Innoruuk.. i was 10, the time of decisions. When i looked at the way my mother changed in this place, at the way everyone looked, I decided No god would affect me this way. Gods use man to satisfy their own ends. You label me &quot;neutral&quot;, but i was Free to rule my own destiny, my own future.<br>

The day my eyes glazed over, my will became stronger, and a voice thundered in my head, &quot; Kill Him!&quot;  I am now in service to Innoruuk, yes, I am still &quot;neutral&quot; by nature of who i am, but follow a god by my choosing. Yesterday you asked me, How fares Sel'quar, in response i answered, We prosper. Your next question was &quot;on the backs of neutrals?&quot; I speak for Sel'quar, and I am neutral, Am i weak? no, do i use others to aid my house in it's growth? Nau, I do not. I do not understand you anymore Shin...and given your hostility toward me, I'm not sure i want to. <br>

Daughter of Tunare, you are right in saying we are all children of Tunare. Long past is that fact, and no teir'dal would openly admit that. We are proud of who we are, we hold our traditions tightly in our fist.  Innorruuk made us thus, he planted his seed in the new &quot;king and queen&quot; of Neriak.  But as bloodlines continue the link to Tunare is diluted with each teir'dal child's birth. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> shakes her hair back, holding her head high as her lavender eyes sparkle</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Okay, I've got a riddle for you then!<br>
<br>
A coupla weeks ago, I took a bunch of clay.  I slipped it up with some water and molded into the cutest little doll!  Then I put in a pretty stone so that my doll was holding it, and then stuck it in the kiln so it would be in the fire until it was as hardened as it could be.  It's been out of the fire a long time now, and I've carried it all over the place since then.<br>
<br>
So here's the riddle: What is my doll made of?<br>
