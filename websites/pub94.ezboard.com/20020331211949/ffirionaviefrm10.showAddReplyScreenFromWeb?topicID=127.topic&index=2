I kept one eye<br>
on him, and one eye on the gleaming and fiery god <br>
that I saw sitting next to me on a wooden barstool.<br>
<br>
He was surely the avatar of my Master, the brash and powerful Solusek Ro!  Who else would have one hand <br>
on his gleaming sword, and the other poised on a mere mug of milk with so much power and strength?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Pax!&quot; I gasped, out of breath.  &quot;I come in peace,<br>
Burning Prince!  Solusek Ro, may your great flames <br>
consume all that is vile...all that is hateful and seeks<br>
to fill Norrath with fear!  Snuff out Disease, save for<br>
when I channel it in your great Name!  Hear your <br>
servant, Milord!&quot;  I prostrated myself on the ground.<br>
<br>
Fish Ranamer, confused by this sight, lay my small<br>
flask of Elven Wine next to my hand.  I picked it up,<br>
drank some, and then began a rise in bodily heat<br>
that only the most favored of the Lord of Flame can <br>
withstand.  Slowly, as if I were a log on the hearth, <br>
I smoldered and  burst into flame.  I then warbled:<br>
<br>
&quot;Exalted Ro, from Plane of Sun to Norrath came,<br>
 Your crown as molten gold, your eyes as flame!<br>
  So fearlessly and forcefully you incite Change!<br>
  Most highly favored Prince!<br>
  Sol-u-sek!&quot;  (I turned this into a bold 7-syllable word,<br>
  prolonging the 'Sol' part into 5 distinct notes.)<br>
<br>
I let the flames of my body die down, stood up,<br>
still steaming heavily, and wondered why everyone<br>
inside Fish's Ale was laughing at us!  How rude!<br>
<br>
&quot;That's not Solusek Ro, my young Chrysothemis!<br>
That's some fool Paladin who doesn't follow the <br>
Brell!&quot; howled Trumpy Irontoe.  &quot;HAAAA ha ha ha!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I couldn't decide whether he was laughing more at the<br>
golden knight or at me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 11:26:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solusek Ro...is that you?!</span><hr size=1> I looked over at Trumpy Irontoe, only to stare daggers as he knew that I had come to know the truth of him and of his dark master that lay within the sewers below. The dwarfs smile swiftly faded as one hand moves away from the mug on the bar, and the other now more obviously moved to grasp the hilt of my sword.<br>
<br>
I looked over at the half elf that was before me, and back over to the bar, now relaxing my group upon my blade. &quot;I am a simply knight milady. My name is Banegrivm, I am a paladin of Mithaniel Marr, the Lord of Valor.&quot; What tis thy name? <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaxalygen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 4:40:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My escape from Freeport  (P.S.  I'm a Bard now.)</span><hr size=1> I smiled at Banegrivm, a rosy blush tinting my <br>
cheeks.  &quot;I am Chrysothemis of Ro.  Solusek<br>
Ro is my deity, and I see that Mithaniel and He<br>
have a friendly rivalry together.&quot;  My face grew<br>
pleasantly hot.  This one certainly wasn't like any <br>
of the brash Dwarven Paladins I had seen traveling<br>
through Freeport.  For one thing, he drank no ale!<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you abstain from the liquorly pleasures,&quot;<br>
I grinned.  &quot;Aye, 'tis good.  Spirits cloud your<br>
judgment, and though I drink wine, 'tis only to<br>
start cleansing fire to course through my veins.&quot;<br>
<br>
Banegrivm nodded.  He seemed to smile at me,<br>
although in a cautious and meditative manner.  I<br>
could tell this was a man that did not let his inner<br>
heart boil over his surface, as mine sometimes did.<br>
<br>
I lowered my head and my eyes halfway, intending<br>
to tell him a secret.  &quot;I had to escape from Freeport.<br>
The dung-filled streets and menacing Militia were <br>
beginning to make me uneasy, and I also had <br>
trouble with Pietro Zarn.&quot;  Pietro Zarn, fear the <br>
name, was the leader of the Church of the <br>
Dismal Rage, a Human enclave of Innoruuk <br>
followers.  He was a powerful Shadow Knight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pietro Zarn saw me as I strolled through the city<br>
on holiday.  Many had said the City Founded on<br>
Sweat and Steel was the greatest of all cities, but<br>
I found it filled with dark rogues and the most fetid of<br>
dung heaps.  To me, Freeport was trash.  Pietro<br>
lusted after my blazing red armor--and blazing-red<br>
lips.  He asked me if I were a half-courtesan.&quot;<br>
<br>
Half-courtesans, of the Bards, were not the singers<br>
who sold their love easily.  One man would pay a<br>
top price for a girl, and she would become his<br>
mistress for life unless the suitor gave her some<br>
beige silk slippers, which meant &quot;go and good-bye.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I told Zarn that I was indeed a half-courtesan.<br>
<br>
He said he would gather up every coin--copper,<br>
silver, gold, platinum--that the Church of the Dismal<br>
Rage had.  He said that the work of Innoruuk <br>
could wait a thousand years, but that the half-<br>
courtesan Bard girl of Solusek only came along<br>
once in an Age.  Pietro vowed to pay the highest<br>
price possible for me at the Bards' bidding table.<br>
<br>
That night,&quot; I finished, gazing at Banegrivm<br>
intensely, &quot;I fled Freeport entirely, yearning for<br>
my home back here.  I cannot stand Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wondered if Banegrivm would reject me now,<br>
because I was not only a Bard, but a fiery semi-tart.<br>
<br>

I'm a Bard now.)</span><hr size=1> I smiled with a soft ease, that did show within the deep pools of my dark eyes. My hand rested from my sword hilt and returned to my cup before me, and my attentions now turned to this maiden before me.<br>
<br>
The more she spoke, the more I was at ease. A pleasant distraction from the toils of the world about me, yet also did I feel sad for her troublesome past.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry milady that such wickedness would befall thee in fair Freeport.&quot;, I said as I looked upon her. &quot;The city of valor is not as it once was. It was once a bright and beautiful place until Sir Lucan fell from grace and brought his evil hold upon it. Now it is a place many fight to seek to restore in the name of our father&quot;, I said as I sipped from my mug looking almost distant for but a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pietro Zarn and his allies of the Church of the Firstborn are my immortal enemies. I would gladly die upon a field of battle then lower myself to their subjections and influences&quot;, my lips turned to a half scowel and my body tightened its posture. I watched out of the corner of my eyes, knowing Trumpy Irontoe had overheard of me. I shifted my eyes in his direction and my jaw stiffened. I watched as he shakenly set down his mug and made haste out into the streets of fair Qeynos.<br>
<br>
I reverted my gaze and looked down into the mugs contents, still somewhat tense, but then over to the maiden before and smiled. I could still see her gaze looking towards the floor. I raised my armor clad hand to her, and raised her chin to look her in the eyes. &quot;Fear not the works of Pietro Zarn milady, for the dread lord fears the light. Thee has naught to fear as long as thee dwells amidst the places of the light&quot;, I smiled at her and drank from my cup. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
