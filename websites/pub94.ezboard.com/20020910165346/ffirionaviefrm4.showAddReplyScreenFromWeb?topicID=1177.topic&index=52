<br>
sorry, i don't want to rip out his throat.  i haven't convicted him and tossed him in jail.  if i saw him, i wouldn't even bother sending him a /tell to say what a pathetic little jerk i might think he is either, which is a lot less than what some folks are probably doing every time he comes online.<br>
<br>
but personally i really don't think anyone trying to redeem a wrongdoing is going to show good faith by shouting out &quot;have you all forgiven me yet?&quot; across an entire zone.  who the hell cares if anyone has forgiven him?  he should get back to business and show that he's worthy of forgivenness, and then wouldn't have reassure himself by yelling.    <br>
<br>
if he's truly concerned about what happened, he'd keep his mouth shut and keep his nose clean from now on.  apparently, doing the right thing isn't really his concern.  boosting his self-esteem, or having fun trying to 'get over' or mess with people's minds quite possibly is.<br>
<br>
you've obviously never lived with children and seen their manipulative little ways.  saying 'sorry' and skipping merrily away doesn't fix what happened.  and he said sorry after the problem was already fixed by OTHER parties.  saying sorry is a very cheap way out of feeling guilt, but it does little to recompense anyone or re-establish trust.  <br>
<br>
if he wants to regain credibility, even (and especially) if it is for something he may not have done, that comes from actions and not words.<br>

Some kids are self conscious about their age, enough to lie about travelling abroad to obtain education, just to make themselves seem older, and thus, cooler.  Maybe it doesn't register to the person the same way it registers to you.  Maybe he doesn't think of EQ as an alternate life, but rather sees it as a game, and when he does something stupid and people get all freaky weird over it, and the GMs zap the thing away, he can't fess up to doing it because he's too concerned with being 'cool' in the place he likes, which is this server.<br>
<br>
It's no secret that on most servers there's large groups of scammers with their own little tricks of the trade.  Their behavior is tolerated, even championed there.  Maybe he has been stuck around these types of degenerates and knows no better, much like the characteristic 'DING 2!!!!11!1' shouters who must suffer from the classic AOL 'Me Too!' -itis.<br>
<br>
I don't necessarily think everyone should forgive him, but those not directly involved taking on the mantle of righteousness need to be taken down a notch.  If you don't like him, fine, don't deal with him.  Inform others, if it pleases you.  But when he makes any attempt at all to return his reputation to dubious, well, you can at least return the favor by kicking it up to threatening.<br>
<br>
Blind hatred = blind stupidity in my book.  I'm just as sickened by some of the stuff I've read as by the foolish zealots who want to 'nuke the arabs'...<br>
<br>
I hear all of you say &quot;He shouldn't be shouting, he should be out there trying to prove his worth&quot; and blah blah blah...well what the hell do you expect him to do?  Especially when you offer NO advice on how he can regain that trust.  Might as well tell a blind man to walk a tightrope for all the good it will do him.<br>
<br>
And so it wasn't an epic, but rather an epic piece.  Big whoop!  You're still a moron if you go trying to give people reasons to screw you over.  If I have some important quest item, I'm not satisfied until the thing is in the bank, where if it disappears I can bitch at VI over it.  I most certainly wouldn't be letting people take a look at it.  If someone is concerned with the stats of something, kindly direct them to allakhazam's. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 5:43:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> You would sound like a complete ass if you told someone to use a web resource to look at the stats of something rather than taking two seconds out of your time to put it up in a trade window for full inspection. Note that he didn't really mean to actually TRADE the Soulfire, but just wanted to show it off.<br>
<br>
The problem comes in when Valancer thinks of it as his, when obviously a borrowed weapon cannot be compared to the Soulfire. He was told that it wasn't an intentional trade, and he was asked to give it back. Instead of going along with this, he proceeds to gloat about his newfound fortune, and also rub it in the face of the previous owner.<br>
<br>
Again, I firmly believe that the previous owner would have never received his sword if it weren't for the GMs. And yes, it is quite amusing that all of a sudden the brother gets back from his vacation and makes a public plea for forgiveness on behalf of his &quot;mental&quot; brother. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxadria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xadria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/02 7:40:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1177.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Horrible Mistake!!!</span><hr size=1> I was there in CC with the Gm's and Valancer...

While there the Gm's were discussing what to do about the situation... he was sending tells laughing about the whole thing... Then to top it off.. the Gm told him that if he camped the soulfire would be removed immediatly... <br>
<br>
After hearing Aaeb's side of the story and laughing some more in tells... what does he do... /q out of the game.. <br>
<br>
The very next day is in the bazaar asking people to see their equipment in trade windows... wtf<br>

It's a 12 year old. You people give little snots too much credit. We were all (for the most part) demented little psychos at that age. This is par for the course for someone that age in a video game, and I have no idea why anyone expects/hopes for better. Yes, I am sure that there are plenty of kids that age who don't act that way and play EQ, but they're a rarity. He wants to stay, fine. He acts up again, chances are he'll get his ass banned, and that will be the end of it- and he'll probably move back to Counter-Strike or whatever. Just ignore the empty can rattling.

This thread has about as much validity as a Soulfire does in the hands of Valancer.<br>
<br>
Two points.<br>
<br>
A)  Valancer DID act this way.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
B) Valancer's imaginary brother DID act this way.  If this is the case, Valancer is at much at fault as if he did it.  He is responsible for knowing his own brother, and ultimately, his own account.<br>
<br>
Either way, Valancer just plain doesn't exist anymore.  Re-roll or not, his guild will probably go down as well if there is a single sane person in it.<br>
<br>
Last point.  GM's saw this as a major grief.  We all know that it takes a lot to get any GM to act.  Obviously Valancer was way out of line.  Attacking Aaeb for making a simple mistake with the new UI is silly.  We have all put things up in the trade window to show an item to someone, and we all trust ourselves to not accidentally trade it.  Human error is common.  Whenever I do this my heart skips a beat...more so now than ever. <p><center>
