It seems like most people either are too low to get this done or too high and either gaining exp (like im doing) or raiding.  Are there people who are actually trying to get some items via questing?  I was trying to get some twilight armor done, but of course, most zones are empty and people aren't interested.  I do have some good items, but I had to buy them with my hard earned (and sometimes farmed) money, the only remaining items I quested for being crafted.  There are tons of good stuff to be had, but getting it doesn't seem very plausible.  <br><br>Example, im 45, and I wear a rockhopper hide belt of 6 ac.  There are plenty good belts out there, but getting them means going in a zone to find it empty or to try and find a party willing to do the 6 hour camp for it which most wont.<br><br>Hmmm, what are your solutions to this?  Although I check those who sell in the forum, but most are the same people who can either farm/camp easily or just solo everything.<br><br>[/Tv is starting to show stuff]<br><br>(Don't I always have the most negative posts... and yeah, the server is STILL dying) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/29/02 7:23:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1226.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone else notice how hard it is to quest or find gear.</span><hr size=1> *smile*<br>I've had no problems getting quests done on FV, or going with a group to do item camps either for that matter.

Everyone has something they want.  Deciding on which want to satisfy with the group's time is hard to do.  The nicer part of being in a guild is that guildies tend to have a longer memory for favors when you helped them out getting gear.<br><br>Even then, if the camp is unpleasant, it can be hard to get help.  For instance, on old server with my old monk, it was cake to get help for Chardok pipe -- great xp, empty zone.  Getting help for Karnor's pipe was like pulling teeth.  XP isn't too hot and the zone is just packed with r00d d00ds arguing over every spawn in sight.  I detested KC myself, so I really understood why folks didn't flock to help every single day.  The only spot in KC we liked for xp was the sewers -- the d00ds died trying to get in, so we had it to ourselves mostly.<br><br>Anyway, I feel for you -- been there before.  I wouldn't worry so much about gear, though.  Get in enough xp groups in various spots and gear will happen mostly by itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxreynnx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>x Reynn x</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/29/02 8:03:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1226.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well ..</span><hr size=1> Why not type /who friends all.

I must have had 40 different twilight quest items few which matched with the other parts. There are just too many items and too many combinations for it to be worth the time and effort. Quests need to be a little more cut and dry for this stuff like they did with the warrior crafted and the Sol Ro temple quests which also for the most part result in armor as good or better than the new stuff. There is no way more than a few people who have blind luck to do these twilight quests without the help of a spoiler of some sort.

Due to the overall small population, the population of Intrepid Explorers on FV is smaller than normal.<br><br>Lambent Armor is widely considered pretty good midlevel Bard armor.  People know its stats, what it looks like, and are reasonably familiar with the zones you need to traverse.  Nobody know what the Twilight Bard armor is, what stats it has, what it looks like, or even how to get there.  So is it any surprise that people seek out Lambent?<br><br>I imagine that after the Twilight Armor is fully documented, you will see an upsurge in the popularity.  But most people with limited resources and limited play time are going to pick the Good Prizes over taking the Mystery Item behind Curtain Number One.<br><br>You sound like you might be one of those Intrepid Explorers Feneant, and if so, that's cool.
