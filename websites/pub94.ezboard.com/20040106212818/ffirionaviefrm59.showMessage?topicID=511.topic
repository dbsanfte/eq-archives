Inconnu seems to be very busy at the moment, so I will lead the next euro raid. This will be the first raid I have led, please have patience <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
First proposed target: Va Dyn, (Akheva)<br>
Second proposed target: Umbral Plains (Doomshade/Rumblecrush if we get a big force, Radir if smaller)<br>
Time: Thursday night (17th) at 7pm GMT.<br>
Meet: Nexus - south wall<br>
<br>
NOTE: Subject to sign ups and appropriate classes being available. I especially need a CH rotation and a 55+ warrior if we are to try Doom/Rumble.<br>
<br>
To prepare, please read all bestiary information on Allakhazams for the named mobs in both zones - especially healers, debuffers and monks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=126">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...l?zone=126</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<br>
I also need a tracker to check if Va'Dyn is up in Akehva 30 minutes prior to raid time, please could someone volunteer.<br>
<br>
I have stolen Inconnu's raid instructions...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Loot policy:<br>
Gear: <br>
/random 1000 between people who Can and Will Use (CAWI)<br>
If that is noone:<br>
/random all can roll for alts/friends<br>
<br>
Spells: /random between members of relevant class present that have sufficient level to cast. If this is no-one, then /random between all remaining members of relevant class present regardless of level, If no-one of class present at all - spell goes to Shards of Chaos guildbank.<br>
<br>
Orb of Luclinite: - Anyone can /random on this should they wish. It's for Vex Thal key so dead useful to most of us at this time =P<br>
<br>
Cash split:<br>
This will go to - raid Clerics/Enchanter for peridots, raid Necros/SKs for coffins (if needed), Monk puller for Javelin costs. Any excess funds will go to the SoC guildbank.<br>
<br>
Minimum level to attend: 47 (this is not negotiable)<br>
<br>
Other requirements: You must have PoP (I use the raid system)<br>
<br>
Main assist: I will announce a main assist at the raid. Everyone will create a hotbutton with the macro /assist &lt;tankname&gt;.<br>
<br>
Also, make sure attack on assist is disabled.<br>
<br>
To check this:<br>
<br>
The [defaults] section of your eqclient.ini file, should include the following line:<br>
<br>
AttackOnAssist=FALSE<br>
<br>
Raid Channel<br>
<br>
We will use a raid channel for important raid information.<br>
The channel will be euroraid. (No password)<br>
<br>
So please make sure you all /join euroraid at the start of the raid.<br>
<br>
Please do not use this channel for general chitchat!<br>
For general chitchat use groupchat or /join eurochat<br>
<br>
If you are a debuff class you can announce successful debuffs in this channel, e.g.<br>
<br>
;1 Va'Dyn has been malo'd/slowed/crippled etc.<br>
<br>
Also use this channel to announce crowd control activity (mezzing, unmezzable (offtanking))<br>
<br>
Forming Groups<br>
<br>
I will announce groups over raid channel in the form:<br>
<br>
G1 - War (Inviter), War, Clr, Clr, Brd, Rng<br>
G2 - Mnk (Inviter), Shm, Enc, Shd, Mag, Wiz<br>
<br>
Basically if your name is first in the group list, you are the inviter and should invite everyone else in group to group with you. <br>
<br>
I will then do raidinvites.<br>
<br>
Buffing<br>
<br>
Once i ask people to buff up, It is up to groupleaders to make sure their group are appropriately buffed, and to tell the raid channel when they are done.<br>
<br>
I generally recommend:<br>
<br>
junk (not needed for va'dyn - but its a good habit to form!)<br>
junk<br>
stamina<br>
focus/hos<br>
brells (tank/casters) / strength of nature (dps melee)<br>
Call of Predator/Mark of Predator<br>
Heroism/Aegolism/Prot of the Glades (casters)<br>
Clarity line of spells (casters)<br>
Spiritual Light (beastie crack) line of spells (casters)/haste (melee)<br>
Symbol (if no aego)<br>
<br>
In addition on maintanks/backup maintanks:<br>
Agility buff<br>
Call of Earth<br>
Cleric AC buff<br>
<br>
If a buff fades during fight, send a tell to the relevant buffer. Do NOT ask over raid channel. Tells are good because buffers often use the /rt command to target buff requestors.<br>
<br>
Don't bitch about which group you're in<br>
<br>
Unless the raid leader has made an error which you feel will compromise someone's safety on a raid. Just because you prefer to be grouped with a cleric or be in the first group formed does not mean it's best for the raid to have you there. Feel free to question group organization AFTER the raid. I am not infallible. I'm sure we can learn things from constructive criticism, but it's just too annoying to deal with it at the raid itself.<br>
<br>
Going AFK<br>
<br>
If you need to go afk, please check with your group leader and never go afk without putting /afk. If you go afk without putting on /afk or letting your group leader know, they you will be left behind when the raid moves and will have only yourself to blame. We'll help you get your corpse when it's convenient. That may mean an unrezzed death since we're not stopping a raid to do a corpse run for someone who goes afk without notice. Group leaders have a responsibility here to make certain that the raid leader does not move the raid when someone in their group has been allowed to go afk.<br>
<br>
If you must go afk for an extended period of time, please let the raid leader know. You'll probably be asked to gate out (or get a TL) unless we are at a fairly static spot and don't plan to move. Even then, it may be better for you to leave to avoid a death if the raid happens to wipe.<br>
<br>
Do Ask Questions<br>
<br>
But please start by asking your group, rather than the entire raid. If your group doesn't know, go ahead and ask on shardsraid if it's important. If not, it would be better to just note down your question and ask on the boards after the raid. if you ask your important question repeatedly and don't get an answer, sent a /tell to your group leader who will make sure you get your answer.<br>
<br>
Calling the move<br>
<br>
Please watch raid channel carefully for moves to be called. Move promptly. Don't EVER go past the puller or the MA. Don't use autofollow. <br>
<br>
Mob positioning<br>
<br>
The MA should generally be in front of the mob and close to it and should guide its movements. Everyone else should be behind the mob &quot;pushing&quot; at maximum melee range. In general, the MA will try to position mobs in the most advantageous spot, trying to leave room for everyone to engage, avoid adds, and make use of terrain to allow others to avoid AoE damage, all while making sure to keep the mob moving to interrupt casting and prevent gates. (not relevant to Va'Dyn btw -its pure melee)<br>
<br>
Manage YOUR agro<br>
<br>
If you are a nuker - don't open up when the mob is at 90% with 6 solists ice spears in a row.<br>
<br>
If you are a monk, have an evade hotbutton:<br>
<br>
/attack off<br>
/pause 0<br>
/doability #<br>
/sit<br>
/attack on<br>
<br>
(where # = the ability slot you have feign death in)<br>
<br>
If you are a rogue, have an evade hotbutton! (Dunno how to configure this, I haven't played a rogue)<br>
<br>
If you are a ranger, use jolt!<br>
<br>
ENRAGE - a quick primer, in case some people are new to raid class mobs<br>
<br>
When a mob is on low health and level 55+ it has a 'chance' (quite a high one) to enrage when it hits low health. (under 10% I think)<br>
<br>
Whilst a mob is enraged it will riposte ALL attacks from the front automatically. I.e. Every melee attack you try on it from the front, gets blocked, and the mob hits you back once for each attack. <br>
<br>
As you can probably imagine this will kill melee with low delay weapons very fast, as 55+ mobs don't hit like babies. (Va Dyn maxes for 575 a pop)<br>
<br>
For this reason, all melee other than the main tank should be BEHIND the mob, facing the main tank so they do not get hit with riposte damage.<br>
<br>
The main tank should switch off autoattack the instant they see enrage and for the duration of enrage should hit taunt only or if a pally/sk stun, and cast agro spells only. If you aren't fast, you will die or waste huge amounts of healer mana, so be on your toes.<br>
<br>
Enrage is the most common special attack, and it is important you know how to deal with it since we may not have any epic clerics and rezzing people dead to enrage is a waste of mana.<br>
<br>
Don't get demoralised<br>
<br>
People make mistakes, especially when trying new stuff. You might very well die on the raid. (You will get at least a 90 rez.) <br>
<br>
Ok - that's about it, I prolly forgot a lot of stuff. <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening,<br>
