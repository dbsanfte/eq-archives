Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and everyone is entitled to post such an opinion on the web.  Some of the points that are made are valid.<br>
<br>
What I do not agree with are when people report things that aren't right.  I think the one response clears up several of those for this article, but regardless of what color your glasses are, at least get the facts right.<br>
<br>
Other than that, it's an opinion based on a certain perspective.  It doesn't make it right, but it doesn't make it wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukorraisashadowsgate.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Korraisa Shadowsgate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bonecollecter</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/19/01 6:18:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'll let you guys judge for yourselves...</span><hr size=1> OoC: Agreed, some points they made were valid.  But isn't taking your aggression out on some computerised monster, while knowing it's a game, better than throwing things or letting it bottle up in one's own self.  The one other point that strikes me as stupid to even mention is the profanity.  I would have to point out what they get away with on television.  Most of the time when someone starts spewing profanity at someone or the entire zone via /auction, /shout, /ooc...everyone jumps on him or jumps over to /petition and he gets booted.  I think most of us here on Firiona Vie are more civilised than we are in real life.  Because we try to make an effort; sometimes in real life it's NOT worth it. <p><img src="http://www.wynd-haven.com/sigtempt.jpg">

At least Verant has two mechanisms in place to deal with it, which I did not see them mention - petition (cursing in a public channel is grounds for warning, etc) and the chat filter.  I have several friends that use the foul language filter, although some that curse feel the foul language filter somehow makes it ok to curse in a public forum.  I might suggest they read the rules of conduct.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I've never seen it a valid excuse to say that it's ok to do something in one area just because they do worse elsewhere.  To say the get away with worse language on television doesn't justify doing something 'a little less bad' in EverQuest.  It isn't a specific matter of cursing, it is all a matter of respect for others.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel that Verant does a commendable job in the area of cursing compared to other on-line environments.  <br>
<br>
I've never believed that killing creatures on a screen is a tension reliever.  Nor have I ever witnissed someone go into EverQuest angry and come out relaxed after a night of killing.  I'm not saying there aren't folks out there that do, but most of the people I know log out in a worse mood if anything, unless maybe they spent the night fishing or maybe doing quests.  EverQuest can easily cause as much tension as it relieves, though that isn't their point anyway.  Their point is aggressive encouragement, which is a matter of becoming inductive to solving problems by violent reaction and by becoming numb to seeing violence as a way to solve problems.<br>
<br>
The issue I have with trying to take either side of this to some extreme is because there is no simple answer to any of it.  There are people (not just kids, but adults too) that respond to violence in a way that causes them to mimic it in other ways in their lives.  They truly get worse playing games like this, becoming jerks and angry all the time.  There are just as many people that come in from work or school upset and can go kill a few monsters and feel better about themselves.<br>
<br>
There is no single answer because there is no single reaction.  That's why it's really a moot point, and if you find yourself (or see your spouse or your child) reacting negatively to the game, you should encourage them to find another outlet and take a break (maybe even permanent) from the game.  The biggest problem is people don't make the change, and they just get sucked deeper and deeper into their depression or their anger or whatever negative feelings they have.<br>
<br>
It's the same reason some people can play D&amp;D and some people freak out.  It's why some people can lead normal lives and listen to heavy metal, and others hear the demons whispering for them to go kill.  It's a combination of things that foster feelings and the person being open and receptive to those feelings.<br>

<br>
Although, this is an incorrect assumption of the Christian faith.  To my knowledge, Everquest is considered about as evil as Halloween.  People PRETENDING (read: PRETENDING) to be elves and trolls can not be harmful.  However, to some people, this is a lot more than a game.  Everquest becomes an obsession, a deity in itself.  THEN it is an evil game.  But, uh, the game in itself is not evil.<br>
<br>
This would be like saying all plays are evil because the characters *gasp* believe in Zeus. <br>
<br>
While we're on the subject. /rude my neighbors!  On Halloween, they don't even leave any candy out.  They sit in their houses and pray over our souls.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uembermae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EmberMae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/20/01 12:26:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://caelia.20megsfree.com/caelia_thumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'll let you guys judge for yourselves...</span><hr size=1> Give me a break.

The article was entirely way too predictable.  Not surprised in the least by this person's answer.  But he is entitled to his opinions after all.  I doubt he spent much time in the game either, considering the multiple errors (simple ones that a newb should recognize) in his review.  <br>
<br>
I am very curious about what they think of The Sims or Black &amp; White.   Theoretically, you could call both of these God Games... In the Sims, you are, more or less, a God that creates and lords over your family in their not-so-tidy little house.  In B&amp;W, you literally are one.

<br>
The most depressing thing I see from some of these responses is the ignorance displayed by stereotyping all Christians as thinking, acting, or believing the same.  And yes, when you simply refer to 'them' as 'Christians', you are encompassing every Christian in that term.  <br>
<br>
But I can tell you that we are not all close minded bigots that think everything outside of a white picket fence world is evil.  In fact, most Christians that I know are free thinkers and quite tolerant in our views of the Bible and the world.  We don't run around trying to find fault with everything and accuse things we don't like as 'tools of the devil'.  No disrespect to Biblical references, but we are not all sheep.  In fact, I'm more of a cow.  :P<br>
<br>
Stereotyping all Christians under one view is just as ignorant as what you claim 'they' are doing to you.  I know many Christians that play EverQuest, and we enjoy the game immensely.  To think otherwise is just as narrowminded as any other stereotype, including the image you are accusing these fundamentalists of having about gamers.<br>
<br>
This only perpetuatates the cycle of ignorance.  I suggest you choose your terms more carefully.  Sorry, but this gets under my skin as much as those people that stereotype all 'Arabs' as terrorists, etc.<br>
<br>
I agree that this article has a number of errors, and this is quite popular among fundamentalist approaches to anything.  You can find fault in anything if you dig deep enough and conveniently ignore things that would prove you wrong.  Politicians do this, cults do this, the media does this *nods to Kaludram* and pretty much anyone that wants to perform some degree of brainwashing.  Repeat it enough, draw parallels to things that you know are already diskliked, and ignore anything good and you can convince the masses.  That doesn't mean there isn't a shred of truth in what you say, in fact most often you have to have at least a shred of truth to trigger an initial reaction.  The problem is that not all of the facts are presented for the reader to make a decision... the decision is already made for the reader.<br>

This is no different than any game review, movie review, or even opinion column.  Send someone from the &quot;Snooty Herald&quot; to see &quot;Austin Powers&quot; and it's going to get a bad review.  Send someone from &quot;The Man Show&quot; to see &quot;Chocolat&quot; and it will also get a bad review.  Have a fundamentalist Christian review EverQuest and what do you think you are going to get?  From the sound of some of the responses above, It seems you'd get just as slanted of a write up if you reviewed a game about exploring the world of the Bible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usongmistressjenelle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Songmistress Jenelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Song Mistress</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/20/01 2:44:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=57.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'll let you guys judge for yourselves...</span><hr size=1> It goes without saying that when people are speaking of a specific group in general terms, there is going to be a little bit of stereotyping.  A little bit.  It really always happens.  If I said, for instance, &quot;White people can't jump&quot;, that doesn't mean that EVERY SINGLE WHITE PERSON WHO WAS BORN EVER CAN NOT JUMP.  It just means that, in general, people of the caucasian persuasion are not as good at jumping as other people.  Also, when a term is generalized, you're not referring to every single person.  You're referring to the community as a whole.  When I say &quot;Cows are fat&quot;, I don't mean that all the cows in the world are fat.  I mean that most of the cows are fat.  Err, no, all cows ARE fat.<br>
<br>
Yes, even you, Moo-boy!<br>
<br>
I think I stated that the Christian COMMUNITY hates Everquest.  The heads of most Protestant sects and DEFINITELY the Bishops of the Roman Catholic faith list Dungeons and Dragons and things of that nature as one of the &quot;evil bad things&quot;.  Reference the tarot cards and psychic passages in the Bible.  I'm also pretty sure it's somewhere in the CCC, but I can't quote any exact passage.<br>
<br>
And yes, I go to Catholic school.  Yes, my teachers who represent an educated branch of the Catholic Faith, have taught us that all Dungeons and Dragons things are bad.  HOWEVER, after asking a long line of priest's for clarification, I was told that BELIEVING in Dungeons and Dragons ideals is evil.  It's a commonly circulated notion that Dungeons and Dragons are bad.  However, the rumors accuracy is debatable.  Many of my more orthodox Protestant friends and neighbors object to Dungeons and Dragons very much.  <br>
<br>
Jantis, what more did you expect?  The Christian religion is the ONLY religion you can make fun of in the United States.  (Seriously, Jewish and Muslim jokes are BAD.  But everyone hahas when Alanis Morisette plays God, South Park makes fun of heaven, and everytime a Mormon joke is being made).  It happens.  If the people who wrote the article are entitled to their own opinions, we are entitled to ours.<br>

I can see where the attitude against things like tarot and the occult and the like comes from, because that at least is wound up with believing in stuff which has been proclaimed 'evil' and 'wrong'.<br>
<br>
But where's the argument against D&amp;D and, by extension, EQ? Do these people not comprehend the concept of fantasy?? It's pure madness, in fact it's worse because when I sit down to play with my Necromance of an evening, I am NOT suddenly worshipping Bertoxxulous the Plaguebringer. I'm not even pretending to believe in him, a character that is completely ficticious that I am controlling believes in him. <br>

Now, as I said before, I'm pagan by choice, but I do believe it says somewhere in the Bible &quot;Let no man judge another for their actions, for that is God's domain.&quot;, or something to that effect.

I agree, Christians are the only politically correct religion to attack with jokes and comments.  No, I don't expect any different, but that doesn't mean I don't feel the need to clarify.  As I said, many people are actually so narrow-minded as to believe that all Christians follow the established leadership of the sects and branches blindly.  Case in point...<br>

Brain-washing?  Rail-roading?  Trash?  Sounds to me like you have become what you despise.  There is a difference between defending your beliefs and attacking others.  The post above was very clearly not a defense of your beliefs.  Don't let those people that have been close-minded, judgemental, and ignorant just make you into their likeness.  Am I embarrassed to be a Christian?  No, not at all.  I do not let others define me with their poor actions.  Am I embarrassed by the actions of other Christians?  Yes, just as much as I would be by any other member of the human race.  Christians aren't exempt from their own rules, despite what a few of them might think.  It would be nice if I could deguild them, but alas I cannot.<br>

This is a lot more complicated than could be summed up in even a paper.  I tried once, though I think I still only skimmed the surface... but hey, I got an &quot;A&quot; on it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Overall, it coincides with what Jenelle said, in the belief of the ideals presented within the game rules of D&amp;D.  Demon summoning, the use of magic, pagan symbols, etc... none of them rank very highly with the beliefs of most Christians, regardless of denominations.  Except with the Roman Catholic church (and similarly organized denominations) where there is a pretty strict structure of stances on such issues, most of it is left up to the local minister or preacher to deal with.  I'm sure you would get 10 different 'stances' from 10 different churches about what (if anything) is wrong with D&amp;D.  Most will refer to what I stated above, but some will say that it is satan's tool while others will say it's in line with any other book that exposes and encourages such ideals to people.<br>
<br>
And no, some Christians won't read Lord of the Rings or watch Xena because of the included components.  I respect them if they can do that (well, I don't watch Xena either, but that's because I think it's cheesy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), as long as they don't burn my books or turn off my television.  In turn, don't be surprised if they don't let their children watch/ read/play any of those things either.  Of course, this tends to lead to rebellious kids, but they usually learn that too late.<br>
<br>
But that to me is usally the biggest problem.  Interpretation.  Most ministers and preachers I know are intelligent enough not to just shout out how Gary Gygax is the devil and D&amp;D is the next Necronomicon, but most would say in line with what Jenelle was told.  But when it flows down the channel to the church members or what not, they sometimes miss the details of what is wrong and just hear that it IS wrong.  That is where I tend to run into issues within my own family at times.  My father tends to be quite intellectual about his study of faith, but one of my sisters tends to be one of those sheep that grate on my nerves due to her 'blind' following.<br>

<br>
First, I can understand why the conservative wing of the christian community disagrees with this game.  Everquest is a fantasy game, and fantasy games are escapist by their very nature (hense the word 'fantasy').  While escapism is not necessarily bad (heck one could qualify any religion a escapist, depending on one's pov), it does not solve any problems.  Rather, it is a soma for the mind--a drug which has not been illegalized by the government.<br>
<br>
In cases where individuals have very real problems, and they use escapism to pretend (for however long) that their problems do not exist, then escapism is detrimental to their own well being.<br>
<br>
example:  I hate my job.  I play everquest and call in sick.  -- arguable, but it's been done to one degree or another by just about everyone.<br>
<br>
example 2:  I hate my job.  I play everquest and call in sick for a week.  Job goes away.  Problem solved? -- here, it's a definite problem and the game is detrimental.<br>
<br>
Further problems arise with those people who play so often and so long that the difference between fantasy and reality begins to blur.  This is a borderline psychotic condition (inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality being one of the hallmarks of psychosis).  In cases such as this, the individual is not only a danger to themselves, but possibly to others as well.  <br>
<br>
Because of this, religious groups tend to raise concerns regarding games of these types (D&amp;D included).  I think they're right to do so.  However, that doesn't stop me from playing, because I am secure in my handle on reality and I understand the dangers of nonstop exposure to a medium which operates under a different ruleset than RL.<br>

<br>
It's a shame that some people think that we are all mindless conformists who are prone to subliminal messages implanted into a video game.  I'm not well read in the bible area, but isn't the general belief that we have free will?  Some folks read to deep into a fantasy game.  The people that blame games or music for their actions are the ones that can't take responsibility for their actions.  <br>
<br>
I listen to some pretty harsh music, by some people's standards, I have played several Roleplaying games, including VtM, WtA, D&amp;D.  In fact, Whitewolf tells people at the begining of their roleplaying, and more specifically, their LARP books that the game is a fantacy world and that you, as the player should know this and keep fantasy seperate from reality.  If someone can not seperate fantasy from reality, they have no business playing this or any game.<br>
