If you're too low level, sure, you can have this AC 25 armor with +5 bonuses across the board and that gives you a 50% haste -- except, at your level, it's AC 6, has no bonuses, and doesn't give you any haste at all. This lets higher level characters still work on quests they may have missed, while simultaneously providing a viable reason for people not to give out high-end items like candy. <p>Illudin Arbitrator<br>Enchanter and Incorrigible Adventurer<br>Bringing together and calming Norrathians since 3174<br>"Onward, all, to our destinies!

And I've had more friends, and probably more RP, because of interactions - primarily between me and higher levels, but some between me and lower (and getting more with lower as I get higher, not surprising) - regarding TLC issues.<br><br>Yes, there are things that I have missed out on.  But the sheer ease with which I could walk into Upper Guk and in an afternoon, the quantities of useful loot I could garner, suggest to me &quot;why bother to do it when it's a challenge?  Why not level up and do it when they're easy greens?&quot;<br><br>Ditto Runnyeye, Crystal Caverns, and a host of other places that even as a warrior I can now solo. <br><br>I occasionally go to CC to get velium bits, which is easy.  Several times, I've stopped, and invited a nearby local group for whom it was still a challenge to come and kill this &quot;foreman, herbalist, etc&quot; that I'm looking at, so that they can benefit from it.<br><br>And I get to do favors for friends who've had something TLC to them. ...it's *fun* for a lower level to actually feel useful around a high level. <br><br>Also, I get extra excuses to stop and hang out with lower levels, take time to get to know them, do some RPing, chat, etc, and I get RP/IC reasons to hand out some of the gear I pick up that neither I or anyone in my guild is likely to *ever* use, and that they'd love to have.<br><br>And one of the funniest things I've done since the server opened, is give stuff to low level characters  who later became some of the most powerful people on the server.  No, they weren't beggers, it was me running around seeing who would RP a bit.  Actually, old time players know far better than real newbies the value of a small gift, say 3 pp, at level 1.  I can give a genuine newbie an executioner's hood and 50 pp, and they're like &quot;oh, neat, thanks&quot;, but they don't understand.  I can give a long time EQ player 3 pp and a split-paw belt, and they're like &quot;Wow, I can parlay this into level 20 in 4 days&quot; (back before the level 10 patch, and when no one had anything much around here, in the good 'ole early days. . .laugh.  <br><br>Just a few thoughts. . .. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salochin99>salochin99</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 8:55:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> Loved TLC when it came in the warrens as i hate farming (don't want to buy stuff from a farmer that i could have got myself if they hadn't stopped me by perma-camping the mob).<br><br>It is a blunt instrument tho and it would be better if there was a separate TLC tag on items instead of Verant trying to use combinations of existing tags (LORE, MAGIC etc).<br><br>I half agree with the interaction argument but if i was doing a quest and couldn't find anyone to kill the green mob for me i'd be pretty fed up.<br><br>Nowadays I think the single char rule is the biggest factor in anti-farming cos I think most of the demand for twinking items is for alts and so no alts = less demand = less farming.

The character advancement in this game is based entirely upon gear.  Everyone in the same class gets the same spells, the same skills, the same ablities.  The only way in which they differ is their gear.  TLC hinders your ability to get gear after a certain point in your character's development, therefore shutting down a major aspect of the game that Verant created in the first place.<br><br>I agree with the above poster who said that a major deterrent to farming is on char per account.  That not only severly restricts the total amount of characters that need to be equipped on the server (I'd be willing to bet that the average user on a blue server has 3 fully equipped characters, 2 of which rarely if ever get playtime but still need equipment), but it also depresses the demand for items which helps make things like EBay less profitable.<br><br>However, in a game called EverQUEST, I'd really like to see them make quest items exempt from TLC.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    The items that have been farmed the heaviest have historically been the straight gear drops, ie the rare drops from rare spawns.  Of course there's a few exceptions to this like the Ring of the Ancients, but for the most part things like the Molten Cloak, SMR, RMC, Yaks, FBSS, etc have received the heaviest farming.  In short, I think TLC was a good idea, but it was done way too broadly on this server.<br><br>Dungeons should be designed around TLC and existing dungeons should be gone through item by item with TLC in mind, IMO.<br><br>(Just one quick example of this...the final fight quest for the +int/+cha/+mana book in Ak'Anon involves killing 4 evil gnomes and looting 4 distinct pages from them.  Each separate gnome drops a particular page, so you can't just kill one and get all 4 pages eventually.  One of the 4 gnomes is light blue to a level 10.  Another one is yellow to a level 10.  The pages are MAGIC LORE but not no drop.  In order to clear the camp to get to the light blue gnome, you need to clear the rest of the gnomes which are all dark blue to yellow.  Basically it takes a group to do this quest, but if one person in the group is over level 12...TLC kicks in and the quest is absolutly uncompletable.  Get the MAGIC tag off an item like that.  It serves no purpose.)<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=farnoak>Farnoak</A> at: 6/29/02 9:14:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 678<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 9:36:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> I think it was their only solution to the proposed lack of No Drop items that wasn't manhour-intensive when VI was working up this alternate rule set. Going through the entire item database and figuring out which items should be TLC'd and which shouldn't would have been a huge project - and a neverending one, since there would be constant tweaks to adjust for the fact that this thing is now used in a quest since the last patch, or people are now camping and farming this other thing for easy cash.<br><br>I also think there will be a different system in the next game... I do think that FV was a test case. I think they have watched how 1 character, no-drop, TLC and such played out here - both in the court of public opinion and in terms of server economy, frequency of eBaying, etc.<br><br>I view it as a necessary evil. A jarring disconnect in the fabric of the roleplay, an extreme annoyance at times, but far better than a massive swarm of campers.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ellywig</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>/shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 478<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 4:38:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> Love TLC.<br><br>I think they need to tune a lot of items still (ie: Epic components shouldn't get TLC'd, nor should tradeskill components), but taken as a whole I really like it.<br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 685<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 5:16:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> Oh, BTW, Farnoak...<br><br>Quite a few of the newbie gnomes are getting their pages because higher-level folks help (and just don't take the kills).

It's not like those can't be annoying enough to do anyway (/em remember days and days of hunting spider silks in EK) without worrying about TLC. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228979><img src=http://cbwhite.homestead.com/files/RogueSig.jpg border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salochin99>salochin99</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 9:06:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> Farnoak,<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> On the one hand, TLC makes it much harder for the farmers who perma camp zones for selling on EBay<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Good point - I always forget about EBay cos I've understood how ppl would pay real cash for game items.<br><br>revise for/against opinion on TLC to 80/20 from 60/40 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uerazor983.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Erazor983</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 9:46:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2209.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial loot code. friend or foe?</span><hr size=1> Trivial Loot Code is Switzerland!!!<br><br>How so you say?

I have Survived through the beginning days on the server through the alignment, and language difficulties, and through the TLC. I myself have never known what life is like before the TLC so I guess I don't know what i am missing. <br><br>What I have noticed. I can pick up any item I want wether TLC'ed or not. If I cannot find it, I go to the zone and auction, or call up one of my younger friends (I have many because of TLC). Point being I haven't ever missed out on a quest, or an item because of TLC, you see the trade of is having a server without No-Drop on anything of value. TLC seems to keep the farmers, and the outright rude people far away from this server.<br><br>I play EQ on Firona Vie in relative peace and ease, hardly any of my camps taken, surrounded by a bunch of good people, and a very nice population which out numbers dewds 10 to 1.<br><br>I for one can not and will not imagine a server where a lvl 60 can sit in the bottom of the dungeon and farm. I cannot imagine working my way to the boss of a dungeon to find a level 60 shouting &quot;camp taken&quot;<br><br>With all these stout rules, Firona Vie attracts a certain personality, <br>#1 ones who desire roleplay<br>#2 people who are not affraid to work for their loot.<br><br>/Roleplay assumes that you care to socialize.<br><br>With the good natured, fine people I am surrounded with on Firona Vie, I never seem to have troubled relaxing for hours at a time, a server where personal conflict, and KS's are the rarity, not the norm.<br><br>TLC, Alignment,language, one charachter tough? Find another server! Leave us with our rules, we are happy with them. Don't want these rules?
