<br>
&quot;I feel at this time ever so much more angry than I had been the evening before when I finally came about to responding to Aailin's mudslinging comments!  Despite claims that he wished to keep the buisness spoken of private, he put up his words in a public forum for all to see and they were left untouched for three days, giving even more people to come and read.  When I felt I had allowed myself to calm as much as I possibly could, I responded to his accusations, only to awake today and find the entire conversation torn down and destroyed.<br>
<br>
I will NOT allow myself to be attacked in a public room in the way I was and not come to my defense.  I will NOT sit at home and watch one say such filthy things about me and do nothing.  If you will tear down my note where I would have prefered to leave it, I will simply go beyond your authority.  I had figured someone would take that course of action, so I made copies of the notes before hand.<br>
<br>
If you wish to know why this is now out in the open, please ask the two officers involved.  I do not allow somebody to spit in my face and when I attempt to slap him in return, have his friends come out and hold me down. Still, I have strong feelings that I will alienate further people with what I have to say, but feel I must regardless as I will not be treated like dirty garbage.  I suppose the difference would be between those who accually ever cared for myself as an individual, and those who only saw me as an enchanter, just another member, an object to be used toward an end.<br>
<br>
Three days ago, I put up a discussion to say my goodbyes to Resolution in their public room.  I wanted all to know that I had withdrawn my application to their rivals, and had instead decided to retire from adventures forever.  This message was calm and not the one in question.  In my farewell to Resolution in the private rooms however, the one put up when I was only leaving the guild, was quite long and details my feelings and frustrations and emotions for why I was leaving the guild.  The words were often blunt and directly to the point, but they were the truth as told through my feelings, and something I felt everyone in Resolution deserved to know, so there were no questions or feelings of uncertainty left behind.  My words were not evil nor insulting to individuals, all of whom I still care for deeply, but they were the bare truth of my feelings toward the institution of Resolution.<br>
<br>
Before all these words are read, I will again offer my deepest apoligies to all the people who I will always consider my friends, and who may be shocked or disappointed in my choice of action.  I do not do this in an attempt to smear the name of Resolution, and I will remind ALL others who read this that I am obviously angry now at one specific person and his words.  I have grown frustrated to the verge of tears over this matter several times over and cannot allow it to simply go away as it had.  These frustrations are a large portion of why I eventually decided to leave your mortal lands forever, and I do not care to have them tugging and eatting at my heart still in the brief retirement before my final days.<br>
<br>
In my public goodbye, Aailin, who was made an officer of Resolution in my final few days, left this in plain view of ALL passing eyes:<br>

<br>
<br>
You know Ayri I was going to post this on the FV soapbox.<br>
But it isn't anyone's concern really. It was between Resolution and you.<br>
<br>
Well you see Ayrielle this is something that has been eating at me for a while.<br>
<br>
So i'll say it.<br>
<br>
You asked on Rundo's apology post if you fall under Etc well.<br>
<br>
Yes you fall under Etc.<br>
And with good reason.<br>
<br>
You see Zeit, Cad and the rest left. But they left on good terms. They said their good byes and went their way. Some may have disagreed with their leaving and felt betrayed, but they never spoke poorly about their times in Resolution. In fact they all spoke of it with fond memories.<br>
<br>
Zeit, Cad, Pen will always be my friends regardless of guild tags. And as mad as ppl were I will always be welcome them back.<br>
<br>
You, on the otherhand Ayrielle I will never welcome back.<br>
Sad thing was I once counted you as one of the nicest, sweetest ppl on FV. I was glad to sponsor you for Resolution.<br>
<br>
However, you couldn't just leave could you?<br>
No, you thought it best to kick everyone when they were down. You thought it best in your final post to Resolution to flame all our members. To talk about how we failed you. You thought it best in your self righteousness to speak poorly about Resolution and criticize us for any little thing.<br>
<br>
So yes you thought it best to leave Resolution, try to lower morale, insult people and leave a long post speaking of all the things we did wrong.<br>
<br>
Well Ayrielle, I cannot deny that at times you are a wonderful person. Maybe you just had a bad day that day. However, we've all seen a differnt side of you. The Holier then thou I am perfection and you guys didn't live up attitude.<br>
<br>
You came as the nicest quietest of people. Someone always willing to help. You left with one of the biggest ego posts I've ever seen. And hell i'm seen and written a few.<br>
<br>
Quite frankly ayri yeah I would welcome back all of them, you however I'd never welcome you back. You saw fit to kick us when we were down and to flame us when things were bad. You couldn't just leave like the rest did.<br>
<br>
And now you come back with more pretty words. Telling us how we were the greatest family and how no one compares to us. Too late &quot;Angel&quot; you've already shown your other side<br>
<br>
Well Ayrielle, i'm happy to say don't let the door hit you on the ass on the way out.<br>
<br>
Have fun retiring to whereever it is your going. I hope Rallos Zek finds you, clips your wings and adds you to his harem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aailin<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember Ayrielle for every Angel with White wings their exists a succubus with White wings.'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>*a second copy of a note is attached*</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  The following are my words in responce:<br>
<br>
*stomps her feet furiously!* &gt;=\ <br>
<br>
*posts up a lengthy note, torn in a few places by the pen, apparently from writing too hard:*<br>
<br>
&quot;I have given this note much time.  I had at first been furious at what I read, and then decided to take the advice I so often gave others, and allowed myself to calm down before answering any attacks upon my person.  I relaxed for a time, then came back and found myself furious still, so I relaxed longer.<br>
<br>
Now I come back as furious as ever!  Each time I read the words accusing myself of being a horrible person I grow even more furious!  If your goal was to see what I am truly like when angry and volatile, you have chosen the best of paths because my following statements will likely dwarf those written in the farewell that you speak of!  I have retired from adventures due in part to frustrations such as this only to find they do not yet go away!  If anything have become stronger!<br>
<br>
I am accused of being a liar bent on destruction and harm to those I called my friends, and then damned to a terrible fate in closing!  I am told I am egotistical and dismissed like unwanted garbage! <br>
<br>
I am a good person, and I have little room within my soul for anything but kindness, but I can only take and put up with so much!  You have managed to dance upon this imaginary boundary at times before, but now you have done well to step full across!  I am NOT one to be pushed around, bullied, manipulated, nor cornered, and I am THROUGH tolerating such behavior!<br>
<br>
When I left Resolution I did in fact leave a lengthy note behind.  This note was full of things that I knew would make some people feel bad and perhaps guilty, but I left that note for a good reason, and that reason was not to bring about depression and hurt feelings!  <br>
<br>
I left the note because I felt, and still DO feel, that Resolution deserved to know why.  Leaving in silence was not an option for myself because that option would lead nowhere for the betterment of the guild nor its morale, nor myself!  Should I have simply slipped out the door when no one was looking, leaving people do find out when they see my application elsewhere?  Should I leave everyone to start rumors and make crazy assumptions about my motivation, so that I can become a power-mongering, treasure whore?  Maybe a despicable traitor, run off to Fire and Fury to sell my secrets?  Do not tell myself that this would not happen.  It DID happen with the people who had left just before!  Do not tell me they were not spoken poorly of in their absence when you know for undeniable truth that they were! <br>
<br>
I thought it best that everyone hear directly from myself my reasons for the building frustration and my eventual leaving.  Yes, those words were perhaps harsh and blunt, but they were my feelings.  Did you already forget the large note I left up earlier?  The one stating that I would no longer sit by and watch our problems mount upon themselves?  The one that stated I would begin to take the form of a stronger leader of people, and that I would soon come to speak harshly when harsh words were needed?  The one that I left for all to see two full weeks before these incidents?!  Why do you act surprised when I followed through?<br>
<br>
My statements in the farewell were an insight into at least one person's frustrations and reason for leaving the guild.  Since the time they were written they have been supported by the explanations that I have heard of why other people left!  Maybe, instead of claiming I am an evil seductress that spits lies and venom, you could take your head out of the proverbial sand and see the obvious that stands right before you, despite your attempts to push blame upon a scapegoat!<br>
<br>
Perhaps I spoke with assuredness behind my words, not because I was egotistical and oh-so-perfect, but because my points were based upon valid observations that I had made over an extended period of time, and the facts and circumstances surrounding the situations strongly support what I had to say!!  Funny how so many who once claimed myself to be wise and knowledgeable in my words so quickly change their opinion when I speak something that is difficult to hear. <br>
<br>
Why are others to be forgiven and welcomed to open arms should they wish to return and I am not?  Because I had the courage and the sense of responsibility to the guild (even in my farewell to all I must add) to point out the blatantly obvious for all to see, but that most had previously blinded themselves to?  &gt;=\<br>
<br>
Do you have any idea how hard I had worked upon solving these problems long before?  Do you have any idea how many times I had to harp upon detail after detail after detail only to be either ignored or pushed off until a later that does not ever come?   Do you have any idea what it feels like to put forth so much effort into solving something that people want fixed, but no one wishes to help fix?!  Do you have any idea what it is like to have a choice of two options, both of which will make happy half of the people while angering the other half, and still try to find that middle ground for all?!<br>
<br>
The more I write these words with my pen the more furious I become!  I am to have my thoughts, feelings, and words toward the inanimate institution of Resolution and have them turn into a personal hatred and disgust for myself?!  I have never wished anything but the most attainable happiness possible for the individuals for Resolution, and even though some very clearly do not care for myself, I still wish good for all.  But I did not insult anyone!<br>
<br>
Yes, I do feel like Resolution was no longer living up to what I had wanted and expected when I first applied!  Yes, I did point out many of the reasons for such a failure!  You speak as if you would prefer to remain ignorant so that you can dance upon your merry way toward the cliff without realizing it is there!  WHY NOT TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE NOW RECOGNIZED ISSUES AND WORK TOWARD SOLVING THEM TOGETHER?!  Keeping your eyes closed will do NOTHING, and I will repeat forcefully again, NOTHING!!!, to help!  It simply means you will be made to endure the same problems over and over again!  Is this what you want?  Is this what everyone cares to strive for?<br>
<br>
I cannot yet contain the frustration I feel, and it now strikes myself with three times the power it had when I had decided that I felt too much and left!  I cannot get over the thought that an officer (take off your hat all you like, you will represent the guild with every word you utter while serving as an officer) has gone to such lengths as to use petty tactics that you so often accused those who you hate most for using!  Your implications are that I purposely came forth with the intent to harm and endanger Resolution, and that I have been a terrible person from the very start only playing at being nice so that I can seep inside to bring about more powerful destruction!  These words have no basis in fact and can only be supported by your irrational assumptions that have obviously been poorly jumped to in yet another fit of enraged hysterics DESPITE MY TWICE COMING TO YOU IN THE PAST AND ENCOURAGING YOU TO RECONSIDER SUCH ACTIONS!!  What you end up with is an abhorrent use of propaganda aimed negatively in my direction that serves no logical purpose and ends up, in this case ironically, turning you into the malicious one that you accuse me of being!  Perhaps when I awaken next I will find myself accused of selling all those missing items for platinum that I worked hard to locate for people, so I can support my wild addiction to Misty Thicket Picnics, or that I single-handedly engineered and led the mass-exodus from Resolution! <br>
<br>
Why begin a battle that you can hope to gain nothing from?  Why push she whom you are attacking into a place from which she feels she must fight back or risk LOSING something?!  Did you not see the folly in giving myself the option to defend myself in full view of the public or to fall over and endure a verbal thrashing that I do not feel is justified in the least?!  Why, if you wished this to remain private between Resolution and myself do you put up your words in a public forum for all who pass through to see?!  Do you understand nothing of emotions or tactics?  Did you not see where this would lead to?!  Why do you think I had twice before come to you as a friend and tried to help you avoid these situations and how to better conduct yourself in public?!  The second time during which you decided it would be better to continue upon the path and turn THAT attempt at friendship and caring into a fight!<br>
<br>
You have morphed since being awarded the badge of officer.  You remain the same person as before, except what is referred to as the corruption of power has gone to your head, and you are now infinitely more arrogant and stubborn than ever before, despite situations in which OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE slaps you in the face!  The few days in which we served as officers together were very much the final frustrations that pushed myself over the edge of tolerance, since none could have a conversation with you that did not result in your primitive display of pompous chest-pounding and insistence that you know what is best no matter what anyone else says.  As goes with the advice that I left to the leadership stated, that a leader can be wrong but never unsure, and I knew that the future would hold nothing but head-butting and disagreeance, a strong form of unreliability.  If you cannot handle the responsibility that comes with being a leader, I suggest that you turn the title over to someone who can.<br>
<br>
I do not write these words because I want to hurt you or Resolution.  I write them because I am sick of dealing with this time and again and even in retirement yet.  If you ever wished to know what an enraged Ayrielle would be like, here is your desire. <br>
<br>
&gt;=\<br>
<br>
But do not fear, even though I am angry with you, I will continue to forgive yourself for the wrongs I feel you have done to me because, despite your claims to the contrary and what emotions that did explode here, I believe myself to be a very kind person at heart.'<br>

Some people seem to take it as a personal insult and will conspire to hurt you in retaliation.  Adding the fact that you posted criticism about the guild regardless of whether its true or not is just going to inflame the situation.<br>
<br>
When I left DS, I posted a simple goodbye and 2 weeks later apped to FnF.  During that two weeks, people I'd considered friends had sent messages about me to FnF telling them that i'd stolen from DS,  just trying to prevent me from being a successful applicant.  <br>

Your best bet is just to let this thread die otherwise it'll just turn into a huge stupid flame and make you feel worse then you do.<br>

This note was full of things that I knew would make some people feel bad and perhaps guilty, but I left that note for a good reason, and that reason was not to bring about depression and hurt feelings! <br>
<br>
I left the note because I felt, and still DO feel, that Resolution deserved to know why. Leaving in silence was not an option for myself because that option would lead nowhere for the betterment of the guild nor its morale, nor myself!<br>

Bringing up problems you see while you are a member and sticking around to help fix things is helping. Blasting everything you see wrong with a guild on your way out the door is not helping them. It's just a way to try and feel superior, put yourself in a better light (I'm not leaving for better loot, it's all these problems that drove me away), and to try and remove any guilt you feel for telling your &quot;friends&quot; that you are leaving them. That, or you are just an attention whore and wanted to drag it out. <br>
<br>
All of this is about you, to you, and based on your own post. Don't expect an apology. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nueelien>nueelien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thermonuclear Warlord</span><br>  Posts: 562<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/19/03 7:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *stomps her feet FURIOUSLY, creating a large scene!*</span><hr size=1> Pretty sleazy aailin <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
I wrote to you on our Forums, where only those who cared about what happened to Resolution would be able to see it.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I responded to your comments, and posted and found that deleted as well.  You see Ayrielle if you had taken the time to look you would see I&quot;m not adminstrator and don't have access to move posts from our General Discussion forums.<br>
<br>
Also well posting here doesn't bother me I've never been one to shy away from an arguement.<br>
<br>
As Usual ayrielle you made the same mistake you ALWAYS made as an &quot;officer&quot; of Resolution.<br>
<br>
You assumed you knew what was happening and jumped to conclusions when in fact you always knew little if anything about what truly was happening.<br>
<br>
So let me post my reply to you here again.<br>
This was suppose to stay just on our forums where only Those who actually looked from Resolution Would care, but you chose to bring this to all of FV so now I'll reply.<br>
With as close to the same words as I wrote to you on our board.<br>
<br>
You say Do I know how it feels like to work hard for so long to try to fix things and make it better?<br>
<br>
Actually Yes I do, we're still here in Reso fixing the problem and making things better.<br>
You speak like you poured your heart into this.  You were guilded for 4 months.  How &quot;HARD&quot; did you actually work at it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> am accused of being a liar bent on destruction and harm to those I called my friends, and then damned to a terrible fate in closing!

<br>
Now I never called you a liar, and I never said you joined Resolution bent on destroying it. Once again this is your letting your Roleplaying get in the way of the Game.<br>
<br>
I said the same thing I state now, You came to Resolution stayed 4 montsh or so we're made an officer and then when times got tough instead of sticking it out, or just leaving and saying you had your reasons and we're unhappy like the rest did, you took your time to post a lengty note about how WE had failed you,  About how we weren't &quot;elite enough soldiers&quot;.<br>
About all these things we did wrong.  And then off your ran.<br>
Flame the guild in private and then run off.<br>
We never showed you anything but the utmost respect.<br>
We never let your Roleplaying interfere with us.<br>
You decided not to want to Charm in HOH to help the guild and 95% of us supported you.  But in the end you couldn't resist you had to throw those last few jabs in and insult us all when morale was already at a low.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Leaving in silence was not an option for you because your ego would not allow it to be.  And your post flaming us all for our mistakes was better for morale then just leaving quietly?<br>
You could have very simply said you we'rent happy, and people may have questioned it however like the rest that left we'd have gotten past it.  No, instead you yell and chastise us all for mistakes we made in the past.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, I do feel like Resolution was no longer living up to what I had wanted and expected when I first applied!

<br>
Thats exactly the point.  If you had posted our mistakes and failures and stayed to try to rectify them or offered solutions NO ONE would have reacted like they did when you left.<br>
No, you just hurled accusations, spoke with that Same Holier then THou attitude and ran off.  You have NO PLACe to speak on working together to solve things.  You see a problem and instead of confronting it you ran like a coward, and then get upset when people call you out for it.<br>
IF your not going to help remedy the problem I suggest in the future you STFU and leave with dignity.<br>

<br>
See Ayrielle once again you twist things, because you accuse people of saying things they never said.  I would never have Flamed you for leaving, I never said a thing about those others that left.  But then again they left.  They said their goodbye and went off.  There is no propaganda here only truth. Only fact as to what you did.  No one is accusing you of anything.  The day you turned over your portion of the guild bank to Myself I told everyone as such and had it marked exactly what you gave so as to make sure you'd never be accused of such.  Once again you are making the mistake of thinking you were somehow bigger and better then the rest of us and this is all about Ruining your reputation.  My dear Ayrielle this has NOTHING at all to do with your reputation.<br>
This has EVERYTHING to do with the fact that (and I'll say it again) when you left in your good bye post YOU YELLED, CHASTISED, CRITISZIDED, and FLAMED the ENTIRE guild for not living up to your Expectations.  And then you deguilded and ran off like a COWARD.  My post had nothing to do with anything else.  You flamed us, and even when Many of us could have done the same to you we refrained.<br>
<br>
You put yourself in front of the guild WAY too many times.<br>
With your idiotic Guild Motd's that you would write in latin.<br>
Where people would log on saying WTF are we raiding today.  Why would you write a guild motd in Latin?   This isn't ancient fucking Greece.  Its a game. But you put yourself ahead of others having fun playint this game.  That i'm not gonna stand for.  You left motd's in latin as part of your roleplaying, even tho roleplaying of that part effected other people. Half of the time we didn't even know if there was a channel.  Other times another officer would post a guild motd with a channel you'd log on and change it into some long winded latin saying and just confuse the hell out of eveyrone.<br>
<br>
I will never flame you for roleplaying.  However when you join a Raiding guild and your roleplaying starts adversely effecting others then a line must be drawn.  Your free to RP don't try to Force others to do so if they have no desire to.<br>
<br>
See Ayrielle I'll tell you what your problem is.  You are having a problem distinguishing reality from in game.<br>
You RP that you are an ANgel and a friend of gods and as such many times you spoke to the rest of us as if that we're true. As if you we're a goddess and us just peons to be told what to do and what we were doing wrong.  You spoke to fellow officers and Long term members like this.  I&quot;M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS SAID THIS IN THE PAST&gt;<br>
<br>
You let your roleplaying, which I had always admired get the best of you.  YOu actually Thought you were a goddess or an angel and that allowed you to speak to others like they were shit.<br>
<br>
Well let me break this down for you.  You are no goddess or no angel.  YOu are just another 65 Enchanter who pays her monthly Fee to play this game like the rest of us.  You forgot that along the way.  You let your story line get the better of you.  You started to believe your storyline and used it as an excuse to speak down to others.<br>
<br>
As for my morphing I said when being made officer that I don't know if I'll be any good but I'd give it my best.<br>
And my chest pounding? Why because I stated a belief which you did not agree with.  Like that day in EW during the 10th ring war when you proceeded to tell me my beliefs were wrong?  That my opinion was wrong because you didn't agree with it?  You are a spoiled child.  When others did not agree with you, they we're wrong.  You in your ridiculous belief that you were actually some sort of heavenly all knowing being decided that if others didn't agree with you they we're wrong and that gave you permission to speak down to them.<br>
<br>
You don't twist words.  You just have a perverted way of seeing things people say and immediately think it all revolves around you, and put it into a light that you think is what they meant when they may have meant something totally different.<br>
<br>
You tried to do the thinking for people and not let the m think for themselves.  The Player of Ayrielle should have known better then to Kick people when they we're down aand then run off. <br>
<br>
You speak of my terrible Insult.  Further proof that you have too much blurred the line between Roleplaying and Reality.<br>
You forgot somewhere along your path that Real people play this game, you assumed all think like you and that insulting people via Roleplay and making them feel bad was ok.<br>
<br>
You ask why I brought this public, even tho I left my reply confied to the Resolution boards where only those who actually looked would know?<br>
<br>
Because of your utter god damn Hypocrasy.<br>
You left spewing venom about how we failed you, about how we did things wrong about how we failed.<br>
And then you went an applies to FNF and we forgot about it.<br>
But when things didn't work out there you came back to us Speaking of how you &quot;thought&quot; things over and all of a sudden realized Resolution was the best guild ever.  How no one could come close to us.  How much you missed us etc.<br>
<br>
So we went from the worst guild on EQ with a myriad of problems to the best family in EQ in a matter of 5 days.<br>
I find it terribly ironic that once things didn't work out with you in FNF for whatever reason you suddenly came to the stark conclusion that Reso is the best.  Spare me the hyprocritical drivel.  I don't want to hear it.<br>
THe bottom line is you left because you saw the grass greener on the other side and when that didn't work out, you came back to try to rebuild all the bridges you burnt down when leaving.  The answer is obvious as to why you would do so.<br>
<br>
You need help ayrielle.  I mean Real life help.  You should see someone.  You are letting your storyline begin to control you, the player that is Ayrielle.  The lady who sits behind a desk with a computer in front of you.  And you use roleplaying as an excuse to tell others what to think, how they should act.  You spoke too us all too many times like you were truly a goddess and us just your worshiperrs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ayrielle what you did was WRONG and uncalled for.<br>
You didn't leave. That wasn't good enough for you.<br>
Resolution was suffering at that time, and you felt it best to<br>
FLAME an entire guild for what you percieved as their wrong doings. <br>
<br>
You were an officer.  Yet you decided it best to point out errors we made and chastise us all for things that went wrong, and then instead of trying to solve the problem you ran off.  You pointed out mistakes and then deguilded and ran off like a coward.<br>
You decided to kick us all when we were down.<br>
It was that same condscending tone you have always used with members.<br>
You spoke like we were children and you our mother.<br>
Telling us what we &quot;should&quot; think and how we &quot;should&quot; act.<br>
<br>
And if we disagreed with you the next 10 minutes we're spent in tells saying how much you disapproved of our beliefs because they didn't agree with yours.<br>
<br>
It was that god damn condscending attitude that was one of the problems.  I'm sorry but when one of my friends (who was one of those who left) tells me your attitude of speaking down to people was one of the factors he couldn't take it anymore yeah your damn right i get upset.<br>
<br>
Even more so when you then Flame everyone, in a private post to our guild and then run off.  YOu claim you did it to state the obvious.  Well Ayri there is a place and a time for everything.  Kicking people when they are down and then running off is not the way to endear yourself to others.<br>
That post had the same Know it all attitude most of the conversations had with you.<br>
<br>
If you had just left saying you we're unhappy people may have been upset but they would have gotten past it.  But that wasn't good enough for you.  You spoke of all these problems and then like a coward ran off.  If you had spoken of these problems and then stayed to try to fix them no one would have said anything.  It was your arrogant tone of speaking to us and then running off that angered so many.<br>
<br>
I was just the one to take how many people felt and speak my feelings.  Perhaps now others will.  Doesn't matter to me.<br>
<br>
You chose to bring this to the soapbox for all to see.<br>
I left it in a forum where only those who followed Resolution and cared enough to look would read it.  I left it in a place where you could reply. If you had access to the members only section i'd have written my post there, but you didn't and I wanted you to READ what I wrote.<br>
<br>
Remember it was your choice to bring this here to soapbox so FV as a whole could see.  Thats fine with me.  As I said i've never been one to shy away from controversy.   Hell I live for it i'm an Attorney.  So now you concerned many people who contrary to what many of us may think really don't give a fuck about Resolution/FNF or any other Uberguild 001 and are just out to enjoy their EQ lives.  But your ego wouldn't allow that.  <br>
<br>
Thats great, I need to pad my post count here anyway.<br>
<br>
Go get some help ayrielle, learn to distinguish between when RP comments are ok and when even tho you use the guise of RP you are insulting the real people who play this game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aailin <br>
<br>
ps.  I find it even more amusing that my RP insult to you hit you so hard like a slap in the face.  Just firther proof that somewhere along the way you blurred the line too much and forgot that Real people play this tgame.<br>
