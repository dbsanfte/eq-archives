her favorite dress tied with a bow.<br>
Today was Daddy's Day at school,<br>
and she couldn't wait to go.<br>
<br>
But her mommy tried to tell her,<br>
that she probably should stay home.<br>
Why the kids might not understand,<br>
if she went to school alone.<br>
<br>
But she was not afraid;<br>
she knew just what to say.<br>
What to tell her classmates<br>
of why he wasn't there today.<br>
<br>
But still her mother worried,<br>
for her to face this day alone.<br>
And that was why once again,<br>
she tried to keep her daughter home.<br>
<br>
But the little girl went to school,<br>
eager to tell them all.<br>
About a dad she never sees,<br>
a dad who never calls.<br>
<br>
There were daddies along the wall in back,<br>
for everyone to meet.<br>
Children squirming impatiently,<br>
anxious in their seats.<br>
<br>
One by one the teacher called,<br>
a student from the class.<br>
To introduce their daddy,<br>
as seconds slowly passed.<br>
<br>
At last the teacher called her name,<br>
every child turned to stare.<br>
Each of them was searching,<br>
for a man who wasn't there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's her daddy at?&quot;<br>
she heard a boy call out.<br>
&quot;She probably doesn't have one,&quot;<br>
another student dared to shout.<br>
<br>
And from somewhere near the back,<br>
she heard a daddy say,<br>
&quot;Looks like another deadbeat dad,<br>
too busy to waste his day.&quot;<br>
<br>
The words did not offend her,<br>
as she smiled up at her Mom.<br>
And looked back at her teacher,<br>
who told her to go on.<br>
<br>
And with hands behind her back,<br>
slowly she began to speak.<br>
And out from the mouth of a child,<br>
came words incredibly unique.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Daddy couldn't be here,<br>
because he lives so far away.<br>
But I know he wishes he could be,<br>
since this is such a special day.<br>
<br>
And though you cannot meet him,<br>
I wanted you to know.<br>
All about my daddy,<br>
and how much he loves me so.<br>
<br>
He loved to tell me stories,<br>
he taught me to ride my bike.<br>
He surprised me with pink roses,<br>
and taught me to fly a kite.<br>
<br>
We used to share fudge sundaes,<br>
and ice cream in a cone.<br>
And though you cannot see him,<br>
I'm not standing here alone.<br>
<br>
'Cause my daddy's always with me,<br>
even though we are apart<br>
I know because he told me,<br>
he'll forever be in my heart&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, her little hand reached up,<br>
and lay across her chest.<br>
Feeling her own heartbeat,<br>
beneath her favorite dress.<br>
<br>
And from somewhere in the crowd of dads,<br>
her mother stood in tears.<br>
Proudly watching her daughter,<br>
who was wise beyond her years.<br>
<br>
For she stood up for the love<br>
of a man not in her life.<br>
Doing what was best for her,<br>
doing what was right.<br>
<br>
And when she dropped her hand back down,<br>
staring straight into the crowd.<br>
She finished with a voice so soft,<br>
but its message clear and loud.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love my daddy very much,<br>
he's my shining star.<br>
And if he could, he'd be here,<br>
but heaven's just too far.<br>
<br>
You see he was a fireman<br>
and died just this past year<br>
When airplanes hit the towers<br>
and taught Americans to fear.<br>
<br>
But sometimes when I close my eyes,<br>
it's like he never went away.&quot;<br>
And then she closed her eyes,<br>
and saw him there that day.<br>
<br>
And to her mother's amazement,<br>
she witnessed with surprise.<br>
A room full of daddies and children,<br>
all starting to close their eyes.<br>
<br>
Who knows what they saw before them,<br>
who knows what they felt inside.<br>
Perhaps for merely a second,<br>
they saw him at her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you're with me Daddy,&quot;<br>
to the silence she called out.<br>
And what happened next made believers,<br>
of those once filled with doubt.<br>
<br>
Not one in that room could explain it,<br>
for each of their eyes had been closed.<br>
But there on the desk beside her,<br>
was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.<br>
<br>
And a child was blessed, if only for a moment,<br>
by the love of her shining bright star.<br>
And given the gift of believing,<br>
that heaven is never too far<br>

All the children who are homeless, or poor, who can't get anything to eat, who are surrounded by drugs, poverty, disease in not only 3rd world countries, but in western cultures.<br>
<br>
I cry over all the genocide that happens all over the world, the fighting among tribes in africa, political manuvering that causes pain and destruction to families.<br>
<br>
I cry for those who are oppressed, kidnapped, the unnamed who are killed for no purpose because they have no family.<br>
<br>
I cry for those who are old and forgotten, whose kids throw them in nursing homes to wilt and die, when they used to be someone who was cared about<br>
<br>
I cry for people who abuse their children, their spouses their friends.<br>
<br>
I cry for people who are sad and lost in a world full of uncaring people, those who die by their own hand because no one could help them.<br>
<br>
I cry for the fact that we all make ourselves not think about all that happens everyday, and yet something like 9/11 comes along and people wake up and realize that we need to be more caring and more loving towards each other.<br>
<br>
It is a very nice poem tho.  I was so upset when 9/11 happened.  It felt unbelievable, even up here in canada.  I called my mother and sister just to tell them I loved them. <p><br><br>
