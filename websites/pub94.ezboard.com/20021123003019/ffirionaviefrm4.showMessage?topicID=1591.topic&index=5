<br>
Tzaroth, I think that the mod system this board has set up is one of the best systems for a server board that I've dealt with yet.<br>
<br>
There are a ton of mods, and we're not all some cliqueish group. Meaning, we're not some little elitist group of buds.<br>
<br>
People I like on the board, Syll may not. Someone Syll thinks is the shit, Kais may want to take an uzi to.  Borm may wanna nuke us all from orbit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You see my point. At the very least, you get no playing favorites. Case in point, my modding Zsuzs, who I consider an in game friend.  <br>
<br>
And the mod team is set up so that...there have been a couple instances where I've pointed out a potential nasty thread and asked the other mods to watch it cuz there's no way I can be partial about it. <br>
<br>
And we've all done that.<br>
<br>
About Fuvi. That was an exception, rather than the norm Tza. If you remember, the board leadership changed hands about that time. And with a new admin, came a couple changes.<br>
<br>
Apep's much more lenient with the Soapbox than Jaxy was. (And that's not a disparaging comment. Jaxy did an outstanding job during her time running the board)<br>
<br>
Which gives us mods a little more leeway in what's acceptable.<br>
<br>
I think the biggest reason people get vocal when  a mod decision is made, for good or ill, is because in this forum, most of the time, the threads are policed by me and Syll, who are also both very vocal in here.<br>
<br>
<br>
I dunno. I get rambly. <br>
<br>
Tzaroth, please share with us, another way to moderate the boards. I, personally, think the system in place is a good one, and I thought that before I was mod, and even when there were mods who I thought were useless crap...again, another reason I don't take it to heart when people go off about my modding something.  It's part of the job, ya know?<br>

<br>
Sarhea: why don't you just further define what a personal attack means? Then you can place it in the rules thread and everyone will be able to read it, and then there's just no excuse for breaking it. I have no problem with the other rules, it's just this one that's kinda iffy. Moderators wouldn't have to think about what to do with a particular post, they could just reference it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1694<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/20/02 3:54:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1591.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enforcement of the rules</span><hr size=1> Speakin for myself, simplest description perhaps is that personal attacks = insults about the player themself -vs- their behaviour in-game.<br>
<br>
If I call someone a thief and a liar who ripped me off in the bazaar, it might be harsh, but it's not a personal attack.<br>
<br>
If I call someone a f***ing asshole jerkwad buttmuncher who probably can't get a date if he tried, that's a personal attack.<br>
<br>
Personal attacks tend to get moderated differently based on the severity of the comments, and the circumstances surrounding the comments (were the comments provoked or just out of the blue, etc).  <br>
<br>
If Rollen said that Coinfist had a stupid looking helmet, and coinfist said that he met Rollen at fanfaire and he had B.O., that might be a personal attack but it's probably not anything severe enough that we'd step in unless Rollen e-mailed us about it or something.<br>

See? I think that's wrong. It should be enforced the same regardless of whether or not the moderator thinks it's too harsh. Like you could argue that police shouldn't spend their time picking up truant kids while some guy is beating up his wife on the other side of town, since one obviously needs to command more attention, but it's still crime.<br>
<br>

Anything above the limit is technically &quot;illegal&quot;, but police don't generally pull people over for going a few mph faster than the posted limit...<br>
<br>
   It's difficult to determine intent at those speeds.  Were they trying to speed?  Is there just a downhill slope in the road?  Were they just listening to some fast paced music and not paying attention?  Is everyone else on the road going a little over the limit also?<br>
<br>
   Policing the boards so strictly that any comment that could be possibly construed as maybe being some kind of personal attack if someone read it one way or another takes far more work than anyone is ever going to put into on a message board.   You'll never know for sure what the intent was when you're policing those little ones, and every time a decision is made it'll get contested by one side or the other.  <br>

Ahh, but we do, at least, take into consideration, the people being attacked....although, I am much more likely to at least think to myself &quot;Suck it up, it's just a board&quot;, I'll at least re read the thread and see what's up, and occasionally, even tell people to pipe down lol<br>
<br>
<br>
And Tza, you still haven't given me an example of a better way to run things.<br>
<br>
Making the rules more strict, in the rant board, ffs, would make things worse, if you asked me.<br>
<br>
For several reasons, not the least of which is that all of us mods, contrary to popular belief, do have things to do other than cruise the boards(although some of our bosses may argue that lol)<br>
<br>
Also, we start cracking down on any and all things said that are less than &quot;Tzaroth, you rule!&quot;, then it's no longer a rant board, but a very tired parody of one.<br>
<br>
This board is so so so much tamer than some server boards. I mean, Tribunal.org's board would make several posters here die of spontaneous brain anuerisms, I'm sure. <p><center><b><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner">Sarhea Yigsawla</a></b><br><i>Another taste of the evil I breathe,<br>

<br>
Okay, but, in my opinion, you need to be really strict or you need to go all the way and allow all flames. I think it's stupid to leave posters wondering if a moderator is going to use their stick. Basically, with the way the rules are set up now, it's &quot;if a mod thinks you said something over the line it's breaking the rules.&quot; Who is going to know what the mods are going to make of something, provided it's not glaringly obvious?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also, we start cracking down on any and all things said that are less than &quot;Tzaroth, you rule!&quot;, then it's no longer a rant board, but a very tired parody of one.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I didn't say that. I'm not even talking about me. I want there to be rules that are set in stone. If &quot;FVposter001&quot; says &quot;you shit-eating son of a bitch&quot; and gets a warning, I want &quot;FVposter002&quot; who says the same thing to get a warning too, even if they're entirely different threads. Is that really too much to expect? Equal treatment? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slave to Dvara<br>Tits of Steel Admin</span><br>  Posts: 1934<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/20/02 7:58:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1591.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anything and everything ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Who is going to know what the mods are going to make of something, provided it's not glaringly obvious?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'd like to think that we act on the things that are glaringly obvious.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is that really too much to expect? Equal treatment? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I only used your name as an example, Tza, since I was speaking directly to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
And No, equal treatment isn't too much to expect, and I think we do our damnedest, given what we've got to work with.<br>
<br>
Yes, we mods dance a fine line, we know this. And every few months it pisses someone off. go back through the posts, you'll see this is true.<br>
<br>
I will not be changing my mod style, although, as always, I welcome...opinions, and Tzaroth, I understand that you honestly want to know these things, which is why I'm trying my best to answer you*Smile*<br>
<br>
We don't, as a mod team, set out to single anyone out, nor do we play favorites. <br>
<br>
Obviously, we all have posters that we'd rather just not post ever again*smile* But in cases like that, we almost always will ask the other mods...&quot;Is this post outta line or is it just me?&quot; <br>
<br>
We do everything in our power to make sure no one's getting made a scapegoat, even when, sometimes, I think they've asked for it.<br>
<br>
Maybe it would be better, if we were paid by VI or ezboard to spend 8 hours a day reading the boards, and keeping up with everything.<br>
<br>
I'm sure all of us have made mod decisions that, if we were to go back, we wouldn't make a second time.  We're people, and we all try to be impartial, but sometimes our humanity gets the best of us.<br>
<br>
You're asking for a perfect system when it's an impossibility given the environment.<br>
<br>
I'm just explaining to you that we're doing the best we can, really.<br>
<br>
To make the rules any stricter, would take away from the purpose of this forum. ALthough, maybe the way that particular rule needs to be reworded to take into account the fact that there are always extenuating circumstances. <p><center><b><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner">Sarhea Yigsawla</a></b><br><i>Another taste of the evil I breathe,<br>

I was actually commenting on the old post where I didn't think your attitude to the rest of the server was very nice and people jumped on your more than I anticipated. I was not saying you were starting a brushfire here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
