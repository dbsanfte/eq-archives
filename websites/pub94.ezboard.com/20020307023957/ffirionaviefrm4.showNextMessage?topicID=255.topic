I used to play AD&amp;D in a group run by my partner, and our first group of players were really quite good roleplayers.  The second group of roleplayers learned how to &quot;roleplay&quot; through Magic: The Gathering, and if it didn't involve hack-and-slash, they weren't interested.<br><br>I think roleplaying may have hit a zenith with 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, which, if run right, tended to mitigate against &quot;Monty Haul&quot; campaigns and &quot;powergaming&quot;.  TSR refocused itself on more roleplaying aspects of the game, and developed campaign material that was more about roleplaying than game mechanics.<br><br>However, the market wasn't going in that direction.  The demographic who had been buying TSR products were now snarfing up Magic cards like there was no tomorrow instead of TSR products and TSR went under, only to get bought by Wizards of the Coast.  And WotC capitulated to the lowest common denominator in its release of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition.  Want to be a halfling wizard-paladin?  Sure!  Want that class with no behavior restrictions?  Sure!  Every thing I'd heard people whine about in my ten years playing in my partner's AD&amp;D campaign, every little restriction players didn't like, WotC removed in 3rd Edition.<br><br>When I heard about and got EverQuest, I thought maybe some of those problems wouldn't exist.  Many of the 'rules' are hardcoded: no halfling wizard-paladins, for example.  I found, within two days, I was wrong.  It was as if every bad roleplayer I'd ever run across in real life had cloned him- (or more rarely, her-)self a hundred times.  So I moved to Sullon Zek, before Firiona Vie opened up, figuring roleplay might be better: Evil was, by necessity, opposed to Good.  But SZ has its own unique problems, which I could do an entire thread on.  Still, I was right in my basic premise.  When Firiona Vie opened, I moved over and haven't gone back.  But there are problems.  I get asked for sows on a daily basis, for example.<br><br>Maybe roleplaying is dead.  Maybe it's dying.  I hope it can be recovered from the people whose idea of roleplaying is slapping down their Force of Nature to beat up your Mahamoti Djinn.<br><br>Lasgalen, recovering Magic: The Gathering addict <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A> at: 1/16/02 5:03:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 5:08:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roleplaying's in dire straits</span><hr size=1> Some people aren't going to like me saying this, perhaps, but EQ is not now and never has been or will be the best platform for real role-playing.

I look back on that period of my life like a ex-heroin addict might reflect upon the liquid dream years of their lives.  EQ is worse than Magic tho...you don't need to leave the house to play.<br><br>I agree with you Valquiss...EQ is basically Quake or Doom with longer fights, more power-ups and a thread of continuity.  <br><br>Despite disagreeing with you on another topic Robin Goodfellow, I totally agree with you on the decline of RPG's.  I played AD&amp;D, GURPS, Shadowrun and a lot of other pen and paper games for years - with many folks who play EQ with me now as a matter of fact.  And I tend to believe that the new generations since I became involved in RPG's have too many other distractions to get involved with that are MUCH easier to follow.<br><br>Pen and paper games forced you to *gasp* read a set of rulebooks and *shudder* write out your character/dungeon/campaign ideas on paper and *faint* exercise your imagination!?!?!?  Now, everything is prepackaged and microwaveable.<br><br>I have a good analogy:  I went to buy a younger cousin a Christmas present and thought I'd get him a Lego &quot;set&quot;...you know, a big package of various pieces of Lego with which he could exercise his creativity.  I went to Wal-Mart (shudder) and what did I find?  Well, it wasn't a generic Lego set.  Rather, Lego is all &quot;themed&quot; now.  Basically, each pack of Lego only builds one thing, and even more deplorable, each package has ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS.

EQ, no matter what server, but especially FV, is hundreds of times more dynamic than the typical D&amp;D campaign. If I never had to look up another hit point or damage thingy from a chart I'd be happy. The personalities you meet in EQ, not to mention the lore, and the energy that goes with the game (message boards, for example<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), add to it even more.<br><br>I can understand pining for the old days.

To be honest, half of them turned into pick-up sessions (and I wasn't interested).  There was one that was good, but when I stopped dating one of them I stopped being invited.  (I am SO glad there are more women gaming now!)<br><br>So I've joined a group again recently.  I think they all just RP themselves, and half of them I don't even like, so I stopped going.  I haven't seen things change much over time, except I'm no longer hit on via some guy's character as a general rule.  RP is still what I make of it whenever there's an opportunity to take.

Lightbulbs aren't included though, so I had to wait a day after I got home to play with it.  I made the space shuttle, and I still have it in the main room.  I turn it on when I'm watching TV.  It makes me smile.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>---<BR>Kimaya Silverbark<BR><BR>"I bark at that!"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Woodfella</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 11:30:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roleplaying's in dire straits</span><hr size=1> 1) Dire Straits: &quot;I want my RPG...&quot;   ;=] <br>Not their best work, but I had to think quickly...<br><br>2) EQ is as role playing as you want it to be, IMHO. I am somewhat new to this as EQ is my first RP game, but I have been in a Blood Bowl League for several years. For those of you not familiar, it is a Games Workshop/Warhammer tabletop creation. Think what a rugby/football match would be if played between Orcs and Wood Elves, or Halflings and the Undead, etc. Players can be killed, accumulate experience points, etc. I was never exposed to AD&amp;D as a youth, but the friends I play BB with had/have an exhaustive campaign on the old Greyhawk world. This game can be played by writing names on a roster and playing, but we have taken it several steps deeper, including writeups on the lives of our players, their personalities and background, etc. It is set in the old D&amp;D Greyhawk world. We started this league in 1996, and when these guys get killed (it does happen in-game) there are times we have to halt the game for a a few minutes to take it in. My point here is that my friends and I don't just heap our players with the best skills as they gain experience, we try to think about what would make sense for the character as well. A hard bitten human lineman, a former combat infantry sargent with a nasty disposition and a mother hen mentality toward his players would not acquire a side-step agility skill for example. So it is possible to RP in any environment. I role play an enthusiastic employee here at work, for another example.<br><br>3) Lite Brite, good call, didn't know they still made them!  <p>Palantiri, Ranger of Norrath<BR>Sacred Jesters Of Quellious, Woodfellas<BR>Cosmos Mariner, Destination Unknown<BR>www.angelfire.com/games2/NNB/ <BR><BR>Dohneagle of Firiona Vie<BR><BR>Why is it that every MOB you are hunting is never found unless you are on a corpse run, when they are at every turn?<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rexfelix>Rexfelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 12:27:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=242.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roleplaying's in dire straits</span><hr size=1> Heheh Palantri, the Dire Straits joke made me snortle my coffee as I was swallowing...and your roleplaying an enthusiastic employee thing lodged a piece of muffin in my nasal cavity:  &quot;Hail a_Wal_Mart_Shopper_8907323324098, have you seen the new Ronco Spray Hair I just got in?&quot;<br><br>I'm hoping that the next generation of MMORPG's will actively cultivate an roleplaying community.

I used to own a hobby store and experienced the ups and downs of the comic and game industry first hand.<br><br>One thing I would like to add to your post is hte fact that alot of comic stores sold RPG's as well. In my case it accounted for roughly 40 percent of my business, depending on the time of year. When marvel comics tried to change the distrribution system for their product it impacted the comic stores in such a negative way that I blame Marvel Comics for the crisis the comic industry went through entirely. The end result of these changes that Marvel did was 80 percent of the comic book retailers were no longer in business after 5 years. Thats Eighty percent of the comic book stores that sold RPG's gone too. Marvel almost slit its own throat by doing this. If you think about it if 80 percent of the retailers are gone who is Marvel going to sell to?<br><br>This loss of sales combined with some bad investments left Marvel almost bankrupt. Marvel survived but the repercussions of their actions rippled through the card game industry, RPG industry and cost the jobs of tons of folks from retailers, distributors and producers alike.<br><br>Its been a long time now. I'm not bitter about it. Infact if anything it taught me a valuable lesson about product diversification. Lets hope the RPG producers out there have learned similar lessons and are taking steps to ensure their continued exsistence and profitabilty.<br><br>I think I am gonna run out and buy a copy of GURPS.
