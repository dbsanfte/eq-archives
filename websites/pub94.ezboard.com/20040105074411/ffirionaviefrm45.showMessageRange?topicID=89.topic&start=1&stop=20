<br>
Right now I'm putting a fair amount of time into alternate advancement.  By the time i hit level 55, I hope to have about 18 AA points total, with 12 to spend.  <br>
<br>
Looking at the abilities, I think this is what I would like to spend them on, eventually:<br>
<br>
1. Run Speed 3 - This I already have.  I think it's great, it's very nice to not have to worry about being outrun when I'm injured (for the most part).  <br>
<br>
2. Innate Natural Wisdom 5 - Why? because with 10 extra wisdom, I can wear a mask, earring or ring that is exclusively for resists, such as a velium diamond wedding ring.<br>
<br>
3. Mental Clarity III.  This is the first archetype I plan on practicing. The extra mana regeneration will be wonderful.<br>
<br>
4. Healing Gift III. It's a prerequisite to many cleric archetypes.  I'm not sure when I'll practice this one, 5 and 6 below are also very attractive.<br>
<br>
5. Spell Casting Mastery. Anything to reduce fizzles. Fizzling a complete heal may mean the difference between a tank living and dying.<br>
<br>
6. Spell Casting Reinforcement. Getting a little more out of buffs is very important.<br>
<br>
I don't want to look any further ahead, because it will be a while before I get into the cleric archetypes.<br>
<br>
I know this is pretty ambitious but I think it's something to look forward to.  <br>
<br>
Anyone have any comments on other skills they would like to study? Perhaps something that I've missed?  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

I would suggest strongly against this.  Do you have a magelo link?  If your wisdom is under 200, then this is worth it.  If it isn't, you will get more mana chosing other AA's.  Resist gear is for switching out for raids not for full time use usually - get levels and your resists take care of themselves against xp mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mental Clarity III. This is the first archetype I plan on practicing. The extra mana regeneration will be wonderful.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Mental Clarity 1 is definately worth two points.  There is a debate among clerics if MC2 is worth four points.  Almost every cleric agrees that MC3 is a waste of six points.  It isn't 2 points per level, it is 2+4+6 so 12 points by the time you get to MC3.  Get MC1 but then I would move on to the next thing on your list and come back for MC2 and possibly MC3 later if you decide you want them.<br>
<br>

You will need it eventually and the occasional crit is nice.  Not really a big deal though unless you want a class skill for which this is a prerequisite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Spell Casting Mastery. Anything to reduce fizzles. Fizzling a complete heal may mean the difference between a tank living and dying.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is the best cleric AA you can get before level 61.  It will give you WAY more mana then the extra wisdom.  I read the cleric board and I don't think there is a cleric there that wouldn't agree that this is a must have.  I would suggest pushing this up your list to the first arch skill you get but at very least suggest pushing it up to right after MC1.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Spell Casting Reinforcement. Getting a little more out of buffs is very important.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is nice because it also works on your heal over time spells.  I think you need to be at level three for it to give you an extra tick but I'm not positive.  <br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind, AAs are important but level helps you a lot as well.  Now that you have run3, you might want to consider pushing ahead to 60 and then stopping there to get the AAs instead of slowing down your advance to 60 for them.  Of course that depends on the level of the people you group with and where you hunt, but you do get more mana and better resists with each level so don't neglect levels and new spells for the AAs.   <p>[65 Archon] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231627">Ariene</a> (High Elf) Bristlebane<BR>

I agree this is a waste of 5 aa points. Personally I sit at about 270 wis in normal gear (aka 255), switching out to resist gear brings me down to 240 or so. However in a raid situation you will usually have kei on... that happily brings you up to 255 again.<br>
<br>
I used my other 3 general aa points getting regen3, just because its the hardest of the abilities for a cleric to get on gear.<br>

MC1 is worth the 2 points, I didnt bother going MC2. Before you seriously consider doing MC3 I would suggest working on your 8th coldain shawl... much more bang for buck there.<br>

I am currently working on HG3, the celestial regeneration aa you can get in the class level uses this as a prerequisite, and at levels 63+ you can get upgrades to celestial regeneration that make it REALLY nice (800hp per tic regen... mana free insta cast)<br>
<br>

I have SCM1, currently, not for the fizzles but for the reduced mana cost it can trigger. I plan on getting SCM3 once I have hit 65.<br>

<br>
I see the opinion seems to be against spending AA on extra wisdom, but considering the ability to raise mana past 255 with PoP abilities, I think that this could be useful.  As well, I do not often have KEI. Nobody in my guild can cast it yet, and I don't have the funds to always pay for it. Also, seeing as I have to spend 6 AA in the general skills anyway, I thought I would go this route.  <br>
<br>
I've also been thinking about First Aid instead of extra wisdom, but I haven't decided yet.<br>
<br>
I also do not plan on leveling quickly, so saving up a large portion of AA points between now and level 60 is not a concern for me.  I have no desire to push towards level 60. There is still too much &quot;50s content&quot; that I have yet to see.<br>

My wisdom is over 283 (13+ points over my current cap of 270), with most of my gear being focused at mana gear and not wisdom gear, and with many of the things being obtainable either through question or through small (1 - 3 group) encounters.   Putting points into AA wisdom is a waste IMO, because you will find that once you have got that wisdom over cap, your focus will turn to straight +mana gear, and there is very few pieces of good +mana gear that don't also have solid wisdom bonuses.<br>
<br>
If your goal is resists, you would be better off spending those same points in AA resists so that you can keep your gear focused on mana.   Run3 is a definate, I prefer Regen3 as well but putting those three points on magic would be +6 RM. *shrug*   Spell Casting Mastery 3 should be the first set of AA's you get after, as SCM is the single biggest mana boost you can get for yourself. (My mana pool is roughly 4175, with SCM that pool is &quot;increased&quot; to effectively 5400, a boost of well over 1k mana, or effectively a 30% increase in mana pool).<br>
<br>
Every single thing you go for after SCM is entirely dependant on your playstyle.   Like to play battlecleric?  Go with casting fury for the nuke crits and hammer proc crits.  Stricktly a healing cleric?  Go for healing gift and adept.   Use the elixier series more often than direct healing?   Look at spell casting reinforcement / reinforcement mastery to extend the duration of the heal over time.  I agree with Tal,  putting 2 points in the first set of MC is a solid investment, anything beyond that depends on how desperate you are for mana regen.  Being in your mid 50's, there is multiple sources of flowing thought items you could group and / or get multi group events together for, IE 8th prayer shawl, slime boots. <p>Venerable Azhrei Hiever d'Phlith<br>

I don't know if you use stat foods, but it really isn't that hard to get into the habit, and you can have 10 wisdom and a bunch of other stats from Misty Thicket Picnics and Qeynos Afternoon Tea. <br>
<br>
Right now, I presume you're not post 60, and you aren't raiding the higher tier planes.  Getting runspeed, innate regeneration, mental clarity, SCM, SCF, etc, are all much more important and will make a difference in your efficiency as a cleric.  If you really really want that wisdom, you could always do it later, once you have the more important AAs.  5 AA points are much better spent in plenty of different areas.<br>
<br>
I would also argue that leveling to 56, in particular, is very worthwhile, for the summoned hammer and Yaulp V ( provides mana regen while fightin'! )  But I sat around at 52 for  AAs, and at 54, and again at 56.  52 was nice, got Heroic Bond; 54 nice also, got Mark of Retribution.<br>
<br>
Take a look at my Magelo, below my sig, if ya like to see what I spent my AAs on thus far.  They've worked out nice for me. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://itsinhere.com/saga/Elsbetsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

Almost all clerics know which are of least importance: Turn Undead, Innate IVU, A million PoP advance things, majority of General, alot of other class abilities <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Where clerics rule the AA world is quite simply in the archetype category.  Unless you really want to be an Archon or whatever just pop points into these abilties with the exception of the must have Mass Group Buff.<br>
<br>
I'll use 3 different clerics to discuss 3 different routes we took and why: Jherek, Penrif, Rundo<br>
<br>
Jherek: Jherek took the most classical approach to cleric AA's going for mana and healing abilities first.  After run 3 and something else 3 (here i'd recommend either regen 3 or stamina 3) he moved onto SCM 3, Healing Gift 3, got MGB, Celestial Regeneration, and Divine Resurrection, went on to do the PoP wisdom abilities, and I believe now is looking to do SCR followed by SCRM...<br>
<br>
Penrif: Penrif is a nutball and likes to nuke so if you are like him your AA will look more like:<br>
general stuff as above, SCM 3, MGB, Healing Gift 2, SCF 2, MC 2, Divine Arb (very useful I hear), Unfailing Divinity 3, etc.<br>
<br>
Rundo: Rundo is what we'd like to call a wanna be tank cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Fortunately clerics have many AA to help with combat skills<br>
general stuff as above, SCM 3, MGB, Unfailing Divinity 1, ND 2, CA 1...will move on to ND 3, then CA 3, then LR 5, then CS 3, then ID 5 then SCF 3 (for procs) ... all combat skillz all the time<br>
<br>
Other good AA abilities not mentioned above include Radiant Cure (very useful I hear) and Bestow Divine Aura (limited in use but can be useful)<br>
<br>
Pretty much do what you want but I wouldn't hinge around getting AA for wisdom, do that with your gear...same with mana regen...use AA to either get you new abilities or make yourself more customized as a nuker, tank, or healer as needed.  MC 3 isn't a waste I'd say since it stacks with worn regen...however it also shouldn't be a priority at 6 AA point cost <p>Venerable Rundo Nundodundo<br>

Didn't mention radiant cure or divine arbitration because those are PoP abilities that require level 61.  Both are wonderful though - I would suggest getting div arb 1 first thing after dinging 61 and then radiant cure 1 then div arb 2 and 3 as soon as you get the levels for them.  I'm pretty happy with radiant cure 1 - I'll probably get levels 2 and 3 eventually but level one cures a lot already and I can pull out a clicky cure earring (or pure blood now) if it isn't enough.<br>
<br>
In my opinion the best cleric AAs are tied between spell casting mastery and divine arbitration.  Those two are must haves for every cleric.   <p>[65 Archon] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231627">Ariene</a> (High Elf) Bristlebane<BR>

My 35 AAs have gone into Run 3, Innate Wis3 (just for the heck of it), MC3, SCR 1, MBG, Radiant Cure 1, and Divine Arbitration 1.<br>
<br>
What you do with your Archetype abilities seems to vary with your play style.  I went for mana regen with MC3 (also have Flowing Thought VI) and I have never looked back.  <br>
<br>
Mass Group Buff is the best thing I've ever gotten, of course, but don't overlook Radiant Cure and Divine Arbitration when you are looking for something to do.  They both have low AA costs and have proven very useful for me.  As an added plus, they both refresh in a mere 3 minutes!  <br>
<br>
Radiant Cure 1 takes down just about everything you're likely to encounter in an experience group.  Tash, most slows, DoTs, even snare and mez (not charm, though, since you can't cast helpful spells on charmed party members)!  Being able to knock off almost any harmful spell that hits your party is very useful.<br>
<br>
Divine Arbitration is one of the most surprisingly useful abilities I have.  It casts in under a second, and can save the day in many situations.  If I have a CH rolling on the tank, and he suddenly takes more damage than I expected, I can dismount, stop my CH, and use Divine Arbitration all in about a second.  If the rest of the group is full health and the tank is at 15% or so, it usually takes everyone in the party to about 80% at the first level of the ability (that's not exact, of course.  It will vary with your groups).  That's much faster and much more effective than using fast heals to get the tank back to a CH-safe level.<br>

I would definately get the mana cost reduction  AA (SCM) before MC 2 or 3, but they are well worth keeping on your list for later acquisition. <br>
<br>
I also agree that poinst are better spent almost anywhere, rather than on stats. If you feel you have a stat weakness you can fix it up with gear alot faster than getting 5 aa points...<br>

Some things have no cap, though, like resists (or do they cap at 500?  still, that's a lot less achievable cap than 355 wisdom).  If you're really worried about resists, just spend the 3-5 AA points on innate magic resistance instead of wisdom, and keep your wisdom mask.  (I'd primarily worry about resist magic, not so much about fire/cold/disease/poison, especially because a lot of encounters hide clerics from the AEs, using the fact that you don't need line of sight to heal).<br>
<br>
Let's do some math on SCM vs MC, using three 58 clerics at probably the bottom of the &quot;average 58 cleric&quot; range, the top of that range, and in a top-end raid guild situation.  As a review, MC1-3 add 1 point of mana regen per level of the MC ability.  SCM adds 3%, 6% (cumulative, so 3% more) and 12% (cumulative, so 6% more) to mana savings per spell cast, including complete heals, etc.  (It might be 2% 6% 12%, but SCM3 is 12% everywhere I've seen and heard).<br>
<br>
Cleric #1 usually doesn't have KEI, spends most of his time medding or on a horse/lizard, and does have Blessed Armor of the Risen at 58 (one reason why I did my first major AAs at 58... it adds 6/tick to your mana regen, that's double mental clarity 3... so I'd get 58 before you do AAs).  He has flowing thought I, from the solstice earring, like pretty much every other 50-something cleric.  His mana regen per tick, sitting there medding/horsing is 1+1+25+6+1=34.  (1 for standing, 1 for sitting, 25 for meditating, 6 for Blessed Armor, 1 for FT1).<br>
<br>
Cleric #2 usually has KEI, spends most of her time medding or on horse, has BAotR, and has FT6.  Solistice earring, 8th shawl, and book from the big camel/giraffe/goat/whatever thing in umbral plains).  Her mana regen per tick,  medding is 1+1+25+6+14+6=53.<br>
<br>
Cleric #3 usually has VoQ, spends most of his time on a horse, has BAoTR, has beastlord mana buffs, has FT15, has Lunar Whispers, and has Wind of Marr playing for (not sure of the total with instrument modifiers, but it's 21 before modifiers, so that's worst-case scenario) 21.  His mana regen per tick medding is 1+1+25+6+18+8+15+2+21=97.<br>
<br>
Cleric #1 would increase his mana regen from 34 to 35 with MC1, an increase of just under 3%.  If he chose SCM1 instead, he'd save 3% mana on every spell he cast.  That results in an effective mana pool increase of just over 3%.  (If you went OOM from casting 97 spells before, they now cost 3% less, so you can cast 100 for the price of 97, your effective mana pool went up by 3/97 or just over 3%).  In addition, though, since you save 3% mana, if you cast a series of spells that used to put you OOM, you now have 3% mana left.  It takes you 3% less time to recover from casting a certain series of spells.  Cleric #1 has a regen rate of 34 per tick, and 3% of that is just over 1 extra point of mana per tick (effective).  SCM1 basically gives Cleric #1 a tiny bit more mana-regen for the buck compared to MC1, but also inreases his effective mana pool by 3%.  SCM1 is the better deal.  SCM2 costs twice the AA points as MC1, but provides the same benefit as SCM1.  It's probably a tossup.  Same mana pool increase from both, more or less, but for double the cost, SCM2 also increases effective mana pool again.  SCM3 provides double the benefit as SCM1 and 2 for 3 times the points as SCM1/MC1.  Double the effective mana regen and also 6% mana pool increase for 3 times as many points as MC1.  I'd still say it's worth it for this cleric.  After that, consider MC1.  MC2?  no way is it better than SCM1 2 or 3.  MC3 at 6 points is a joke.  There are lots of better AA abilities than that.<br>
<br>
Cleric #2 would raise mana regen from 53 to 54 with MC1, less than a 2% increase, or less than 1% per AA point.  As we saw above, SCM1 will give a 3% increase to effective mana regen, so 3% of 53 is 1.6 (significantly higher than the 1 point from MC1).  Or think of it as an increase of 1.5% per AA point.  In addition, the same 3% mana pool increase.  SCM2 gives another 1.6 mana per tick effective for 4 points.  That's 80% as good as MC1 but you get another 3% mana pool increase, so I'd say SCM2 is still considerably better than MC1 for this cleric.  Finally, SCM3 is a 6% increase for 6 points.  Definitely better than MC1 in value per AA point even if it didn't increase the mana pool.<br>
<br>
Cleric #3 would raise mana regen from 97 to 98 with MC1, just over a 1% increase, or about 0.5% per AA point.  SCM1 will give them approximately an equivalent of FT3 increase (3% of 97).  That blows MC1 away.  SCM2 is the same increase but for double the points.  Still, 3 for 4 points beats 1 for 2 points.  SCM3 gives about 6 extra mana per tick effective for 6 points.  6 for 6 beats 1 for 2 as well.  Hands down, SCM1-3 are more important for this cleric even completely ignoring effective mana pool increase.<br>
<br>
By the way, you can use this to analyze if an obulus death shroud (mana preservation 3) is a better upgrade than boots of flowing slime.  The ODS doesn't work on complete heals, making it complicated, but for all other spells, 10% mana savings vs FT3, it's about equal, and the ODS costs much, much less.<br>
<br>
Summary - SCM is significantly better than MC for a majority of clerics in terms of mana savings and mana pool.  The higher your mana regen is, the more effective SCM becomes.  Do SCM3 before MC, and MC will just be that much more valuable when you do it, too.<br>
<br>
Since a lot of crit heals are wasted, one can argue adept is better than gift.  Crits are fun, though, and even crits from gift 1 are double, so hey.  Still, I'd recommend if you're going to do them all, max out adept before gift (but do your 2 points in gift for fun, it's only 2 points and you'd do them eventually anyway) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also, both adept and gift apply to procs on items which heal, too (but not clicked items like velious quest greaves).  Blackstar, Mace of Night procs for 124 for me instead of 105, and crits for 248 on average of once per proc in a full group (16% crit chance, 6 people healed, so roughly 1 crit per proc).  They're great skills.  I'm at 73 AAs, don't have MC1 yet, and still have lots to do before I do MC1.  Even more before I do MC2 or 3.  They sound better at first read than they actually are, I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely/signature/sig_top.gif" style="border:0;"alt="Gravely Mistaken"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Have you noticed the difference yet?  Did you buy SCM 1-3 all at once?  I imagine it made a pretty big difference if you did it that way?  Any plans for what's next as far as AAs or levels or some of each?<br>
<br>
Another &quot;big difference&quot; level for me was 58, because of Blessed Armor of the Risen (the 6 extra mana per tick), and because I did SCM3 on that level.<br>
<br>
Hey, for anyone who is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a spellbook completist, and looking at spells and AAs around the level 60 mark, I would seriously recommend flying past 60 right up to 62.  Aego is really not worth it except for completeness, because it seriously lacks hitpoints compared to the 61-2 spells.  For example, Symbol of Kazad (level 61, 910 hitpoints) plus Faith (level 61, 520 hitpoints, 22AC) plus Ward of Gallantry (level 61, 54AC) add up to 1430 hitpoints and 76AC.  That's 330 more hitpoints and 22 more AC than Aegolism (level 60, 1100 hitpoints, 54AC).  It's even 280 more hitpoints and 16 more AC than Blessing of Aegolism (level 60, 1150 hitpoints, 60AC, group spell).<br>
<br>
My point is, Aegolism is good for one level, and once you hit 61, it's out of date.  If your groupmates can put up with you not having Aego for one quick level (60 goes much faster than 59 and 61), and if you can stand buffs that only last about an hour, you can give your group much better protection at level 61 than Aego gives.  Technically, the three level 61 spells are better than Virtue at 62, but it's only 25 hitpoints difference and 4 AC difference.  Aegolism's convenient, but it's noticeably inferior to level 61 spells, and then it's probably worth going for 62 to get Virtue for the convenience.<br>
<br>
61 and 62 are huge, huge levels for clerics.  They give you access to:<br>
<br>
* Great hitpoint/ac buffs at 61, though short duration.<br>
* Virtue at 62 for convenience and good hp/ac.<br>
* Supernal Remedy at 61 (1522 hitpoints in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1.8 seconds</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for 400 mana)<br>
* Supernal Elixir at 62 (2000 hitpoints healed over 4 ticks for 400 mana)<br>
* Divine Arbitration (level 1 takes the group's total damage, adds 20% and shares it evenly among the group, very fast (0.75 seconds), so it's great for saving people, and it's really a must-have ability)<br>
* Radiant Cure (cures curses, poisons and diseases for all party members, plus cures other detrimental effects like root, snare, malo(s(i(ni(a)))), etc.)<br>
* and a few other PoP abilities as well<br>
<br>
I really think the big cleric levels which seem to be good for stopping for AAs are 56, 58, 62.  65 is a nice level, too but it's the last one, so everyone who reaches it stops for AAs I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I am now 61 with 32 AAs spent.  I stood at 60 for a very long time, cruised through a bunch of AAs rather quickly.  Noticed that when I leveld to 61, I had an automatic plus 5 to all stats, which is so good, and I got the (purchased, for 251 pp,) Supernal Remedy, which has been especially nice right now.  Just over 1500hp heal, for 400 mana, and 1.8 second cast time.<br>
<br>
All the best of our AAs are to heal better and faster.  SCM3 is godly.  Not flashy at all, but it does its thing.  Didn't spend anything on SCF, yeah, it's all flashy and kaboooom, over 1k damage under level 60 and all, but that isn't me.  MC1 was a good AA to get early on, Nina, you did well there.  Flowing Thought is always nice, but MC2 and 3 are debatable, based on what I've read.  Spent some points on ND1, SCR1, innate wisdom1, and I will blow a bunch more on wisdom and Pop wisdom, cos mana pool is probably the most important thing for the game I play... Saving 9 points for mass group buff seems a bit wasteful to me, since I don't raid.  <br>
<br>
But looking at Gravely's must-haves, Divine Arbitration and Radiant Cure are my goals, after I hit 62, since I have a Virtue scroll in the bank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gravely>Gravely</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/1/03 9:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.visi.com/~mlm/eq/gravely_face_60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My take</span><hr size=1> I really think you'll enjoy being 62 and getting some AAs at that level.  It's a good choice, in my opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You'll have all the buffs anyone really needs, too.<br>
<br>
The only things that I really, really love about 65 are armor of the zealot (it's 450 hitpoints and 8 mana per tick), Yaulp 6 for soloing, and Mark of the Righteous because it's so much damage.  I have never once cast The Silent Command or whatever that level 65 AE stun is.  Group Virtue is convenient, but doesn't increase my power as a cleric (and I don't raid much and accordingly don't have MGB).  It's a good level, and fun to be 65 and stuff, but I don't think there's any big reason to level up to 65 before doing AAs, especially the really important AAs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Oh, there's also a good group heal at 64, it's like 2750 per person or so, I think, and with healing AAs and stuff, I'm getting over 3k per heal, with crits for 6500ish.  It's a good upgrade to group complete heal because it's so fast.  But it's not usually a spell I memorize except in specific situations.<br>
<br>
I'm working on avoidance AAs now (combat agility and lightning reflexes after that) because I get hit a lot and want to be able to channel more (if they're missing me, they're not interrupting me).  Then maybe channeling focus, and then, I'm not sure.  Mana pool is kind of nice, but for grinding or for long fights, mana regen is more important.  I may work on those, or I might do something like Unfailing Divinity for fun.<br>

I killed a Xi Vius in Maiden's Eye and dinged AA 18, then went down to Great Divide and killed an Ancient Shardwurm and dinged 55, in that exact order ( I had been carefully splitting AA and XP, trying to get a &quot;double ding&quot; with one kill.. I have yet to be successful, but it's fun trying). Then I spent all my points on SCM and zoned into Thurg to get them to activate. I noticed a HUGE difference immediately. With KEI and SCM3, I can heal almost non-stop all the time, unless my group is being silly and fighting for aggro. I can even melee/mark of retribution/summon Smashy the amazing smashing hammer too without any ill effects. It's great fun.<br>
<br>
I should have enough for anther AA soon (tomorrow maybe?) and I plan on taking a &quot;me&quot; AA, something I'll enjoy. I've been thinking of Spellcasting Fury, just because I get a fair number of chances to be &quot;battle cleric&quot; and I think it might be fun. I was also thinking of getting crit heals, because those are pretty flashy too. Not sure what I'll take yet.<br>
<br>
I'd like to take a bunch of the different archetype AAs. I know it'll be a long process, but I'd like to get 5 or 6 a level between now and 60 so that I can have some fun. The two healing abilities, spellcasting reinforcement, mental clarity, and channeling focus are all on my list. I hope to get two of them to level 3, and maybe the rest to level 1 each.. but we'll see. <br>
<br>
<br>
Right now, I'm having so much fun with Spellcasting Mastery and my new spells ... it's such a blast. Speaking of blasts, I still need Judgement.. oh well. One day, I suppose. <br>
<br>
I need a wealthy benefactor. <br>

<br>
SCFury sounds interesting because of the crits on procs from the summoned hammer... I'd like to see those.  I'm just getting hit often enough, and getting annoyed by being interrupted enough that I feel like working on avoidance AAs (Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes).<br>
<br>
I really love crit heals, too, and healing adept is fun with those, too, because your crits get bigger, too (like if you get adept 3, complete heals are 8250 instead of 7500, but crits are 16500 instead of 15000, for example).<br>
<br>
I see from your magelo you made 56, woohoo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And your equipment is looking very nice.  Have you thought about trying to get an Idol of the Underking from the Hole?  The camp is the ratman jail, and it's kind of a fun place.  The named rat is tough compared to the regular ones, and the ratman guard (instead of ratman warrior) for the SK epic is also kind of tough, but a good group around your level would do fine, I'm sure.  It's a rare drop from a rare spawn, but if you're planning on doing lots of AAs between levels, then it might be worth it, as it'll last through level 60, and then sell for a decent amount later on if you stop using level 60 or lower heals.<br>
<br>
If you run across any extra copies of Remove Greater Curse (54, but yeah right, who ever has an extra of that hehe), Stun Command (55), Aegis (57), The Unspoken Word (59), Banishment of Shadows (60) and/or Marzin's Mark (60, but again, yeah right, hehe), let me know, I'm buying! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
