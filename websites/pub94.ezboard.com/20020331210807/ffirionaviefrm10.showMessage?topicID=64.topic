Those whom had given their lives for the light in the name of all that was good and just. I carried a torch in my hand, making my way past vaulted doors that descended to darkness. Once within I stood as oft I had before where my mother and father had lain to rest. I could still hear their voices, shadows of the past that yet remained...<br>
<br>
&quot;Euthan...Banegrivm...&quot;, the boys had been honing their skills of swordplay under their fathers close teutelage when their mother had called them for dinner. &quot;Go on in boys, and make sure to clean up before hand for supper&quot;, their father smiled nudging the two onwards laying his sword beside his tabard that was emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Knights of Truth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Race you...&quot;, I still remember my brothers words as Euthan and I races for the cottage throwing down are wooden training swords. Little did I know then of what the fates would have in store. I had always wondered, but little did I know of what secrets lie to gather within the darkest of shadows.<br>
<br>
I had always wondered, where did my brother go when he slipped out the back doors at sermon at the Temple of Marr. I had always wondered where he dissappeared to in the evengings upon occassion; when off he would be at the standing stones within the eastern commonlands where dark things would aspire to come to pass within the unseen folds of night.<br>
<br>
I still remember that one fatefull day, forever etched to memory. I was walking home from the Hall of Truth after a rigorous day of training when I had noticed a plume of smoke rising off in the distance from the direction of my families cottage. With great fret, I made my way in haste...only to be revealed to the deepest of sorrow and horror.<br>
<br>
For as I crested the hill top to look down upon the cottage of my family, I stood and trembled as my heart broke threefold. My home was set to a blazing inferno from which I could hear no screams yet see no one. Not my mother, not my father, and not my dear brother Euthan.<br>
<br>
I remember rushing to the door and trying to fight past the flames and that was when I saw something...something of the deepest evils. The charred husks of my father and mother lumbering from the flames, their eyes burning with an eerie unholy light. I drew my blade, feeling my heart race whilst biting back the dears and lay what had been my mother and father to rest. Freeing them from their torment. But where was my brother Euthan?<br>
<br>
It was then I heard a sneering mocking laughter and my brother was revealed to me in his truth for the first time. &quot;Where is your strength now my brother? Where is the light? Where is your <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  HATE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?&quot; I will never forget the blind rage that consumed my body that day as I lunged at my own brother with my blade staving him in the side. My brother stepped back reeling from the blow and invoked Innoruuks unholy name. He passed into the shadows, and was swollowed whole...never to be seen again, forever consumed by hate.<br>
<br>
I stood within the crypts of my mother and father, my brothers evil never to be forgotten. &quot;soon my brother, soon enough&quot; I thought. I muttered a prayer to Mithaniel Marr and departed, sealing the bitter hand wrought by the fates. For I knew, sooner or later...the Truthbringer comes for all. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=64.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=64.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=64.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=64.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=64.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
