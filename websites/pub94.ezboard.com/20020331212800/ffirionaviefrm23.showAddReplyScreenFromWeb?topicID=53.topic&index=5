A guard demanded. He was big, and furry, but I suppose you could describe all of the Vah Shir like that. His fur was dark in color, and covered in spots. I held back obvious remarks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Merciful guard, I am here to warn your king of the incoming plight! There are certain parties that wish to bring down the walls of this magnificent city!&quot; <br>
<br>
The guard studied me for a moment, and I wondered if I laid it on too thickly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Follow me. N'gyor, watch the gates.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did as I was told, and was led through the city. I took in the sights, and the Vah Shir took in the sight of me. There was much whispering and much more giggling. I must have looked annoyed and must have looked more intimidating, as people stopped giggling. We reached the palace, and I was patted down. They asked me to disarm myself, and I handed over several shurikens, a few throwing daggers, and one of my good daggers. I still had another knife hidden in my left boot, and two more throwing daggers hidden in the right one. My potions were carefully under my armpits in seperate vials. <br>
<br>
I was now in the company of three guards. The one I met outside the gate entered the palace, and I was kept in the watchful company of the two others. They tried not to stare, but they also failed miserably. It was a few more minutes, then the original guard returned. I was granted immediate appearance before the king, probably because they considered it rude to keep me waiting. <br>
<br>
I was led into the palace by the three guards. The original stood in front of me, and the other two flanked me. The entire palace seemed like it was created to be more defensive than impressive. A wall surrounded the entire building and there were no windows. There weren't too many decorations besides the occasional tapestry hanging down from here or there.<br>
<br>
I was caught up in looking around and didn't notice the original guard stopped. I walked right into his back. He went down onto one knee suddenly, as did the other two. The throne room wasn't as ornate as it could have been. A throne sat against a back wall, with a Vah Shir woman sitting to the right of it, from my view. To the left was an advisor, and all along the walls were armored men and advisors. <br>
<br>
&quot;GRAB HIM!&quot; Someone cried out from behind me. I turned around and spied a Haughty Elf. To his left was some sort of robed magic-user, and to his right was someone decked out in armor. I suddenly felt a massive paw grab my shoulder. I turned around and, as hard as I could, kicked, hoping that Vah Shir had testicals in the same places other humanoids did. I hit armor, but also home, as signalled by a loud yelp. I stepped out from the triangle the guards had around me. The magic-user was making funny gestures which meant he was casting a spell. I didn't appreciate people fighting back, so I bent over, drew a throwing dagger, and rolled. I threw the dagger and it went in, blade first. That stopped him. By now everyone had at least drawn there weapons. It didn't look like diplomacy was going to get me out of here.<br>
<br>
It was then that I felt cold steel burrow itself in my left arm. I suddenly remembered my regeneration potion, which then made me remember my take-me-home potion. I began sprinting away, and drew out my regeneration potion with my right arm from under my right armpit, which was not as easy as it sounded. I drank it. A minute later I began feeling hungry, which meant it was already taking effect. I sped up more and ran to a nearby room, sealing the door behind me. <br>
<br>
&quot;Who-who-who are you?&quot; A feminine voice said. I turned and realized it was a Vah Shir girl, who had been sleeping.<br>
<br>
&quot;A ghost,&quot; I replied, hastily gulping down my Take-Me-Home potion. She stared at me. BANG BANG BANG! went the door as the guard's swords sliced into it. It was then that I felt my body being sucked away, and knew the potion was beginning to work. I took a deep breath and prepared to loose my lunch upon my arrival home. Better than my life, I suppose. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>
