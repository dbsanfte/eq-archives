As a SK, you can group with everyone who lets you. And in roleplay you can hide everything. If your fellows are good RP-ers they will help you with that.<br>
Isn't there a SK out there who pretends he's a fallen paladin? I've been very impressed by that idea.<br>
And it isn't Verrant that makes it cut-and-dry, if at all, it's the players who do that. <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>

I imagine if a Merchant in Qeynos was found to be dealing with either the Bloodsabres or Sabretooth Gnoll clan, they would be harshly punished for their treason.  In fact there is a Qeynos quest that can result in the execution of such an NPC.<br>

You have either outgrown or have no need for the item you are selling, thus you are giving your trash to the other person in exchange for something that will strengthen your cause.<br>
<br>
I mean seriously, all you kids are talking RP this and RP that. How the fuck does your character know something is Druid/Paladin/Ranger, etc. only? &quot;Blast it! This thing has a few dead leaves stuck to it, I bet it's an item for those damned Druids! /destroy.&quot;<br>
Strictly in character, you are selling what you deem to be trash. The cliche stands, one man's trash is another man's treasure. You manage to find someone who wants your &quot;trash&quot; and get coin for it, all the while thinking the person in question is a sucker. Meanwhile he's got his cherished item, all the while thinking you're the sucker.<br>
<br>
It's great to play intelligent characters who are well-spoken and know their history, but I swear some of you play your characters as though they're omniscient.<br>
<br>
(I could see a reason for not selling something like a lammy to opposing forces though. I see no in character reason to not be able to tell that a very powerful item is a very powerful item and is not trash. With other things though, fuck outta here. You've got some monk's head, and this fool wants to buy it?

<br>
Because apparently, according to the game mechanics, everyone in Norrath has learned to identify the uses and purposes and restrictions of items very skillfully. Perhaps the spells used to enchant things leave very easily-identifiable auras. Perhaps Intro to Adventuring 101 (required course for all young folks) includes a complete overview of armor and weapons, along with handy tips on how to ascertain the quality of items.<br>
<br>
In some other games, there are skills that impact one's ability to identify what an item is or what it does, or give varying amounts of information to different people. Not so here, so I see no reason to impose false ignorance on characters.<br>
<br>
The guy who sells fishing bait can identify the subtle differences between various swords well enough to offer varying prices, and apparently so can I.<br>

<br>
Who says I deem it to be trash?  Just because I now have a better weapon, doesn't mean that I consider the old one useless or trash.  It was a good weapon for my skill level at the time.  Actually, rather than selling that older weapon, I am probably going to give it to a youngster in my guild or another Priest of Life who can use it.  I would not sell it to an enemy who one day could use it against me or one of my allies in the fight for good.  Just because the weapon doesn't do as much damage as my current one doesn't mean that it doesn't do damage.<br>

<br>
Greetings Adventurers, and those less adventurous!<br>
<br>
Are you seeking an item that is difficult to obtain.  Just don't feel satisfied with your current gear and wish to smack your foes with greater gusto?<br>
<br>
Feeling a bit down because your chosen god forbids you to intermingle with those polar to yourself?<br>
<br>
Rejoice!  I'm the solution to your needs.  Let me explain.<br>
<br>
With my uninformed upbringing, I've discovered that there is truly no good or evil in Norrath.  It basically boils down to what you think is &quot;right&quot; and how it bumps up against those who believe your &quot;right&quot; is actually &quot;wrong;&quot; while their &quot;right&quot; is viewed as being horribly &quot;wrong&quot; in your eyes.  But then both your &quot;wrongs&quot; are &quot;right&quot; in a third parties' view.  Confused, well who isn't?<br>
<br>
Me!  I just don't care how you feel about each other.  There's just no prof...um, let's just say I don't like politics.<br>
<br>
I also don't believe that these so called gods exist.  What god in their right mind would allow themselves to be smacked around by mortals?<br>
<br>
Sorry, getting a bit winded here.  If you need an item or items and are having a tough time finding them, look me up.  I'll be glad to help find the item for you, of course, there is a small finder's fee attached to each purchase.  But nothing excessive; you've got my word.<br>
<br>
So don't trouble your heads any longer with the limitations placed upon you by your &quot;beliefs.&quot;  When you need help, you come see me.<br>
<br>
Good day!<br>

One that I think a lot of people have missed (mostly those who thing the /role flag is a good thing).<br>
<br>
What you know does not equal what your character knows. Players  (that's you) have to have a basic knowlege of metagame mechanics. What spells they can learn, what weapons they can use, their level, the general /con of other monsters, stats, etc...<br>
<br>
You don't have to impart that knowlege to your character. Just because you know what that odd item is for, it doesn't mean your character does. You have to know the levels of the characters you group with (important game mechanic to avoid abuse), but that doens't mean you're character knows. Role-playing is in part at least, playing your character without the metagame knowledge that you have.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic at hand, just back up and think about what your character would do. Just being 'good' doesn't mean your character is Paladin perfect. He may have some minor flaws like a bit of greed, or be dangerously naive. The world is full of basically good people who compromise what that think they should do just to put food on the table.<br>
<br>
Another point is to keep in mind, when finding group members, your character would seek out people he trusts his life with to go do something dangerous. Your character would ask questions of them, and try to get to know them. The same isn't true in a merchantile situation. Exactly how deeply would your character pry into the personal life of a potential customer? What stereo-types does your character have of certain races? Use your character's persona to determine who to trade with. Not some meta-game mechanic.<br>

<br>
If you want to roleplay faults that are not covered by the game mechanics of whatever system you are playing, fine! Wanna play a blind character? Sure... turn off your screen! Wanna be maimed? Never equip anything on your left arm if you like. Just gotta be a traditional vampire? Go right ahead and delete yourself if you ever catch a ray of sunlight. EQ just doesn't have mechanics for that stuff. You are more than welcome to simulate them however you like, but everyone else isn't failing as roleplayers if they don't do so.<br>
<br>
Likewise, EQ includes the idea that the ability to assess items is something everyone can do. Just like everyone can, with no training whatsoever, instantly ride a horse if they buy one. Or can easily function in any sort of armor they can squeeze themselves into, with no training whatsoever. Not very realistic, eh?<br>
<br>
The point is that roleplaying does not exist independent of the rule structure of the game. In D&amp;D, you need special abilities, skills, or spells to learn what stuff does above a certain minimal level. In Asheron's Call, your chance to identify things is based on your training in that type of identification and your raw intellect. Not here - here, everyone can do it. That is the system.<br>
<br>
It isn't metagaming to use the basic, coded functions of the game - assessing items to see what they do, /conning monsters to decide whether or not to attack, etc. Every game has a few things they set by the wayside, favoring gameplay over 'realism'. In EQ, appraising items happens to be one of those things.<br>

Caillou, wood elf worshipper or Tunare, couldn't imagine giving or selling an item to a dark elf even if he purported to be good (at least at this point in her life).  However, if it was a human, she would have no issue with it at all, even if that human was actually a shadow knight worshiper of Innouruk because she would have no way to discern that on appearance alone.  What does she know (still young) of shadow knight only items or armor (ooc: even if I did inpect &amp; see something, I would have to look on spoiler sites to know what 90% of the items are anyway)?  If the human is wearing plate (or what looks to be plate) and wielding a sword or two, he could be either a warrior or paladin (but Caillou has been learning that humans are confusing and could be evil as easily as good).<br>

The reason all items are immediately identifiable to players is to avoid scams. VI decided to sacrifice a bit of reality to create a fairer environment. Player knowledge, not character knowledge. If your character falls prey to a scam, VI wants it to be willing on your part (if you did a story were another 'RL' friend's character stole something from your character for example), not because you didn't know what you were getting into.<br>
<br>
If your character isn't the divine type, he may not know why he can't use that paladin only or shadowknight only sword. It may burn his hands, or leap from his grasp when he tries to use it. The runes on it look innocent enough. All he knows is that Erudite in platemail over there is willing to pay him a lot of money for it.<br>
<br>
The same goes for most RPGs. D&amp;D characters don't know their levels. Nor would they reduce the people of the world to such simple classifications as fighter, mage, rogue, etc... <br>
<br>
There are just things you need to know to make the game more fun. Imagine if you couldn't /con or /who players, and didn't get messages about experience gains. You could group with a friend who's a little too high a level for a week or so before you realize that you’re not improving. Realistic yes, but EQ shouldn't have to hide metagame information from players, just to force players into character. That's the job of the role-player.<br>

Tatter Pikken, it's good to see that there are other sane people wandering this world of ours. We'll definitely have to get together for a few drinks some time. I know this Sebilisian who's one hell of a bartender...<br>
<br>
(ooc)<br>
Right, then, back to the thread at hand. It's really tricky to determine what is, or is not, IC information in the game. Obviously, things like health, mana, and stamina are (though I think saying things like &quot;60%&quot; borders on the OOC line). The effects of items you have equipped probably should be, too, though it's an open question as to how one talks about a &quot;+4 DEX&quot; item. It's stated in the EverQuest manual from Ruins of Kunark that /consider is a mystical ability that all Norrathians possess, so it's IC as well, as a convention of the game world. (I like to view it as reading the aura around the target; ergo, the /con color equates to the color of their aura.)<br>
<br>
As for items you don't have equipped, I think that really depends on your character. A grizzled old adventurer probably knows a lot about a number of pieces of equipment, while a magus of the 16th circle or later has the Identify spell and can use that as his explanation for the knowledge. Would a naive Druid fresh from the Surefall Glade be privy to such information? OOC, yes; IC, maybe not.<br>
<br>
In any event, I agree with Ellywig that this is a lot a function of how you choose to play, and that, given the complexity of the issue, it's unfair to consider those who play to a different standard &quot;wrong.&quot; <p>Illudin<br>

<br>
I tailor my RP, for consistency's sake, to take into account much of what is necessary knowledge to get by in whatever world I'm in.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, Ayida believes that  the world is broken up into &quot;zones&quot; with magical barriers between them, and can refer to them IC.  Concepts of level, hit points, and any other stat-based thing are included in that.  As you learn the game, your characters get more knowledge as well, and sometimes I'll refer to &quot;library research&quot; from 3rd Gate, or &quot;I got someone to get me a book from Erudin library&quot;, or &quot;I was talking to this dwarf and *he* told me. . ..the list is endless.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, I'm Ayida.  I'm in Iceclad, just zoned.  I'm a level/rank/season 52 warrioress.&quot;, is completely IC to me.  When I'm around folks who don't talk that way, or if they're always couching things like ((ooc: what's your level)), with OOC signifiers, then I'll try to adapt and use *their* habits of what makes them comfortable.  If I'm around folks who think I'm talking OOC and prefer it that way, I don't disabuse them of the notion by waving it in their face.<br>
<br>
As long as in my head, I can hear what *Ayida* thinks, and my fingers will type it out, (funny isn't it, how nearly all our communications IC *have* to be conveyed by words, one of the best RPer's on the server is Titaisia, btw, and why?  Because she communicates with her Vah Shir so effectively by using the body movements, distance, and the bare bones non-verbal clues we're given.).  If I was strongly stuck in the &quot;my character doesn't know what my player knows perspective, even the fact that we use written vs. verbal/non-verbal communication would bug me.<br>
<br>
Just a couple thoughts, tangential to the thread. . ..<br>

I can appreciate your view, but in all honesty I think you may be slightly kidding yourself.  If you are going to RP *ALL* sales transactions, and RP that your Character is NOT aware of all items/stats/etc. IC, then if you found a Dark Reaver, what would you do?<br>
<br>
/auction Looking to sell a large black sword, has a dull finish, may be magical<br>
<br>
RandomPerson Tells you: Huh?  Is that a quest item?<br>
RandomSK tells you: Is it a Dark Reaver?<br>
RandomWarrior Tells you: Stats?<br>
<br>
Because you couldn't actually auction it by name, unless you rationalize that it has Dark Reaver written on it.<br>
<br>
And then what happens when some helpful soul explains to you it is a Shadow Knight weapon?  Do you still sell it?  Or say 'Drat!  Now I have IC knowledge and cannot further the cause of evil!' <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2204.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2204.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2204.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2204.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2204.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=2204.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2204.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2204.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
