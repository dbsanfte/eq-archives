Rainik was my first EQ character. A friend at work talked me and 3 others into forming a 6 man group. That friend and his bud had played eq up to level 45 on other servers but the rest of us were all pretty much new. We designed the make up of the group from the beginning. We had a Cleric (our leader), warrior, ranger, rogue, chanter, and wizard. We set out to do leveling the hard way. All of those levels were spent in dungeons. I think it really helped me out. Its amazing how many pick up groups I have been in at level 50+ that have people that don't know how to play the game very well. People that did the PL cycle of oasis, loio and all that. The way we went was pretty much newbie zones to level 10 then we hit the warrens. Stayed there to about 15 and then hit UGuk. After Guk we went to Runnyeye. Man that was so much fun. I still have screenshots of the time me and the warrior held of like 8 frogloks as the rest of the team ran to zone. It was so cool when we actually cleared that train, just me and the warrior. Or the time in Guk when i saved our rouge by casting my weak ass 10point ranger heal on him... I remember actually feeling scared and my heart racing when I was level 8 and got lost in Gfay. I pulled up tracking and there were Orc centurians all around me. I really miss those days. I think it was a combination of everything being new, me not knowing anything, and me being with a bunch of friends that gave each other hell.<br>
<br>
Well our whole division at work got layed off in May and our group broke up. Only 2 of us still play on FV and I am leaving EQ all together. I really do miss those days.<br>

I had all the maps printed from EQ atlas, and I was terrified. I got to highpass and got lost, a kind mage helped me to high keep, bound me and led me to the EK zone.<br>
<br>
I remember running down the ramp in EK, absolutely terrified.. the people in that zone were all 18-25.. I was 8.. I was petrified of getting trampled hehe.<br>

Somehow I made it. Seeing the different landscapes for the very first time was an amazing experience. <p><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=53989>Nahide' Altaica , Khala Dun Journeycat Champion of the 54th rank</a><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>

I did that at level five.  From Kelethin to Erud, not Halas, but the same principle.  I did all kinds of touristy things in Erud while I was there--sightseeing, mostly.  I didn't speak a word of human then, so it was a very alienating experience, especially once I got to the Qeynos area and the only people who spoke elvish were half-elves who didn't know they could actually speak elvish.<br>
<br>
I did get killed in Kithicor on the way, and in Highpass, too, but I did make it, eventually.  And, huge kudos to Elaira (I still remember her for this), when I got killed in Qeynos while bound in Freeport, at fifth level, she took me to Surefall and bound me there so my stuff wouldn't rot.<br>
<br>
[Edit: I remembered it was Elaira who did that teleport.  Kendara helped me out with something else at about the same time.] <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

<br>
this was about a year ago, and of course i was just starting out on another server.  my bardling came running up to the entrance of kaladim gawking at the huge stone dwarf over the entrance, pack slung over her back.  <br>
<br>
immediately, a little nekkid dwarf hails me.  so i hailed him back, and said &quot;i am a tourist in your land, and a thirsty one.  could you perhaps show me where i might be able to buy a frosty ale?&quot;<br>
<br>
he proceeded to lead me all around kaladim, showing me its wonders and pointing out the bank, the different guildhalls (he made special note of the orcbelt quest giver) and the nearest tavern.  i ducked inside, ordered a stack of booze, split it into two and slapped half of it up into a trade window for him while thanking him profusely.  <br>
<br>
then i skipped off down the road while he waved goodbye standing under the gigantic dwarf statue.<br>
<br>
*sniffles*<br>
<br>
from that day to my arrival on FV, i've been trying to recapture that feeling.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujaroodooger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaroo Dooger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/20/02 4:49:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2364.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning, I'm feeling very drunk and very nostalgic.</span><hr size=1> Doing the Stein quest with about four members of my guild.

<br>
(1) Moreth the High Elven Enchanter (my first ever character) was born on Tallon Zek earlier this year when a few friends convinced me to try EQ and asked me to hop on TZ because they thought the server name sounded nice...<br>
<br>
I still remember how moments after Moreth arrived in Felwithe he fell into the moat trying to follow his friends and swam around endlessly until he saw &quot;You have become better at swimming!(7)&quot; and sent my friend a tell &quot;My yellow bar is almost at 0, I'm gonna drown... bye bye...&quot;, then somehow bumped into a ledge and climbed ashore just before my stamina (luck) ran out and rejoicing at how I escaped certain death in a bottomless pond. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Soon after meeting some very friendly Elves and hours after wondering why the nice Troll I just buffed turned on me and killed me, I was introduced to the concept of PvP servers...<br>
<br>
(2) Zarknar (my second and now, only character) rose on Firiona Vie and gave me the chance to finally learn the mechanics of the game and it seemed every moment from there was a memorable one. Mostly because of the people... <br>
<br>
The most memorable would have to be assaulting the Kromdul Fort of Chalp with two good buddies when we hit our 14th season and complaining about how &quot;Taunt&quot; doesn't work until I realized I had to put a point into training it only when I was in my 16th season... Oh.. and how could I forget my first real Roleplaying experience, a little chat with Zildrax.<br>
<br>
Ah.. memories... <p><DIV align=center>
