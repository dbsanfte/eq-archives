<br>
&quot;Oliver North was the was at the center of the Iran Contra affair during the Reagan administration, his televised examination would see him reply to every question that he couldn't recall, the interragator would then direct him to physical evidence in order to jog his memory at which point he would remember only what was contained directly in the evidence.<br>
<br>
Adding a qualifier to work a technicality is no different from a lie, since Kzan is well aware of the truth when he types in the qualifier and point.&quot;<br>
<br>
It would be a lie in that sense if he had the intention of misguiding or misleading the general public.  If the phrase &quot;I don't think we've done Dain 425&quot; is making people think we did him, anyone under that misconception could easily ask a number of people (you, for one) to clarify the issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; That's nice but not relevent.<br>
<br>
I was conceding you a point you said this wasn't a lie and on this one I agree with you. How is agreeing with you on whether or not it's a lie not relevant?&quot;<br>
<br>
I was referring to the phrase: &quot;on further review this one can be chalked up to incompetence&quot;.  Kzan's competence or incompetence isn't in question here, as I'm not equipped nor of desire to debate it.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; If you were making the point that &quot;so I wouldn't really know&quot; made it a lie, why are all the extra words there?<br>
<br>
To make fun of Kzan's total lack of skill at the game playing the easiest class to 2 box on the overwhelming majority of high end encounters.&quot;<br>
<br>
I see.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; &quot;Yes he did. Kzan now states it was his opinion all along to remain a small guild&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Quote the reference please. I don't read that from his original statement.<br>
<br>
You have been banned from this EZBoard. Oops can't get the original reference, well I can, but I'm not going to. Kzan's posts on recruiting on the Fire and Fury boards, not sure if they still exist, I can assure you he always wanted more people, if Kzan states otherwise you can decide who to believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
I mean quote the reference that he &quot;now states it was his opinion all along to remain a small guild&quot;.  I know he was previously of opinion to recruit more people.<br>
<br>
&quot;The ability to create a house of cards of absurd possiblities does not equate to reasonable doubt. It's just the same trash talking no skill gimp trying to figure out how to say he's better.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't consider the apposibility that Kzan changed his opinion to be absurd.  Or were you referring to something else here?<br>
<br>
&quot;Kzan is a liar because he lies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well that's just the issue here.  I don't believe that every instance of &quot;That's a lie ---&quot; in your original statement is correct.  My statement: &quot;That Kzan holds illogical beliefs does not make him a liar. It just makes him mistaken.&quot; to which this was a response was itself a response to your statement that Fire and Fury experiencing the majority of the high-end game is illogical.  He can believe it's true even if it's not sensible, that doesn't mean he's lying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Same as a thief is one because they steal. It does not require to be continually engaged in the activity.&quot;<br>
<br>
True.  However, your original statement took his statements and said &quot;This is a lie&quot; in addition to claiming he was a liar in general.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's entirely reasonable to believe even he doesn't believe what he wrote making that another lie, regardless he is a liar.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to believe that, yes.  It's also completely reasonable to believe that he thinks Fire and Fury will experience the majority of the &quot;high-end&quot; game.<br>
<br>
&quot;Promoting World Hunger, Famine and the return of New Kids on the Block to the top of the music charts.&quot;<br>
<br>
The latter obviously being the worse of the three.<br>
<br>
&quot;&lt;I won't quote the big long thing, I think you know what you said, anyone else can click on the above link&gt;&quot;<br>
<br>
And what do you gain out of it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, full disclosure is a seperate issue. Mommy does daddy make you reach climax? Lying is wrong, full disclosure isn't warranted in that situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
I wasn't differentiating &quot;lying&quot; and &quot;full disclosure&quot;, so thank you for the clarification.<br>
<br>
&quot; If you're going to answer a question answering with lies is so rarely productive in the long term that it's an in-advisable course of action. &quot;<br>
<br>
I certainly agree to that.<br>
<br>
&quot;&gt;&gt; If I was an undercover cop and had to disguise and a criminal (say, car theft) in order to arrest people, would I be immoral?<br>
<br>
It would be illegal in my country if you lied answering a direct question which would result in the the criminals going free regardless of your undercover work. Police are held to a higher standard and face greater scrutiny.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
That's not what I asked.  Would it be immoral?  I don't equate &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; for numerous reasons, so let's not even bring in legality.<br>

Depending how many chanters are on that day that rate at which I rune will vary. I couldnt tell you if Dain was 425 or not and I really don't care. I also dont play everyday. Cap just recently pointed out that there was a time where I could hardly play at all. I couldnt tell you what we killed during those days because the first thing I say when I log on is &quot;heyas!&quot;.. not , &quot;So what died?&quot;<br>
<br>
The whole guild size thing can be looked at a bunch of different ways so I'll let you decide which one is accurate:<br>
<br>
1. The whole thing was just me baiting Fuvi hoping he would go off on one of his &quot;rabid dog&quot; like posts and get him punted as he was on his &quot;final warning&quot; in FnF at the time. Cuz, really, as intelligent as Fuvi is.. he's really quite easy to manipulate.<br>
<br>
2. I changed my mind from wanting a guild of 50ish raiders to a small number of hardcore raiders, then changed my mind again after a lengthy (and sometimes heated) discussion on the FnF boards. I am stubborn, but my opinion can be changed. Just ask Xoraxis!<br>
<br>
Either scenario works for me. You pick. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

It's very easy to sit there and call someone like Oliver North a liar because of the limited information that the public actually knows about the Iran-Contra Scandal, and the farcical Congressional Hearings that took place.<br>
<br>
Does anyone actually believe that Oliver North and Ronald Reagan were going to sit there and disclose the full, unadulterated truth about the inner schemings and mechanations of covert U.S. activities overseas to Joe Hamburger sitting in his easy chair at home?<br>
<br>
I hate to break it to anyone, but politicians and governments lie - because that is the nature of the game.  Lying is wrong, it's bad, it &quot;doesn't help things&quot;...however so is letting your economic and military enemies know the truth about your plans and situation.  And when you get into the world of intelligence, espionage and counter-espionage, the entire name of the game is who has the most convincing smoke and mirror show going on.<br>
<br>
There are many good folks out there who compromise their sense of moral right every day and have to lie and be &quot;scoundrels&quot; because if they don't, the safety of other good people is compromised.  Over the top?  Overly righteous?  As over the top as you being able to enjoy playing Everquest and as righteous as your freedom to slander those who make it possible.<br>

Regardless however, my discussion had nothing to do with Phewvee or Kzan, it was in response to Xethux's labelling Oliver North as a liar and scoundrel.  If you pursue the line of thinking that X person does Y bad deed therefore they are &quot;bad&quot; to everyone, then we're all guilty:<br>

Neils Bohr is the greatest contributor to mass murder of all time because of his advancements in physics - why wasn't he executed or jailed rather than receiving the Nobel Prize in 1922?  <br>
<br>
Why doesn't anyone who uses any product connected with Dow Chemical hang their head in shame or face criminal negligent prosecution or aiding and abetting a criminal act, because of the fact that Dow's plants in Mexico are governed by different enviromental laws that permit them to dump chemicals in Mexico that result in babies being born without brains in Texas and other American states?<br>

Xethux is right on point. We have a legislative branch for a reason. These people are elected by you and I to control the pursestrings of our hard earned taxes. Reagan/North and that cabal knew damn well that if they had openly approached the American people with the proposition of ' Hey Joe Taxpayer, can you lend us the money to prop up a paramilitary force to overthrow the ELECTED government of Nicuragua' we would have collectively told them to get bent. Instead they opted to smuggle drugs into our country ( now now Nancy... just say NO ) to purchase weapons for the Mullahs in Iran... yeah, that woulda gone over well with the American people. They were caught and they all denied knowing anything ( poindexter was a terrible actor, Ronald on the other hand....hmm, he was so befuddled you 'almost' believed ). Ironic isn't it that they renamed Washington Natl. airport after the guy who threw all the air-traffic controllers out on their asses ).<br>
<br>
P.S. Samm Walton is only a hero to those with no understanding of the economic impact that syphoning away mass amounts of money from a local economy and replacing it with low paying non-union jobs has. The better communities ( at least here out west ) have no Wal-Marts.<br>

Agree with you 100% on the Walmart-effect:  shop big-box, sell-out your community.  However with annual sales over $160 billion and millions of spandex and XXXXL t-shirt wearing bovinesc shoppers praising Walmart for &quot;looking out for them&quot;, I'm sure you can still see my arguement.<br>
<br>
As for Iran-Contra:  if you think that is the most immoral operation that the US has undertaken and executed, then think again.  Furthermore, if the Iran side of the operation had worked out as planned, I think the tune would have been a bit different...same with Korea...and Vietnam...  <br>
<br>
Oliver North is just an example of the duality that exists within public perception.  Look at Bill Clinton:  busted for getting gummers in the Oval Office by a barely-legal White House aide, he used every Slick-Willy trick in the book to evade prosecution and impeachment (successfully mind you), and after all is said and done, his approval rating went up?  What about he and Hillary's involvement in White Water and the Rose law firm?  How many people surrounding that fiasco died of mysterious circumstances?  But things appeared to be just fine and dandy during Clinton's administration so folks are willing to turn a semi-blind eye to everything.<br>
<br>
My point is this:  morality has very little meaning anymore and there are no moral heroes.  Self-interest and personal security override the public's overall perception of decision makers and the governing body.  If interest rates are high, unemployment is high, domestic growth is low, and the US is out there, conducting immoral operations - then folks bitch and drop their jaws in suprise and disgust.  <br>
<br>
However when economic growth is rampant, millionaires are being made overnight on bullsh*t business plans, McDonald's is cheap, and folks can laugh at Seinfeld every night, who really cares if men and women in US military garb, or behind computer screens in intelligence think tanks are killing babies or plotting political insurrections elsewhere in the world - pass me another Coors light and a bag of Doritos...it's Sunday Night Football!<br>

Yes, governments and politicians lie.  I think we all are aware of this fact.    And while I hate to hijack a thread, I must just ask the simple question:  Is it ok that governments and politicians lie?<br>
<br>
Here in the United States, we supposedly live in a democracy.  We elect our officails, and we supposedly have a system of checks and balances to make sure that none of them overstep their power.  Currently in America, we have a un-elected president pushing for a war that no other country supports with scared democrats in congress, fearful of the coming election, voting for giving King Bush the II the right to declare this war.  All the while, the american people are blinded by a whitewash of patriotism.  <br>
<br>
Ahh, democracy at work.  <br>
