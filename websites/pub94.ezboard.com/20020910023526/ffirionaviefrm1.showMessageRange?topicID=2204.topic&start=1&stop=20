Is trading with evil wrong, in the same way that grouping is?  I suspect it depends on the underlying rationale for not grouping with evil….<br>
<br>
If grouping with evil is bad because it aids the evil dude (even though it aids us, maybe even aids us more since evil is being slain), then trading with evil should be forbidden, (except maybe in cases where the evil guy is making an extremely bad deal).  <br>
<br>
If because evil and good simply can’t stand each other, then trading should be right out.<br>
<br>
If the restriction is simply because evil can't be trusted not to ninja loot, backstab, or otherwise betray those in the group, then trading is ok since the trade window prevents fraud.  But, that rationale is much weaker, and would seem to allow grouping with evil that 'could be trusted' not to act dishonorably {and nothing says villains can't have certain aspects of honor}.<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is because it seems somewhat hypocritical to trade with evil, yet not group with them.  And, I wonder if any guilds have the gumption to actually refrain from trading with evil.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, I am not well versed in the lofty discussions of good and evil, and very well may be missing the point.  If so, I humbly ask for enlightenment.  Also, if this has been thoroughly hashed out before, then a pointer to the topic would be most appreciated.<br>

<br>
The rationale he gave?  If he destroys the weapon, it won't fall into the hands of the enemy.  If he takes it and sells it...even to another Good or Neutral, then there is always the possibility that it will be used to oppose good.<br>
<br>
Should Pure Goods sell to Evils?  In my opinion, no...but then, that's just my opinion. <p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><font color="#800080">Tuppen Tangledroots

I have had many friends who did, and in my younger days have accepted things from those friends.  I have learned better since I am older and more experienced.  These days, if something I need can only be obtained from evils (other than slaying them as they deserve) then I will do without it.<br>
<br>
OOC:  If your character is against grouping with those of evil alignment for moral reasons, then they should also be unwilling to trade with them.  I am also unwilling to do that which I would consider evil in order to gain faction with an evil group to finish a quest of some kind.  If I have to hurt my good faction, then it is a quest that I will do without.  Occasionally, I have been giving things, being unaware of where they come from.  When I become aware of their origins, they have usually been turned into the Temple to be destroyed or cleansed as necessary.  For me, the roleplay is much more important than the gameplay.<br>

<br>
Is it possible to justify trade between good and evil folk? Im sure it is, when you reduce such activities to individuals with individual agendas. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But in general, it seems wrong that the two sides would engage in extensive trading. War is war, after all; when nations are at war, they dont trade with each other, although individuals may chose to step outside the conflict and do so.<br>
<br>
Im interested in seeing how other folk justify it. As a neutral with tendencies toward the light, I might trade with both sides, but would be more comfortable supplying or accepting gear from lightbringers, provided there was a balance between light and dark. If there was a serious imbalance, I would tend toward supplying the lesser of the sides.<br>

<br>
Who justifies it?  In my view, trading is OOC for the most part, with the exception of those that try to stay in character for it.  While I can appreciate the above players that are destroying evil-only weapons, I have a hard time with it, especially if it's a rare drop that I know some player can use.  With the small population and limited supplies of items on the server to begin with, I can't justify destroying something someone else can use simply because they are of different alignment.  <br>
<br>
However, that's simply my view, and I support those that decide to stay in-character with trades.  I just choose not to for myself. <p><br> Jaelyn DiMathe<br>

From an IC perspective, if you're maintaining an objective good/evil stance, you should horribly gouge evils on any deal (so as to strengthen good, but there are OOC issues to this), refuse to trade with them altogether, or, as someone else mentioned, refuse to trade with them and destroy any item you get that might be of use to them. After all, you don't want to support evil.<br>
<br>
Really, I'd say that trading is an IC activity. It's quite possible to establish an IC trading company, roleplay changing prices based on haggling or the target's reputation/alignment/race, etc.<br>

This isn't a PvP server though. We're here to have fun. I can't imagine me destroying something that only a paladin could use would be any kind of fun for a paladin. Especially if it was something he needed and had been looking for.. camps in this game are brutal enough. <br>
<br>
The way I look at this: roleplay all you like, but realize there's a real person on the end of a computer for every single toon in the game. That person might really like to have what now posses. Do you really want to destroy it in the name of &quot;roleplay&quot;?<br>

<br>
Some quests on this server require you to do things that perhaps your character just wouldn't do. Maybe you don't want to kill faeries, because you are a decent and holy sort?<br>
<br>
Well, a &quot;trade&quot; with an evil who does kill the fae is one way around it. Perhaps you /duel and &quot;loot&quot; the faerie bits you need from his cold dead hands, while the stealthy evil rogue &quot;steals&quot; the item he needs (but doesn't want the faction hits for) during the distraction of battle. The game mechanic used is the trade window.<br>
<br>
I agree with the whole extensive trade between goods and evils being rather silly. I also have a smidgen of pity in my heart for people who find creative ways around some of the really idiotic quest designs in this game. So I guess I think it is rather jarring (in roleplay terms) in general, but some instances fit storylines well - kind of like cross-alignment grouping.<br>

Iksar are equally KOS in Oggok with the evil ogres as they are with the Bane brothers in Qeynos.  Iksar have no outposts outside of Kunark, and I find their isolationism similar to Pre-20th Century Japanese culture in that respect.  So if you wanna be anti-Iksar, that's fine and don't trade with lizards becuase you don't like the thought of luggage kicking your butt... but don't label Iksar evil becuase they are not.<br>

Good people cant go around accepting, or even *paying* for items that come from a evil, that was traded to a good person, that was traded to a friend, that was givin to your guild could you now? <p>

(Now, I could have just said &quot;he's a gnome -- I can buy from him.&quot; But the chap showed up in a black robe carrying a scythe. Not much doubt to his profession...)<br>
<br>
I figure there are (at least) two *equally valid* ways to roleplay the good/evil thing, and I sure as hell don't want to defend or debate either (so please please pretty please don't flame me too badly). <br>
<br>
The first is along race lines: this is sword and sorcery fantasy, where there is Good and Evil. Where races are precisely what they should be, good, evil, chaotic, lawful, whatever. They just ARE, and one should roleplay accordingly. <br>
<br>
The other way is to play tabula rasa, and see folks as individuals. Lest, he's never met an ogre before. Met one troll, who, while he did look a bit... hungry... was extremely polite and chatty rather than combative. He has also met a LOT of snobby, greedy, and /or just plain rude wood elves. And a few very sweet ones as well. (Never met a barbarian he didn't like, though. For the record.)<br>
<br>
Anyway -- Lest's a half-breed outcast loner with quite a bit of self-loathing going on. He's not in any position to judge anyone, so he takes each person as they are. If you have something he needs or he has something you need, he'll trade with anyone once -- he wants to learn your name, and the value of your soul. <br>
<br>
Plus it's honestly the only way the poor bastard gets to meet new people most of the time anyway. <br>
<br>
Just my, um, 4 coppers. Sorry for rambling. <br>

I ain't here ta pour coin in some lightlover's pouch. I ain't here ta make their life easy cause they can bribe me wit' platinum,neither.<br>

Which happens ta be why I ain't a Leaguer no more-cause I won't be part of a group that makes em fat an' happy.<br>
<br>
There ain't nothin' a gods-fearin' follower of t'dark gods needs from one who don't follow em-aside from their deaths.<br>
 <br>
Anyone who sayin otherwise is putting their greed ahead o' their faith-an' I say it goes fer almost any who ain't godless heathens. Ya enrich t'followers of a god,ya increase that god's power on Norrath by empowerin' their followers.<br>
 <br>
I burn Tunarean wood-prayers when I find em. Iffen I find any thing sacred ta lightlovin' gods,it's broken an' ashes when I'm done with it-fer it's cleansin Norrath of weakness. An' any fool that gets his hands on somethin' sacred ta MY god that doesn't deserves what he gets iffen I get it soon after,if he ain't faithful ta t'right gods.<br>
 <br>
Tradin' with infidels means yer just makin' it worse fer yer people an' yer god ta do what they desire in Norrath. T'paladin ya sell to today is going ta' be &quot;cleansing Norrath&quot; wit' yer help tomorrow. That druid ya sold somethin' to will be reavin' and banditry in Nektulos that much easier thanks ta yer trades.<br>

Trying to inspire fear in your enemies is somthing pretty much anybody who fights does, Iksar merely focus and pride themselves on it. Evil does not adequetly describe Iksar. Warlike, cruel, harsh, yes, evil, no. I've argued for 5+ hours straight with people that Iksar are not evil, I simply do not believe they are. They are too honorble and selfless. There is alot more to the Iksar then just a bunch of lizards who run around saying &quot;Fear me!&quot;. However, since I don't wish to jack the thread, you could read probably one of the better discussions on the subject here:<br>

When i make a trade with a light race i make very very sure to send a chat tell letting them know its being done completely ooc. If you let em know its ooc then it can fall outside of your RP. This kept in mind that i will only make sales/trades/buys in the bazaar, i refuse to auction outside of city zones. That is a breach in RP since morg is kinda seclusive.<br>
I do prefer to deal with evils though, thanks tallonar for my nice new adamantite chainmail, its going to serve me well <p><center><img src=http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL22/566694/847606/10715197.ptp.gif >

I personally don't trade, at least didn't so far, don't know whether I will in future. I only give items and accept items from others (only those who are nice to me, of course), well, that's also sort of trade. <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>
