<br>
You don't actually tell us what happened. Maybe you did camp-steal?<br>
<br>
If he was there first then effectively that room is a solo or at best duo camp, sharing it is a complete waste of time. I have been there myself and had people come in, see me and then just start killing. I felt pretty annoyed about it at the time.<br>
<br>
Of course if you were there first then the same logic applies. <br>
<br>
From accounts elsewhere this guy certainly sounds like a griefer but if you are going to flame him at least give the facts of what happened.<br>
<br>
The fact that it was you asking to share sounds as if you arrived to find the room camped, asked to share and when refused, you started killing anyway. If this isn't the case then post what happened, otherwise you are just jumping on the bandwagon.<br>
<br>
Not trying to be hard on you. If this guy is a griefer then we need to know about it. Yes &quot;there are no camps&quot; and if a Guide was called they would have made you share, and if 6 more people arrived and petitioned they would have made you all share until everyone had one needlite every 20 mins to get exp from <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The point is that if you give respect then somewhere down the road it comes back to you. This applies to whoever was in the wrong here, I am making no judgements.<br>

And Yeah you'd better abandon your thread Tinysugar, because i found it and i posted the logs of that evening's encounter as well. Here you go Gowt, I'll make good on my promise, here are the logs.<br>

In both of the cases that i've been complained baout, i've been exaggerated about, if not outright lied about. If you have a complaint against me, make it a valid one. I do not, nor do I desire to, get along with everyone on this server. However, I do take my reputation seriously. For that reason I keep meticulous logs and sort them by days. I didn't post those logs about Gowt originally because I would just as soon have forgotten about it and gone about my business, he would have ruined his own reputation entirely without my help. If you desire to attack me, or my character, make sure you come with some real ammunition, so far the immature children of the server seem to just be shooting blanks. In fact, i think that anyone with a head on their shoulders will very quickly see the common bond that Gowt, Tinysugar, and Leawen share. I do not tolerate troublemakers.<br>

Wimbus S'corpse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mylodifv>MylodiFV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.monstersinmotion.com/tv/montyrabbitplushtn.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slayer of Bunnies</span><br>  Posts: 427<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/02 7:07:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1976.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wimbus!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>[Fri Nov 29 18:30:28 2002] You tell market:1, '32 necro lfg'<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

As an aside, I learned from experience that when in a camp which is semi-popular (as Echo Caverns is), when someone shows up wanting to hunt the same thing I am, the best way to start is by asking them if they want to group. *shrug*<br>

Wimbus, FYI .. there is one situation where a nearly fully popped room *can* be camped (though not in the case highlighted in this thread).<br>
AoE groups.  My guild do AoE groups in Guk doing lord/frenzy etc.  With AoE you want to pull large amounts of mobs at once.  This often means pulling an entire section of your zone, killing it, pulling another section, killing it .. waiting for a repop to give you enough mobs to justify an AoE pull, killing it all again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bendieq>BendiEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/02 8:30:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1976.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> Actually there are several mistakes about camps being made here. Camps are a courtesy, but they have some pretty hardcore delimiters. Killstealing is when someone kills a mob after it has aggroed on you first.... and thats all killstealing is. Killstealing is NOT taking a mob from your camp. <br>
<br>
Camps are certain static spawns/rooms. You cannot camp an entire area of a zone - and it doesn't matter if you are in an AoE group. Just because you are capable of killing 3 rooms, or 3 named in an area, that doesn't mean you have camp rights to all 3. You have camp rights to one, and one only. If someone asks for one, you got to give it up. This most certainly includes area effect groups - and if giving up even one of the sub camps makes an AoE group non viable... well, thats life, you don't get to hog a whole area simply because you can. <br>
<br>
If you leave a camp, you lose the camp. If it reaches full spawn, its not your camp anymore. <br>
<br>
That said, I'm *strongly* suspicious of anyone who acts like Wimbus did in the above post - he was being an ass. He was in the right, but he was being an ass. Though at 32, there are better areas for him to be hunting (mind you, same goes for the mid 20's as well). <br>

<br>
As has already been stated - if you leave a camp your claim is gone (fighting in the hallway outside a room is not leaving a camp - you are still fighting in a general area and some camps have pull spots or roamers that you can pull to supplement yourself). If you are AFK and the camp is at full spawn, your camp is gone. If you are sitting there preparing to break and someone leapfrogs you, that is rude and I will ask them to move on before I get nasty. KSing is not acceptable in any case. If you see someone in the area, send them a tell asking if they claim the camp. Just taking it is rude. It's also rude to automatically threaten someone and berate them for campstealing and KSing without trying to work out a compromise. <p>Vulrath Vadrigaar<br>

<br>
if there's a full spawn, at that point I consider it open. I dont care that you'll kill it &quot;as soon as I med up&quot; ... it's FULL!<br>
<br>
AoE groups are tough. In general they all need to be pretty careful, but if they are actually clearing all 3 of their &quot;sections&quot; before the first section respawns, fine. But if they are killing slowly, I'd ask for a little piece... but not make a big fuss if they dont want to. Camps dont exactly come prelabelled, and what one person believes is a camp is mostly abitrary. As long as you CLEAR it all, it's your camp.<br>
<br>
If you are not clearing it all, please share =P<br>

<br>
Don't mean to complicate the issue here but every situation is unique - that's why we play an online INTERACTIVE game - because we can interact with other players and find a solution. The idea of camps began long ago before you and I and most people were playing this game. They were a set of loose &quot;community rules&quot; that people held to so that there was some order in the community. VI tried to destroy the idea of camping with the PnP but it endured because the players recognized the need to camp and the need for order. In time, even SOE came around to the point of recognizing the need to camp but not officially accepting the idea of one person or group monopolizing the spawns in a certain area. So we are at the present where camps are generally respected - with some people to a lesser or greater degree - and the big flames you see are mainly bred from misunderstanding and unwillingness to cooperate with a lot of ego and temper thrown in as kindling.<br>
<br>
More than respecting camps, respect your fellow players. Most of them are not out to screw you over. If you only know one place to gain XP for your level range, do more research and look around - I have never been at a point where I don't have at least 3-4 options for good solo XP. It probably took them longer arguing about the whole fiasco than it would for one to leave and relocate somewhere else and there is all the hurt feeling in the process.<br>
<br>
Bald, most AoE groups like to find some out-of-the-way place where people don't hunt often and there are lots of things to pull all at once. Trying to do an AOE group in a traditionally highly populated zone with generally respected camps is just lining yourself up for confrontation. You are fine as long as noone is there, but when someone calls a camp check and you shout &quot;Lord/AM/Hand/FG/Sentinel/Ritualist&quot; expect someone to say &quot;Which one? You listed 4 camps there.&quot; Monololizing 4 camps (or even 2) with an AOE group in a loot-oriented zone is disrespectful to the normal players who would be happy with just 1 camp. I'm sure you would probably find a way to work it out with someone to share 1 camp instead of just replying, &quot;AOE groups always monopolize areas and camps - deal with it&quot; becuse I generally think you and the people you play with respect other players. <p>Vulrath Vadrigaar<br>

  Lguk is not always camped.  Maybe that was a bad example as it is kind of camped US time (I'm a Brit, UK time its often quite empty).  My point is, if you have been AoE'ing a zone for a few hours and clearing the zone, why move for one person (who can farm elsewhere anyway).<br>
<br>
  Respect is a 2 way thing.  If I see an AoE group I will NOT say 'I am taking one of your camp areas because I am soloing, it is my right'.  Also, if I am AoE'ing an area, do not try to encroach on my camp and claim a section for your own.  It is plain rude if I am keeping all mobs dead (except waiting for the one minute it takes an area to respawn fully).<br>
<br>
   With regards to normal camps, hell I'll always another area than mess around with another groups pulls.  I doubt many of this board have even met me in game ...
