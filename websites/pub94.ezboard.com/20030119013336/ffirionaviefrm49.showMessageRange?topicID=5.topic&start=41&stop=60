Not saying that happened on the fnf boards but i can see how that would piss someone off and come here to *show off FnF's dirty panties*<br>
<br>
Alot of us have been playing this game for 3 years+ and have left servers cause some stupid guild woke the sleeper for selfish reasons so to many it will always be a touchy subject of seeing another server turning into a loot farm hell.Who the hell cares if 4-5 or every dam guild has the drops from ToV wont make my dick bigger or smaller.But like its said theres 3 sides to every story and im sure theres abit of truth to it.When the top guild has members leaving that have been around for very very long time and alot of people know and like its hard to take the word of someone whos been apart of the guild for say a few months compared to say 6.<br>
<br>
I would take Kzan's word over virens word cause hes been in FnF for way way longer and ive known him longer its just the way its goes with me /shrug <p>Attuma Evilknight

<br>
&quot;Of course it's not about the loot, which means waking Sleeper is being done for the fun of depriving other people of one of the most enjoyable zones in the game and some of the most prestigious and desired items, and to think I thought I was an @sshole.&quot;<br>
<br>
It clearly does not deprive them of some of the most prestigious and desired items, and as you pointed out in that thread it happens to give them the opportunity for superior items.  Superior items which can be obtained with one group as opposed to the 9-11 minimum required for warders.<br>
<br>
As for the enjoyability of the zone, the zone would still be there for people, just 4 mobs would not.  If people's enjoyment of this game hinges on the killing of those 4 mobs then I'm a tad baffled.<br>

<br>
We cannot give a definite answer on whether or not the sleeper is going to be woken because the future is hard to predict.<br>
<br>
Fuvi's quote is accurate, I think he copied and pasted it, though I'd have to double check to be sure.  Bako did say he intended to wake the sleeper.  His position on this could change if he is proposed with new evidence or rethinks his old evidence.<br>
<br>
You all act like waking the sleeper is like killing your dog.  If you feel this strongly about it then you may want to start a thread about why or why not we want the sleeper awoken on Firiona Vie, and I'm sure Resolution and Fire and Fury leadership will read it and take it into consideration.<br>
<br>
I personally don't see the horror in waking the sleeper.  I personally think it would be fun to see the dude rampage the world.  My thoughts and feelings don't really have any bearing on what either guild does, though.<br>

I know the truth Kzan. The truth is this: without Fuvi's knowledge of the game your guild would still be raiding plane of hate. He contributed more than anyone else in your guild. If the trend was the same at the point I stopped reading FaF's member's boards, Fuvi was removed for speaking his mind, and being honest, unlike the rest of you who either (a) have no clue or (b) are too concerned about your loot income to be honest. <br>
To other guilds, apart from the obvious benefits of a wizard with a whole lot of AA, you won't find someone who is at more raids, who puts in more, who knows more about the game, than Fuvi. If you see him apply, snap him up pronto, you are lucky as hell.<br>

It was about agreements being broken. Doesn't matter if it was ST or a box of donuts. My guild was promised the chance to loot every other donut from that box and FnF started grabbing them as fast as they could because they got there first. It was also not the first agreement broken by the same FnF officers. Please do not forget VS.<br>
<br>
And the reason why Reso would never agree to sharing the first brood with FnF is because the more keys FnF got the greater the chance they they would have to wake the sleeper. Reso is a large guild and it is my intention on getting all of our members experience the zone. ST without the warders is pretty dull IMHO, but the warders are some very fun fights. Everybody who wants and is capable should have the chance to experience it.<br>

<br>
I would also like to say that Fuvi is very strong willed and stubborn. He had his beliefs and was very vocal about expressing them reguardless of what everyone else thought. He has fought tooth and nail with guild leadership over one issue or another for as long as I have been a member. One of such issues was the a discussion that had come up many times about weather or not we would attempt to wake the sleeper when we became able to. It is a subject that had come up often in our private forums, and not suprisingly he was the one to initiate the topic most of the time. The stance of the guilds leadership as well as the stance of the general population of the guild has changed frequently, it is not an easy topic to discuss without taking alot of things into consideration. Often times someone would make a point or provide a good arguement and everyone's opinions would sway one way or another. Fuvi's post is directly from one of the guilds private forums where we have had these discussions. It is a outdated quote and really has no bearing on what we may or may not do should the time come where actually waking the sleeper becomes an option.<br>
<br>
The dynamic of the guild has changed alot recently, we would not have been able to wake the sleeper a week or two ago, and with recent changes in the guild we are even even less able. We have lost some good people recently for many varied reason, and it so happens that among those people were some of the very people that felt that the sleeper should be woken as soon as we were able. I would seriously doubt that with Fuvi being gone that the issue will come up much (thank god) we are a long ways away from having all we need from the warders, and even farther from being able to kill the 4th warder and wake the big guy. By the time the guild is (1) happy with recieving all the drops that everyone wants from ST, and (2) are actually able to be able to kill the 4th warder. I am sure the dynamic of the guild and the feelings of the people within it will have changed substantially from what it is right now. <br>
<br>
I dont agree with Fuvi posting stuff from a private forum, especially since he knows that that we are nowhere close to having it even be a possibility. I think that he wanted to lash out at the leadership of the guild since he must feel very mad and very hurt. I cant say as I can blame him much, he was a very central part of the guild, but the fact remains he and the leadership of the guild had issues that were not likely to be solved and he was removed. <br>
<br>
I will certainly miss Fuvi, and I really hope that he knows why I have to post this and understands that I hold no ill will against him even tho I dont agree with his posting things that are not an accurate representation of the current facts in a public forum. <br>
<br>
Good luck Fuvi, I hope to see you again soon.<br>

I have not forgotten VS.  Actually, I wasn't even in the guild when it happened, and I don't know the details.  What I do know is that everyone in your guild thinks it is our fault, and everyone in my guild thinks it is your fault.<br>
<br>
I would disagree with any rotation on any mob because I know how it is going to end.  Someone is going to feel that the other party broke the agreement, and everyone in that guil is going to feel that it is the other guild's fault, and everyone in the other guild is going to feel that it is that guild's fault.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, I think these things occur because of miscommunication.  One man once said &quot;Communication is key&quot; and was a wise man in doing so.  <br>
<br>
Regardless, my point still stands; whether it was your intention or not, the effect of your post was to add to the controversy around Sleeper's Tomb.<br>

<br>
<br>
What fuvi posted was 100% correct, I typed those words. and Many more actually.<br>
<br>
What is discussed on FnF private forums is just that... Private... and I am just sicked that moderators let them stay. <br>
<br>
It was a long discussion, many many post, 4 pages long or more I believe. The Quote he took was taken out of context.. It was posted as a I wish post.. I wish... this was over cause I am sick of people making such a big deal over 1 zone, that VI put so much importance on 1 zone. etc etc. I was sick of the argueing and bitching my members were making over one posable event... Thats why i typed the words I did.. <br>
<br>
I mean as of now I am not even close to being able to kill the 4th warder.. So its a non issue atm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for you Sliver.. I would like your mailing adress to send you some cash so you can buy a clue. Sure Fuvi is a very knowledgable person when it comes to EQ. But its people like Ramel, Rosiel, Kurley, Humle and Many others and Their knowledge of the game, Not just one man.. sure he had a part, but nothing compared to some. You seem to think you know alot... for someone who left the server and this guild over 5 months ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
I could copy and paste many Quotes that fuvi has made. Personal attacks on Players lives... And toons, as well as the FV community and some people who he has come and defended him on this post. But he said those things in private, on a private forum. I dont think its nessesary to post peoples private thoughts.<br>
<br>
You know I wasnt even gona post here, because this had no right to be here.... But I knew people would stick their nose in and say &quot;by saying nothing you are just admitting guilt&quot; &quot;by not denying it you are just guilty&quot; &quot;lets all hug poor fuvi, because he is a victim and a hero to the FV community for what he has done&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1208<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 1:47:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=55>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> ok, first off....<br>

<br>
I don't comment on sleeper much except what bako basically said, I have said before. If you aren't in the zone making the decisions, your opinion has little bearing and amounts to little more than frustrated whining about how you won't get some specific loot.<br>
<br>
You really can't cry foul when you're not even in the same zone. You really can't expect the populace of FV to never waken the sleeper.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What I'd ask, and what I'd really like to see... If the people who finally do wake it, make a concerted, educated, genuine attempt at waking it for the purpose of killing it. Of course you can't...at least make it a good show like you tried. But again, I actually had the rare opportunity to choose to not be in ST on this server, so I'm not there, so.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fuvi>Fuvi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 2:30:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Hey Kzan and Veloxia you can apologize now for calling me a liar.  Email me at bryanmck@sympatico.ca if you're too shy to post your heartfelt apologies in public.<br>
<br>
Close to the truth Bako, it wasn't an I wish, but thanks for bringing it up here.  I realize you did this because you knew 40 people wouldn't keep a secret, but atleast you took the time to post.  WWX beat you to it but it's the thought that counts.<br>
<br>
And the words that worry me &quot;I&quot; am not even close, that's why people pursue the &quot;accomplishment&quot; because I woke the Sleeper.  Well the accomplishment is killing Ventani, I tried to tell you how to do it, but you didn't listen, I'm shocked.<br>
<br>
Please copy and paste all you want, I feel accountable for my actions and words.  Sometimes even I change my mind, shocking but true, but I have no problems with bringing anything up because I'm honest and don't want everyone to like me, I just want people to trust me.<br>
<br>
That's why your post means a lot to me, because you are nothing without trust and you let everyone know they could trust me, you let everyone know that anything Kzan and Veloxia post means nothing.  Veloxia I didn't have any issues with before she called me a liar 20 times in this thread, but for Lyns and Gore and all the people I don't know about thanks for making sure everyone knows about Kzan.<br>
<br>
I'm not a hero, I'm an @sshole.  This is an important issue to me for reasons much like Rollen described and also because people who want to Wake the Sleeper are often people looking to go out with a bang, I didn't want to be in a guild with people with one foot off the server, although that side of it was taken care of before I posted here.<br>
<br>
Killing Warders is not a big deal, the point is why would players remove content from other players.  The ironic timing of patch rumors I'm hearing cause me endless amusement though. :-)<br>
<br>
I never said I could stop you from Waking the Sleeper, I would have helped you depending on some timing, had you gone into the zone after Reso with only 4th up I would have de-guilded, but if you went for 4th with 2nd up I would have helped kill the hardest mob you would get your Shrouds and then pop 2nd without me.  I never said this thread could stop you from killing Warders, Zsuz even encouraged you, but it's the best I can do, and I always do my best. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwitherweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Witherweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 2:37:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> &quot;Killing Warders is not a big deal, the point is why would players remove content from other players.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're also adding content to other players.  You're actually letting them get superior gear with a fraction of the raiding force.<br>
<br>
At least that was your argument against waking the sleeper.<br>
