It was the posting of logfile in defense of your outrage that made your entire approach OOC to me. <br>

Many people, perfectly sane and perfectly capable of seperating character from real self, refer to their character in 1st person.  Only those who know you intimately (i.e. your friends) would know that you do not.  To insist that strangers automatically read your mind and figure this out without any clue whatsoever is really narrowminded.<br>

*shakes head in weary contempt at Oumen* Another naive young fool poisoning our lands with the sectarian hatred and bigotry his pompous teachers have no doubt stuffed him with. Perhaps one day he'll work it out - that it's all about vested interests, that the rulers of Paneel and Erudin promote their tedious Gods and their ideology in order to justify their never ending pissing contest with each other... Both cities are as bad as each other - full of self-rightous pricks like this.<br>

Perhaps one day he'll work it out. On the other hand - he is a Shadowknight.

I have several any many guilds that would back me up that I am a roleplayer. And yes, I understand that the rudeness was to my character, not myself (the player), which is the context I was taking it in. I understand characters can range from the perfect angel to the royal bitch and many, many steps in between. But what is the limit to roleplaying rudeness before it becomes to be too much? As Sabrosia said, one person's limit for rudeness is different from the next. It all depends on who you talk to. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
At what point does RP'ed rudeness become too much?<br>
<br>
There is no point that it becomes too much. Unless you have spoken to this person, told them OOCly that the RP makes you uncomfortable and to please tone it down if you wish to RP together in the future, then this person did nothing wrong and is allowed to be as rude as they want.<br>
<br>
The only thing this person did, uninitiated was to give you a rude gesture -- which you could of ignored. You chose to send this person tells and though I am almost always OOC in tells, most of the rest of you are not, and RP unless you have your OOC in bubbles.<br>
<br>
I have roleplayed on some games, and with some types of characters that are not the nicest of characters. You cannot tell someone how to RP your character, you can only tell them how you feel about their RP and make requests and suggestions. If you do not like their RP, or they cannot accomodate your request, then you do not have to interact with them.<br>
<br>
For instance (Example forthcoming).<br>
<br>
I played a black spiral dancer on a mush called Viels of Darkness. A character who did not know I was BSD, and thus an evil werewolf, decided that he would attempt to rape my character IC. This of course calls for a Timestop -- where a storyteller must judge the scene, to make sure that we follow rules and do rolls appopriately and that its all worked out fairly. He wants to rape me. I do not want to be raped. I want to rip off his head, eviscerate him, and eat his guts while he's still alive. Er, he does't know this last part yet of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Timestop commences (If he had won with being able to rape me, naturally I could of asked to Fade to Black. Ie: To say this event occured, but not to have to RP it).<br>
<br>
The poor fellow didn't get what he wanted. My character frenzied and became a Garou, an evil, vicious garou that proceeded to hamstring him, slice open his belly, taunt him, and start pulling his guts out inch by inch and to eat through them while he was still living. Well, he got all sore about it, told me I sucked as a role-player, and didn't want to RP anymore. But it was too late, he was dead now anyhow, and we agreed to Fade to Black on the details of his death as well.<br>
(Sometimes its funny how people react when the tables are turned on them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is this: People decide how their character's personality is going to be. It is not fair for anyone to tell them they can't be like that, just because you may not able to handle the interactions between you and them, and feel that you must be able to do so in order to be happy. Too bad. If you don't like it. Don't interact with the person. You could of stopped paging this person if you had wanted to. I really don't think he was being a bad sort at all. He was RPing, and you never did tell him you didn't like that kind of RP (In any case, you could of stopped sending him tells).<br>
<br>
It can't be happy fun RP all the time. Some of my most interesting RP is with people who try to belittle me. I admit, it does feel bad, and it sucks, and often you feel like you don't come out ahead in these situations either, part of that is because one of you cares, and the other one doesn't get phased by stuff like that and to them its just RP, their character, and not them. Because you weren't especially rude to this guy back, no one knows if he would of reacted in a way that indicates he can't handle being intimidated. But one thing is clear is that Annahun isn't comfortable with RP'ed rudeness and thats -ok-. Just learn when to back off and cut your losses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
There are many people who DO like this kind of conflict interaction and can keep it seperate from themselves and not get hurt by it. But there's nothing wrong either with not being able to. I still get hurt, pissed off, upset, or whatever have you when I'm having some difficult conflict RP and I'm the one who looks consistantly bad :P, thing is, ooc communication in these situations is important. Talk ooc if you feel bad. I always let the person I'm belittling in RP know that its nothing personal, its just RP. Or  if its the other way around I ask: Um hey, you don't have an OOC problem with me right, this is just RP? I'm not feeling too good about it and I just want to make sure there's nothing going wrong here.<br>
<br>
Handling it either way, if you're unsure, is a great solution and works about 90 % of the time for me. It saves a lot of trouble in the long run Annahun, I promise, and you'll feel better later too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
