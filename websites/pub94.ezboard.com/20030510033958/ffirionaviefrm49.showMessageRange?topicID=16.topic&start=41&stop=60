This thread has been very entertaining. I didn't realize there were so many people who have never taken a basic economics course.<br>
<br>
For example...<br>
<br>
Kreelos:<br>
<br>
--Azhrei:<br>
<br>
--&quot;Historically/RL, the only time a product is sold at an obscene profit margin, is when that product is a monopoly.&quot;<br>
<br>
--Really? So CDs sell for $1 at my local store? Yahoo!<br>
<br>
<br>
I went to amazon.com and found this:<br>
<br>
--Office Depot CD-RW With Jewel Cases, 700MB/80 Minutes, 1x-4x, Pack Of 12<br>
<br>
-- Office Depot Price: $14.99 <br>
<br>
not quite $1 each, but close.<br>
<br>
So stop paying $16 each and tell those singers and record companies that they don't have a monopoly anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1170<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/13/02 12:19:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hahaha</span><hr size=1> It took me about 4 hours to go from 0 pottery skill to 188.<br>

<br>
1) Jewelcraft has a low markup because it is far and away the easiest one to grandmaster.  To be a GM jeweler is nothing more than pp.  I could start a twink right now and be a GM jeweler in a couple hours.  Tailoring, Pottery, Smithing take loads more money and loads more time... Hence the markup.<br>
<br>
It's like going to going to school... You spend the time for that PHD you expect to paid better in the end.<br>
<br>
2) The Earing is never going to drop significantly in price.  I can still sell them easily for 15k and I highly doubt that will ever change until simply no one wants earings anymore.<br>
<br>
Reasons for this are simple.  The materials are a PAIN to get and you are not going to see people &quot;progressing&quot; to the level of tradeskills needed.  Robes are a pain.  Sickels are just HARD.  At 250 smithing I am lucky if I succeed on half the sickels I try.<br>
<br>
Point is the materials to make the earing have already dropped to a point where they aren't going to get any cheaper.  Thus the people who are making the earings are already selling at the minimum profit margin they are willing to except.<br>

Basically a lot of these are a TON easier than you make them out to be, but taken in total it's a pretty fair pain the ass.  And, the one hugely tedious aspect that keeps me from doing it is the basic skill-up work.  Gawd, I can't imagine anything more boring than skilling up a trade.  Even a quick and cheap one to GM like Pottery is dull dull dull. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/13/02 7:46:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm, there are some big holes in a few of these</span><hr size=1> &quot;2.

Assuming you survive the trip.<br>

&quot;4. You mean you don't have your own personal druid? I thought everyone on FV was issued one at creation.&quot;<br>

No, I don't.  I prefer not to impose on others.  <br>

I don't know how to magically press a button every 90 seconds without being there.<br>

Trust me it's tedious, even if I did work fishing while I was there.  I went through over 180 bait while I tried to get oak.<br>

Not even worth responding to the rest of that, Zuzu and Bjond already did a fine job.<br>
<br>
If people understood that you can spend a little bit of time gathering components, and get an Earring of Solstice for under 5k in materials, I can guarantee there would be more people doing the quest on their own.  Is it &quot;worth&quot; 20k+?   Maybe to you.   The value is entirely determined by each individual who desires it.  Note:  Go here if you want info on the quest..  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm">www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If an item existed, that was made with 5 copper worth of storebought materials, and resulted in an item that was 125 to all stats/resists/hp/mana/ac with an effect that combines FT10 and 80 hp/tick regen, how much are you going to charge considering its &quot;value&quot;?  Nuff said.<br>

I am not a jeweler.  I have never been a jeweler.  I worked up my JC skill to make star ruby steins (they require 150 JC skill to avoid failures) but I have NEVER sold jewelery items... except one time, when I sold off my two old 6 dex 6 str rings for I believe 400pp each.  That price is not arbitrary... it's the price Coriolis charged me to make them.  So, um, get your facts straight before you flame.   And again, go to other servers and check around for the price on golden diety idols.  Especially non-tunare golden diety idols.  They're 1500pp from me, here.  Go ahead, check a few servers, see what they say.  I'll give you a hint... Solosek Ro averages at 4kpp.<br>
<br>
Cobra... I never said what the average for opal steins is, but it's generally at or below cost on most servers now.  Your experience was pretty common.  This is from people with high level characters who skill up randomly on a skill, then sell below cost with an alt.<br>
<br>
And to the person who said what if you use the opal stein for buying food and water... then don't buy one!  The vast majority of people who buy them, over time, will gain a lot of money.  But I always told bards not to buy them (they don't work with instruments and bards usually have enough charisma on other gear for their charming).  I mean, your arguement is like saying crystal spider fangs should be worth 50pp cause that's all they're good for if you're an enchanter and your melee skills stink.  Please.  But the vast majority of people will at some point hunt in Sebilis OR Seafuries in OOT OR do a tradeskill OR fight in a plain OR kill giants in Kunark... something involving large money transactions with vendors, and the steins pay off very fast.  So why begrudge the maker of the stien 200pp that they made, when you made back far more?  Which you will, unless you never level above 20, never sell or buy anything from a vendor, or some such.<br>
<br>
And to Chase... brewing ain't my buisiness, so I'm not saying this as someone you're competeing with... but please don't get frustrated and kill the market.  Really.  It only comes back to hurt you in the end.  Sometimes you have to lower your price, some times you have to talk to someone, sometimes the person won't listen and only wants to sell their stuff for any price, no matter what.  Best solution to the last situation is to lower your price right along with them when you know they're on... when they get below cost, buy their entire supply and go back to their old price.  Works like a charm.  Heh.  <br>

<br>
Huh?  This does not make sense to me.  I don't port and I've made Celestial essences.  You know how long it took me?  Hrmm... like maybe 20min to gather all the pieces.  And that includes running to a zone connectes to SH to get a Mortar and Pestal.  All the Words and Runes I used in it I bought from merchants in SH and the Bazaar.<br>
<br>
Don't see how this is complicated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh and Chase... I plan on getting my corking device not just for getting my skill up, but also because it's needed for my eventual GM Trohpy.  That and the bags full of already prepped stuff for things needing it.<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Azhrei:  Average cost on other servers isn't 1500, it's 3k.<br>
<br>
So, if we want to run the costs out, asuming perfect success rate (which lowballing the cost)...<br>
<br>
Average Server:  300pp Per Combine + 1020pp per firing = 1320 per idol.  Average price is 3k, so total profit to maker is 1680pp, roughly.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie:  300pp Per Combine + 120pp per Firing - 420pp per Idol.  Average price is 1500pp, total profit to the maker is 1080pp.  <br>
<br>
So on golden tunare idols, on this server you save 50% of your money, and I make 33% less cash per idol combine... not someting most would complain about.  Again, you pay much less on Firiona Vie for your golden idols (especially non-tunare idols) than you would elsewhere.  At the time I priced the golden tunare idols, they were averaging at about 5k on other servers... and I never changed my price, as I saw no need.  I used to give a discount for iron oxides of 500pp... I sold the golden tunares for 1kpp and one iron oxide if they would supply that.  Once they became more commonly available in the bazaar I stopped doing so to avoid inflation (come on people, it's a ground spawn!).  That was a very cheap price, and many took advantage of it.<br>
<br>
But now let's look at non-tunare idols, shall we?  These have a 40-50% sucess rate at 255 skill.  I started selling them at 240 skill with gearlock, which was a 25% success rate.  But we can ignore that.  At 255 skill, golden Innoruuk Idols:<br>
<br>
(275pp per vial + 115pp per Saphire + 10pp per gold bar + 5pp misc supplys) = 405pp per combine, X 2.5 is 1012pp per unfired idol.  Add 120pp per firing (100 for the oxide, 20 for the other supplies) getting you 1132pp cost to me per idol.  I was assuming 10pp to imbue the saphire.  Now, these things are a bit streaky... if I fail a bunch and get one in four success rate, that idol just ran me a whopping 1740pp.  And yes, that happens.  But I always sell for 1500pp.  On average I make about 368pp per Innoruuk Idol... a less than 25% mark up.<br>
<br>
On other servers Inny and Sol Ro Idols average at 4kpp, a nearly 100% mark up.<br>
<br>
For those who wonder why Tunare is cheaper, it trivials at 240, while the other idols have an estimated trivial of 300.<br>
<br>
Also, golden idols do require the collection of Permafrost Crystals, Iron Oxides, and White Lead.  The first two are buyable in the bazaar for 10 to 20pp, and 100pp, respectively (not 50pp though, I've bought about 95% of my oxides for 100pp), and the last is made in a mortar and pestle using ingredients from Kaladim.<br>
<br>
Now remember, on top of all of this, that any firing has a 5% chance to fail, and the first combine also has a 5% chance to fail when fully trivial (ignore that first combine fail rate in the non-tunare idols, it's included in the 50% fail rate).<br>
<br>
And for Lethe... if you want to make a lot of essence, you can't depend on random stuff in the bazaar... you have to go to Ak Annon or West Commons for an unlimited supply.  So yes, that takes a while.<br>
<br>
Believe me, I set my prices for logical reasons, usually setting them below the inter server averages.  Sometimes, the price bombed on other servers, but the market was still very strong here, so my prices did end up higher for short periods of time.  I usually corrected for it as soon as I was able to keep the items in stock for more than a day (note that I did drop Spirit and Faithstone prices from 10k to 7500pp to 5k without having any competition as my skill got better and inter server average prices went down).  <br>
<br>
I remember the first item I ever sold a bunch of... Thurgadin Gate Potions.  These had never been sold before, and I was getting offers of 500pp and more for them.  But I sold them for 75pp each or 5 for 250pp, because I thought they were so neat and that every melee should try them out, and I wanted them to be affordable.  Sadly, I ruined the shaman gate potion market when I did that... I hadn't thought about it.  I later rose the price to 100pp each, but kept the 5 for 250pp price... couldn't keep the darn things in stock otherwise.  They still sell out very fast, and I'm sure I could sell them for more, but they don't cost me hardly anything and hey, gating for melees is fun.  <br>

I don't mean to sound rude, but this is bullshit of an exaggeration.  Half the things you have listed here are 1 time events (raising Cov Faction, raising fishing etc).<br>
<br>
  You can make like fekkin 80 celestial essence in one trip and have it only take up 4 inventory slots.  They're fekkin weightless.<br>
<br>
   You say fishing doesn't have any salable items... go raise it in Ocean of Tears you lazy bastard.  Medite and other aspiring human smiths I'm sure would be glad to pay for the saltwater seaweeds you fish up.  <br>
<br>
   You make it sound like wood-elf druids or high-elven clerics are rare.  They freaking <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> worship Tunare.  There's almost always one milling about in the bazaar.  I'll be damned if I don't trip over Xylox every time I go bank something.<br>
<br>
   Sacred thread is same case scenario as the essence.  It's not like you can't buy a bunch of it at once.  You have to pass by there anyways.<br>
<br>
   You're welcome to charge any price you like, but be freaking honest about the effort involved.  I'm not saying it's an easy feat, but you make it sound like there's some colossal effort involved in asking Xylox or someone to imbue an emerald for you.<br>
<br>

<br>
PS: To me, honest is saying something like &quot;Look, it took me several weeks to raise my pottery skill this high.  The first 190 points flew by, but it slowed down after that.  I invested the time in taking up this skill because I wanted a way to generate a profit.  Between the foraging and contacting friends it takes a few hours to make each one of these, and that's time that could just as easily be spent in a profitable adventuring zone.  If you want to only count the material cost of the items, you go collect every last one of them, and when you catch me in bazaar sometime, I'll only charge you a small fee to attempt a combine, but if you just want a ready made golden idol it's gonna cost you X amount of plat&quot;.<br>
<br>
The above is honest, and a statement I'd respect.  Trying to convince me that asking a druid/wizard friend to pick up some essence of Marr for you when they drop by commonlands to pick up a friend is a huge timesink is just bullshit.<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Syll... I do agree that much is one time.<br>
<br>
But let's actually analyze the time spent per pole.<br>
<br>
The time to get fishing to 200 should not be underestimated though, it IS quite long... I know, I've been trying (I need 175 for Crucibles of Escape).<br>
<br>
If you figure you'll make 50 poles over your fishing career, which seems reasonsable to me, and it took you let's say 10 hours to raise fishing to 200 (this depends on your intelligence... mine's only about 145 in full int gear), then that's about .2 hours or 12 minutes per pole.  When I get essences I do 4 stacks at a time, that's 80 essesnces... but to keep our numbers easy let's say they get 60 and have a few failures.  A run to Ak Annon takes me about 50 minutes, as I can't gate.  Now, I do other things (like look for oxides) along the way, but 50 is nice for this demo.  So that's about 1 minute per pole.<br>
<br>
Getting CoV faction and level 46 is something I think we can assume you'd do anyway, so let's not factor that in.<br>
<br>
Getting to the plain of growth to forage pretty much requires being a druid or ranger.  That's just a supplyer limitation, doesn't take time, just reduces producers.  However it does mean 1 pole every 24 minutes... I'm not sure what the failure rate is so let's just assume perfect success rate here. <br>
<br>
Blessed Emralds are usually done on a per stack basis... when I collect these for Golden Tunare Idols it usually takes me about 20 minutes to find someone to do this (most druids can, and I've paid off a few druids with heavily discounted golden tunare idols, I'll assume the pole maker can do something similar to get a regular crew).  You can do other things while you wait for imbueing, but let's just say it's 30 minutes total per stack to do this, so that's 2.5 stacks of emralds, but the .5 stack will take about as long as a full stack, so that's roughly 90 minutes total, with 50 poles that's .555 minutes per pole.  Running to thurgadin is another 30 minutes, plus let's say 10 minutes to make the spool... that's ignoring the time in Velks to collect the velium, I'm just assuming you'd fight there anyway, it's good enough exp.   We'll assume you make 5 spools per trip (can't fill up the bank too much, one runs out of room) so that's roughly 40 minutes per five spools, or 8 minutes per spool, with one one spool per pole.  I'm not sure on dragon eggs, I believe that's foraged a little more rapidly than poles, so let's say 30 minutes to get to West Wastes (never been but I hear it's tough), forage a stack in two hours (does that seem right?), and do all your foraging in one go.  That's 5 minutes per egg plus 30 minutes to get there, assume you gate back with a gate potion or port spell, if you gate back take the spires to the nexus, that's about 300 minutes total, devided by 50 is 6 minutes per pole.<br>
<br>
Getting tailoring to 150 is a lot of time, let's say 20 hours perhaps?  That seems a pretty conservative guess to me.  Brewing and pottery would take about 3 hours to get to those levels.  So that's another 27.6 minutes per pole.<br>
<br>
End result, assuming a ranger is foraging... it's a bit lower for druids who can avoid the spires... is 79.15555 minutes spent per pole produced.  Now, I rounded a bit but I did it in both directions.<br>
<br>
I dunno, that's a lot of time to make one stinkin' pole.<br>
<br>
I'm not a seller of these things, though... can anyone else check my numbers?<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> What I probably won't be able to convey here is that I, and perhaps others, want to see tradeskills as a way to make a living.  Everything else is just quibbling.<br>
<br>
When you want to trade skill to make a living then everything else is a distraction and time sink.  Levelling?  Gets in the way.  Gathering components?  That's time invested.  If you have to get to 46 to forage planar oak then you factor that time into the cost of planar oak.  If you're going to get to 46 anyway then you don't.<br>
<br>
The basic analogies differ.  <br>
<br>
One group says that once you reach a certain point of skill making an item is easy and you shoul charge based on cost.<br>
<br>
The other is that of the doctor or the plumber.  You invest a lot of time to be capable of making high end tradeskill items.  You expect to charge to pay yourself for that entire time when you reach the point you can finally make the items.<br>
<br>
Really, criticizing the community only masks the main concern.  That the game has been designed with tradeskills as a sideline NOT something you can effectively make the focus of your character's life.<br>
<br>
Perhaps EQ2 will fix that.  Perhaps not.  Until then, sadly, making tradeskilling your character's primary function is ineffective (at least on FV where there are no alts).  It's a pity though, I think more RPing would come from having merchant class PCs hanging around than forcing everyone into adventuring mode. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utrallosdrachen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trallos Drachen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/14/02 11:33:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You want it? You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> As off topic as this post has wandered lets get it back on track.<br>
<br>
Chase I have to agree, our prices are near dead on, but the people that keep undercutting is getting irritating.<br>
<br>
10p for QAT may be over cost, but the drink is still worth at least 15 or more and it takes a long time to gather some components.  <br>
<br>
SRTJ is worth about the same, cheaper to make, but again tedious gathering components and the yield is horrendously low.  <br>
<br>
I don't make the Fizzy Odus Juice, not miraculous so it isn't worth AS much, but still up there I imagine.  <br>
<br>
Grobb Liquidised Meat is easy to make, rather cheap, $2.667 by my prices.  Again though, this requires a corker and mine cost 3000p to have made the price of that is absorbed by these.  These are also incredibly tedious to make, just look at the recipie some time to figure out for yourself.<br>
<br>
As I'm not making constitutionals yet I'll only venture a guess that the failure rait is high from what I've read, the price reflects this and the running that has to be done to make them.<br>
<br>
My Prices<br>
Qeynos Afternoon Tea -- 15p<br>
Surefall Ranger's Trail Juice --15p<br>
Grobb Liquidised Meat --10p<br>
Kaladim Constitutional -- 25p<br>
<br>
My prices no longer change, I'm sick of playing the pricing game.  If I log on and put up my brews, check to see there are others selling for less, I let them.  Fuck em, after long enough they'll sell out and I can sell mine.  If it below cost, I'll buy the damn things out and put em out of business, I've done it before.  I wil not sell below cost and I will make a profit on my drinks.  I have a good customer base that doesn't mind my prices or even flinch at them.  I sell to friends and some members of FnF and Reso.  The only complaint I had was starting Grobb Liquidised Meat off at 20p, my first batch and I was unsure what the Market would take for them.<br>
<br>
You live and learn, what I've learned is that QAT sells like shit anymore, I usually brew it to drink myself.  I've also learned that making a batch of Grobb Liquidised Meat usually yields about 80 to 100 and I can sell every last one within about 3 days at my price. <p>Trallos Drachen<br>

The problem with putting Tea at that price is that it makes it exceptionally difficult to unload SRTJ or FOJ at 10PP, because they give less stats, but are almost as expensive, and equally as tedious, to make. I think I may just join you on the &quot;these are my prices, take them or leave them&quot; bandwagon.<br>

SUCK IT UP! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udalmorevilknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalmor Evilknight</A> at: 9/14/02 5:42:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwiggibblet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twig Gibblet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/14/02 6:49:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You want it? You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Time to make an item, and the time to raise a skill is paramount when you look at what a grandmaster tradeskiller is charging you for.  Posting the prices for making the items is far from the point.<br>
<br>
A grandmaster tailor, just to get a few combines together for a Solstice Robe, has already gone through <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> endless</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> combines, foraging, hunting and purchasing to raise his skill.  I make robes, and I respect the 2500pp price when I get a success.  I average 1.5 robes every 46 combines.  What does that entail?  <br>
<br>
I collect 280 spider silks to make 140 swatches.<br>
<br>
I purchase 140 emeralds (15pp ea) and have them imbued.<br>
<br>
I purchase 280 Celestial Solvents, and 280 Scent of Marr.  I combine these to create 280 Celestial Essence.<br>
<br>
I combine 140 Celestial Essence and 140 Imbued Emeralds with 140 Jars of Acid — yield &lt;=140 Blessed Dust of Tunare (considering failures) <br>
<br>
I then combine 140 Blessed Dust of Tunare with 140 Silk Swatches — &lt;=140 Sacred Swatches (consideing failures)<br>
<br>
Finally, I combine the Worked Silver Chain with 3 Sacred Swatches and a pattern.  After all that, I am lucky to get one robe at 200 skill.  This doesn't take into account the cost to have the Chains made by a GM jeweler.  At least they are returned on failure.  the GM jewler I had create my 10 chains failed 4 times at 250 skill...<br>
<br>
That's around <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1500+</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> clicks of my mouse, not counting miscues and moving all this stuff from bag to bag, etc.<br>
<br>
So...besides the fact that it took me a god only knows how many hours to level past 160 in tailoring, it takes an astronomical amount of time, effort and money to create the items.  <br>
<br>
Think about that the next time you purchase something from a tailor.<br>
<br>
PS<br>
I started making Robes at skill 195.  I have gained only 3 points off of them and have done the aforementioned routine at least 7 times.  Tailoring takes great patience, I assure you.  Past 160 it's a living hell...believe me. <p><center>
