<br>
So you wish to join the ranks of Fire and Fury – may whatever God you worship have mercy upon your soul.<br>
<br>
There are several stages to the process of becoming an official member of Fire and Fury:  prospective applicant, official applicant, voted applicant and probationary member.<br>
<br>
Please note that at any time during the process, should you demonstrate yourself to not be suitable Fire and Fury material, you will be informed of this fact and the application process will end – to avoid wasting anyone’s time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Prospective Applicant Stage:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Read the requirements for becoming an Official Applicant.  Should you be currently unable to meet any of the requirements, you may post an “Intent to Apply” in the same format as the “Application Format” detailed below - clearly indicate the areas where you do not meet the requirements.  From the date of your “Intent to Apply”, you have two weeks to meet all the requirements to move to the Official Applicant Stage (leadership reserves the right to extend this time period, in certain circumstances) or your application will be removed.  You are invited to reapply at a time when you meet all requirements.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Official Applicant Stage:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
To be recognized as an official applicant of Fire and Fury, you must meet all of the following minimum requirements.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Resists:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You must be able to maintain a magic resist level of at least 85 along with the simultaneous ability to raise any one of fire/cold/poison/disease resist to at least 100 without the aid of buffs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Insta-Buffs:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You must have a minimum of one insta-click/buff item that is usable indoors and outdoors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Water-breathing:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You must have an item that allows you to breath in areas without air – buffs are not acceptable<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Magelo Profile:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You must post and maintain an accurate magelo profile:  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com" target="top"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">www.magelo.com</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Expansions:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You must have all expansions enabled, including Planes of Power.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Human Tongue:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It is the official guild language - master it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raiding Schedule and Rules:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Fire and Fury raids 5 to 7 days per week.  It goes without saying that you are expected to attend raids on time and conduct yourself appropriately.  The Raid Schedule is as follows.  Times are subjected to target availability, and patch days.<br>
<br>
Monday-Thursday: 7pm EST - 11pm EST (Can start as early as 6pm EST and/or end as late as 12am EST)<br>
Friday: 7pm EST - 11pm EST (Can start as early as 6pm EST and/or end as late as 2am EST)<br>
Saturday:  2pm EST - 3am EST<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sponsor:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  During your time with Fire and Fury, you will meet a lot of people during raiding and experience groups.  In these encounters you may become friendly with some.  Those who you come to know well you may want to ask to sponsor you.  You must have a sponsor or you cannot be voted upon.  It is your responsibility to communicate with your sponsor about whatever issues arise (i.e. inability to attend raids, personal conflicts with other members or applicants, etc…) and about the guild’s current schedule of activities.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Raid Attendance:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Fire and Fury uses an Attendance Point System to track member attendance and contribution. Please review the Attendance Point System and the Raiding Rules to be fully aware of what you are getting yourself into and how you will be judged. From the point that a prospective applicant becomes an official applicant (i.e. meeting all of the above criteria) you must acquire a MINIMUM of 10 Attendance Points before your application will even be considered for voting by the membership. Again, 10 Attendance Points is the minimum you must acquire as an Official Applicant before your application is eligible to move to the next stage of consideration – the leadership retains the right to extend your official application stage beyond the 10 point minimum.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Attitude:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Check your ego, your attitude, your lust for loot, and any stubbornness you may have at the door - or don’t walk through it.  Expect to be told how to do things and when to do them during the course of raiding.  If you are unsure of something, ask your sponsor or someone else that you feel comfortable with.  Small mistakes can result in enormous catastrophes at this level of raiding.  You are here to LEARN and to PROVE your worthiness.  You will also have fun.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Vex Thal:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Its important to realise that being an applicant in a Vex Thal capable guild is NOT easy. You will be expected to complete your Vex Thal key. This is a long and sometimes tricky camp, and most of the time you will be expected to organise these camps yourself along with the other Fire and Fury applicants. <br>
<br>
This is not an easy undertaking, but we expect a level of competance from our recuits that should allow them to finish these keys and join us in Vex Thal. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Voted Applicant:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Subject to you meeting all of the minimum requirements to become an Official Applicant, fulfilling the minimum prerequisite Raid Points and the determination of the leadership, your application MAY become eligible for voting.  <br>
<br>
The voting process lasts one week, but may take longer (i.e. if a number of members are not available to cast their votes).  To be admitted as a Probationary Member, the membership vote on your Official Application must result in a minimum of 75% positive votes in your favour.<br>
<br>
During the voting stage you are expected to attend raids and conduct yourself appropriately.  Should the membership vote reveal that it is unlikely that you will be admitted as a Probationary Member, you will be informed of as much and the application process will end.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Probationary Member:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Should you make it through the Voted Applicant stage, you will be admitted as a Probationary Member.  At that point, your Attendance Point total will be reset to zero.<br>
<br>
You will remain as a Probationary Member until you acquire a MINIMUM of 15 Attendance Points.  The leadership reserves the right to extend the probation period for a particular member at their discretion.  REPEAT:  the probationary period is not set in stone and the leadership can extend probation at their discretion.<br>
<br>
Instances of unacceptable behaviour, poor/annoying conduct or unsatisfactory skills will result in official warnings, with any repeat instances resulting in you being removed from the guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Expectations:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The application process is long and filled with many requirements.  You are expected to attend as many raids as possible, to be there on time, and to stay for the full duration of the raid.  You are expected to demonstrate your skills, demonstrate that you are capable of taking direction quickly and accurately, demonstrate that you have the capacity to learn and improve, and demonstrate that you will not annoy your fellow guildmates.  You are expected to do this during the entire application phase (4 to 5 week minimum).<br>
<br>
And for all of this hard work you can expect to get absolutely ZERO loot, absolutely ZERO character flags/keys and absolutely NOTHING but our willingness to teach you and give you the opportunity to prove that you deserve to wear our tag.<br>
<br>
Any loot or flags/keys you receive during the course of the application phase is solely at the discretion of the leadership.<br>
<br>
Still interested?<br>
<br>

<br>
Whether submitting an “Intent to Apply” or an “Official Application”, submit your application in the following format, and note the areas where you do not meet the requirements for you application to become an Official Application.  You MUST label your application as “Intent to Apply” or “Official Application” in the subject line – please update this as it applies.<br>
