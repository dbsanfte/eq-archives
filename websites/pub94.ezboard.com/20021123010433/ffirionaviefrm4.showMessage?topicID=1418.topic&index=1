Please support this claim.<br>
<br>
I realize that you did say &quot;almost any and every,&quot; but I have a feeling that you haven't read any non-Soapbox posts of mine. And that's the purpose of this forum anyway, so I don't know why I in particular should take heat for complaining. I also don't agree with your saying that I belittle anyone who argues with me. It may have happened before, but it was only once I was completely fed-up with that person. I think that you are exaggerating, but then, that's just my opinion.<br>
<br>
Egotism and self-righteousness are similar descriptions, and I personally don't think either apply to me. Both would indicate that I am so convinced that what I am and what I do is great and infinitely superior to what anyone else does, but I rarely compare myself and my actions to other people. If speaking out against someone or something and not even mentioning yourself in the equation qualifies as doing that, well -- there's so many nice and intelligent egotists here that I can only take that as a compliment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/02 10:34:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sheesh.

This is one of Madrain's posts in the Captain's latest thread. I don't think any of my posts in the past few weeks have been meaner than this (and it's not that harsh). By the way, I agree with what he says here. This isn't an attack against Madrain. And what about Snout (who has admittedly grown on me since the confrontation we had)? Or the occasional Isharra (who I also feel is cool) post?

<br>
Sorry Taz, you aren't unwelcome here in my books, but your posts are rarely upbeat.  95% of the time you are either attacking someone (even if I agree with you, you still are) or are pawing over something about FV you think isn't good enough.  Hey, criticism can be useful, but that's still what you are doing.  The statement stands.  And no, I'm not going to pull quotations, you know where you've posted.<br>
<br>
Don't take things so personally Taz. I think that's 90% of the reason you are having trouble being happy.  It was all in good fun, and on a completely irreverent thread.  Shintou doesn't threaten to kill quite everything either, if you haven't noticed.  And I accused him of that also.<br>

I get blamed for alot Tzaroth.  I had to take quite a hiatus from the Soapbox after getting extremely miffed at Vall Shadowstrife and Mollycat, who were constantly attacking Shintou.<br>
<br>
Shin and I aren't necessarily friends or anything, but I do like the guy, and I try to stick up for people I like.  I think I might've said a piece for you before Tzaroth, even if in another thread I was against you.  And I like to be vocal.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
I rarely get too offended by things these days.  I stop and try to ignore it if that happens.  I defended cyber in the cyber thread, because while cyber does not equal roleplay, cyber doesn't discredit either, at least in my books.<br>
<br>
I rant against Ollias because I don't like the tone of his post.  It's demeaning, as if everyone with a roleplayed racial hatred is unimaginative.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't see how ANY roleplay is bad, considering how rare it is.<br>
<br>
That said, I try to help out in General Chat if I can.  I post Kudos from time to time.  Or some random nonsense in OT/OOC.  Or a story in Bard for a Day.  Or silliness in Hero Heart Tavern.<br>
<br>
I think what gets you a bad rap is that, as Tzaroth, your whole time posting almost seems as if it is entirely in the Soapbox.  Some people may not know that you were Ryael (sp) or Skrag or what have you, and that you posted non-flamy things.<br>
<br>
And yeah...Valquiss exaggerate sometimes.  Exaggeration is a lovely tool.  I wish someone would exaggerate my rambling incoherence sometime. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1523<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 12:45:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> no need to exaggerate it hun, it's larger than you.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
