<br>
to set the scene to this post I planned to try kill ixiblat and ragefire a week and a half ago, he was killed (some say after i posted intent some after but thats not really important now) and was not up so we killed 3 ixiblats for myself, hevenlee and afferado who were there and ready, but rage still didnt show till 6 hours after we left so we missed him.<br>
<br>
so i set about camping his spot, i logged there last night, i was there a good few hours today alone 90% of the time, including when to my suprise he popped right infront of my eyes!<br>
<br>
GREAT! i start sending tells to friends and enlisting a force to come kill him, unfortunately a few minutes later a member of awakened souls (who had killed him the 2 previous pops i refer to) zoned in and so they start getting a force to kill him as well again.<br>
<br>
I had gotten 12 pple in the zone by the time they had 7 or 8 and politely asked the raid leader if since they killed him at least the last twice and i had been there first with a sizeable (not kill capable) force they would back down and let us prepare in peace and time not rushing and get my epic piece, to which i was told no we are going to kill him.<br>
<br>
So i keep gathering my friends to kill him, we had 20 in the zone within a few minutes and would have been capable of killing him with ease if allowed the extra few minutes to get everyone else in and buffed when they pulled him and killed him.<br>
<br>
This wasnt technically a kill steal as he hadnt been engaged, but i amongst those who had come to help me (a gathering of ple from several guilds including as ma Gore from fire and fury who offered his help very nicely thanks gore and everyone) were disgusted at this behavior.<br>
<br>
I thought this server was made of decent pple and the uber guilds which get bad names elswhere were different here (uber meaning larger and more powerful) and as members of fire and fury who turned up to help here and against ixiblat and resolution who helped with ixiblat and would have with rage if not raiding at the time show, here they are decent and courteous and helpful, except it seems awakened souls.<br>
<br>
DO i not being in a large guild and capable of going /gu rage is up come kill it and instea have to do /tell dozens of pple and organise it more , thus needing more than 5 mins not deserve a chance to kill a spawn when quite capable, even when there first just because a more powerful guild comes along ??<br>
<br>
What would this have meant to them, a 3rd (or more) clerics with epics, to my guild it would have been 1, to the open raid community (and i know i dont go on all there are several a week now, but i go on a lot) it would have been 1<br>
<br>
I go out of my way often to help people, getting tells to come help on a raid wipe, like in sebilis, tofs, lower guk... i do passing rezzes when i see dead pple in zones equipped who are online, i went to COM to rescue a poor guy who forgot he was bound there and gated ad went afk to come back to 40 bodies (thanks faira and johanna for helping my lack of epic made it slow otherwise). An epic for the open raid community would make raids so much better, but simply because it would take me 20 mins not 5 to get a force there and prepped , even when im there alone as he pops, i cant get my drop.<br>
<br>
I shortly after this incident got tells from pple as well claiming awakened souls said you all logged so they pulled him, and from others sayig awakend souls said you tried to kill steal him. Well there were a lot of us there from several guilds, i wont name any but i hope that some will post the truth.<br>
<br>
Basically im saying i put in the effort, was there first prepping but since it takes more than a few mins i am not able to get the fight simply because awakened souls pull him sooner just because they can. Did they ks? techically no. Were they discoureous to someone there first yes. Did they have use for the epic drop yes. But would it really have been a loss for them to wait on a 3rd (or more) epic cleric for a week since they can so easilly get it at will compared to 0 in my guild, 0 in open community and difficulty getting the force there in 5 mins? not at all!<br>
<br>
thankyou for reading this post feel free to post what you will, i will not be responding to any comments regardless of the flames im sure i will get , but i do know i am very far from alone with incidents such as these against awakened souls, the kind of guild that give big guilds elsewhere a bad name i thought we didnt have any of here, guess i was wrong on 1 count. Do they have good members? undoubtedly i count 2 friends i have fought alongside and will continue to do so, but as a guild, sorry but i will have nothing to do with them.<br>

I haven't ever had a positive experience with Awakened Souls. However, your anecdote really takes the cake. Is this true? Gore, care to comment? <br>
<br>
I really don't mean to flame or attack an entire guild unnecessarily, but if this is true, AS is well and truly on my blacklist (not that they'll care), as any guild would be who pulled something like this.<br>
<br>
Have some honor, folks. Failing that, grow some courtesy. Failing that, move to freakin' Stormhammer, please. We don't need you here, neither do we want you.<br>
<br>
Wasn't there just a thread about this and the general consensus was that this wouldn't be a problem on this server? Well, a few jerks and d00ds can ruin a whole lot of folks' day.<br>

Congradulations! You have already begun the process that I spoke of before a VERY long time ago. You have trancended and in your greed and non caring, you've now tossed Firiona Vie into the sprial that we know as the Blue Server.<br>
<br>
Nice work people, Firiona Vie is now no longer special, for now I can say pretty much that it is no longer a Purple Server, but a blue Server.<br>
<br>
Is it all your fault. Nah. You can Blame Verant and how they jacked the alignment system. But this puts FV over the edge I think.<br>

If you ask me, who ever was there first, and made it clear what their target was, had the rights for Ragefire. However, that is just my opinion. If folks want to play this server as a &quot;Whoever is buffed and gtg, wins&quot; then thats what it will degrade to. I said in an earlier post that a reservation system will never work if everyone doesnt agree to use it. The same can be said for any system, including first come first serve.<br>
<br>
No one can dictate to anyone how to play this game, or how to run their guild. You can try to impose as many social penalties on them as you want but in the end if they just don't care... well nothings going to stop them except another, more powerful force ruining their raids. Pretty much &quot;bullying&quot; them into a certain set of rules. Obviously, this isn't an ideal solution. <br>

One of the major differences between this server and others is the courtesy... I've seen folks decide to join up with an open Lodi attack just because they didn't want to steal the kill from a raid that was 75% ready.  It's so much better that way.  But behavoir like this, if it became a regular occurance, would be very damaging for the culture and climate of this server.<br>

Sorry we were raiding at the time Blayze or I would of gone soon as you sent me a tell (probably with friends). Really upset me when I found out what happen, there is just no need of it this server. Like the rest I'd like to here what AS has to say about it. You'll get him next time hun don't give up.<br>

<br>
It takes strong people to not let greed rule them and make them forsake a good rep and the well being of others in persuit of it.<br>
<br>
From the start of the sever, FnF has always wanted to make a new name for the top guild, not the &quot;assholes at the top&quot; but people who are aware of the comunity also. <br>
<br>
Reso and FnF have had a few black marks, even if some were undeserved. Throught it all we've come back and shown we are not all assholes and we've gained alot of respect. This sever is different than others, the people at the top do listen, and do help.<br>
<br>
It truly saddens me that now, the very people we respected, now that they have moved up, they are the ones turning the server into what they always hounded us to not do.<br>
<br>
I was there because I have known Blaze to be a good person, I don't mind helping anyone with anything. Awakened gathered faster, as they should, an open raid is hard to mobilize. They pulled Rage once they had enough to kill him. They did not use cheesy kite till ready tatics, which is piss poor from anyone. So in all respects they did it just they way they should to be in the right with the &quot;rules&quot;.<br>
<br>
The real thing is, in the quest to &quot;uber&quot; they forgot about the small people, and walked over Blaze because he didnt matter to them. <br>
<br>
That saddens me.  <p><br>

From my experiences with them, they simply do not care about others.  Training, KSing, RP bashing.  Reputation meaning what it does, I've little real need to even hear a second side to the story.  Blayze is one of the more respected characters around and AS is rapidly becoming notorious for being a guild of selfish jerks.  I have little doubt it happened as illustrated.<br>
<br>
What I am most curious about is why people would ever want to stay in a guild that seems to go out of its way to be inconsiderate and rude.  Is &quot;phat loot&quot; and the false bravado of taking down uber mobs worth it?  Maybe it's just me, but my characters mean far to much to me to sell out.  And characters aside, there is still the person behind the box doing the actions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/13/02 10:36:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=993.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://noirdaila.homestead.com/files/ZDoll.JPG width=83 height=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rare mobs and decency...</span><hr size=1> Maybe before the bashing of AS begans let them respond.

People who lable (think) there Uber or whatever and dont care about others on the server are just hurting themselves.Why? cause even with all the zerg guilds you cant do everything by yourselves and if you blacken your name you will not get help ,Or when you leave said *uber* guild to join other said *uber* guild you'll have less chance at getting in cause of past experances.<br>
<br>
I have heard nothing good about AS since they crawled out from whatever rock and some crossed my family members so i wont help them out ever.But sadly the need for greed is stronger than honour.I am very proud that we of dreadstorm havent done shady crap and burned people at the end game cause in the long run its really not worth it.Hell i only group with guildies and help guildies and even i know this but it is lost on most people. <p>Attuma Evilknight

We even had one set up on EQVault for a time.  It fell apart because the top tier guilds refused to acknowledge it and many mid tier guilds took their leads from them.<br>
<br>
The top two guilds had a rotation system, you see.  Basically every time one of the top guilds became capable of killing a mob, they farmed the hell out of that mob as often as they possibly could before they had competition.  When the second guild to kill the mob finally was able to, that second guild pretty much always tried to farm that mob non-stop as well.  They figured hey...guild 01 got the mob for the last 2 months non-stop, now we should.<br>
<br>
That's when guild 01 pounded them into the ground until guild 02 came to them and worked out a deal.  Pretty much every single major mob went that way.  (Pounded them into the ground as in...raced them for every single spawn, regardless of timezone...if they were second to the mob, following directly behind during the raid lagging the hell out of everyone...jumping over corpses after a wipeout...pulling past a raid that was buffing...etc)<br>
<br>
So what happened when a third or fourth guild became capable?  Well, they obviously didn't fit into the rotation, and so that mob became a free for all.<br>
<br>
Basically that's how our server worked.  If you were buffed and ready, and the mob hadn't been pulled, you pull him and kill him.  If the guild racing you wasn't ready...too bad.  There were times when the difference between getting a mob and not getting one was literally seconds.  I remember a time when a guild pulled Severillious as the other guild was giving the pull order.  15 seconds later you could see the second guild shouting...he's gone...who pulled him???<br>
<br>
This happened unless you had worked out an arrangement with another guild.  Arrangements worked out between two guilds never extended to anyone else, and working out arrangements didn't guarantee you a mob...only that the guild you were working with wouldn't compete for that mob during alternating spawns.  There were times when two guilds who agreed to rotate spawns actually would work together when a third guild started gathering to take that mob to ensure that those two guilds got that loot and that noone lost their turn in the rotation.<br>
<br>
In my mind, that's the only way a non-calendar system can work.  You cannot say...well, we'll respect the people who are in the zone and trying for the mob.  The bottom line is, your guild cares about your guild members more than you care about someone else.  When that someone else is level 52 and trying to scrape together a pickup raid...well it's very easy to think to yourself, &quot;I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some level 52 newbie scrape together a pickup raid and deny OUR cleric who is level 60 and has done yadda yadda yadda for MY guild HIS epic.&quot;  The dominant guilds will always underestimate the capabilities of the guilds under them.  They will always justify reasons for moving past people who are already there.  They will even get to the point of ignoring others in the zone and just going about their business in &quot;retaliation&quot; for some triviality in which they feel wronged by the other guild.  (We actually had one guild charge past another guild to kill Sontalak because months before the two guilds had raced for a miniboss in Hate and felt disrespected.)<br>
<br>
FnF and Reso can work out all the arrangements they want, but that's not going to help anyone else in any way, shape, or form.  In fact, top guilds working out arrangements amongst themselves even be detrimental to smaller guilds, as walking away from a spawn for a smaller guild can mean that you give up your turn in any rotation you've worked out.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for Blayze.  I feel bad for his guild.  I know what having even one epic in guild can mean for a guild.  Wipe recovery time goes from over an hour down to under a half hour.  It can mean the difference between being able to make only a single attempt at a mob in a night, to being able to make two or three attempts at a mob.  That can be a huge help towards learning how to place, pull, and fight a mob without having to resort to just surfing the web for the spoiler on how other guilds kill it.  I also know that cleric epics provide diminishing returns and not every cleric in a guild needs one, yet every single cleric in a guild feels compelled to have one.<br>
<br>
The people of Firiona Vie make it what it is, but unfortunatly when the top flight guilds declare the server first come, first serve, that's what it becomes.  The guild that was in Skyfire with lethal force buffed and ready to go first, was the first to get served.<br>
<br>
Blayze, if you were actually able to get a pickup raid together within 20 minutes of Ragefire poping, you'll get your epic.  It's just a matter of time.  Best of luck to you and hopefully the pain of camping that son of a bitch will be over for you soon.<br>
