I doubt it'll be anything you haven't heard of.  But I could be wrong -- My Rogue has fought many &quot;warlords&quot; without being scratched.<br>
<br>
First of all, you have to learn &quot;NOT&quot; to leave attack on.  You only turn attack on when approaching someone.  It's known as 'jousting' on most servers, as I'm sure you know.<br>
<br>
I suggest running about ten to twenty feet away from your opponent.  Stopping, turning around and facing him.   Figure out how far away he is.  So that you may better 'time' your attack.  Once you feel comfortable, you run towards your enemy, WITH ATTACK OFF.  You turn attack on, right before or 'as' you approach him.  Do not stop at him -- Run right through him.<br>
<br>
If performed properly, you should deliver a nice round of attacks, and move out of harm's way, before your target realizes what's happened.  <br>
<br>
Also, if you leave attack on and try to run right through someone, the attack reset will miss 90% of the time, unless you're using some insanely fast weapon, with haste.  Like Celestial Fists, or Nightfall(rogue only).<br>
<br>
That's just a basic.  And really the first step to 'learning' your own style of 'dueling.'  <br>
<br>
So, once you feel like you've got the timing figured out, you will want to learn to hit attack, and your 'kick' hotkey at the same time.  If you're like most people, your attack button will be &quot;A&quot; and your kick button will be 1, 2, or 3.  The keys are relatively close, so it's pretty easy to figure out.<br>
<br>
Make sure that you use your left hand, to hit attack and kick, though.  You have some people try to use the mouse, for them.  It's too slow, and next to impossible to maneuver around with your left hand on the directional pad, and your right hand on the mouse, clicking kick, then switching your left hand back over to attack in time.<br>
<br>
The object is speed.  Most jousting happens in a split second.  <br>
<br>
Also, a two handed weapon will outperform a one handed weapon anytime.  Hands down.  Since the damage is done in single blows, and doubles.... you really can't get the advantage of using dual wield -- it's done on speed.  And when you're jousting, you don't stand still long enough for it to reset.<br>
<br>
It's much more painful to double for 298 and 315, than it is to driveby and do 46, 75 and 27!  Trust me.<br>
<br>
I assume you two are warriors -- new to the server.<br>
<br>
If you're in-experienced in the world of PvP, don't expect to learn how to joust, and go out and rip experienced duelists apart in seconds.  Regardless of equipment, it won't happen.<br>
<br>
I personally, being a Rogue, take my hand away from attack, when fighting a Jouster.  I place it on the directional pad, and my right hand goes on the mouse.  I hold right click down.  And wait for them to approach me.  When they near, I step backwards, and to the side.  As soon as they pass, obviously missing me... I use mouse look to turn around as fast as possible, move my hand to Attack and backstab. <br>
<br>
Continuing to hold right click down, I now press the left mouse-key, to move forward.  After dueling so much, I can time a backstab next to perfect, and pull off a nice quad or more, while I'm at it and have moved out of range before he realizes there's a hole in his back.  <br>
<br>
With practice, a Rogue can rip an in-experienced jouster apart in seconds, using that method.<br>
<br>
But, for more experienced duelists, that trick -rarely- works.  <br>
<br>
You have to lure warriors in.  Halfway through the fight, stand about ten feet away.  And click your hot-keyed Invigorate.  The opponent is forced to attack, in order to keep you from healing.  He usually throws himself at you, entirely.  He rushes into a situation without thinking. <br>
<br>
As soon as you see him comings towards you, hit 'D' for duck, that interrupts your casting.  Then step back when he's 3 feet away from you.  He'll hit attack, expecting you to be where you were, when he headed towards you.  He loses his round, while leaving himself wide open for 'punishment.'  <br>
<br>
Simply, &quot;stop moving backwards&quot; and hit 'forward,' and attack/backstab simultaneously.  If timed right, the rogue will get off a full round of attacks, and a backstab.  <br>
<br>
Yes, Rogues can backstab from the front, if they hit backstab -right- as they pass their opponent, it'll work some 90% of the time.  Usually doing amount of damage, than had you been standing directly behind them.<br>
<br>
There are alot of tanks out there, that -don't- have &quot;see invis&quot; items, even at level 60.  So, I recommend for the first round, hitting hide, right before the 'jouster' approaches you.  If he doesn't have one, you'll be removed from his target list, and he'll be wide open for assault.  <br>
<br>
And to those warriors who don't have a see invis item, when a Rogue does this.  Hit tab once.  You will target yourself.  Hit again.. you will target your last target.  The Rogue.  It usually takes them by surprise, giving you a free round.<br>
<br>
Warriors VS Monks = Very unfair.  If the warriors fights him face to face, the monk will rip him apart.  If they joust, the monk will rip him apart.  Even IF the warriors 'pwns' him in a joust match, his regen will give him a noticeably advantage.  Not to mention Mend pops up non-stop at this level.<br>
<br>
Against Hybrids.  Well, you HAVE to stay on them.  Put a Ranger face to face with a warrior.  The warrior will tear them apart most of the time.  Even with the damage shields.  <br>
<br>
But, give the ranger time to cast heals, and nukes on the warrior, and it's going to be a different story.  You don't pause inbetween jousts.  You charge at him non-stop, and engage in 'face-to-face' combat if possible.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Ranger's Archery is 'great' in Dueling situations, but wouldn't know -- I've never fought one that used it on me.  Rangers and their low Poison resistances <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )~<br>
<br>
I know Warrior's archery doesn't even scratch me, when standing.  I doubt a Ranger's is THAT superior to theirs.<br>
<br>
Same goes for fighting casters.  You don't give them to cast.  You chase their tails until you, or they are dead.  As a Rogue, I can kill almost any caster in less than 8 seconds.  Even with them running, and pausing for &quot;attempts&quot; at casting.<br>
<br>
To the guy who gets rooted... I feel sorry for you.  I'm a Rogue, and I am unrootable.  Snare can land, once out of ten times, if I'm SITTING DOWN, and letting them chain cast it on me.  And the thing about snare is, it lasts a long time.  Nukes don't break it.....  So, if it does land.  You better hope your Invigorate can outheal their Dots.  Or their Nukes.... which rarely happens, unless your SV Fire is extremely high, and they're nuking for like 300 =T<br>
<br>
Edit:  Almost forgot the fastest way to kill someone.  If you can get a melee to 'chase you'.. as you often can as a Rogue, you can kill them in no time, without being scratched.  <br>
<br>
Get him right on your tail.  Run five yards, turn around and hit attack and take off running as soon as you do.  If he's 'chasing' you, he'll probably follow you again.  Turn around, and hit attack instantly.  <br>
<br>
Unless the person you're fighting has an insane case of A.D.D. .. it'll be impossible for him to time that.  Unless he's psychic.  If he's right on your tail, he has NO idea when you're going to stop, turn around and attack.  And by the time you do, it's too late for him to realize that you have.<br>
<br>
It's literally impossible for him to hit you, unless he's randomly hitting attack, and has great luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Lots of melees get into chasing someone, and are 'dead,' before they even realize it, or before they even inflict any 'real' damage to their opponent.<br>
<br>
I've seen that happen alot.  Even to 'experienced' duelists.<br>
<br>
