(serious Rant ) </span><hr size=1> What ever it is... that last post I made was not idiotic... Well at least how I think it was not stupid, silly and moronic.<br>
<br>
I'm sitting here thinking... You know, maybe people just think that all young kids deserve a beating when they try or attempt to rival an adult in debate or ranting, such as the soapbox..<br>
<br>
I also sense I'm getting some pity too, maybe it feels nice to have people sticking up for you. Though, I just get that feeling that I have alot of pity spared on me cause of my age.<br>
<br>
Sure, I condemn parents beating there children, for discipline reasons only. Hell, I used to get the belt when I was little, and if I get into trouble, ill get shoved around a bit. <br>
<br>
All in all I know someone in my school, whom parents are afraid of there son... What the Fu.... ? <br>
<br>
You guys do know that, I was suggested by a friend, reason why I'm LFG for a long time is, people read the soapbox and say, &quot;Gee that moron is sure smart, I wont group with him, cause if he can't post, then he can't play his chara.&quot; <br>
<br>
Not to say that I already know that this will happen... Yeah sure I don't mind the little abuse, maybe get slammed everyday, but Jesus Christ on a Crutch! <br>
<br>
I don't want a whole &quot;faction&quot; war started over me cause I'm just &quot;14&quot; and I post to entertain and annoy people, and make the soapbox a little interesting...<br>
<br>
Sure my intentions where good, but hey! Look now! When I actually do rant, it gets treated like trash! Again, I do realize the price posting stupid stuff has against your reputation...<br>
<br>
From now on, I won't do anything other than rant in the soapbox... For those the remotely found my posts amusing, or the funny gentle slams that came after it... Well get over the loss, its not happening anymore. <br>
<br>
I have to save my reputation at one point, and Naktah's comment drew the line for me. I intend not to cross it.<br>
<br>
No more misspelling for me, I'm in a very high standard English class, and I have to get my stuff together... <br>
<br>
Reason why I'm not pissed at Omi? It's because he can be an over-wrought Zealous bastard. Though i have known that, and I do respect him. <br>
<br>
He dose give out good advice. I do belive though he lets the heat of the moment get to him alot though. <br>
<br>
Well good night guys, Doing a project on Cronos, Father of Time for my Mythology class, gotta get working on it. <br>

(serious Rant ) </span><hr size=1> dunno if you care or whatever but heres my take on it.<br>
<br>
Magiith ill be honest i found your posts to be pretty damn annoying most the time, and i had no clue your age.  In my opinion the reason people dont take you serious has nothing to do with your age but your posting style.  It seemed like you had very little to add and would make big giant arguments over beyond petty topics and often strive to be center of attetion (like when you started 3 or so threads in one day).  Its not something that teenagers only do, i am sure that people who have been driven off this board for posting immaturely etc are not all minors.  people are fed up with you for who you are, not how old you are.<br>
<br>
The only connection might be that since you are younger you dont see what your doing wrong, dont realize how your actions are effecting your name.  And thats something people learn with time (for the most part, not everyone learns how to be mature).  If you carried yourself better people wouldnt care if you where 2 or 82.<br>

<br>
Look, you seem to be asking for some advise, so here is some honest advise.  The problem isn't that you are trying to rival anyone at anything, the problem is just that you are trying so damn hard.  This isn't a competition.  I know that might seem difficult to understand sometimes, because people sometimes treat it that way, but there is a subtle distinction.  When I am &quot;competing&quot; with my friend to see who can show off the best scar, no one really cares who wins.  It's just fun.  Most of the &quot;competing&quot; you see around here is of that sort.  A lot of the rest is just nasty, and then the odd time there might be some genuine rivalry.  But that's it.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, going around and trying to win at everything is not an effective life strategy.  I've been watching your posts for ages.  &quot;I'm the youngest planes raider.&quot;  &quot;I can roleplay gooder than you.&quot;  &quot;See?  I'm cool also....&quot;  I'm sorry bud, but you are constantly hanging yourself out to dry by demanding approval where no approval is necessary.  And then you wonder why people end up shooting you down.  You almost force them to, by demanding they either play up to your own image of yourself or say something to deflate it.  Your age wouldn't be such a damn issue if you weren't constantly drawing attention to it as some kind of benchmark, like you have somehow gotten the scoop on all the rest of us by being younger than we are.  Seriously, we wouldn't care if you just didn't care.  When was the last time you saw someone bragging about being the oldest player of EQ?<br>
<br>
So, yeah.  Just calm down.  Work hard at impressing the kids your age, it might work better.  Probably not, never worked for me, but you never know.  Maybe you are just more impressive than I was.  But as you wander into high school, you might find those unwritten social rules are more like what you find here rather than what you got in middle school.<br>
<br>
In your own way you are a pretty cool kid Magiith.  The only damn thing about you is you seem to need to hear that every five fucking minutes.  So remember I said it this time.  Print it and put it on your wall if you need to.  Cause this is the one time you get it from me.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

(serious Rant ) </span><hr size=1> Mags, my problem has never been with you(at least not since I found out your age).  You seem like a nice, bright kid.  Yes, you're annoying to me, sometimes, but no differently than my 17 yr old brother is(I'm 31).<br>
<br>
Since I found out your age, my problem has been with your parents. And no, I don't know how your life is. You could have the greatest parents in the world, but I rather doubt it.  I had mediocre parenting and my dad always set limits on potentially harmful things.  IE Nintendo(Yes, I'm frelling old), and suchlike.  He always knew what I was doing, who I was doing it with, and where I was doing it.  He even went so far as to be all sneakish and shit and check up on me, till he realized that I was a decent kid(I didn't hit my rebellious stage till I was 19 or so).  <br>
<br>
I dunno, I just see you posting all sorts of stuff, all hours of the day, and I wonder where your parents are during all this. And I feel a little bad for you, that they don't seem to take a more active part in your life. <br>
<br>

I really don't see whats wrong with having a bit of freedom, as long as I can be trusted... <br>
<br>
Why don't you talk to them in-game? instead?<br>
<br>
My problem is, that i can't keep my mouth shut, i'm just like my mom, and my mom is the opposite of my dad. I also like to post and talk to people. <br>

One last thing... <br>

Gee, my moms an at- home mom. They are always an active part of my live, On-line in EQ and offline... Just that, they know i need my privacy, and i'm not doing anything Illegal of that sort im pretty much fine. <br>
<br>
I post before school and after school... What dose the soapbox have to do with my parents? Why should they fight my own war? <br>
<br>
Ohh yeah as for parents restricting there kids? There are parents that i know that won't let there son, or daughter, watch a fucking PG-13 movie....<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all the parents fault for how they raised there kids!&quot; <br>
<br>
That is a fucking understatement. We sure as fuck understand death.... We understand what happens when somone dies. How it affects there family and feelings... <br>
<br>
Problem is some of you people are sooo freaking old... that you never keep up with this age... Imformation is more advanced and refined... <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, wow look at it here, our parents where really good at <br>
disipline. I mean the old fashion way of rasing a kid is way better!&quot;<br>
<br>
... You do realize that at one point, your age/time period was new? Everytime period is new at least once... cause time always gose forward not backward... <br>

Mag, you know I am your biggest supporter. I see you as something of a protogé, and I have never been annoyed or upset by your posts. That should come as no shock to anyone. <br>
<br>
Traelle meant no harm by her post, and was offering her take on the subject. You are one of the biggest proponents of 'this is what happens' in the soapbox, but you need to learn... well.. to quote a song from back in the day.. 'know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em'. Pick your battles. You should know by now that Traelle was offering advice as a friend. Look deeper at what she is saying. She's hella-wise and has a huge heart. <br>

<br>
I'm 17 bro, graduated from high school and leaving for college Tuesday so you can at least know I am coming from relatively a close age range to you. Traelle was giving you advice, good advice, and surmising your current situation. Sure man, your mom is at home with you and respects your privacy, but what Traelle is saying that she really should be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>there.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Valquiss was right, and I know I am guilty of the same things sometimes myself. You seek validation so much from the wrong places, and the wrong people, and in the wrong ways. That is why Traelle thought that perhaps your parents should have a stronger presence for your lives bro. Parents can be there, in the same room, in the same house, but that isn't being there for their kid, there is more to it than that.<br>
<br>
Good advice is so damn few and far between bro, and sometimes, no matter where it comes from, listen, Traelle is a good, smart lady. Sure you can say &quot;Oh time's have changed, things work differently now&quot; just like I did a hundred upon a hundred times. But you know, human nature is human nature, and believe it or not, in general, all people go through the same things, end up similar ways, and much can be deduced about the from very little. Wether they group up decades ago or now, it doesn't matter bro. That will click one day, and you'll regret it when you realize you wish you had only listened here and there, I know I sure as hell do hehe.<br>
<br>
Well *cough* I guess my attempt at good advice is done for the day, I'm hungry. <p>===================<br>

I'm not sure of your age but it seems to be part of the theme about any comments about you lately. So I'll put you at 16, give or take a year. That's not a bad thing. But it can work against you if your not careful.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Problem is some of you people are sooo freaking old... that you never keep up with this age... Imformation is more advanced and refined...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Technology is, information is, and even society to a degree. But human nature and how people inter-react to each other has always been and will remain basically the same.<br>
<br>
We're not too old, just for the most part a whole lot older and mature(er?) than you are right now and your looking to interact with us. <br>
<br>
With the exception of those who have diarhea of the mouth (you know the ones, the ones that are reactionary in their posts and replies) Most posters take the time to reread what they are going to post before posting it. That allows them to correct spelling and more importantly reword what they want to say. It means they took the time to consider what they are going to say. Once you click add reply, it's too late to change anything.<br>
<br>
People razz you about your spelling, If you made sure your spelling was correct, you may find what you post starting to get you the reputation you desire and that I know you deserve.<br>
<br>
And to everybody else...lighten up! At his age he is supposed to be wanting to prove something to us.<br>
<br>
Where's my teeth? I just put them down a second ago.<br>

Try to refrain from excessive profanity, people with little value to their opinion and can't argue it effectively tend to start adding a lot of fucks&amp;shits to their comments.<br>
<br>
An obvious lack of profanity can greatly increase a person's opinion of your comments.<br>
<br>
Check it out. go back and read some of the posts of the people you respect the most and you'll probably find little or no swearing.<br>

<br>
I have to agree with Bjond and Traelle.<br>
<br>
If you organized and presented your thoughts in a clear, concise and coherent matter, it wouldn't be a big deal. If you used the spell checker, and capitalized the correct words, then we wouldn't have as much of a problem with what you post. And, if your posts had substance other than: look at me here, then I'm sure people would read over what you had to say.<br>
<br>
Magiith, you need no approval or validation from us. You do however need to like yourself. I'm not sure why you seek out our attention -- and can only think that Traelle has hit very close on the noggin.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you're lonely? Have few friends in RL? Maybe your parents, though there, don't really give you the attention you need? I don't know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But hey, you're not alone -- many folks here probably could say the same. <br>
<br>
But there was no need to get defensive with Traelle or launch an attack -- she wasn't attacking you, but expressing sympathy and understanding and commenting that perhaps things were laid out a certain way in your life.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you are right and your parents trust you implictly with the internet so they never check up on you. But thing is, it isn't about trust. Even the best of people can run into trouble online -- the best of people can become addicted to this beast - and the best of people can ruin their lives over it if limits aren't set.<br>

Stuff that just had no place in the soap box or any other place that I can really think of. Maybe the OOC forum might be a better place for you to spend your time. <br>
<br>
sure, the soap box has almost every person who posts on these boards come by. Every spammer comes and posts his pointless crap here. But that doesnt mean that its a free for all forum. Stuff like this belongs here. Where you have an honest problem with people, in my eyes, is that you take offence to things, much like you did with Traes post. She ment well with her comments. Granted it might have been hard to see, but she ment well and she is a wise woman. I'd listen to her. <br>
<br>
Your still young and have alot of life to go through. You will learn alot during the next 2 years, not to mention the next 4. The person you are now will be a memory when you turn 18. You still have alot of time to mes things up and make them right again. Hell, if I could go back to when I was 14, my life would be alot diffrent than it is now. Its difficult to change mistakes made and evne though I am still young, Im only 22, I am having a hard time swinging my life back in the right direction. <br>
<br>
In my opinion you should head outside more. EQ is a great way to stay out of trouble, it kept me out of trouble when I first started playing, but it can get you into alot of trouble as well. Spending all day on the boards and ingame is alright during the summer and on the week ends but thats about it. Focus on school and your friends. They are what is most important. The next 4ish years of school for you are going to be the most important. They will be a HUGE part of what determains your future. <br>
<br>
EQ is a game. These boards are a way to kill time. Its not a way of life. Took me awhile to learn that. <br>
<br>
Just learn some self control when it comes to posting. Try to be like Irexes, hes a pro board troll. Spends his entire day here. But he doesnt post random crap. Just dont be a such sarcastic jerk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Magiith, worry not. It is not just you that I don't like but in fact an overwhelming majority of all minors in online games. If your parents are not with you at all times policing your online behavior, I don't think you should be allowed online.<br>
<br>
I have a very big beef with SOE's policy towards allowing children to play the game and if I had the money, I would probably litigate to have your right to play the game removed, Magiith. Its not personal, I just don't other peoples' kids in my free time. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

Nakath? What the heck makes you better than a kid? For one, not all people below the age of 18 are immature buttheads that ruin your time (Not saying that Magiith is either) But that statement about kids playing the game is silly, nor do I believe that a parent needs to -constantly- hover over their child's shoulder to monitor what they're doing online -- I mean, if you do that, might as well hover over them while they're playing basketball, or while they're taking a shower or something.<br>
<br>
Honestly, lets not go overboard. While I believe parents should be involved in their child's life, and occasionally walking over to surprise them and check up on what they're doing and read over a little bit what they're saying -- I do not believe it requires constant supervision, nor do I believe that people below the age of 18 should loose their right to play this game.<br>
<br>
You don't have to play with these people if you do not want to, just ignore them.<br>
