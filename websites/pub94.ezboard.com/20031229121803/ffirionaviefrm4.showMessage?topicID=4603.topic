<br>
Ok, story so far yeah? I get a ldon group, they asked me to pull/tank as im of higher season than they, i agree, we go into MM and all is fine, the chanter is lulling, the cleric is healing... then 5 mins later another melee runs infront of me while in mid-pull and gets the attention of the intended mob i was going to pull, and another mob. He pulls them back, we kill them, no-biggies right?<br>
After the kill i said to them all, very politley &quot;Hey guys, so you do get aggro whiles im pulling/tanking, stay behind me ok heheh&quot;<br>
<br>
... No answer ... i'll take it as a yes then. <br>
<br>
All is well again for another 5 mins, then it happens again, melee class runs infront of me in mid-pull, gets adds, brings em back, we kill them (Just) and cleric announces she is OOM... no biggie again right? well it was only (in total) our 6th kill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Think nothing of it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> i said to myself, thinking it was an innocent mistake. We wait for cleric to med up, she announces shes ready (70m) i say &quot;Ok guys, im gonna pull, stay here ok? i'll bring mobs to you&quot;<br>
<br>
... No answer again ... i cast a spell and half way through the same damn melee class runs infront and we get 2 more adds and the intended target, we kill them and by this point im getting slightly annoyed, i ask &quot;Can everyone here understand the language im currently on??&quot; <br>
<br>
... 5 yups ...<br>
<br>
&quot;ok&quot; i say &quot;Well, stay in here while i get the next mob and bring it to you ok?&quot; I go to pull, turn around and the same damn melee is running around behind me like an idiot!, runs infront, pulls instead of me, gets adds, we kill em, so i ask him if he would like to pull.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no, you're higher than me, its your job&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then will you please stay behind me when i pull, that doesnt mean run infront of me and grab adds, it means wait till i bring the mob to you&quot; I replied<br>
<br>
... No response ... But all was good for another 10 mins, then all of a sudden i go to pull, the melee (the annoying one) runs out infront of me and gets 6 adds inc intended mob, of course im running around like a headless chicken trying to get aggro off the cleric why she heals, the melee died instantly, the chanter decides to nuke instead of mez and gets killed, the cleric dies, i harm touch one which kills it, a few slashes on another and it was down... we'll i managed to kill em with 12%hp spare. Im the only one in the ldon by this point, so while bandaging myself up i decide to add humour (and sarcasm) to the moments by saying:<br>
<br>
&quot;See, this is what happens when you dont stay behind me when i tell you too&quot;<br>
<br>
Annoying melee (lets call him AD) replies with &quot;YOU NEVER TOLD US TOO!! IM SO P**SED RIGHT NOW!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
of course, i reply &quot;Uhmm... yes i did, about 3 or 4 times, you just didnt listen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, we didnt listen to you because your being an asshole! yelling out orders like that, we know what were doing y'know we have done ldon before!! Now were going to lose because of you!&quot; says AD<br>
<br>
&quot; ... and thats why your dead right now is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
**More argumentitive text** <br>
<br>
My point being here, i felt like a complete ass because i had to keep telling them what to do repetedly, i left them to their own devices and they get killed so we try the tactical way and they dont like it at all, then i realised, the only reason i felt i was being an ass was because they were making me into one by not listening to me.<br>
Dont get me wrong one bit, i enjoy the fun of ldon, its not about winning, its about taking part and to me, as long as your in a good group and you all have fun, then the win is just an added bonus.<br>
<br>
The problem with this group is they all had online personalities of goldfish, im sure many more of you have come across groups that when you join, you just know it isnt going to be fun.<br>
<br>
I just so needed to rant about this, its been annoying me for a time now... thanks for listening heheh<br>
<br>
Sunosan<br>
<br>
P.s - just so you know, after waiting 20 mins for them to come back, the chanter decided he was a tank, so i said to him &quot;WoW i didnt know chanters could tank and hold aggro!!&quot; to which he replied &quot;We cant&quot;. so i said &quot;Damn... looks like you're screwd now then&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.myimgs.com/data/skadii/sunosanwoo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oliiasmoorglade>OliiasMoorglade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 810<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/9/03 10:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4603.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thephosphorbox.com/cptrply-small.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: &quot;YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING ME LOOK LIKE AN ASS!!!&quot;</span><hr size=1> That's ok I was in an LDoN last night with a 51 Shadow Knight that didn't know he could snare things.  Yes, seriously.  He had no idea.. he said he couldn't do it.. we told him he could with the Darkness line of spells.. he didn't know which one we were talking about.  I kid you not.<br>
<br>
Then to add insult to injury, we had a cleric who was attempting to heal us using the damn clicky pants with the AOE 105pt heal on them.  Listen sister, it's a 12 second cast time and I'm getting pounded for 200 a pop.  Do the math..<br>
<br>
NO MORE pickup LDoNs with people I don't know.. <br>
<br>
EVER.<br>

I would have told the group right after your first warning &quot;If you don't listen to the MT you will not be healed and will get a 0% Rez at the end of the adventure&quot; <br>

Granted, we didn't win every one of them, but definitely most. And it was great meeting new people, learning different ways of doing things, and really having fun doing it all. <br>
So I'm not sure if I'm only invited by the good groups, or it's only the bad ones that make it to the soapbox. But for all of you saying I won't join a pickup group as they all suck, I'm here to tell you it isn't true. Some are great, and that's the only way you're going to make new friends. Grouping only with people you know tends to limit exposure to new people.<br>
<br>
For example just last night, had a pickup group in Miragul's. Slaughter mission. A few mobs before we finish the MT (a ranger, mind you, who didn't even die on the adventure, imagine that) goes LD. Without a hitch, the necro gets to tank, while I'm doing the damage. Pulls continue steadily and we finish the adventures successfully, with nearly 20 minutes to spare. <br>
<br>
Don't give up on pickup groups. <br>

anyway, yea you get some where they all have no personality and wizards w/ no concussion over 60 (*COUGH* YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE) and people who wanna just try to ghetto pac their way through the whole damn dungeon instead of *gasp* mezzing an add.  <br>

If nothing else, they should've said something if they disagreed.   Being quiet = agreement. Their own darn fault.<br>
<br>
That and... Running in front of the puller is ALWAYS a bad idea.<br>
<br>
Heck in some cases you want to keep a nice distance from the puller at all times, so you don't accidentally run in where they are sneaking/invis/pacifying and aggro the stuff that they managed to avoid... aka don't follow the monk unless they tell you it's ok!<br>
<br>
That said, I've had pretty good luck with my pickups... in general if I'm organizing, I try to get at least 1 or 2 folks that I know, then that sets the general tone (the &quot;strangers&quot; question you less).  The more folks you don't know or haven't worked with before, the more you need to expect a few minutes at the beginning to iron out the 'kinks'.<br>
<br>
And kinks exist even in the best groups.... I found one group that was so used to working without a slower, that if I actually slowed fast that the ranger root parking was having a tougher time.. so I did the unthinkable and delayed my slows =P<br>
<br>
Then there's the times I realize the tank hasn't got a chance in hell of holding aggro... time to slow while standing really close to the mob, so I'm tanking half the time. <br>
<br>
Or when I realize I really do need all my heals up... (rare)<br>
<br>
Or the times I loaded all my heals and realize that quiescence (heal over time) is actually sufficient to heal the warrior... the entire dungeon I supplemented quiescence oh.... twice? with my 1300 pt heal.  And the closest thing to another healer was a beastlord... <br>
<br>
Or the time that I was with another shaman and got to play druid... that was interesting but worked really well.  The other shaman did all the slowing etc, and I loaded my rains and nukes and blasted away.<br>
<br>
I've had groups pacify, others that mezzed, some with a monk pulling... then there's the groups where there's no version of crowd control whatsoever and you get to practice your root parking... These are the ones where the scared folks run away before even joining the adventure *grin* (or mysteriously go LD)   (Ps: I got a good win ratio and I'm NOT uber... I'm missing 3 out of 5 of my 65 spells, I don't have ornate armor or LDoN armor (yet) etc... )<br>
<br>
Ps: other shamans reading this... get virulent paralysis. It's nice for a quick root park.<br>
<br>
I have fun figuring out the appropriate tactic for each group I'm in.<br>
<br>
I even got to tank an assassination mob once... yep... you heard me... a shaman tanking that oh so hard assassination mob.  (So much for the scaredy cat tanks that don't want to tank an assassination mob.  Pfft... stay away from me wimp!) The paladin had died right away thanks to harmtouch (oops)... and this was a hard mission, our average had been around 61 or 62 so we got a 63+ dungeon... and *gasps* it was guk, too.  Okay, so we lost it but we did get the consolation price.  Only reason we lost is because we had a 50/50 chance at the right path and took the wrong one to clear =P (It was an official event, everyone had to go into a &quot;hard&quot; dungeon and count deaths... we only had 2 *sighs*. Got &quot;yelled&quot; at for almost winning, too... )<br>

Just this past week Gerda found it was up at 2am EST time so I brought Zippus all the way over and got the stupid thing done.  As a side note the bastard repopped immediately upon turn in... I blasted his ass with Agnarr's.  So satisfying.<br>

Trick is to have at least 3 folks in the group you know/respect. Odds are out of the 3 strangers, only 1 will suck, and only maybe.

<br>
I do pickup groups quite often(odd schedule, random neuron firings making decisions for me) and have to say I've had overall more good experiences than bad. Sure, the occasional group just doesn't work out, but its a learning experience regardless. Oftentimes I'll even take it upon myself to try and teach the &quot;offender&quot; some tricks(the few I know, I don't claim to be some sort of EQ expert), that is if they aren't boorish jagoffs to begin with. <br>
<br>
Just thought I'd present my take on it, as every time one of these discussions comes up invariably people tend to go with the &quot;never do pickup groups&quot; mantra. It's hard to meet new people(and get groups!) in an environment where people feel pickup groups are surefire tests of aggravation. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viala>Viala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rogue with a heart</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/03 4:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4603.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Pickup groups...</span><hr size=1> I don't quite understand people who have a desperate aversion to pickup groups.<br>
<br>
Yes, it's best fun of all to hunt with friends, with people who entertain you, whose company you know you enjoy. But how are you to meet such people in the first place, if you don't ever group with strangers?<br>
<br>
After all, with the exception of those who come to the game to join RL friends, everyone's network must once have begun with a pickup group. When I started on FV two years ago I had never played an online game before and knew nobody at all. I couldn't possibly recount all the fun people I've got to know since then, mostly by going out there and mixing.<br>
