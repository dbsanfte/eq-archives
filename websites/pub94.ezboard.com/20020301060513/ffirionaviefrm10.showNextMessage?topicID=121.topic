<br>
Most do not remember House Dracul.  It's original name is no longer able to be found.  On a random voyage they happened to crashland upon Velious.  There a dragon attacked them without regard for the fact that these people were wanderers.  As unlikely as it sounds the great dragon Veeshan saved this family and asked for a pledge.  A pledge to serve and worship her.  Thus they were renamed House Dracul or House of the Dragon.  Sheltered by the dragons House Dracul became very prosperous.  I am the last princess of House Dracul.  With prosperity comes disregard.  My father came to wish for more power ... whether this was because there was something he desired or rather because he was spoiled I do not know.  In his lust for power he first beseeched Lady Veeshan who turned down his desires with a scolding.  He then turned to the god of the Teir'Dal of Neriak.  He turned to Prince Innoruuk who inacted a small price.  In return for his power he must give into making House Dracul worship Innoruuk.  This my father gladly accepted and that was the day that House Dracul started to crumble.<br>
<br>
When Lady Veeshan heard of this she was outraged.  Her faithful servants who she had protected and granted care of her dragons to ... turned away to the God of Hate.  With this knowledge there is only one payment for betrayal ... a swift death.  She sent forth the dragon armies who quickly destroyed every defense House Dracul had ... the power that Innoruuk had granted to my father was no where to be seen ...<br>
<br>
<br>
This was because I myself had already confronted my father.  The man who had destroyed my family had angered my Goddess and had turned into a monster that hated everything before him was no longer a man I could allow rule House Dracul and was no longer my father.  Pretending to worship Innoruuk he let his defenses down enough for me to cast a spell of mesmerisation upon him.  Much more than a simple charm this spell would hold him still and let me tell him why.  My words were simple for destroying my family and everything I had ever cared for I was going to send him to meet Innoruuk with a message I have .... that message being that one day I will stand above your corpse and laugh at the true power of Veeshan.  With that said I slit his throat with his own dagger and slumped to the floor waiting for the dragon armies to finish the house and myself off.<br>
<br>
As fate would have it Veeshan was watching the throne room when this event took place.  She took me away and we spoke as I trembled before the Goddess.  She told me I was to no longer worship her but rather to see her as my mistress.  She will look after me but no powers will be granted to me.  She said I would have to work very hard to regain the trust of the dragons.  She would deposit me in Neriak where hate for Innoruuk is common place even as they worship him.  She allowed me to live knowing that one day I would fulfill my vow I made to stand over his corpse.<br>
<br>
With that I found myself at the Nektulos wizard pyramid confused and looked down to see my favorite rose, the one I always wore on my robes, to be stained with the blood from my father.  The black blood of hate, the blood of Innoruuk had stained my rose and in that it has turned me, Zsuzsana Dracul, into the Blackened Rose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uspirits101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spirits101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/9/02 7:36:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Rose</span><hr size=1> All of the stories I have read so far, give great motivations for the characters.
