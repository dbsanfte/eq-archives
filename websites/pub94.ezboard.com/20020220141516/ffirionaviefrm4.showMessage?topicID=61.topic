 So ill just post here and see what people think about it.<br>
----<br>
 I been wondering if EQ ever thought about a samurai like class. Ive seen many people who would love to see that.. and even some trying to roleplay it - but it its very hard.<br>
 There isnt any class who is close to that, we have rogues who can safe fall, hide and sneak.. but the way they fight doesn´t really match with a samurai concept. Bards get some of rogue skills also, but level cap is really low. Warriors are just fighters who couldnt sneak even like an elephant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , well and monks are just warriors that dont use weapons.<br>
 I cant understand why no online rpg game that is coming or been arround ever had a class like that, since many people would love that.<br>
 Anyway, the main reason you cant roleplay a class like that its because, well, if you want to be make a character who wants to find eternal life, maybe a necromancer following miragul´s step would do it. If you want a greedy quick card player, maybe a rogue will do it. But still, you can be any of that, just bending a little bit if you want to play any other class.<br>
 Now a samurai style of life is directly related to his body and skills. You cant be one and not be worried about seeing everything arround you, slashing your opponent so fast that he could not see you, being able to walk almost as invisible...<br>
 Well, anyway.. this kind of class should and would be something very different from the common classes of fantasy online roleplaying games. <br>
 So, again what I want to know is if EQ ever had any interest on that? Is it possible for this class to be in a game like everquest?<br>
 I think EQ would give another great step into online rpg gaming by adding this unique and desirable class.<br>
-----<br>
 Ack, for me EQ not having a ninja class is like you coming and having no casters, or something like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

*shrug* maybe I'm wrong, but it looks like you want a Ninja class and not a samurai...if ya want the Ninja type, I think you could make a Rogue out to be one.<br>

I thought about that before <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . But even a samurai that is just a swordsman is very different from a warrior, since they should be very skilled ( in a way that couldnt fit EQ ).<br>
 A rogue wouldnt do it tough, they cant really swing 1hs weapons... and well, they fight like rogues. <br>
 I think a ninja class should have at least safe fall, hide and sneak, and not skills from monks. Monks are good in delivering damage.  A ninja should be good at defense as well. Maybe some skills that are defensive instead of offensive would be really fun and different. <br>
 Im trying a monk this time, seens ok, her name is Linse. Still its not what im looking for.<br>
  What I would really  love to play ( not only in EQ ) is a character that could also jump a little better, run ( not sneak ) in silence, use most type of weapons... maybe for a assassin type having some good damage skills ( like backstab ) and having a better defense than fighter classes.<br>
  But that would make a good fighter solo class like a necromancer is great caster.<br>
  Pity I cant see how that would fit everquest. If we want class balance we cant have warrior class who can damage and play tank ( we have meat shield warriors already ).<br>
 What should a ninja class do in a group!?! Maybe a bit of all like druids?<br>

<br>
A Samurai is a cultural (Japanese) Warrior.  They follow a code of honor and rules that are specific to their culture, but there is nothing special about them that you couldn't play a Warrior as a Samurai.<br>
<br>
Your initial post seems to indicate you think Samurai should have stealth ability, I disagree.  The Samurai are all about honorable combat, so no Stealth skills are required.  In fact, Asian style weapons have been introduced, so that you could adapt your Warrior to a Samurai mode somewhat in EQ.<br>
<br>
But ultimately to answer your question there are no Samurai because Samurai are Warriors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urevler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>revler</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/23/01 9:18:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Noooo</span><hr size=1>  Ok, this is a mess!<br>

Make a warrior &lt;or a hybrid if you want to cast spells like the video games&gt;, go to Stonebrunt mountains at 20'ish level and do the Wakizashi of the frozen sky quest.  Walk around with the sword and say you are a samurai.  That is the closest you'll get in EQ =). Just like what was said earlier, the Samurai are nothing more than elite swordsman the equivalent of european knights, I would gather.<br>

Their skills revolved around concealment, moving undetected and moving through / across / around improbable barriers.  They were of course accomplished fighters - and used a number of tricks to confuse / scare their opponents and make them seem invincible as well as unusual equipment to give them an edge.  None the less - they were aimed at sneaking into enemy encampments and assassinating their target.<br>
<br>
Samurai, as several here have said, are warriors that follow the code of Bushido - the way of the warrior.  Their skills revolved around supreme excellence with their swords, Katana and Wakizashi (the daisho) and (to a much lesser extent) the Daikatana.  (nb The Katana is a 2 handed weapon - but Miyamoto Musashi (the sword saint) used and wrote about the use of the katana as a one handed weapon - weilding a bokken (a bamboo training sword) in his off hand).<br>
<br>
Samurai also mastered the use of the bow and were accomplished horsemen.  Ronin is a samurai who has lost / abandoned / been abandoned by his lord - Ronin was a bad thing to be, and many resorted to banditry.<br>
<br>
What you are seeking as a character class is the movie / anime ninja or samurai.  These characters are very entertaining - and I can imagine plenty of games centering on them - but they are portrayed with a skill set that will simply never work in a multiplayer / multiclass system.  They are designed to be and act as loners - with incredible skills in a number of fields.  (You are looking for something that has the attack capability of a monk, defense of a warrior and movement advantages better than a rogue - not going to happen).<br>
<br>
Personally I was disappointed when I discovered that monks couldnt use any 1hs weapons - a monk in panther skin armour with a couple of katanas wouldnt be unbalancing (so long as the 1hs weapons available to them were carefully selected) and would be a great deal of fun to play. <p><B>Gray Hateborn</B><BR>

Whips could have a specialty affect.  Plus safe fall and sneak as mentioned before.<br>
<br>
This would be a nice touch and critical hits for certain weapon types that they have specialized in.  Say, for example they could only get critical hits in the first weapon in which their skill was brought above 100, and no other weapon type after.  Additionally they could have a build it agility bonus allowing them a faster run by default, though not quite a fast as a spirit of wolf buff.<br>
<br>
Well, those are my 2 pp.<br>

 Aye... im aware of that, sort of <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 In a way, if we imagine druids they seen very powerfull ( well, I think they kind are, I never played till high level because I hate all classes hehe ) but still they have balance in the game. Perhaps a class that can do damage almost as good as monk, defend almost as good as warrior and have some unique skills wouldnt make them that powerfull, perhaps powerfull to solo but still with class balance.<br>
  And oh well, paladins can Loh, monks mend, theres harmtouch.. some few nice abilites to a Jubei-anime fighter type wouldnt hurt!<br>
 Anyway, I hope if some class like that ever come to EQ, they wont be humans because human male is ugly like a troll!<br>
