<br>
We are writing our rule policy right now, so I don't want to get into too much detail, but some of the highlights will include: <br>
<br>
Stricter interpretation of what acceptable names are <br>
Transfer of disruptive players to other servers <br>
<br>
Tighter scrutiny of the open channels <br>
<br>
We also have plans for more GM interaction with this server, once we see if this server can be a success story. Not to say there won't be events on the regular servers, far from it. But the future holds more interaction than our standard.<br>
<br>
Asked what acceptable names are and what not on Percival, she replied:<br>
<br>
For instance - say someone insisted on having the name &quot;Milken Cookys.&quot; I think that's funny. I know people with names like that. They are great people, and fun to hang out with. But many roleplayers would consider that disruptive - so we would gently suggest to Mr. Cookys that he might be happier on another server where the environment is a little looser, where the roleplayers are not as... strict. We would of course offer Mr. Cookys the opportunity to change his name if he'd prefer. <br>
<br>
Or let's say someone was talking in /broadcast about how Michael Jordan's comeback. This is perfectly okey dokey in my world - but a stricter roleplayer would have an aneurysm. Maybe our sports fan would be happier on another server.<br>

<br>
The naming and ooc spam policy is one that I suggested in feedback long ago. I think it's an excellent method of dealing with anti-RPers.<br>
<br>
Also please note that there is absolutely no cringing &quot;well we don't want to offend the jerk community&quot; or &quot;well how can you really define roleplaying&quot; sort of language. They understand the needs of roleplayers and are supporting it. Clearly their examples aren't roleplaying. Period. And they also seem to understand that event driven play is another need.<br>
<br>
Of course, VI will claim in language worthy of Pravda that this is already the case on all of their servers...<br>
<br>
Mind you, I have little interest in a Camelot theme and zero interest in a game where PVP is mandatory. I much prefer the background and classic D&amp;D/fantasy classes and races of EQ. I just think that what they are doing is GREAT and should be emulated by every MMPORPG company. <p>Numtini Lightheart <br>

I personally would like to see a *facist* response.  The rules are pretty black and white.  The response should be the same.  Put them in a Box imediately.   &quot;Cyberman&quot; is obviously not a RP name, and the player knows that when they created the character.  The GM's dont need to hold counsil to discuss it. Pull the character until the player picks a sutible RP name OR -- Automatically generate one for them.<br>

Some cases it has some background in others its just oh god Everquest is too hard let's do this.<br>
<br>
Example 1:  I hear this all the time,  Damn twinks always going out and farming for their little guys.  How many people here like the TLC which I can assure you gets rid of most twinks.  Personally I love the TLC and with making everything TLC you just have to add the fact that things will be No Drop.  Making great items decay is lame.  Oh wait let's not forget something it's not super hard to get those special items   <br>
<br>
Example 2: Man tradeskills are so lame you cannot use any of the stuff.  Well untwinked tradeskills are very nice.  And just a quick question what is the joy of a caster class slaying another caster in a fight just to find that hey he is wearing a crappy robe the one my tradeskill buddy just made for me is 10x better.<br>
<br>
Example 3: Okay so you do not like camping mobs well what is DAoC solution ah you won't have to kill things for experience let's make it almost completely quest based which I imagine will be for some fun but you wanna know where I see the most fun being.  Don't camp in a zone go around looking wander zones and kill random mobs that attack you or for some reason don't fit your fancy.  Example of this, Group of 6 Teir'Dal start walking out from Nektulos and come across some orcs who attack them slay them and keep moving go into Western Commonlands, (if high enough to slay the guards) one of them can talk some trash to a guard who has obviously offended him and the group can kill the guards giving a high five to Kidzean Gix as they walk to Kithicor.  When they get through Kith and Highhold maybe they see a bear in the Karanas who one warrior shoots with his bow for fun and draws the ire of the nature loving fools who would stand against them.  The war party proceeds to rip her to shreds and enjoy a good jest about it.  <br>
<br>
Sound like fun to anyone here?  I tried to get friends together to do this on Tholuxe Paells but most were interested in getting items and while this has the oppurtunity to find items you won't get the phat lewt of camping an item til a named spawn pops.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I seem critical of DAoC but from everything released it seems like it was programmed by a few ex Eq players who wanted to be uber d00ds and couldn't keep up with the rest.  Don't even get me started on the lameness of their experience death /pray,<br>

My guess is those who hate PvP have never played UO...  or maybe they have.<br>
<br>
In UO, PvP was less harsh (IMO).  Reason being is that the items you found in UO (through Dungeon Crawling and what not) were nothing big to worry about if you lost them.  They were all pretty much common or easy to get.  Now in EQ, losing a SSoY to some PvPer could be quite upsetting because you have to invest a lot of time in getting said item.  Where as if you lost your &quot;Critical Short Sword of Slaying&quot; in UO, you could just pop into your local dungeon and find one that is similiar in a matter of minutes.<br>
<br>
One thing I hated about PKing (or PvPers) in UO was the grief player.  The person who just PKed because he wanted to upset other people.  However, if I died from someone who actually role-played it out and such, I would be less upset.<br>
<br>
This is what I believe DAoC (and to some extent the PvP servers in EQ) try to enforce.  Don't go around believing that PvP is the same in every online game out there, you could be missing out on something.<br>
<br>
Personally I'm the type of person who doesn't like competitive video games.  If there was a sports game, I'd prefer to play on the same team as my friend rather then against them.  Same thing with RPGs.  I tend to prefer to play WITH other people against the computer then AGAINST other people and the computer.  However, I have had the BEST times of my online time spent with friends chasing down PKers in UO.  Did we succeed?  Not too often.  But when we did, boy was it a rush and you sure got a sense of fulfillment. <p><BR>

There is only PvP in certain areas, and you never have to go to those areas.  Not everyone will like it, and I agree that this isn't the spot to go into a great DAoC v EQ debate.  This is an EQ board.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, don't condemn it if you haven't tried it.  There are no abuses of chat channels there, although they do have them in limited capacity.  There is minimal twinking even allowed by the game.  There is an incredible difference in the swing between competition and cooperation.  Many, many, many more people roleplay on the roleplay servers.  In guild last night a former critic of DAoC who was trying it out for her first week said &quot;ok, ok, but I can still grumble that you can't change the size of your chat box&quot;.  We showed her how.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Plain and simple - Dark Age is NOT for everybody.  Then again, 95% of the people that I know from EQ have decided to either make Dark Age their primary or only game after a week or so of getting used to the differences.  If you don't like it, that's great too.  No one said you had to.  But being condemning it without giving it a chance is pretty toddler-ish to me. &quot;No, I won't eat my vegetables!&quot;  If you try it and hate it, then kudos to you!  (you know, those little desert bars... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Seriously, I would think this belongs in the OT/OOC forum.  There certainly doesn't need to be a DAoC forum, though.  I would love to answer any questions folks might have about the game.  janti_eorl@yahoo.com  The RP server rules are being ENFORCED, but you can't condemn a lack of enforcement on this server simply because Verant didn't have the peanuts to actually make it a Roleplay Server.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey guys, ya know, we can appease these whiney roleplayers (after two years) by finally givin' them a server with the roleplay name on it, but if we put PREFERRED at th' end, we don't actually have to do schnitzel about it if peoples don' roleplay, hehe... pass the cheetos&quot;  I still love the atmosphere of this server more than any other, and for more reasons than I am allowed to go into here, but you have to admit Verant did a half arse job of it.  Oh well, it's all we have.<br>
<br>

<br>
Some of us can't afford or have time to play two pay-for-play games, or even 'try it and see'.  I barely have time for one character on a &quot;normal&quot; server and one on Firiona Vie!  I've no problem with DAoC...it looks like a cool game, and I'm happy that some people want to play it and EQ, or even DAoC instead, but why do people insist on spreading the joys of DAoC all over EQ message boards, and sneering at the 'idiots still taking whatever crap Verant feeds them'?<br>
<br>
I realize this thread was perhaps started for different reasons - it *does*, perhaps, give us leverage with Verant to push for a real RP server.  Jantis hit the nail on the head - they did a half-arsed job on Firiona Vie by making it &quot;RP preferred&quot; so as to A. Not piss anyone off and B. Not have to work to enforce anything.  It's so obvious they can hardly argue that they didn't do it so as to minimize their workload.<br>
<br>
That's not to say that telling them this would accomplish anything, but I still keep making my thoughts known to them.  I'm not expecting them to listen, per se, but I keep trying.<br>
<br>
Yet despite it all, I'm sticking it out.  I like EQ, generally.  I like Firiona Vie even more...hell, I've had some really fun experiences so far.  I bet I'd like DAoC just as much, if not more, but I have a real life to consider, both in terms of time and finances.  *wry grin*<br>
<br>
All my love to DAoC fans...just don't harass me for sticking it out with EQ.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, I'm all for a fascist response, too.  Naming is a bit rough...I'll give them one opportunity to change it.  But ooc behaviour over shout/auction deserves one warning, then a character deletion.  On the positive side, though, I've noticed more and more that OOC shouts in FV get flat ignored - like &quot;Dings!&quot; and d00d speak.<br>

<br>
Believe me, if it weren't for a few things, I wouldn't have been able to do both either.  I'm very fortunate to have such an opportunity.<br>
<br>
I was in Dark Age beta just as the 4th Beta came out, so I've got a couple of months experience working with the development team and there is simply a world of difference in the approach.  I am not saying this to rub it in... I am saying it with hope that Verant will get it's act together.  <br>
<br>
In the same turn, I have worked closely with most facets of EverQuest behind the scenes, and I can say from my experiences that the developers, guides and GMs all are doing the absolute best they can.  It is up to the corporation of Verant to wake up and change their policies and approach.  The paid staff as well as the volunteers get a lot of grief over simply doing their jobs.  The number one bottleneck with EverQuest is the top brass.  The situation now is that Dark Age is just the first of the games coming out that are specifically targeting the two years of complaints against the design of EQ and will be syphoning out players... and believe me when it isn't the punks and griefers that are flooding to Dark Age.  Why would they, when they are being forced to follow the rules and are limited in how they can screw people over?  They may as well stay in EQ, where they can get away with it.<br>
<br>
I love EverQuest, and I remember when it was light years ahead of anything else out there, including UO.  But Verant has sat like a fat cat and ignored their customer's begging and pleading and are about to see the results.  I hope for everyone's sake that this is the 'first step' for Verant getting a change in attitude and fixing the problems not only in the game design, but in the approach to customer service (the rules, not the people).<br>
<br>
Can someone move this to the OC or Soapbox section?

<br>
I like EQ and DAOC both. Mostly doing DAOC right now because it's new and all.<br>
<br>
I'm keeping my EQ account too, though. At least, for a couple of months minimum. FV server is fun, and we have a huge guild Christmas event on Rathe coming up, so have to be there for that, too.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ is better than DAOC in content, and in society; as in, the society of friends, guilds, and acquaintances that you have built up over time.<br>
<br>
DAOC is better than EQ in class development, game design, and roleplay atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Of course, that's just my .02.    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table>

I don't know what it is, I just got really bored and uninterested to the point that I just refused to log in.  Even though I kept reading the beta boards and hubby talked non-stop about the game.

<br>
I've never really pinpointed exactly what it is that I dislike.  People have asked me this repeatedly and I have no solid answer.  The graphics are good, the scenery is great, the concepts are organized, mythic is a great company that listened to its beta testers, the playability is easy.<br>

There's just something that makes me just scream inside.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Now I know that Shadowbane will be the next game I put time into and we're waiting for hubby to get into the beta, he just updated his beta info so we're looking forward to seeing how that game goes.  I guess I just like EQ, even with all its quirkiness and problems.  I started playing online games with Meridian59 and the community was so close, and when a server matures on EQ it is nice, like that community feeling.

She also couldn't pinpoint what she doesn't like, though it is my feeling that she has just never been big on change, and she has put two years into EQ and doesn't want to give it up.<br>
<br>
She's never been disenchanted with the 'end game' (Gah, I hate that term... I want a living world, not Doom: Final Level!), she has kept her distance from most of the politics *cough* and she has never had a problem looking for groups.  I, on the other hand, get wrapped up in the politics too much, had to accept that EverQuest forced an end game and forced your role in that end game, and I also hate the who LFG thing.<br>
<br>
I think part of it too is that even in Beta, I had friends playing and didn't have to feel alone, while most of her friends were still in EverQuest.  Now, many of her friends have moved to Dark Age, but I think she's kind of happy with the break there as well.<br>
<br>
Overall, I have never kidded myself that everyone is going to love Dark Age.  They have implemented some of the things we grumbled for in Dark Age Beta (like the friends list, yay!) and actually it's nicer than EQ had.  It tells you when a friend logs in and leaves and also has a little screen you can turn on to see your friends that are online.<br>
<br>
I think my attitude was that I loved the EverQuest community, but was completely fed up with the game and the lack of interest I saw in changing the problems in the game.  Those that don't like Dark Age tend to not be impacted by all of those game-related problems of EQ.  The one comment people make about a weakness in Dark Age is a sense of community.  UO people said the same thing about EQ in its first six months.  But we made our community there, and we are making it in Dark Age as well.<br>
<br>
So don't feel alone.  I think you would see a different issue when it comes to the community already, but then again maybe you wouldn't.  It's not going to be a game for everyone, but then no game will be.  Some people swore they would never leave UO for EQ, and some of them never did.  That's the beauty and bane of the human spirit - we aren't all the same.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The server politics drove me nuts esp since I was a guild leader on torvon for 8 months, but overall the problems with EQ really have never bothered me.  I accept them for how they are and just live with it.  I was a guide on veeshan and druzzil ro for awile and have been in the customer service part of EQ and had my head torn off by the players because I was unable to do this or that and it never bothered me at all.  I just looked at being a guide as doing what I could and if that wasn't enough it wasn't my fault.  *hehe* <br>
<br>
I just have a real high tolerance for different people and personalities and game wise?  Like I said I played M59 and 3do was way worse than VI when it comes to service and game, so I learned just to ignore the parent company and just concentrate on how I play the game and enjoy just being in the game no matter how good or crappy the game is set up.  Its the people and experiences that I enjoy and look forward to when I log on.  Everything is just a technicality and I am very adaptable.<br>
<br>
