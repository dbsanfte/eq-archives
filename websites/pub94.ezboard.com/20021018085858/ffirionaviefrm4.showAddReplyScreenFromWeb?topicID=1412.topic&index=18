  Re: GM pettiness is what </span><hr size=1> I don't think the original thread by Severine was blaming or slandering all the guides and Elders, just a particular few and the circumstances that were beyond her control.<br>
<br>
 I've had 4 petitions total in the year I've been playing EQ-2 on this server, which were handled promptly and courteously, and 2 on Tribunal, only one of which was answered and fixed (text from an NPC was wrong. Had to misspell a word to get the quest triggered). The other was some minor items that poofed when I was transfering them to the bank and went LD. Never did get an answer to that one. Not a big deal in my world. But, there has been a noticible decline in the timeliness (sp?) of answers to requests since SOE eliminated so many GM's.<br>
<br>
 Severine does raise some valid points about the lack of integrity in customer service for EQ. So, you want to charge $40 dollars for a name change, which is being done for free now. Inform your customers of the new policy-don't lie to the guides and say it's become impossible to do so, for programming reasons, and then start charging money for a sevice that was previously free. It makes the guides and GM's look like they are part of a conspiracy to rip off the paying customers. That is something I would take exception to, myself.<br>
<br>
Maybe the guides on this server are so much nicer, because they don't have to deal with the whiny ass riff-raff that exist on the blue servers. <br>

Never roleplayed with him personally, but I've got to sit in on a little, and read about much more...it's great to see someone thusly promoted taking the time to not only do their job, but to roleplay as well.<br>
<br>
Can't say much for the other guides I've talked to, as my experience is quite limited..but they were never rude to me and always seemed at least apologetic if they couldn't help me.  I was quite impressed with one guide telling me straight up that nothing would likely be done, but that he/she was sorry for how I was treated and apologized for getting back to me so late (about 4 hours late).<br>
<br>
What gets me upset aren't guides though...it is VI themselves.  I can't even direct anger at GMs...only having read a few bad things about them, never seeing anything firsthand...it just seems to me that VI has very bad customer service policies and they will continue to do so because they have us eating out of the palms of their hands (us meaning collective customers, not just FV) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 900<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 2:05:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I can't understand why anyone ..</span><hr size=1> .. would want to be a guide.  A guide's basic job it so to be shit on by pissed off players so the GM doesn't have to deal with it.  Guides have pretty much zero power.  They can't really do a damn thing but help people that are stuck in the geometry and (if they wish) add their voice to yours when you need  GM.<br>
<br>
For the most part -- one on one -- GMs are pretty good.  After playing on Legends, though, you really learn about the good ones and the bad ones.  Some of the processes VI has in place are really awful, too.  For instance, did you know that if you complain about a GM the compaint gets routed to the GM and not his superior?  Guess what the GM does with it?  Also, GMs pretty much make up the rules as they go along.  They are often completely unaware of the published rules (a guildie has screenshots of a GM asking where the rules were posted and she wasn't joking).<br>
<br>
Does this mean all GMs are bad?  No, many are nice people trying to help make the game more fun.  It does mean that the GM support team is FAR from a proffesional operation, though.  You are not customers and they are not support; you are a player and they are the Game Masters.  Considering all the scamming and shit they put up with, I'm not surprised, but I do wish it was more of a customer/client relationship. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udamienlogos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damien Logos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.jsspace.com/lommtwt/attackrlocke.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 2:57:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://razza.org/ephestione/Download/Pictures/Fantasy/WomenandBeasts/images/strahd.jpg width=93 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I can't understand why anyone ..</span><hr size=1> Lemme cover that, Bjond =D<br>
<br>
1)  Guides like helping people.  The reason most of them quit is because players yell at them too much, and they get burnt out.  That doesn't happen much here.<br>
<br>
2)  Guides do have power.  KS issues (not many on FV), rezzes due to 10k falls, rezzes due to server crashes, corpses lost at sea, summoning people from geometry... and most of all, answering questions.  According to Thrads, 70% of petitions are questions, not issues.<br>
<br>
3)  GMs have a set policy.  It's called the Policies &amp; Procedures, which is 100+ Pages long.<br>
<br>
4)  GMs who bend it aren't doing their jobs.<br>
<br>
5)  Complaining about GMs does not go to the GM.  A copy of the letter is fwded to them, but the correct email to use is... umm... I'd have to ask Thrads.  It's like GScotto@soe.sony.com or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udamienlogos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damien Logos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.jsspace.com/lommtwt/attackrlocke.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 3:02:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://razza.org/ephestione/Download/Pictures/Fantasy/WomenandBeasts/images/strahd.jpg width=93 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I can't understand why anyone ..</span><hr size=1> Oh, Ish.<br>

I don't know which dwarf you're talking about, unless you mean the one that died on an island.  Had it been in the water, they could have dragged it to land, but that's about it.<br>

Guides are not allowed to Guide on their play server.  Also, think about it a sec.  No power?  If that were true, I guarentee you that 1/8 of the server would still be stuck under the world, epic pieces would be lost, corpses would be gone forever, and thus cause people to leave...<br>
<br>
Here's how Guide characters are made.  The Guide is given an account flagged as free.  They make a character normally, on their assigned server (which is not allowed to be one where they have characters), and then have a GM summon them up, and flag them as a Guide.  Yes, it's all checked on their play accounts, and they're not allowed to transfer there.<br>
<br>
Also.  Guides have to spend 6 weeks as Apprentice Guides.  If they look like they'll abuse the program, and help friends who have moved there because of them, they will be removed.  The Apprentices have no power.<br>

<br>
Damien never said Guide abuse never happened.  Unfortunately, there are very few Guides who do abuse the system.  Fortunately, these are few and far between.  Guides are screened during their Apprentice training.  Should a Guide be caught breaking the rules and policies set by Verant, such as Severine was, then the consequences are typically severe and could lead to dismissal from the Program.  One must, after all, be accountable for one's actions.<br>
<br>
I've seen both Thrads and Elli, as well as other Guides grant GM ressurections, rescue helpless players from beneath the fabric of the world, resolve camp disputes as well as KS issues.  I've seen Senior Guides grant surname changes, and do all of the above.<br>
<br>
Didi-  Elli says &quot;Thank you!!&quot; and sends a BIG HUG! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW-  Speaking of, I had an interesting conversation with Elli last night.<br>
<br>
She told me that she had come close to resigning from the Guide Program after she had read that post.  I asked her if she had really wanted to quit.<br>
<br>
She was silent for a few moments then she responded.  &quot;No.  I do not want to quit.  If I quit, then they win.  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ENJOY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> being a Guide.  I enjoy helping and interacting with the players, especially here on Firiona.  It is, after all, why I became a Guide in the first place.  I am not going to quit something I very much so enjoy doing just because a few disgruntled ex-guides, seniors, elders, and GMs want to ruin things for the rest of us.&quot; <p><p align="center"><font color="indigo" size="+1"><i>Keridwen Darkblade</font></i>

Geez... sounds like a Senior Guide.  Regular Guides can't change surnames (which is what titles are.  Surnames with spaces, and multiple words)<br>

Entirely possible.  All I know is they have been able to rez for the past 9 months.<br>

Not true.  If one group has engaged a mob, and a second kills it, they can recieve a warning once, warning twice, warning thrice, and suspension. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugavenfv69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GavenFV69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 6:15:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Typical guide abuse ..</span><hr size=1> So you dont have to pay if you become a guide? <p><a href="http://www.boomspeed.com/gaven69/Bowerwood.sig.JPG" target="_blank">

All the major guilds across most servers have this kind of support.  It's regarded as fairly normal.  As far as resolving camp and KS issues, guides can't DO anything.  They can beg and plead and yell for a GM, but if the players ignore the guide, the guide has no power to halt the KS'er.<br>
<br>
That last one happened right here on FV at the skeleton ruins epic monk camp that TLCs at level 10.  Damn TLC turning a dumb level 6 skeleton into a KS'ing free-for-all.  Guide came, told them to leave me alone, watched them swear and cuss and yell at me, KS me more, train me, etc. etc..  Guide kept telling them to stop and they ignored her.  Nothing ever happened to them.  Players have to recognize the guide as an authority in order for a guide to be effective.  GMs don't need any such approval from players.<br>
<br>
A GM can and will: kill the KS'er, summon him, rebind him in OOT, suspend him, and ban him.  I witnessed a GM do that once, though I only heard about the suspend and ban because the idiot whined about it on the boards.  God that felt good to watch.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

IMHO, guides are a waste of my time, since I typically don't petition unless I need a GM.  However, not everyone is like me in that respect.  There is a vast body of truly dumb petitions out there that make guides very necessary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udamienlogos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damien Logos</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.jsspace.com/lommtwt/attackrlocke.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/20/02 12:37:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1412.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://razza.org/ephestione/Download/Pictures/Fantasy/WomenandBeasts/images/strahd.jpg width=93 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I think you'll find ..</span><hr size=1> Gaven:<br>

Then that Guide didn't do what they could have.  Every time they curse they could have gotten a warning.  Every time they killed an engaged mob, they could have gotten a warning.  These are official, and are added to your account.  When your account has 4, a GM comes in a bans you.  So the Guide isn't allowed to summon you, and bind you in the jail, but they can fill out the paperwork to get a GM to.<br>

1)  That doesn't seem very humble   2)  I'm sure the Guides are going to feel great, and be glad they spend their time helping out, with that sort of comment and/or attitude<br>

At least we have good guides on FV.  I have very seldom had a problem, I guess I am lucky, I have only /petitioned one time asking for help.  But friends of mine have been responded to quickly.  And from what Mizzery told me about Thrads in an e-mail during the everyone Vs. Gore thing a few weeks back, he is a great guy as well.<br>
