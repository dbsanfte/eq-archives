<br>
I think a lot of the discussion from warriors right now stems from the frustration involved in not being good at anything and the warrior class just not being fun to play because of it.  Warriors have no utility at all and battle from thier standpoint comes down to hitting auto attack, hitting bash or kicks as it pops, and timing taunt usage. Occasionally during a normal group they get to hit /disc def or during a raid they get to be useful for the full three minutes def lasts.  Where is the fun in this?  <br>
<br>
All other classes have jobs to do other than hit auto attack and disc at the right time even including the tow other melee classes.  Any casting class of course has plenty to do to make thier class fun. Even clerics, long seen as a boring &quot;CH and sit&quot; class have been given fun utility spells and spells designed to give them things to do such as yaulp's mana regen allowing them to melee not to mention having downtime duties such as buffing.  Pure casters have many duties in and out of combat and those duties change constantly such as a wizard focusing on dps one battle and being on root/snare CC the next.  Warriors, in every single battle, hit auto attack and time taunt.  Warriors don't even get the fun of discipline usage since they generally have to save defensive.  During downtime, there is nothing at all for a warrior to do bar possibly clicking one of thier items.  <br>
<br>
This is all made worse now that warriors in a non-raid enviroment are generally useless.  Without aggro control, all the vaunted hp and ac of a warrior is useless.  In normal grouping, such as in LDoN, mobs come fast and die much too quickly to waste time gaining aggro.  Snap aggro is required and knights do this much better.  Except when a warrior is using a disc, knight and warriors also tank much the same with the knights having a noticeable advantage with thier self healing capabilty and powerful group buffing spells and abilities.  Why take a warrior anymore when knights tank the same and you get a rezzer/buffer/healer/situationally outstanding dps class or a strong dps class that can FD pull, give the group FT 10/regen 10/atk 100 and procs lifetaps so much on slowed mobs they don't even need healing a lot of the time. Warriors bring nothing at all to a group anymore.<br>
<br>
Here's a few of my ideas to make warriors more fun as a class to play and hopefully address thier uselessness in groups now.<br>
<br>
1)  Put all discs on separate timers.  This would give warriors something to do during battle and allow them to fully use some of the more fun abilities they already have.  With this, a warrior could take different roles during battle depending on what type of disc they currently have up. <br>
<br>
2) Get rid of defensive and give warriors inherently better mitigation abilities.  Wariors are the arms masters of EQ doing nothing all thier lives but focusing on thier ability with arms and armor.  Why shouldn't they be noticeably better at it than anyone else?  Asmuch as a 20% mitigation advantage over all other classes doesn't seems far out of line and would help minimize the retuning required after the loss of defensive.  This would give warriors a strong advantage in tanking over a knight.  This mitigation advantage could also be pared down depending on any snap taunt abilities given to a warrior. i.e. more aggro control = less inherent mitigation advantage and vice versa.<br>
<br>
3) Give warriors some fun discs that are valuable to a group all on seperate timers so warriors aren't stuck using one all the time.  An abilitie like group shielding where a warrior gives his entire group enhanced mitigation abilities for a limited time would make a warrior very desired in LDoN runs where adds come fast and furious and would balance them with the group abilites of SK and paladins. Another ability that would work well is a gorup atk bonus simulating the tactician role of a warrior directing his group in thier attacks. There are obviouly a lot of idea that could fit here and would make a warrior valuable in any group even when they are not tanking.<br>
<br>
4) Make warrior abilties scale throughout thier lifespan.  Right now, there are very large and obvious parts of a warriors's career where they gain nothing.  Levels 40-50 are just chaff for a warrior since they only gain level inherent bonuses while other classes get new spells etc..  Levels 61-65 are the same way.  Why not during these levels warriors gain some of the discipline abilities previously mentioned?  This doesn't mean that a warrior would get a new abilities every few levels since some of the discs could be simple upgrades of a previous one.  However, to make the class fun the more new and unique abilities added the better.<br>
<br>
5)  Warriors need some utility and fun to do abilities just to make the class more useful when a group isn't immediately available and just plain more fun for the player. Just giving clickies does not cover this area since why should a warrior have to do a long boring camp or pay an exhorbitant amount for an item that any caster could buy at a vendor?  How about enhancing warrior regen out of combat?  Say if a warrior has not engaged in combat for a set period of time, say a minute, they begin to regen very fast.  They could not use this ability if they have attacked or been attacked within the time mandated.  With this, warriors could solo for experiance or gear with some effectiveness.<br>
<br>
6) Along this same line warriors could be given the ability to root or snare on a limited basis.  Obviously these abilites could be overpowered in some ways in the end game if taken as they are now but the root and snare warriors get could be modified just for them.  These abilities could be discs and would follow the same outlines as the abilities previously mentioned.   An ability like AE grapple could represent the warriors tactical control of a combat area and would effectively AE root or snare (with no aggro component on the snare possibly).  These abilities could be balanced with reuse timers or damage components on them such as how shaman dots and pre-61 druid roots are balanced now.  <br>
<br>
Take for example the situation where a group suddenly gets a lot of adds, the warrior could AE root for a few seconds to give the group's CCers time to work.  However the root just damaged all the adds so a resist could very well kill any overeager CCer.  Care would have to be used to balance how fast true CC can be achieved with how much damage the warrior is taking.  The resist rare on  the root could be a further balancing tool of this ability.  AE or single target snare would follow the same lines though removing the aggro component of the snare would be suggested to limit its insane aggro abilities.<br>
<br>
7) Give warriors the real ability to rampage and flurry like warrior mobs do.  The PoP AAs warriors currently have are a waste of time and don't present any AA customization option for warriors.  Right now, warriors above all other classes have a set AA path with little to no deviation possible.  Warriors absolutely have to focus on defensive AAs to be useful  Nothing else mattters with the exception of AE taunt and that only because it is guaranteed taunt.  How about rampage as an active ability on a set timer or maybe just as an ability that could be switched off and on?  On adds this would give the warrior and his group the idea on whether to CC adds or just take them and possibly raise the group's DPS with the warriors possible ramp damage.  With this, warriors could gain some appreciable situational dps.  In particular, this ability would be of value during some LDoN runs and disatrous during others.  Warriors just gained some customization and required intellect to play.<br>
<br>
True flurry as an AA or given ability would not be hideously unbalancing for a warrior since it serves only to increase thier dps with aggro only affected by damage and possibly more swings per round. Having this ability on a timer seems silly since warrior mobs in game alway have it on naturally.  Why shouldn't warriors, being the truly ferocious combat masters they are, be able to flurry inherently or as a passive AA?  The check for rampage could be dex based the same as mobs and could be balance tuned by the proc rate.<br>
<br>
These are just a few ideas on how to make warriors more fun and less useless than they are now.  Just being good at raiding kills the class for all but raiding and doesn't let the general EQ population have much fun with it.  Keep in mind, this isn't an all of nothing list of abilities.  Some could be taken and others scrapped easily enough.<br>

<br>
I don't know about AoE root, but I've often thought that a warrior should get some type of AoE &quot;intimidate&quot;  that causes fear in opponents- some berserker war cry or something.  Maybe the &quot;root&quot; could be the warrior causing his opponent to cower in fear.<br>

I wonder how much effort Sony is going to keep putting into EQ since SWG is out and EQII will join us soon.<br>

<br>
I agree, we warriors need some changes, much like the changes that the knights at one time needed.  I find that if I'm in a group with another warrior in LDoN, the group is a lot weaker, as the second warrior brings /nothing/ to the table at all, and I'm usually the second warrior.  <br>
<br>
I'd love to see some warrior utility in the game myself, other than the very brief moments where /defensive or /evasive are needed, or a knight cannot be found there's little use for a warrior.  (Though I'm fortunate enough to have friends who enjoy having me along even though my class can't pull its weight.)<br>
<br>
<br>
/Shield was a good idea, and while at 58 it is a lot less useful than it was, when I got it through my 40s, it was a great ability.  It seems to be underused, and the range on it is a bit too small.  Casters seem to leave the range much too often when I try and keep them alive a little longer now.<br>
<br>
 <br>
I'd be pleased to see it end up where the choice between a warrior and a knight actually involved some tradeoffs on both sides for a group rather than the current situation.<br>

<br>
I never just &quot;hit autoattack, etc.&quot; I was always acutely aware of my own and others' proximities to the mob and was constantly adjusting my own proximity to use that as an aid to keeping aggro. If the situation allowed for it, I would not taunt from behind to regain aggro, but strafe around and make sure I was between the mob and its current target. Fighting was a dynamic dance. I kept up a running information with the person in charge of crowd control about the status and &quot;waiting order&quot; of adds. Often, our group was making decisions on the fly about the combat, adjusting roles and fighting styles. In many of my groups, I was directing the rate and flow of combat, adjusting our position in the environment through my control of the mob(s). <br>
<br>
But then, I only got to 54. I avoided the tedium of raids. And I often fought with groups that were pushing themselves in places where they would have gotten creamed if they weren't a tight unit with great communication. I did A LOT of pulling. So, I guess, that's another suggestion to make being a warrior interesting. <br>
<br>
The two big reasons I stopped being a warrior had nothing to do with being bored with the class. The greatest reason was the attitude of other players toward the warrior class and the decision by a large percentage of players that paladins were the only tanks worth having (or so I got told over and over). The second reason has to do with my own play style. I don't like getting gifts and I'm perpetually poor. Makes playing a gear-dependent class immensely frustrating.<br>
<br>
But I would never call being a warrior boring. At least not the way it CAN be played. Sitting on your behind, standing up, casting, sitting down again...bleh. THAT's much more boring.<br>

<br>
I mean, by definition warrior is just not as involved as other classes.  Some people like the straightforward beat down style of play, some like more complicated a la casters.<br>
<br>
Yes I agree that warriors are underpowered, but not a lot more than all the other melee in the game.  <br>
<br>
Can't really play a class, not like it, then try to change it because you don't like the style.  I've always had a melee mentality in every game I play.  I would never play an Enchanter, declare that they are too complicated and ask to change it.  Casters just aren't my play style, so I don't play them.<br>
<br>
Lemme repeat this before I stop because I know the flames are kindling in some people now - Yes I agree that warriors are underpowered, but not a lot more than all the other melee in the game.  <br>

Pallys, SK's, rangers and the rest generating more damage is, in my opinion, complete bullshit.  Flame all you want, but Warriors should soak up the most damage and deal it out, period.  I believe it would fix the taunt problems and it would give us the needed groupings.  <br>
<br>
The rest of the melee classes (well except for monks, but they get their special attacks, though Ive never played one, so I have no idea on how much damge they really do) get an assortment of spells.  All we get is taunt and our discs, of which the effectivness is much debated.  I think the AoE root would be nice, as well as all the other stuff, but all I really want is to do more damge.  I SHOULD do more damage.  I don't need a root.  I dont need anything special.  All I need is to do the maximum damage, and right now, I'm not achieving that.  It's not nerfing the other classes.  It's changing something that should have been done int he first place.<br>

I would envision a warrior using it to hold the attention of adds long enough to give his/her group's CC team time to work or maybe to lock down a train just long enough for the warriors group to get a head start to zone.  <br>
<br>
This could also be the solution to the warrior snap aggro problem.  AE root would give warriors a form of snap aggro that would allow the debuffers a chance to get thier spells off and not take aggro.  This wouldn't give nukers the safety net to overnuke like they do with knights no and would force the group's other melees to pay special attention to thier aggro radius.  Using AE root this way would require a lot of coordination among the warrior's teammembers, something I personally would enjoy. Warriors wouldn't have the snap aggro lock ability of knights but they would have enough snap aggro to make them valuable in groups.<br>
<br>
To prevent abuse and as a factor of realism the ability could even be tied to the warrior's proximity. i.e the warrior obviously use his sheer physical prowesss to command an arena of combat he is nowhere near. This, the resist check, the amount of opponents afffected, PBAE type of four target max quad type, and the duration of the root could all be used as balancing and maybe level based improvement considerations.<br>

'but' once you get your defensives out of the way we really come into our own. The differnce that maxed out ferocity,punishing blade, flurry, CF makes is unbelievable ! I have very average gear yet had no trouble holding aggro with 31% haste, 44 delay weapon ( no taunting type proc ) tanking UNSLOWED mobs in a group of 65s the other day including a rogue and monk. Granted the other mellees were skilled at funnelling aggro to me which makes a bigger difference than any gear, but I agree that warriors need some other 'trick' for the sub 90 AA'd who can't devote xp to offensive gear. In the meantime just plow away AA til you become a QUINTUPLE attack ( eat your heart out monks =P ) DPS machine.<br>

Asdeuce for example, seems hapy with the status quo, and suggests that if one hunts with experienced people there are no problems at all.  (Which seems to imply that the rest of us are inexperienced.)  <br>
<br>
Sylexis also offers the sam opinion.  Warriors /can/ solo, and they work great if you know the secrets.  No evidence to back this up is given.<br>
<br>
One absolute statement that can be made about EQ is this: It is a caster's game.  Most everything in the game favors the casting classes.  They have the options, the spells, and the choices in combat that warriors ( I haven't played other melee classes, so won't comment on what I don't know. ) don't have.  Spell specialization, focus items, new spells in each expansion...<br>
<br>
A point which no one touched on is having a second warrior in a group, or being that second warrior.  If I'm in a dungeon as a 58 warrior, and there's a 60 warrior with me, one of us isn't pulling their weight since our warrior DPS is pretty laughable, and we don't have the utility of a knight (single pulling, snap aggro, backup heals, buff abilities etc... )  I'd like to see something that makes a warrior more useful in a group when they're not MA. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why take a warrior anymore when knights tank the same and you get a rezzer/buffer/healer/situationally outstanding dps class or a strong dps class that can FD pull, give the group FT 10/regen 10/atk 100 and procs lifetaps so much on slowed mobs they don't even need healing a lot of the time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Knights have CRAPPY DPS. Knights are FAR, FAR from &quot;outstanding DPS classes.&quot; Yes, paladins can do respectable DPS when fighting undead, but if we're going to make that distinction, then CLERICS are an &quot;outstanding DPS&quot; class. Paladins and Shadowknights are not wanted for their DPS (which is down near the worst in the game, btw) but for ability to near-instantly grab and hold agro, something warriors just can't do.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Warriors should generate the most damage of any class.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
/boggle. Um. Warriors aren't a DPS class. Warriors soak damage, they do not deal it. You're saying warriors should deal more damage than wizards? Rogues? Mages? I couldn't disagree more. One of the problems with class balance right now is that a warrior with smart AA and decent weapons can outdamage a similarly equipped monk, provided the warrior isn't tanking. That, in my opinion, ain't right.<br>

There are three melee classes. Rogue, monk and warrior. None of them get any spells. That's what a pure melee is--a character without any spells.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>All I need is to do the maximum damage, and right now<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Play a rogue, ranger or wizard then. Your job is not to deal damage. If you really like dealing damage (which it seems you do), warrior is the wrong class for you.<br>

Sylexis said (in response to the statement that warriors can't effectively solo):<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They already can.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sure, with 100k+ in gear they can. So what she really means is if you're a twink or an ebayer you can solo. Please, Sylexis, enlighten us on exactly what gear they'd need to buy, and where they'd need to go to solo. I'm sorry, in my eyes a class who needs to spend 100k+ and go to only very specific zones to solo, can't *effectively* solo.<br>

Go to Safehouse and check out their discussions of how wizzards with enough FT items outdamage rogues almost 2:1 on continuous basis, I'm not even talking about mana burning. (gotta love a 55 or so wizzy crit blast for over 3000 every 4th blast, while only a rogue with the 19dmg poker can dream of something comparable); and how rangers with proper AAs (EQ, etc.) outdamage rogues with similar amount of AAs /boggle. No, I'm not complaining, I love my rogue and know both strengths and weaknesses of my class. However, you still do have to agree that developers are caster/hybrid oriented. <br>
<br>
And as far as rogues go there is a fun bit circulating in the rogue community: with the new LDoN expansion the assassination mission can be completed by any single class group of 6 except rogues /boggle (of course its not true but as I said every class thinks they got it the worst). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vicairedelestacia>Vicaire Delestacia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/2/03 4:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4984.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior ideas</span><hr size=1> Warrior dps is quite a bit lower than shadowknight dps assuming equal gear.

 A SK that tries can sustain a respectable amount of sustained dps in an equally leveled and geared group in the 60 plus range. SK dps is nothing to brag about but warriors fare badly in comparison which is an important factor in this discussion.<br>
<br>
Paladins in an undead enviroment with SU3 and BoN are an incredibly outstanding dps class.  I have seen them put rogues to shame easily. Paladins can at times beat mages, arguably the best sustained general dps class around,  for sustained dps in an undead enviroment.  <br>

Jebbar this is a sorta counter productive statement.<br>
<br>
A tanks job is to Hold agro, but not do damage? Then haow the hell do they hold agro? Dancing with the mob?<br>
<br>
A warrior is a specialized Melee class that should excel at dealing damage fast and hard enough to keep the mobs attention on him. Maybe what they need to do is up the Crit rate of warriors or give warriors a Focus weapon path so they can specialivze in 1 sort of weapon type be it 1hb, 1hs, 2hb, ect. A warrior should be able to generate enough agro with thier melee skills so the mob does not go after the casters or Hybrids. Yes the soak up the damage but what good is all them HP's, and AC if you cannot generate agro with Melee and taunt? I think that warriors should have the highest skill cap with all weapons. The knights should be tied with warriors with 2hs so they can start doing Melee Dps. I dunno. Just my 2cp's<br>

Clearly the poster of the above has not ever played a wizard nor knows much about them.  And thus should not really be posted such....<br>
<br>
To clarify: while a wizard can, with maximum crit AA's, get almost 1 in 4 crit hits (current parsings seem to show about a 23% crit rate) this requires a CLASS AA (which you cant even start to get til you are 59) and a POP AA which has a pre-requisit of the 59th AA. In total max crit AA's also cost you 42 AA's - how many 55th level chars have that many I wonder?<br>
<br>
Therefore the above statement is totally false.<br>
<br>
As for doing a 3000 crit - the highest damage spell a 55th wizard has is the 1150 Ice Comet (and they'd be mad to use this often as it is hopelessly inneficient and gets resisted often). Even with an ID3 item hitting for the full 20% extra and a bard with rizlona's you're not going to get many (in relality probably any) crits over 3000. And they'd go OOM very rapidly. <br>
<br>
Please get your facts straight before posting. <p>------------------<br>

Incorrect. It takes brains, you dont need to drop 100k on gear to effectivly solo on a war although a few platinum for bandages will save you alot of time.<br>
<br>
If you want proof, Come to Sola and i will teach you how to solo, dont forget to inspect me because i must have some really UBER gear in order to do so.<br>

If you say it can't be done, please dont interupt the person doing it.<br>

<br>
Exactly. They hold agro with taunt. Taunt does not work very well as it stands now. Certainly doesn't work as well as a knight's spells at holding agro, which is the issue.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to maintain some sort of balance here in my suggestions. Warriors are not damage dealers, they are damage soakers. They don't generate agro by doing a crapload of damage, they generate agro by hitting quickly, procing nasty things, and taunting. If you make them a supreme damage class, you've just screwed over a lot of other classes. Trying to achieve balance here elegantly, making the fewest possible changes. Make WARRIOR ONLY taunt a +450 agro (or whatever) function instead of what it is now. That's all.<br>

I think what was implied is soloing in places higher up the ladder than SolA. Almost everyone can solo in SolA, but how many under 55 warriors do you know that can solo PoJ? I did witness at various times a necro, a ranger, a wizzy, and of course a druid all under 55 destroying their mobs in PoJ single handedly (am I missing any other classes that can do it?)<br>
<br>
As far as warriors being useless in groups with knights when they are not MT,  I have to totally disagree. A good warrior will be able to offtank and be a melee type of crowd controller; a good warrior will be able to interrupt casters when needed (seen a whole lot of that in LDoN); a good warrior will be able to step in and save the group from a wipe when needed. Warriors are a great class, cheer up; they just need a little fix here and there.<br>
