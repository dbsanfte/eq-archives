She chuckled at him, &quot;Gore, you still don't pass for a spell caster in that robe, with those glowing swords of yours.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I know. Here, I have something for you.&quot; She smiled and clapped her hands excitedly when he pulled out a new set of leggings for her to wear, stronger than those she had on. &quot;Thank you so much! You spoil me too much, you know...&quot; she said as she gave him a quick hug, admiring the leggings. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well put them on already!&quot; he scolded, and she quickly changed into them, posing for him as she giggled. &quot;They look nice. You look good in Red...&quot; he said. She thought she caught a strange note in his voice and looked up at him, but he was grinning down at her, so she relaxed. <br>
<br>
Suddenly a chill washed down her spine as she heard the thoughts of another enter her head. &quot;It is time, Gnome. I've had enough of your pretentious mouth. Let us end this.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, lets. I am in the Bazaar's Arena, come to me,&quot; she replied, sending her thoughts back to the girl. <br>
<br>
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Gore, seeing the change in Charizma's demeanor. &quot;Sarhea is coming,&quot; she answered, a determined look on her face. &quot;It is time I set you free of this, Gore. I know what is in your heart, you've shown me. I know you don't want to live this hateful life she leads you on. I will get that sword from her.&quot; <br>
<br>
She didn't catch the sly grin on Gore's face as she turned away, preparing herself for battle. She unsheathed her swords and held them in front of her face, kissing the blades. The blades Gore had given her. She pointed them into the ground and closed her eyes, slowing her breathing, focusing on the task ahead of her. Sarhea was more powerful than Charizma and they both knew it. Only luck and the gnome's quickness would give her the slightest chance of success. <br>
<br>
Charizma heard footsteps and looked up. Entering the Arena was Sarhea, complete with her entourage. Gray Hateborn himself was there, a man she had heard of but never seen. His armor glowed a deep purple, a sure sign of his devotion to Innoruuk, and Charizma trembled slightly at the sheer intensity of Hate she felt exuding from the group. <br>
<br>
Sarhea pointed at Charizma. &quot;You!&quot; she said, her voice seething with anger at the gnome. Charizma gathered every ounce of courage and determination in her heart and walked up to the half-elf. &quot;I see you've finally come to meet your end, Sarhea.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sarhea's raised her eyebrow at Charizma. &quot;Is that what you think? Then come, little one, you can even have first blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You disgust me how you use Gore as your pawn. You control him and use him for your little games.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Better than you having him as your lapdog.&quot; Sarhea retorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lapdog! How dare you! I do not use him as you do, I have honor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, don't even begin to speak to me of honor, Charizma.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will free him of you and your games.&quot; <br>
<br>
Charizma heard a voice come from the side. &quot;But does he wish to be freed...&quot; Gray said, just loud enough for her to hear. She turned her eyes toward him slightly but did not reply. <br>
<br>
&quot;He is my teacher, my friend. I have learned much from him over these years. I treat him with nothing but respect, something you can not say,&quot; said Sarhea. <br>
<br>
Charizma reached up and slapped Sarhea, suprising her. Sarhea quickly retorted with a swing of her Mace and they glared at one another. <br>
<br>
&quot;Respect! Is that what you call it? No, Sarhea, I can see the good in him, no matter how much you've tried to destroy it. I know what he is capable of becoming if you did not hold such control over him. I will see that he gains his freedom from you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you always make the lizard's decisions for him?&quot; asked Gray. Charizma's head whipped toward him as she spat back at him, &quot;Do you always talk so much for your colleagues? Or are you in on this power game as well?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I've only spoken this once,&quot; he replied, but Charizma had already turned her attention back to the half-elf. <br>
<br>
&quot;Let's settle this like true Warriors, not like little school girls,&quot; said Sarhea. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Half-breed, lets,&quot; replied Charizma as she charged in, swords flying at Sarhea, trying to quickly gain the upper hand.<br>
<br>
The battle was close, each bite of Charizma's sword only bringing a flash of pain as Sarhea's blades found their mark as well. The injured each other equally, Hate dripping from Sarhea like sweat, while Charizma found strength in her compassion for the lizard. <br>
<br>
Suddenly Charizma's sword went flying through the air and toppled to the ground. Sarhea had disarmed her, and an evil grin spread across her face. They both knew who had won now. Charizma fumbled for her sword, trying to land punches at Sarhea while she sought to regain her weapon, but her bare hands were little good against the other Warrior. <br>
<br>
Charizma's strength faded quickly then, Sarhea's two swords more effective than the one she still held onto. Her hand finally closed around the handle of her second sword and she turned to Sarhea, furiously stabbing at her, but it was too late. Charizma fell to the ground, defeated. <br>
<br>
When she came to, she heard Gore shout across the Arena, &quot;Now you die, Sarhea!&quot; Her eyes widened as she quickly sat up. Gore had turned on Sarhea and was quickly killing her, his blades pushing hers aside as he slipped them easily through her armor. Her swords barely touched him no matter how hard she tried. <br>
<br>
Charizma gathered her gear quickly and ran up to them, just in time to see Gore turn on Gray. He furiously slashed at the man, shouting, &quot;Now you die, Gray!&quot; and Gray was no match. Sarhea screamed out, &quot;Don't you touch him! Get away!&quot;, tears streaming down her face as her leader fell to Gore. She turned on Gore and tried to slash at him, but she stood no chance against the Iksar. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gore, please! Gore, you don't have to live like this any longer...&quot; Charizma pleaded, horrified at the sight of him on a rampage, killing everything in sight. He turned and swept his blade across her throat. &quot;Leave here now, Gnome. I'll not kill you here.&quot; Charizma gasped and sank to her knees, sobbing. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here, take your sword!&quot; she cried. She tried to hand it to Gore, but he kept fighting her, blinded by his rage. &quot;Fine, I drop it,&quot; she choked out, her life quickly slipping away. The sword fell to the ground as Sarhea fell next to it.<br>
<br>
Charizma looked up to see Gore bending to pick the sword up, tentatively at first, then greedily grabbing at it. A maniacal grin spread across his face as he shouted, &quot;I am free! Finally I am free of your grip!&quot; <br>
<br>
Gray had returned and stood before Gore, the emotion on his face unreadable. &quot;Yes, you are free, Gore. Your soul is your own now.&quot; Gore ignored him, still staring at the sword in his hand. <br>
<br>
Charizma's sobbing only increased. What had happened? Who was this monster standing before her? He quickly turned and saw the awed group of spectators still standing in the Arena. He narrowed his eyes and charged at them, swords flying. <br>
<br>
Charizma heard shout after shout from Gore, and each one stabbed at her heart, making her writhe in pain. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now you die, Badeb!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Now you die, Maladominus!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you die, Syllestrae!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you die, Kelisk!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you die, Voskor!&quot;<br>
<br>
The shouts kept coming, Charizma's heart breaking into that many more pieces. She gathered herself from the ground and rushed at Gore, her blades flying at him, knowing she could do little against him, but knowing nothing but the pain she felt in her heart. He ignored her onslaught as he fought off several people, but suddenly his blades turned on her and she fell quickly. <br>
<br>
Once more she gathered herself from the battle grounds, the torment inside too much to let her sit idly by while he killed everything in sight. His shout of, &quot;Let the world see what has been done to my family! Let the world bleed for it!&quot; made her jump at him once more. He was badly wounded, only because he had been fighting so many people and she thought she may stand a chance. She cut at him again and again, following him as he ran from her, jabbing in every chance she got. <br>
<br>
He began to dance with her, running off and coming back to slash at her before running behind her, then turning and coming back at her, again slashing her as he passed. She cried out in pain, but still she kept on, trying to pierce his thick skin with her blades as he passed. She gained hope, she could see the life bleeding from him, he was so close to death. Just a couple more landed blows and he would be done for. She tried so hard, but he was stronger in the end. He cut her down first, then ran from the Arena, the grin of a madman on his face. He had killed everyone.<br>
<br>
Charizma slowly gathered her things once again from the Arena floor and limped over toward the entrance. She glanced up to see Sarhea slumped against the wall, her knees pulled into her chest as tears fell down her face. <br>
<br>
Charizma walked up to Sarhea and screamed at her, &quot;Look what you have done to him!!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;This is your fault!&quot; she screamed back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I tried to save him. Look what you did to him, you corrupted him with your hatred!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You unleashed this, Charizma. I held the utmost respect for him, you knew nothing about him. You brought him to take the sword for himself and unleash his fury upon the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
They were both hurt, angry, crushed. They glared at each other, the tension quickly building. Charizma burst into tears and again charged at Sarhea, wanting to kill her. She knew this was Sarhea's doing, not her own. Again they fought, the pain, hate and compassion all colliding into a blind need to lash out against the other. The fight was just as the first, and Sarhea again defeated Charizma leaving her laying on the ground bloodied and battered, sobbing. Sarhea ran from the Arena, her friends from the guild following after, concerned for her.<br>
<br>
Charizma sat up slowly.The tears would not stop falling as she attempted to bandage herself, her body a complete mess after the battles. The Iksar from Skathris Ven'Sho, Thrads and Ellishae who had come in to witness the end of the battle, and Saurix all still stood around her. <br>
<br>
The Iksar mocked her. They spoke half in the common tongue, half in their own hissing, painful language. The words she could make out were insulting to her, and she lashed out at them back. She insulted their language, insulted them while she kept her gaze on her wounds, trying to heal them. <br>
<br>
Kelisk offered several times to put her out of her misery, that they could easily kill her if that is what she wished. She reminded him of their duel earlier and how easily he had been defeated by her. Suddenly he was brave with his friends around him. She would be sure to put him in his place again soon.<br>
<br>
Voskor mocked her for being a fool and falling for the &quot;Traitor&quot;'s ploys. The Iksar hated Gore for turning his back on Cabilis, the only thing that mattered to them. He sat and ate fruit, sucking the juice from the berries while she watched on, half starved from the battle and out of food and drink. She paid more attention to the food he ate than to what he said, and he saw the longing look on her face. <br>
<br>
He came forward and dropped a handfull of berries in front of her and stepped back. She glared up at him, but her gaze softened as she grabbed the berries and greedily ate them up. He smiled at her, and she returned a weak half-smile. Until she realized that the smile on his face was from the image in his head of Charizma on his dinner plate. She scowled back at him, as Kelisk laughed at Voskor for feeding her like they would a wolf pup back in the kennels of Cabilis. She started to retort, then thought better of it. The berries were good, even if the Iksar were not.<br>
<br>
Thrads talked with Charizma softly, asking what had happened. He had known of Sarhea and Gore's relationship, but not that Charizma had become involved in any way. Ellishae sat nearby quietly, listening. She recounted how she had become curious about the Iksar and had spent time talking to him, getting to know him. He seemed to take a liking to her, and he had opened up to her, showing her that he was tormented by the life Sarhea made him lead. He showered her with gifts, money, and attention and she grew fond of him, and more and more wanted to see him free from Sarhea. She just knew he could turn around.<br>
<br>
Her eyes lit up a little, and she looked up at Thrads hopefully, wanting him to understand. &quot;It seems you were blinded by your feelings, Charizma,&quot; he said. Her eyes quickly dropped back down to the ground as another tear ran down her cheek. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I can see that now. He merely used me to gain the strength he needed to win his freedom.&quot; Her face became contorted with pain. &quot;I'll never let my self feel that way again! I'll never care about anyone like that, I will not be made a fool!&quot; <br>
<br>
Thrads told her softly, &quot;Those feelings can be good, Charizma. You just have to be wary of what they can do.&quot; Her glare hardened as she stared at the ground. She knew there was no way she would be taken like this again. <br>
<br>
She sat quietly while the Iksar and Thrads turned their conversation to other things, topics that held no interest for Charizma, and they had certainly lost interest in her. She stood up quietly and mumbled, &quot;I have things to think over...&quot; as she slowly turned and walked away. '<br>
<br>
Thrads called out to her, &quot;Yes you do, Charizma. Good hunting then...&quot; but she just hung her head as she walked away.<br>
<br>
She realized her mistake, saw what Gore had done to her. She had turned in her badge at the Tinker's Pride guild hall, certain that this journey she had taken was hers alone. She had left them with barely an explanation, not even fully knowing herself where her path would lead, only that she must try to save Gore. She had felt that she could not drag them into this fight, so had left them quietly, sadly. She now saw how he had manipulated her.<br>
<br>
She thought of all the gifts he gave to her, all the talking they did. She thought it was because he had grown fond of her, that he was confessing his innermost secrets to her. Now she saw that he was only brilliantly toying with her, knowing exactly what to do, what to say, to make her fall under his spell. How could she not have seen it...<br>
<br>
Her thoughts turned to Zapoo and her heart bled again. She had seen him briefly, and knew that he still lived. But as soon as his gaze fell upon her he stumbled to the ground, obviously in unbearable pain at the sight of her. She had quickly jumped out of sight, watching him gather himself from the ground slowly, both of them crying. She thought back to the note he had left for her, and the affliction that had come over him. <br>
<br>
She wondered what part Gore had played in this...never before had the thought crossed her mind, but the pieces fell into place. The look of jealousy on his face when she told him of her love for Zapoo, her rejection of his attempt to show her &quot;true power&quot;. And he had the means to arrange such a tragedy. What if he had caused this pain for Zapoo...<br>
<br>
Charizma closed her eyes and leaned against the wall, tears still slipping down her face. She wondered if they would ever stop. She had never felt such pain. She wasn't used to it, her life had always been so carefree. She didn't know what to do, where to go. <br>
<br>
She opened her eyes and lifted her head as a single thought drifted into her mind. She took a bit of comfort at it and slowly gathered her bags, prepared to travel. She walked slowly for many hours, absorbed in her thoughts. <br>
<br>
Charizma finally stopped and looked up, just a hint of a smile on her face. She took a deep breath and pushed open the door, walking under the sign that read, &quot;Tinker's Pride&quot;. <br>

He'd half-jokingly teased his friend about his own flounderings in his magical studies. He had also known that such warnings were pointless, and Kelisk would go ahead and charge into battle with his usual bullheadedness. But Kelisk's honor was his own, and it was hardly Voskor's place to stand in his way. He'd taken a seat in the stands to watch the duel, not entirely surprised to see Charizma defeat the patriarch and his wolf.<br>
<br>
Still, it hadn't been a bad matchup. Perhaps defeat would spur Kelisk to attend more diligently to his studies. &quot;I have some business to attend to in the bazaar,&quot; he'd told his friend, &quot;I'll be back a bit later if that's all right?&quot; (ooc: Shrek was on and I'd never seen it before, hehe) Kelisk had agreed readily, and he'd left the two of them at the arena.<br>
<br>
Voskor rather liked the Gnome. Inasmuch as one could like an enemy that one fully intended to slay when it became necessary, anyway. Their conversations were unavoidably tinted with veiled barbs and threats, but he had always come away from them feeling that he had spoken with someone he could understand. A warrior, who understood the tenets of honor, and respect for one's opponent.<br>
<br>
Earlier that very afternoon, he'd met her in the bazaar and asked her about the rumours he'd heard linking her to Gore. She'd replied (and he tried to remember the words as closely as he could, though the translation from foreign tongue made it difficult), &quot;Oh no... Gore showed me power, that's true, but that kind of power is... wrong. It would destroy my soul.&quot; And then, &quot;I hope to change him... there must be a way to save him.&quot;<br>
<br>
No way to save someone from his own delusional insanity, Voskor had thought. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
When Voskor had returned to the arena some time later, rather bemused to hear that Kelisk was still there, the sight of Gore killing Sarhea was certainly the last thing he expected to see. The Legionnaire stopped dead in his tracks and shot a puzzled look at Kelisk, who'd at least had the sense to retire to the stands. &quot;Why is he killing the elf wench?&quot; Nevermind, 'why is he here in the first place'; the scene below was far too surreal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because he is confused and weak of mind,&quot; Kelisk retorted simply, chuckling as Gore turned on the cleric Hateborn, clearly enjoying the show.<br>
<br>
Voskor was too confused to enjoy it. He had thought Gore a traitor because of his blind devotion to the sword. That, at least, he could understand. Misplaced fervor over an imagined blood debt. This... utter carnage... held no reason, no order. It was foreign to his entire way of thinking. He watched as the traitor proceeded to slaughter the League, and proclaimed himself free.<br>
<br>
That, to Voskor's mind, was a more dangerous declaration than anything, as Gore was very clearly insane. If he now perceived himself to have no boundaries and no consequence, the chaos that could fly in his wake was unimaginable.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think he's calmed down now,&quot; he heard Kelisk say, as he hopped down into the arena. If he'd been a hair quicker, Voskor would have grabbed him by his stupid tail and held him back. He couldn't hear the words from where he stood, but he saw Kelisk approach the lunatic as if to say something.<br>
<br>
And of course, Gore struck.<br>
<br>
Self-preservation flew from the Legionnaire's thoughts as he leaped down into the pit. However great a fool Kelisk acted, he was Iksar. He was his friend. His brother in arms. And however futile the attempt be, Voskor was bound by honor to defend him. The irony did not fail to flash through his mind as he coolly drew his weapons and laid into the larger warrior.<br>
<br>
Kelisk fell quickly, and Gore turned to him with furious blows. Voskor gritted his teeth and held his ground, though he was battered through his armor and rent with pain. He would lose the fight. He could see that from the first exchange. But his own skill had grown since they'd last met, and he could see that he was hurting his opponent.<br>
<br>
Gore saw it too. &quot;You've gotten better,&quot; he hissed at a junction when their blades locked. Voskor only smiled grimly and shoved off, following up with another swing. Dimly he heard Charizma telling him to put up a good fight... A vicious slash drew a torrent of blood from Voskor's side, and the warrior saw red. He loosed a roar of defiance and flew into a berserker fury of flashing weapons, determined to do as much damage as he could before he fell.<br>
<br>
And suddenly the pain was gone. His wounds closed of their own accord and life flowed once more into his limbs. His discipline faltered momentarily in surprise, and he needed a second to catch up to the sight of Gore suddenly detaching from him and laying into the human in purple. Hateborn. Had... healed him? Then the League and their brat god must truly have forsaken him. Burning every bridge in sight, Gore, he thought grimly to himself as he leaped after him again.<br>
<br>
The battle became a blur as the rest of the League - perhaps finally spurred at the sight of a single warrior standing up to him, he thought dryly - joined in to cut the traitor down. To his only half-surprise, Voskor saw a familiar glint of steel and scale and Saurix beating on Gore from the side. &quot;I should have known you'd come,&quot; he tried to hiss, but he couldn't know if the words escaped, as a final blow sent him crashing to the earth and consciousness fled.<br>
<br>
He awoke in the tunnel at the gates to the pit. Saurix and Kelisk were beside him. &quot;What happened?&quot; he groaned, sitting up and trying to shake the rattling out of his skull. Through the portcullis he could see Gore still standing. &quot;Someone healed him?&quot; he asked puzzledly.<br>

&quot;I think it was Thrads,&quot; Saurix muttered, busy binding his own wounds. Voskor quickly knelt to assist him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mistmoore's little herald? What's he got to do with any of this?&quot; That, no one could answer. They bound up Saurix as well as they could and prepared to let the battle be rejoined.<br>
<br>
Too late. &quot;I win,&quot; Gore shouted simply, and fled the arena to embark on who-knew-what new crusade.<br>
<br>

<br>
Voskor hung around the lingering Leaguers and Thrads long enough to hear what they had to say, but he kept his own involvement in the conversation to corrections of fallacies. Mainly Thrads'. The little rat never did come out and say how he was wrapped up in Gore and why he'd gotten involved in the first place. He seemed to be under the impression that Gore loved Charizma, or Sarhea, or the other way around, or something.<br>
<br>
When Charizma had cried and said she only wanted to free him, he had almost felt sympathy. After all, he himself had always thought that Gore's treachery was entirely centered on the sword, and not realized until now that his insanity had grown much deeper than that. He had kept his mouth shut while Kelisk insulted her, because it didn't seem like the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
But then she had said that Iksar could never understand things like caring for one another. And any trace of sympathy had been squelched by indignation. He, who every moment's breath was devoted for love of Cabilis...! &quot;You,&quot; he had snarled, &quot;do not presume to know our thoughts. It is you creatures of chaos who cannot comprehend devotion to one's kind.&quot; Hadn't she told him that very day that she had parted ways with the Tinkers to pursue her own ends? How dare she speak to him in such a manner.<br>
<br>
And even then, he had tossed the fruit at her feet, having noticed her pale shivering and longing glances at his food packs. Though the scale and reasons may have been different, she had fought at least as hard as he had that afternoon, and the gesture was not as entirely mocking as he made it out to be. Somewhere he hoped that the warrior he thought he had understood in her would see that.<br>
<br>
He was not her friend. He was Iksar. And he knew what it meant to care for another. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzapoofirionavie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zapoo FirionaVie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/3/02 1:28:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Manipulation</span><hr size=1> .. Zapoo clutches the table, straining to weep quietly, blood coming from his fingertips where his fingernails have been scoring the wood of the table. The pain from the splinters under his fingernails providing a distraction to the more intense pain.<br>
<br>
He listens intently to every word even while he silently screams in pain, and struggles to concentrate on the tale.<br>
<br>
*some time later*<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn bards. Not even safe for me to stop for an ale.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zapoo's thoughts turn away quickly from the joy he feels at Charizma in the Pride again, and the fact that his life is about to get a lot more difficult.<br>
