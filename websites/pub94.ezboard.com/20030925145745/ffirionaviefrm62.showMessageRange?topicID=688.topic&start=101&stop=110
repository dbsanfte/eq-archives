As it currently exists, peer-to-peer trading of media doesn't just trade music of this type.<br>
<br>
The problem is that you made the assertion that the RIAA is to be circumvented by &quot;any means possible&quot;.  I think the natural inference is that illegal trading of RIAA sponsored music is within the realm of &quot;any means possible&quot;.<br>
<br>
All-in-all, we're very close to agreement, and I don't plan on picking at this argument any further.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I do have some advice.<br>
<br>
You've repetitvely pointed out ad hominem of other people in this thread, including accusing me of ad hominem incorrectly.  I maybe would have some sympathy for you, if it weren't for gems like this one directed at Caemus:<br>
<br>

<br>
Your quick internet education, in an attempt to show up the uppity college kid, is leaving remarkable gaps in your knowledge which are so exploitable that I feel bad doing it. This is an opinion, not part of any argument I am making, but If you actually did go to college your school ripped you off. Again, I'm sorry, but I warned you before about what would happen if you made particularly bad arguments.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There wasn't an argument there for you to try and counter. There was a question for those of you who believe you're in the right by stealing intellectual property.<br>
<br>
Have you truly sat down to write a song (not a comical song that you're thinking of on the fly to get a laugh)? After writing said song have you ever tried recording it professionally, under the supervision of a producer who is making sure EVERY nuance is dealt with? After doing that for just one song, have you then gone on to write and record a good 10 more to complete an album? How about after completing your album gone on to promote it through various outlets?<br>
<br>
All I'm getting at is you guys must think this is easy work, because you have essentially decided that the artist deserves no consideration in your war on the RIAA and their prices. Your hard earned dollar is worth more than their hard work, and you just lack the guts to actually put those thoughts to words. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fortuneoffear>Fortune of Fear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 10:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

<br>
Do your self a favor and actually read completely the second to last post I made.  I debated with myself wether or not I should make you look really stupid just now.<br>
<br>
I decided to offer some friendly advice instead.<br>
<br>
This is an example of me being civil to people.  My responses to ceumus are becoming an example of me being mean.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eliezer.<br>
<br>
If I understand your argument correctly, your suggesting that the government  does not exist to correct market failures.<br>
<br>
If I got that right, then your suggesting some pretty far reaching things.<br>
<br>
I'll offer a few to you so that I can get my point across.<br>
<br>
If the governement wasn't responsible for correcting market failures, (via the definition)  <br>
<br>
1. No money wouod be spent on national defense.<br>
<br>
2. Taxes would not be levied to remedy externalites (as an example, pollution, given in the definition.)<br>
<br>
3. Anti-trust legislation would not exist.<br>
<br>
These are three consequences derived directly from the definition.  It took little interpretaion or thought to come up with them.<br>
<br>
Second, you suggested that I thought capitalism was a higher authority than U.S. law.  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but that's not exactly right.  Capitalism and U.S. law are intimately linked.  You can make an argument that we are, at least in part, a socialist country, but the majority of our operations are still capitalistic.  I'm not sure what else your looking for here, but I think that my response to your market failure question can be looked at to refute this second point you made as well, if I read you right.<br>
<br>
Kazot.<br>
<br>
I don't have time to make a lengthy response to everyone that posts  1 word &quot;arguments&quot;.  If you want me to respond to you, make an effort to think about your question, and or critiques, and I'll make an effort to respond to you. <br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Gasp.<br>
<br>
Your right mostly. <br>
<br>
I knew that this could be taken as comitting that fallacy, so I explicitly stated that this in no way relates to my arguments against him.<br>
<br>
Second, This persons arguments speak for themselves.  I lost respect for him after about the 10th stupid thing I saw him say here.  I'm not talking about arguably stupid.  I mean mistakes in basic definitions.  I only have so much patience.  <br>
<br>
I spedifically said that I would make an example of particularly bad arguments, to encourage others to think harder about what they post.<br>
<br>
&quot; recommend you learn how to debate without committing ad hominem. You've done it over and over on this thread, and as a result I don't respect you. I almost agree with you on this issue, I just don't respect you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I swear to god, did you see some of the shit this guy was posting to me?  Wtf am I supposed to do.  This was not part of my refutations of his arguments.  This is genuinely what I beleive after having to read his crap. This guy has to be a masochist to keep posting here.  I'm not in to sadism, so, it's making me distinctly uncomforatable. <br>
<br>
 If you don't respect me, I doubt you respect very many people then. I thought I was too tolerant by half of this guy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Targok.<br>
<br>
My response to you is the same one I used with kazot.  I will put as much effort in to responding as you put in to asking.  With that said, I am reposting the &quot;Courtney Love does the math&quot; link again.  As this fits your question almost to the T, I am led to beleive that you havent read the article yet, else you would have had something to say about it just now.  &quot;That was a crappy article, I didn't beleive a word of it!&quot; or &quot;wow, that was great, That's all I wanted to know, thanks!&quot;<br>

Because someone makes a personal attack against you on a message board, you have to respond by making a personal attack?  This is going to sound old, but isn't this &quot;two wrongs make a right&quot; again?<br>
<br>
Try to take the high road, especially if you're trying to persuade (as I gather that was your original agenda).  Most of us readers are smart enough to recognize that ad hominem isn't relevant to serious debate, and we don't even need your help pointing it out.  If you have to, just acknowledge it as a personal attack and move on.<br>
<br>
It's perhaps unfair that I'm singling you out, since most everyone gets stuck in a cycle of mutual personal attacks on this message board.  It's just that your behavior seemed to be detracting from what was decent argument. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Order of Crimson Hands</span><br>  Posts: 1620<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 11:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

The Government does NOT 'exist' to correct Market Failures.  However, as a consequence of its existing, it does correct Market Failures.<br>
<br>
The United States (hereafter referred to as the Government) exists to perform all necessary functions to run this country - it collects taxes so it has funds to do so, it maintains armies, law enfoircement, legislative and judicial functions, it runs national trusts, regulates business and commercial interests, settles disputes between states, etc.<br>
<br>
The simplistic statement of the Government 'existing to correct market failures' is true in the same way as saying &quot;I exist in order to consume food and poop.&quot;  It is not an accurate definition, although it is true that I eat and poop.<br>

Umm...  Try this:<br>
<br>
1.  Money is spent on National Defense in order to ::GASP:: DEFEND the NATION.  Although it is certainly true that some defense spending is motivated by other factors, again that is a by-product, not the primary purpose.  Furthermore, economic meddling that is done through the Aegis of National Defense is in itself contradictory to your position.  If the Purpose of the Government was to correct Market Failures, they would just do it without the cover of National Defense.<br>
<br>
2.  Taxes are levied so the Government can FUND the programs that it uses to run the Country and serve its citizens.  Pollution is NOT a Market Failure.  If anything, under a purely capitalistic model, it is a Market OPPORTUNITY.  Now you can create an industry to clean pollution.<br>
<br>
3.  Anti-Trust legislation exists because the US favors a capitalistic Free Market, that is correct.  It still does not make it the 'function' of Government.<br>
<br>
Any time there IS a Market Failure, the Government must DECIDE if it will do anything to attempt to corrct it or not (qv Economic Stimulus, Airline Bailout).  If you said the role of the FED was to correct Market Failures, I would agree without question.  But the scope of the US Government is far broader tha that.  Unless you think Afghanistan and Iraq are examples of &quot;Market Failure Correction.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
I made that observation only because your flow chart of reasoning keeps going back to Capitalism, and your embrace of Adam Smith's definition of the purpose of Government.  Personally, I would go with the Framers as a more reputable source of Government definition - No one quotes Adam Smith when pondering Constitutional issues.<br>
<br>
But we are getting sidetracked...  Lets get back to the issue at hand....<br>
<br>
Let's assume for a moment your view is valid:<br>
<br>
a)  The RIAA is a &quot;Market Failure&quot;<br>
b) The role of the Government is to correct Market Failures.<br>
<br>
Should not &quot;c&quot; be that you use the Government to correct the problem?  Where does ignoring copyright laws and setting up a black market distribution network fit into your view?<br>
<br>
I just don't see how you make the leap to that.  Even if you say the Government is correupted. then should not the proper action to be clean up the Government corruption so it can return to its intended function? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caemus>Caemus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=106>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

Perhaps this should tell you something.  The fact that you find yourself defending yourself against the majority of the responses to your posts is very telling.  If anyone is twisting arguments here, it is you.  But, of course, anyone who disagrees with you is simply ignorant.<br>

If you think it's wrong to use p2p software, don't. If you want to call me a theif, fine, do it. But if you think for one minute that unjust laws should be followed just because they are laws then all I can say is that I might be a bit further up on kholberg's hierarchy than you, not lower, as some were suggesting.<br>

If you can not explain why you believe your primary point then why should I endeavor to wade through the rest of the verbal dross.<br>

It appears you just want their product for free and you have been here for six pages trying to justify why stealing it is more ethical than boycotting the organization or organising legal reforms. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zekspawn>Zekspawn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/03 7:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

I DO have problems with people who download whole albums and the people who's computers are the hubs for this stuff.  Wether it's RIAA music or indipendant...you should support an artist if you enjoy their music.  P2P isn't the way to do this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fortuneoffear>Fortune of Fear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/31/03 10:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=688.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I hate the RIAA.

I went back and reread the post you mentioned. Rather than ask me to shlog through that (and yes, I did shlog through the whole thing), please, insult me and make me look like an idiot.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how you can expect anyone else to arrive at your point 12 from the previous 11 points. It is a non sequitor.<br>
<br>
I agree that the music industry is seriously flawed, that record companies make disgusting profits from the work of the artists, and that the price one is required to pay for industry music is ridiculous. I do not see how this justifies theft. And that is what not paying for intellectual property is. On this point you'll not dissuade me.<br>
<br>
I read your link to Courtney Love's interpretation of the math of the music industry, and have only one problem with it. She represents it as happening to bands that are bid over by several labels. Any band, established enough to generate a bidding war by various labels, that allows this to happen to it, deserves it. A band like that should have the label paying for studio time, not themselves. A band like that should have the label paying for it's video under the promotion budget. A band like that should have the label not only paying the tour expeses, but getting paid for the tour. A band like that shouldn't recieve an &quot;advance&quot;, they should get a signing bonus. Change it to a band with marginal recognition that gets one and only one offer from a major label and I'd be much more likely to believe it. Even then, the devil doesn't force you to sell your soul, he just makes it look attractive in the short run. The artists accept these shitty contracts, and sign over their intellectual property to the record label on the hope of breaking big. They're not bad, or greedy, or idiots, just ambitious and maybe niave.<br>
<br>
I agree that there is a change coming to the music industry, and the major record labels aren't going to like it.<br>
<br>
None of this justifies theft.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the storm.<br>
