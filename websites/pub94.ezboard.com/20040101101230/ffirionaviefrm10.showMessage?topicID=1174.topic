<br>
Kyri look at the troll guards found outside the harbor of Dulak. The journey was nearly completed after the unusual experience of actually having to walk a good ways to get here. It seems the portals in the Plane of Knowledge had forgotten about this spot when they set up their mystical passages. Nonetheless the journey was at an end. <br>
<br>
As she reached into her pouch she took out the letter which offered her free passage to her soon to be employer- something necessary in this place where even others who trod the dark paths were scowled at by the pirates of the harbor. Still a writ of safe passage from one of the five Captains would be enough to ensure her safety for now. None of the pirates would risk interfering with their work.<br>
<br>
Still the job itself was rather oddly discovered. In one of her rare trips to Cabilis, Kyri found a posting in the Haggle Baron which caught her attention. A Captain Osaftars from Dulak’s Harbor sought out an assassin to remove some competition- of course this Osaftars didn’t come out and say that of course, but in her line of work Kyri knew how to read between the lines. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Odd that’s he’d post here.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself at first <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>After all the iksar aren’t really into the assassination business, they just prefer to march out in force and obliterate everyone in their way. Doesn’t make much sense to post something like this here. Unless he wanted to make sure someone who wasn’t an enemy of Cabilis found it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She concluded deciding to check with the Baron himself.<br>
<br>
The Baron of course, like most of the city residents, gazed down on Kyri distastefully as she hailed him. Being polite, since he was in the position to let her make some money, Kyri used the Baron’s own tongue which failed to impress him but he grudgingly deigned to speak with her. The Baron had assured Kyri that the letter was indeed genuine and the job a real one. Of course like any merchant he professed his innocence of any knowledge of what lay behind the note. “I am a trader softskin,” he had told her “I hear much but nothing that will get me killed, that’s bad business. Even you softskins should know that.” He had replied when pressed for more details.<br>
<br>
The Baron then began to turn away before stopping and turning back to Kyri, taking a piece of paper out of a pocket. “If you DO wish to take this mission, I have been instructed to give you this seal of passage, in Captain Osaftars’ own writing, to ensure you reach him without getting killed. You softskins ARE rather fragile I have seen. I hope you read our language better than you speak it, if you doubt my words, read it for yourself.” He sneered with a hiss placing the paper on the table before him.<br>
<br>
Opening the folded paper Kyri read, slowly as the iksar tongue was not something she had seen many books written in but she managed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“The bearer of this pass is to be left alone by any harbor dweller for the bearer is here at MY request and WILL be allowed to meet me on the Stormwave at port. Interfere at your own peril.<br>
<br>
In my own hand,<br>
Osaftars- Captain of the Stormwave<br>
Council of the Five &lt;seal&gt; ”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“Council of the Five?” Kyri asked, “What is that?”<br>
<br>
“Softskin…” The Baron replied annoyed, “If you wish to have answers go to the harbor and find them. I was paid to post the offer and give any who expressed interest this note. I know or care nothing else about the matter. Now I have much more important business to take care of than dealing with a softskin like you so be off now.” He finished pointedly turning his back on Kyri and leaving the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well I guess I’ll find out how well this works, at least the pay will be good, and assassinations always pay well, even if I have to deal with this sort of annoyance.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she neared the gate guards to the harbor who scowled as she approached them. Taking out the pass, while keeping her hands from her weapons, Kyri held the note out idly wondering if the troll guard could even read. As if to answer her suspicions the troll looked at it oddly, and then passed it to its fellow guard, who looked at it equally confused, though both pointed to the seal at the bottom of the letter, the seal of the Council.<br>
<br>
Then the first troll, looked back to the guardhouse and whistled. Turning back to Kyri, the troll said surprising Kyri with its plain speech,” I don’t read this tongue but I know the seal. Sergeant should clear this up.” The troll said normally as Kyri reflected to the rumors that the trolls here weren’t your average roll around in the mud and think its fun types. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guess the stories were right.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She decided as another figure approached an iksar she saw surprised to see these two races working together rather harmoniously it seemed at first glance.<br>
<br>
“What is it?” the Sergeant said as he arrived, then looked to Kyri- “you two need help taking this one in?” gesturing dismissively at Kyri with his thumb.<br>
<br>
“No sarge,” the first troll replied, “she had this note from the Council- but we can’t read it so figured you might.”<br>
<br>
“What letter from the Council?” the sergeant demanded as he took the note and skimmed it quickly. Then turning to Kyri he said a bit more respectfully. “Ah I see you DO have business here. Don’t let me keep you.” He said standing aside to let her pass.<br>
<br>
“The note.” Kyri said holding out her hand.<br>
<br>
The sergeant looked at her in apparent surprise that the note of passage was still in his claws. “Oh of course, here you go.” He apologized handing the note back to her.<br>
<br>
“What you though I’d let you hold onto this so the next person I run into around the corner can jump me because you have it?” Kyri said taking the note back. “If you’ll excuse me, we can’t keep the Council waiting after all can we? What’s your name sergeant, I’d be happy to tell the Council how helpful you were to me?” She finished smiling.<br>
<br>
“Um, that won’t be necessary,” the sergeant stammered, the LAST thing he wanted was for the Council to take notice of him, especially if he interfered with one of their jobs. People didn’t get to do so a second time he had seen. Turning around sharply, he began to berate the two trolls for their slovenly appearance hoping that this stranger would be gone when he turned back around. To his relief she was.<br>
<br>
Well finding the dock won’t be hard, just follow my nose. Kyri concluded as the smell of the sea, fish and garbage filled the air. Twice more she was forced to show her pass to some wandering guards before she found the dock itself. Checking into one of the inns there, she carefully stored her belongings and put her own special locks on the door and windows- just in case, as it WAS a port town and being too comfortable usually meant you left with nothing you walked in with except the shirt on your back- if you were lucky.<br>
<br>
Once her room was secured to her satisfaction, Kyri made her way towards the docks themselves where she found five large ships in port. Quickly she made the connection- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Council of Five must be the captains of these ships, a sort of pirate’s guild I guess</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she determined as she made her way down the docks. Naturally she started on the wrong side and made her way down the entire dock before finding the Stormwave at the end of the docks. Walking up the dock ramp towards the ship she saw two iksar immediately come to attention drawing their shivs ready to toss this intruder off their ship.<br>
<br>
Sighing to herself, Kyri again brought forth the note which, the pirate read and said. “Come this way, the Cap’n has been waiting for someone to arrive for some time.” Taking their place at either side the two guards, escorted Kyri onto the ship, though their closeness to her made Kyri feel as if she was a prisoner being sent out under guard. Soon enough they made their way to the main deck and up to a door to a room on the deck. “Cap’n’s quarters, wait here.” The first guard instructed as he softly knocked on the closed door, a muffled voice could be heard within and the iksar went inside.<br>
<br>
Shortly Kyri’s escort came out of the room with another iksar- this one bearing the air of command about him, and more importantly to Kyri, was bearing a small chest. Bearing his teeth in what was supposed to be a smile the newcomer greeted Kyri, “Ah excellent, I had thought the Baron was going to let me down. I am Captain Osaftars, come inside where we can discuss the matter you’re here for. Lads, see no one bothers us.” The Captain ordered gesturing Kyri to go inside, smiling slightly as she deferred and let him enter first.<br>
<br>
“Ah, very wise, you are, you’ve just met me so who knows what I may have set up inside for you if you went first. Indeed, this shows me you’re the one I’m looking for.” Osaftars said agreeably.<br>
<br>
“Spare the flattery,” Kyri replied, “just tell me what you want and how much you’re paying me to do it. I think I know but it’s always best for the potential employer to come out and say it himself.”<br>
<br>
“Blunt and to the point, I can deal with that well enough.” Osaftars replied. “Very well, to be ‘blunt’ you are correct in assuming I need a hired killer to remove my competition here. I seek to rule the Council and bring it under my control to increase our plundering ability far beyond what we now accomplish due to those timid wolf pups. To do so I must remove the most senior of them, Captain Bloodspear. Once Bloodspear is taken care of the others will follow my lead.”<br>
<br>
“Sounds simple enough.” Kyri replied, “So why go so far from here to get someone to do the job? I’d think some of your ‘lads’ could take care of this.”<br>
<br>
“Why? Because if one of mine were seen committing the deed, the other Captains would turn on me in an instant and bring me down. No I need someone who can not be traced back to me and mine to do this. If you are killed my hands are clean to try again. If you succeed then you will be paid and we go our separate ways, until the next time I need to hire your services.”<br>
<br>
“And speaking of hire,” Kyri said, “how much are you offering, you seem to have forgotten that part.”<br>
<br>
“Ah yes, how does this do for payment?” Osaftars answered opening the chest and revealing a velium chain necklace studded with a dozen blue diamonds. “This little trinket was picked up a few weeks back during a raid on a merchant’s ship. It would be impossible to fence here but in a far away land? It would sell for quite a bit I would imagine.” Smiling at the end as he saw Kyri looking greedily at the revealed treasure.<br>
<br>
“That’s quite a bit for such a simple job.” Kyri said after finally looking up from the necklace having quickly estimated its worth. “What’s the catch?”<br>
<br>
Looking surprised, Osaftars assured her, “No catches, I can easily make this up once I rule the Council, and such a prize will ensure you will do your best to pull off the job won’t it?”<br>
<br>
“Ok fine you have a deal,” Kyri agreed, “I take out your competitor and you give me the necklace.” Pausing briefly in thought she added, “Is there any particular way you want it done? To send a message or something to the others?”<br>
<br>
Smiling again the Captain reached into a drawer and pulled out a small vial. “Something I am sure you’ve run across, a slow acting poison, dump the whole vial’s contents into the mess pot of the Oceancrasher- that’s Bloodspear’s ship, once he and his crew finish their meal they’ll find themselves dead in a couple hours. A fine little concoction put together in Cabilis, many odd plants there, whose liquefied essences have the most interesting effects. None of my people are skilled enough to get in and out of that ship undetected or we’d have done it already. So that’s where you come in. Assuming you CAN do it of course.”<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry about that,” Kyri retorted, “I can do that no problem, just keep that necklace safe for when I come back. But now if you don’t want us connected how are you going to explain my being here now- lots of people have seen me on the dock here today.”<br>
<br>
“Ah a simple matter.” Osaftars said dismissively, “my lads know what’s afoot, they’re spinning tales about a Teir-dal merchant looking to hire us to raid a competitor. It’s happened several times in the past, once more won’t cause any additional interest. Of course it does tend to be a slow process, as you’ve noticed we don’t much care for outsiders here so there are many intermediate steps before such a meeting. You being here merely means the job is almost sealed. No one will think twice about your presence for a few days as we ‘finalize’ our ‘deal’ here. “<br>
<br>
“Ok then,” Kyri agreed taking the vial offered, “I’m not too fond of staying long in a place where most folk would rather slit my throat than let me buy breakfast. Tomorrow night, then- one day to scout out the ship and one to slip into the mess hall and season their dinner. I’ll be back here at midnight for my pay, since if this stuff works they’ll all be dead by then.”<br>
<br>
“Excellent, until tomorrow night then, enjoy your hunt. But for now I must get back to my work. You know the way out. May Cazic smile on your mission.” Osaftars replied as he returned to the task he had been interrupted at.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Arrogant lizard</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought as once more an iksar dismissed her like a lackey. Still annoyed she, escorted now by one of the two crewmen who brought her here, made her way off the ship and headed back to the inn to rest up before she began her scouting that night.<br>
<br>
The other iksar waited until Kyri was out of sight before entering his Captain’s room. As Osaftars looked up, the crewman asked, “Well did she take the job?”<br>
<br>
Pushing aside his work Osaftars replied, “Of course, these softskins are easily moved by wealth. She has taken the job. Perhaps this one might succeed, she has some basic common sense for a softskin when not distracted by wealth.”<br>
<br>
“And if she does, you’re going to give her THAT necklace?” the crewman questioned.<br>
<br>
“Of course not, don’t be a fool.” Osaftars snapped, “If this one actually does succeed she might one day be hired to deal with ME. So if this assassin is successful we shall have to take steps to prevent such an occurrence from taking place and ensure my own rise to power occurs with no complications.”<br>
<br>
Reaching into a second drawer, Osaftars removed a pouch filled with a fine gray powder and ran his claws through it before addressing his crewman again. “Cazic’s gift will take care of everything.”<br>
<br>

The crew idled along its tasks, being on shore the demands were few at this time for the crew. <br>
<br>
   Absently fingering the vial of poison in her pouch, Kyri considered her options. A frontal approach was folley, the crew would never let her get near the messpot as an outsider. Besides anyone here would be willing to slit anyone's throat for so much as looking at them oddly, nevermind a stranger waltzing on board their ship. <br>
<br>
   A night approach would be her preferred method but that would have her arriving after the meals and force her to leave the poison out for hours before someone MIGHT decide to use whatever it was she poisoned. No, she concluded, she only had a few hours to get inside and &quot;season&quot; the meal. This time a disguise would have to be trusted and the opportunity taken if one came to her.<br>
<br>
    According to Osaftars, the cook and his helpers often left the ship a few hours before dusk to gather what was needed for the evening meal. That would be when she had to strike.<br>
<br>
   Kyri returned to her quarters where her few belongings remained. On the job she always travelled light just in case she needed to make a hasty depature and didn't want to leave anything of value behind. The temptation to come back for something with sentimental value has proven to be a fatal error for many novices of the trade. The new arrival right before a mysterious death was always the remembered one when the questions started.<br>
<br>
   Going through the one bag she brought with her, Kyri unpacked some plain, unadorned clothes. The long sleeved tunic and pants of a common laborer with the large woolen hooded cloak to go over it, and provide cover for her weapons as well. Even in a place like this brandishing weapons openly was a good way to get in trouble. Better to &quot;privately&quot; convince any footpads lurking about that easier prey lay elsewhere.<br>
<br>
    Leaving the room, Kyri made sure to check her wristband where the tiny springlocked needle lay, coated with a special &quot;rustproofing&quot; experiment of hers. A flick of the wrist would trigger the spring to shoot the needle out with enough force to pierce the skin of her target before retracting- though she had to basically be touching the person to reach them as the spring and needle were not very large. The poison on the needle would be enough to make a person grow faint and fall unconscious for a few hours or so. Long enough to rob them of everything of value while &quot;helping&quot; them. Today the purpose will be slightly different.<br>
<br>
   She made her way to the market area of the harbor town and found a place to wait near the food vendors, occasionally purchasing something to snack on to give her a reason to be there. Kyri smiled to herself as she saw the market was rather crowded, many people brushing up against each other unavoidably. If she was so inclinced, Kyri could have certainly been able to rob many of the people present under these circumstances but she was not hear for that.<br>
<br>
   Finally, just as Osaftars predicted the cook and a couple of servants began loudly making their way to the market. The cook, a shrilled voiced fellow, could be heard clearly arguing prices with the vendors about how &quot;Captain Bloodspear will hear of this outrage!&quot; a common phrase as the haggling began. Kyri did note the vendors did not haggle quite so forcefully after such announcements and grudgingly gave the cook some credit for wits.<br>
<br>
   As they moved along, the cook continued his purchases, and began to load up the servants with him with bags and containers to be used for the meal. Finally after an hour or so the cook announced that it was time to prepare the meal now and obediently the servants turned and began to follow him back to the boat. <br>
<br>
   Kyri had in the meantime been able to make her way near the trio as they haggled, feigning interest in a nearby artists paintings. Seeing the moment, Kyri stepped out after them and came near when she suddenly stumbled and fell forward, her arms reaching out for the nearest source of support, cooincidently the rearmost of the cook's servants. As her hands made contact, Kyri flicked her wrist and smiled as she saw the servant stiffen briefly as the needle struck home and retracted back under her wristband before anyone could notice.<br>
<br>
   &quot;My apologies,&quot; Kyri muttered as the servant tried to hold onto everything without spilling it and keep his balance at the same time. As the poison seeped into his blood , the servant began to get weak kneed as the cook turned around and saw him lagging behind him.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Hurry up you...what are you doing!&quot; the cook demanded as the servant lost hisbattle with the poison and collapsed to the ground. Kyri, still standing near &quot;helpfully&quot; caught some of the bags the servant had been carrying as he fell.<br>
<br>
   &quot;What happened?&quot; the cook demanded to Kyri as people began to move away from the fallen figure lest they get caught in some sort of feud.<br>
<br>
   &quot;I'm not sure.&quot; Kyri answered, &quot;I lost my balance and near tripped if your friend here hadn't been standing so close for me to grab on to. I was afraid i'd make him drop everything he had on him but he seemed like he had everything under control. Then he took a few steps and just fell over. I tried to catch some of what he had with him so it wouldn't be damaged but that i'm afraid i missed a few things.&quot; she concluded pointing to the bags laying on the ground, vegetables spilling from one bag that burst open on impact.<br>
<br>
    Glaring down at the fallen servant, the cook snarled &quot;That lazy fool must have been drunk again. I warned him about drinking before the meal is done. The captain will have my head if his meal is late and thanks to this drunken oaf i'll never be able to get everything back to the ship in time!&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;The captain?&quot; Kyri asked innocently, &quot;you mean you work for one of the Captains?&quot; she finished wide eyed<br>
<br>
   Sensing her awe, the cook straighetened and replied proudly &quot;That's right, I serve Captain Bloodspear, the meanest, roughest and most successful of all the Captains here. Though if i don't get his dinner cooking he'll hang me by my thumbs from the mast and leave me there for a week.&quot; he finished trying to gather the fallen bags when Kyri knelt down beside him also gathering the bags and added. &quot;Oh please, let me help you, i'd be honored to offer any help i could for such a mighty captain. This way you won;t be late, my mother said i have some skill in the kitchens myself, i could help.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Eyeing her carefully the cook said &quot;Well, that drunkard will be of no use to me, let him stew in his own juices here in the street, maybe when he sobers up he might actually still have his clothes. I have no choice come along you...what did you say your name was again?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Sumida.&quot; Kyri replied, deciding to get yet another jab at a Hateborn in case anything went wrong.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Good enough then Sumida, come along and hurry.&quot; the cook replied as Kyri took up the servant's load and joined the small procession back to the ship.<br>
<br>
   The crew looked at her oddly as Kyri was most certainly not the man who left with the cook but the exasperated cook- whom Kyri finally learned was named Marty- argued them down by saying if the captain's supper was late then he knew who to say was holding him up from starting the meal.<br>
<br>
   Soon enough Kyri made it to the kitchen where Marty began passing orders to the staff there who went into a frenzy of activity as they were already behind schedule. Kyri did her part- though she was in fact no great cook by any means but it didn't take much skill to chop up vegetables for the stew the cook decided was the only thing that they might finish in time. She also sought the chance to add the poison to the dish but found Marty often tasted the dish to be sure it was cooking properly so she had to delay.<br>
<br>
   Finally as the stew was nearly finished she found her chance as Marty told her to add some water to the stew which was becoming thicker than the Captain preferred. making sure no one noticed, Kyri quickly dumped the vial's contents into the water she was adding. Fortunately it was colorless and thus undetectable as she poured the poisoned water into the stew. <br>
<br>
   A short time later Marty did taste the stew once more and announced it being satisfactory. Idly Kyri hoped the poison was slow acting since marty's turning green and keeling over dead would put a crimp in her plans. She was about to leave when Marty insisted she help serve the crew as they were still shorthanded. Seeing no reasonable way to refuse and not arouse suspicion, Kyri relented. Smiling for the first time since she met him, Marty promised to have a big bowl of stew set aside for her as well when she finished serving the others- since she did put in the effort to help make it...and save Marty's tender skin in the process, it was only fair that she at least get a free meal out of it.<br>
<br>
   As she expected, the crew was half drunk and were part octopus as she unsuccessfully tried to avoid their pinches and slaps on her buttocks. One tried to draw her into his embrace and found himself wearing the contents of his bowl, and laying on his back as Kyri kicked his chair out from under him-to the laughter of his comrades who then treated Kyri as one of their own...after a fashion.<br>
<br>
   Once the last was served, she returned to the kitchen where Marty appeared a bit pale. &quot;Good job Sumida, the boys are like that, but i see you know how to handle yourself. I think all this stress has gotten me a bit under the weather though. Anyway i set some stew aside for you. Go eat while its still warm.&quot; he encouraged.<br>
<br>
   &quot;In a minute.&quot; Kyri answered, &quot;I just need to get some air for a bit, it is a bit warm in here from all the cooking after all. And my stomach needs to settle some&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Of course, of course.&quot; Marty replied &quot;I forgot you're a lubber and not a seadog like the rest of us. Go on ahead, no one will bother you.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Before he changed his mind, Kyri nodded her thanks and made her way topside. Of course once she got there she continued on off the ship. The drunken guards on the watch never even stirred as she crept past them and made her way back into the city, where she disappeared into the night.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well that should do it, from the way Marty was acting from just a taste i think that ship will have maybe an hour before the poison kicks in completely. Now i just have to wait and see how effective this poison of Osaftars really is.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she returned to her rooms. Tossing her cloak- which was stolen anyway, into one of the alleys just in case anyone remembered the cloaked woman from the market.<br>
<br>
   The next morning Kyri went down, in her regular armor to breakfast in the commons area and found the innkeeper going on about the Oceancrasher's entire crew being found dead in the mess hall.Feigning ignorance, Kyri asked for a few details but the innkeeper claimed he knew little else. <br>
<br>
   &quot;A servant of some sort who had passed out in an alleyway and robbed of everything but his loincloth went back to the ship and started shouting about everyone was dead. A few folk went back with him and sure enough the whole crew from the Captain on down was dead. No one knows who's responsible&quot; he told her before someone else walked into the inn and he began the story over from the beginning.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Looks like i'll be getting paid then, that necklace will get me a good price, i'm sure Stanos can get rid of it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought as she finished her breakfast and made her way towards the Stormwave.<br>
<br>
   Showing her note of passage to the guards, got her invited to Osaftar's cabin where the iksar pirate was waiting.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Well done. The news of this tragic accident has been the talk of the harbor this morning. No doubt the people will be looking for someone else to show them the way after the tragic loss of Captain Bloodspear.&quot; Osaftars greeted her as she enetered and offfered her a seat<br>
<br>
   &quot;Yeah i'm sure they will,&quot; Kyri replied drily, as she sat adding, &quot;and i'm sure you know the perfect candidate for the job. But that's your affair. All i'm worried about is my pay.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Ah yes, right to the point aren't you?&quot; Osaftars replied calling for the Bo'sun who was then sent off to fetch the necklace. Turning back to Kyri he took two mugs off the shelf, placing them on the table before them and then took a bottle of wine as well.<br>
<br>
   &quot;While we wait for your payment to arrive perhaps you'll join me in a celebratory drink?&quot; the iksar asked pouring the wine in one of the cups. As he turned to pour into Kyri's she surprised him by taking the bottle from his hands.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Allow me.&quot; Kyri asked as she sniffed the contents within cautiously as if looking for something.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Cautious as ever i see.&quot; Osaftrars replied once he realized what Kyri was up to. &quot;But not necessary, after all had i wished you dead i would not allow you to come within a blade's reach of me. I'd have my men shoot down down before you set foot on this ship.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Maybe,&quot; Kyri answered as she filled her mug, not being able to pick up the scent of any poison within the wine. &quot;then again who knows what tricks you might have.&quot; she finished dipping a finger into the cup and tasting it with the tip of her tongue and waited for any sign of something toxic to appear as such a small dose would not incapacitate her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You softskins.&quot; Osaftars smiled shaking his head. Here allow me to set your fears aside.&quot; and took a deep drink from his own mug. Placing it back on the table the pirate said &quot;See I still breathe, you have nothing to fear from the wine.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Waiting a moment even then Kyri looked for a sign of discomfort in her drinking partner before taking a drink from her own mug and with a surprise discovering it to be a rather high quality vintage. As Osaftars smiled, the Bo'sun took that moment to return with the case containing the necklace.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Ah excellent.&quot; the Captain replied as he openned the case and showed the necklace to Kyri to prove it was really there. As she reached for it, Osaftars closed the case and pulled it out of her reach saying &quot;OF course this is not for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Surprised, Kyri came to her feet only to find her balance was off as she drew her ragebringer. &quot;What...&quot; she began as the iksar smiled grimly.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Fool of a softskin, did you think i would give such a valuable object to one such as you?&quot; Osaftars sneered as Kyri used her free hand to support herself upright on the table. As she looked accusingly at the pirate he went on, &quot;Oh yes the wine is as i said a fine vintage, not to be ruind with a poison, your mug however, was coated with a drug which shall render you unconscious shortly.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Her hand sliding off the table, Kyri dropped her ragebringer as her hands would not obey her commands and slumped to her knees as the iksar continued. &quot;You have only yourself to blame you know. You were the first to actually succeed in this task and so you are much too dangerous to be running around on your own. Besides there are other captains to be dealt with here and your services will be required do deal with them as well. Obviously no iksar will treat with such as you on an equal basis so consider this to be the first part of new new life in the service of the Empire... as its slave.&quot; he finished as Kyri slumped unconscious to the cabin floor.<br>
<br>
   Waiting a moment to ensure she was indeed unconscious, Osaftars reached into the second drawer of his table and pulled out the pouch holding the grey powder known as &quot;Cazic's gift&quot;. Taking a pinch he placed it into the mug Kyri had drank from and with the Bo'sun's help he forced Kyri to reflexively swallow a few more sips of the doctored wine.<br>
<br>
   &quot;That will be enough for now.&quot; Osaftars replied setting the mug aside. Gesturing to the Bo'sun he added, &quot;Take her down below to the hold where we keep the slaves, remove anything that might be used as a weapon and leave here there. Once she awakens we shall begin the next phase of my plan.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Aye Cap'n&quot; the bo'sun replied calling for another of the sailors to drag Kyri's body down below. As they departed Osaftars smiled to himself as he thought. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Very soon now, not only will i be head of the Council of Five, now four thanks to the assassin, but the entire fleet shall be mine for the glory of the Empire. And its foes shall tremble at our passing. All that is needed now is to bend the assassin to my will and let her be my hand of death against those who oppose me.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> patting the pouch sitting on the table before him he concluded <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And Cazic's gift shall provide me the way.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

How long was she unconscious she could not tell but her throat was parched. Oddly under the cirtcumstances she felt oddly relaxed but this soon changed as she tried to rise to her feet and was brought up short. Her wrists, she discovered had been shackled through a metal loop on the ground of what she determined was the lower decks of a ship. The chain joining them was barely a foot long giving her hands little room to move. Behind her she noticed her ankles also shackled in the same manner, as she looked around she noted other similar sets of restraints set in a line along the deck, obviously set up to transport slaves. An initial test of the chains proved them to be more than what she could break right now. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The room was dark but that was no real obstacle to her night vision. Looking at herself, Kyri realized she had been stripped down to her tismak undergarmets, no sign of a weapon or anything that could be used to pick the shackle’s locks holding her in place. The room was bare except for a bowl filled with what appeared to be water. After the last drink however, Kyri was not about to be so foolish as to trust another drink that Osaftars might provide.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As she struggled to her knees, still a bit lightheaded from the drugged, she heard a commotion from above her. Apparently she had been watched for the time that she would come to, for only minutes later a hatch across the room opened and two figures came down the stairway towards her. <br>
<br>
Osaftars looked at his captive curiously as he neared Kyri, stopping a few feet in front of her as she glared up at him. “What do you think you’re doing?” Kyri snarled defiantly as he looked down at her. “We had a deal!”<br>
<br>
The iksar captain looked at her oddly and answered “A deal? With a slave? The Empire makes no such deals.”<br>
<br>
“Well if I find a slave I’ll be sure to let them know that.” Kyri retorted, “I killed your rival like we agreed, so stop playing your games and pay me and I’ll pretend this never happened.” She finished bluffing, as Osaftars held all the advantages right now.<br>
<br>
“Fool!” Osaftars sneered, “Did you actually think that was my sole agenda? Having one such as you come halfway across the world just to kill someone here? Your arrogance is even greater than I expected slave.”<br>
<br>
“I told you…” Kyri began, stopping as the crewman accompanying the captain smacked her across the face at a nod from his Captain. As she spun back seething Osaftars continued, “Do not interrupt your betters. Now since you won’t be going anywhere I can tell you what my real purpose is. If you interrupt you will be punished for your insolence understood?” Seething Kyri weighed the odds and abruptly nodded in disgust.<br>
<br>
“Excellent, you are already beginning to learn.” Osaftars complimented her, “Now while indeed my rise to rule the council here and control the pirating efforts for the glory of the Empire is indeed one goal of mine. There is another service I provide for the Empire.”<br>
<br>
“You see,” he continued, “Unlike these radicals who seek to join with outsiders against the foes of the Empire, too ignorant to see that ALL are our enemies, I have a duty to protect the Empire and its citizens. That being the case I heard the rumors of those guards who could be bribed into convincing the rest of the city to accept the presence of outsiders. They will be dealt with when the time comes, such weakness disgraces the memories of the Emperors past. An even greater threat I realized came from those skilled in the art of murder, such as yourself. These softskins might prove to be a threat of their own against the Empire. Think about it, no need to sneak through the streets fearful of discovery and death when the citizens have been bribed into letting these softskins walk the streets openly.”<br>
<br>
“Those fools who guard the city would let you wander where you wish, perhaps even to the chambers of the leaders of the Empire, to foully murder them while they slept, which is a softskin tradition I have heard, of those too cowardly or fearful to challenge an Imperial citizen in a fair fight. So this threat had to be dealt with, before everyone’s eyes were blinded or numbed by the presence of your kind among us.”<br>
<br>
“That when I decided I must act. So I left the message with the Haggle Baron knowing full well, only those who could enter the city could read it, and that only those trained in the art of murder would come here. In doing so I could achieve both goals. To first improve my station here and use the power of a united pirate force for the Empire’s glory. Secondly I could remove the chance for killers like yourself to bring harm to the Empire, by removing you from play.” <br>
<br>
“You should feel honored softskin, four others before you came here, all were slain before they could complete their mission. You were the first to succeed, proving my point of your threat. It could have just as easily been the Court of Pain which you struck down, but instead you aid my rise to power and have been neutralized as a threat against the Empire. As a reward for your success, I will not kill you, that could have been easily done once you were unconscious, for you may still serve the Empire even now. As a slave of course, the only role suitable for you softskins at any rate, but still an honor that one of the Empire sees your value enough to keep you. Indeed, you shall eliminate the other three captains here as well, to ensure my supremacy of the harbor. With the others dead, no one will be able to challenge me.”<br>
<br>
“Of course once you have finished your mission, you will be sent to Cabilis to work in the mines for the rest of your days, unless someone else desires your talents in the Empire’s service. A fitting role for one of your ilk indeed.” Osaftars concluded.<br>
<br>
“Oh just like that eh?” Kyri replied, “On your say so I’m going to be a good little slave and do what you want? I don’t think that’s going to happen. Has it ever occurred to you that I might walk the streets there because I wish to aid the Empire?”<br>
<br>
“Then you should have no worries then,” Osaftars answered, “for aid the Empire you shall in your slavery and it will be grateful for your service. As for the rest, your kind are among the more stubborn of the softskins but I am confident you will accept your place soon enough. Cazic’s gift can control even the strongest of wills.” He concluded, lifting the bowl of water up and taking a drink as Kyri’s eyes followed the gesture, which did not go unnoticed.<br>
<br>
“Ah thirsty are you?” Osaftars asked, holding the bowl to her lips, “ That drug I used does have that after effect I have noticed, then drink, as you can see, I have drunk and I feel quite fine.”<br>
<br>
Suspiscious still, Kyri looked away only to have the crewman grab her head and yanked it back towards the bowl.<br>
<br>
“Drink.” Osaftars demanded, as the crewman grabbed her jaw and hair and with a yank opened her mouth so Osaftars could pour the water down her throat.<br>
<br>
Spluttering and choking as she tried not to swallow, Kyri found some of the water did indeed get swallowed reflexively and glared at Osaftars again.<br>
<br>
“Good enough for now.” Osaftars decided after a few gulps were forced down her throat and placing the rest of the bowl in her reach on the floor. “Come we have work to do.” He said gesturing to the crewman who released Kyri before adding “Feel free to drink as much as you wish, there is plenty more. Food will be brought later because I do not wish to have you weak from hunger when it comes time to perform your service for the Empire.”<br>
<br>
Getting her coughing under control, Kyri spat at Osaftars’ feet and snarled, “You’re dead lizard, trust me.”<br>
<br>
Looking back with a serpentine smile Osaftars answered, “I think not slave, trust ME.” And left the cargo bay.<br>
<br>
Kyri glared at the doorway for a brief time and then looked down at the half full bowl of water before her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Obviously there’s something wrong with that water, he seemed awfully pleased when they managed to pour it down my throat.Not sure what though, my throat’s still dry but other than that, I just feel...normal. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She debated whether to knock over the remainder of the water but decided against it in case that was supposed to last her through the day. While Osaftars did insist that she be fed enough to finish killing off his fellow captains he made no mention of how often that would be. Plus the cargo bay was rather warm and dehydration was something to keep in mind as well she realized.<br>
<br>
Testing the chains once more, Kyri gathered herself into as comfortable a posisiton as she could while she waited. Nothing else could be done at that time. As she sat there, her body grew oddly relaxed despite the somewhat awkward posisition she was force to kneel in. Her throughs drifted from escape, to pleasant daydreams of untold riches. After a time she forgot her bonds and tried stretching out as she felt an unnatural laziness seep into her muscles, only to be brought up short. As her body languished, Kyri lay herself down as best she could and closed her eyes indulging in her body’s reaction.<br>
<br>
Kyri openned her eyes some time later and realized she had been still for so long that she had stiffened up and had gotten slightly numb in the process. Trying to strech out and get feeling back in her limbs she found herself dry mouthed again and found herself looking at the bowl of water again. Again she tore her eyes from it, not quite trusting the water but her thrist would not be forgotten. No one else had come to see her, and the noises above her from the crew attending to their duties did little to distract her and soon she found herself staring at the bowl as her tongue felt leaden in her mouth. Her stubbornness endured for nearly an hour before she finally broke down and drank deeply from the bowl again, as she reasoned it hadn’t killed her yet so it was probably safe. <br>
<br>
She then placed the empty bowl down with a sigh of relief as her parched mouth welcomed the moisture. Hoping someone would come by with something to eat, for her stomach told her it was indeed time for some sort of meal, Kyri decided to call out, “Hey you think someone can get around to bringing me something to eat down here?”<br>
<br>
Laughter answered her shout which was about what she expected she admitted to herself. Still, that lizard’s lied to me once already, who knows, maybe he does plan on starving me. If that’s the case I’d better start planning. As she began her planning, she idly noticed her body again relaxing as she sat there and her thoughts again began to drift as she had to force herelf to concentrate on the matter at hand. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What’s wrong with me, I can’t keep my thoughts straight. Is there something in the water after all? But this doesn’t seem to be anything bad,just a relaxant, it doesn’t make sense.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She wondered before more pleasant thoughts intruded and she lay back down on the deck in relaxing bliss.<br>
<br>
Osaftars opened the hold with a tray of bread, cheese and water in hand to bring to his slave. As he reached Kyri he found the Teir-dal lying on the deck a faint smile on her face as she lay there unaware of her surroundings. Smiling to himself Osaftars thought as he placed the tray nearby and in reach of his still unwilling slave, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Cazic’s gift does its work well. With no apparent side effects the victim relishes its relaxing effect and will slowly grow to want it more often. As a thief- she may have the wit to realize there’s something in her drink but that won’t help her, the dryness it leaves encourages its victims to quench their thirst and so continue the cycle. Of course, it does not affect an iksar in any way, only the softskins as the shamans have proven, so my drinking from the bowl earlier convinced my slave of its harmlessness. The fool. When she awakens she will be thirsty again and everything on this tray has been dosed with a sprinkling of Cazic’s gift to make its hold on her even stronger. A few more days and its hold on her will be complete. Then she shall see what happens when she is deprived of its “benefits” and once that is made clear then she will be MINE! For the glory of the EMPIRE!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With a smile, Osaftars looked down at the resting Teir-dal being slowly brought into his service unbeknownst to her, turned and went back above deck.<br>
