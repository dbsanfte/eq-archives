Thought I enjoy the game more than I did EverQuest, last night I ran into a situation that I found deplorable, and gives me a whole new respect for the Guides on EverQuest.<br>
<br>
A situation occured where 5 of us were on a mission, and at the end of the mission, a very high dollar item dropped (sellable in game for around 200 million credits, which is a ton of money.)<br>
<br>
To make a long story short, one of my team members looted the item before the roll commensed for the item and then magically went Link Dead.  His friend, who was also on the team, and on the phone with him, told us he wasn't going to come back and that the disk was rightfully his.  Well, after a few moments of words exchange, his friend decided to come back and we wanted to commense the roll for the item...<br>
<br>
Where, here is a log of what happened after he arrived.<br>
<br>
(The thieves in question are Ordit and Flizor)<br>
(I am Trinodast in this conversation)<br>
<br>
Ordit:how about instead of one of us getting the prize, we were a team getting it, lets sell it and split the credits 5 ways ? that okay with u all ?<br>
Xuum: maybe NO is cool answer ?<br>
Trinodast: Bottom line man, what you did was tasteless and wrong<br>
Xuum: i take 3<br>
Cashiz: 4<br>
Trinodast: 2<br>
Xuum: Flizor your number ?<br>
Trinodast: play the game right, you wouldn't have gotten that disk if you wouldn't have been in this team<br>
Ordit: what is wrong with all of us gettin a little bit of the credits ?<br>
[Team] Flizor: was 5 but not gonna roll for it<br>
Flizor: 5 but I'm not gonna roll for it<br>
Xuum: aight<br>
Xuum: then Ordit u are 1<br>
Trinodast: I'll do the roll<br>
To [helpbot} roll 4<br>
[Helpbot] from 1 to 4 I rolled 2, to verify do /tell &lt;me&gt; verifty 1065<br>
Xuum: whatever just make it quick<br>
Ordit: flizor got it<br>
Ordit: it was 5<br>
Ordit: verify 1064<br>
Xuum hehehe yeah verify plz ?<br>
Trinodast: I just rolled it<br>
Ordit: i did to<br>
Trinodast: was 2, verify 1065<br>
Trinodast: he was out of the roll, he said himself<br>
Xuum: lol oki hold<br>
Xuum: lets just call ark he will roll<br>
Flizor: but i put the 5 down<br>
You are team leader.<br>
Flizor left your team.<br>
Trinodast: dude, yous aid you were out of the roll befor the roll happened<br>
Xuum: that does it<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the GM came and said that he couldn't do anything because they were in the team, and they can loot whatever they want, regardless of the team rules before the mission started.<br>
<br>
So... I sent a letter to funcom...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dear Funcom,<br>
<br>
    I have been playing Anarchy Online now for about four (4) months.  Since I have been here, I have had a lot of fun and enjoyed the game.  But last night, something happened to me that I feel is unacceptable.  Last night my team was on a mission, There were five of us total, myself, who goes by the name of Trinodast, Xuum, Cashiz, Ordit and Flizor.  <br>
<br>
   The mission was going well and we were doing well, made it through the mission and finally got to the boss and killed him.  Upon death, on the corpse of the boss was a item by the name of Instruction Disk (Grid Armor MK IV).  Being the team leader, I called the item and told them that we were going to roll on the item, and everyone agreed.<br>
<br>
<br>
   Well, the two who pulled this travesty of theft, Ordit and Flizor, Ordit looted the disk while I was working out all the details of the roll and after he did, he LD'ed.  Well, his friend Ordit, was on the phone with him, told us that he wasn't going to come back and do the roll.  After a few minutes of arguing with his friend, he decided to come back and then agreed to do the roll.<br>
<br>
   We all chose our numbers, Ordit 1, Myself 2, Xuum 3, Cashiz 4, and Flizor 5.  Well, shortly before I made the roll, Flizor said he no longer wanted in on the roll, so I told him I would take him out of the roll.   Anyhow, I sent the tell to helpbot, and the number was 2, so I won the disk right? Wrong.<br>
<br>
   Out of nowhere Ordit says he rolled to helpbot and that the number was 5, and that his friend Flizor had won the disk.  They both then left the party and left the mission.<br>
<br>
   I called an ARK on the situation, think that if I explained the situation, that being that their be honesty upheld in AO, that we'd get the disk back.  Well, guess what, your ARK's said they couldn't do anything due to the fact they were in team and that they are allowed to loot whatever, and that the agreement we made prior to the mission has no substance whatsoever in this situation.<br>
<br>
   Personally this makes me sick.  Your loophole rules promote thievery and dishonesty, which makes people like me, who's account is comming up to be renewed in a few days, not even want to renew.  Anarchy Online has become a haven for thieves and little punk kids who can rob other players of their hard earned items and leaves us who try to play the game with honesty and dignity, with our hands tied, and our pockets empty.  You should really consider revamping your rules concerning this before you lose more customers than just myself.<br>
<br>
If FunCom supports dishonesty and unfair game play, then I will not support FunCom with my monthy fee.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Joshua Tumbleson<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Anyhow, just felt like ranting and felt like saying that you are lucky that Sony stands up against thievery...<br>

<br>
They (company) do that because they don't want everyone to read the fact that they have third party agreements with overseas clients and other, perhaps, less agreeable clients.<br>
<br>
Most if not all contracts are not the same as most folks don't understand . . . we all assume they are the same WRONG!!!!<br>

Pick up four software discs at a store and read the contract . . . bet at least three will have significent differences in them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dullfiinafv>DullfiinaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/31/03 1:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3952.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: And you think the GM's in EverQuest are bad....</span><hr size=1> You got it wrong Fayrnn.

I was referring to the &quot;spam&quot; send by Funcom themselves.

Only group with people you know and trust.  I learned this long ago.  People sometimes get huffy when I or we wont take them into our groups but you know what....this shit never happens to me.  Sucks...because most of the people who ask are likely pretty cool and would be fun to make friends with but its the occassional jerk that keeps me from inviting people.<br>
<br>
Sorry you got ripped.  That sucks.  I had heard AO sucked... DAoC sucked too... atm I think EQ is the best game out there.<br>

<br>
I think a good customer service base will get you further than a technically sound game.  EQ isn't the prettiest game, isn't the best game, but they take care of their customers for the most part, they don't allow theft, and other things that take from the fun of the game.  Thats why I think EverQuest has lasted as long as it has.<br>
<br>
Then again, thats just my opinion.<br>
