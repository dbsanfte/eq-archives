I like how they do armor in that game, and I think i might be a good suggestion for how it is done in EQ 2.<br>
<br>
Instead of putting a level restriction on the item, the AC of the armor should be reflected in some formula with the AC of the armor and the Characters skill in wearing that type of armor.<br>
<br>
So basically there would be an AC limit based on skill of the player.<br>
<br>
Examples of armor skill categories could be :<br>
<br>
Chain armors<br>
Splint armors<br>
Plate armors<br>
Dragon Scale armors<br>
Supernatural armors<br>
cloth armor/unarmored.<br>
<br>
Such skills would increase much like one's defense skill currently increases.  When you take hits on that type of armor you have some chance to increase in skill.<br>
<br>
The nice thing about Morrowind though is anyone can wear any type of armor.  So you have &quot;battlemages&quot;  Casters wearing plate armor.<br>
<br>
Though the heavier the armor the more str required, and since a caster is likely to put skill points into int, or mana based stats instead of strength, a caster with plate armor should not be so popular, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
I also think there should be more interactive/dynamic quests which do not require grinding as much as solving puzzles, and the result of which may be permanent increases to skill or stats instead of items.<br>
<br>
The dynamic part of it may be specific puzzles which require one to think or used a specific strategy, or require a specific item which may vary from player to player.<br>
<br>
I am not suggesting it would be unique to any one player, but it could vary enough that one going into the quest won't just be able to have some print out of someone elses walk through, because they will likely have the dynamic parts different for them.  Perhaps each dynamic part may have 5 variations, or 10 , though have it some unknown amount so one can not just walk up there knowing for certain they can complete the quest with someone elses walkthrough.<br>
<br>
And restarting the quest woouldnt reset the dynamic parts...there would be a flag on each character (hidden flag of course) so that the game knows what dynamic part you have encountered of that quest.  To prevent someone from trying to restart the quest to do it over a possibly easier way.<br>
<br>
And once such a quest is completed adding a flag to that character which would prevent them from triggering that quest again.  The flag could much be like the keys on the key ring, but instead a notch on ones belt....<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the system of MMORPG can definately be made better.  I am hoping EQ is not the standard but will be just the beginning of the possibilities for future MMORPG's.<br>
<br>
I have hope. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubanegrivm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banegrivm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 4:44:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1619.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Have any of you played Morrowind?</span><hr size=1> Really some very cool thoughts and ideas.

<br>
Let's suppose I want to do a quest (which I frequently do because they are interesting).<br>
<br>
Firstly, I have to find a quest. This means running around hailing random NPCs and then persuing the quest in the hope that it will be suitable for my level and class (which is pretty damned unlikely) or a;ternatively I have to go to a spoiler site to search for a suitable quest... And as soon as you visit a spoiler quest, the quest is spoiled =) [N.B. this may be something that they willl address with PoP looking a the patch messages]<br>
<br>
Secondly, you have to go through the dialogue. So many dialogues are ridiculously difficult to work through. It isn't a fun challenge working out how the designers spelt a particular word. The way to bypass this tedious item is to... you guessed it... go to a spoiler site. [N.B. they've partially fixed this with Luclin, since they have been more careful with the dialogue there]<br>
<br>
Thirdly, so you have to deliver a note to so and so who is somewhere in Freeport. Do you want to spend hours running around that maze trying to find the person? Nope. Spoiler site. [If you've ever done the citizenship quest in Shar Val, that's how finding someone for a quest should work]<br>
<br>
Fourthly, kill mob X. So frequently the monster either trivs, is impossible to find, has to be camped for hours upon hours, needs a raid force etc. etc. At this point you probabnly give up.<br>
<br>
Fifth, you complete the quest, and are rewarded hooray! With a tiny amount of experience and small leather sleeves. Hurroo. =(<br>
<br>
Quests should be shorter, easier (in the sense of not having to figure out dialogue spelling errors or camp a mob for four days) and more rewarding (i.e. actually a decent alternative to grinding . camping dropped items). Plus it would be cool if at certain points, quests branched out so that there were several endings =)<br>

Twinkers leave when they can't twink (AO lost a ton of their subscribers when they yanked twinking -- it's a hurtin' pup these days).  If you want to make money, support twinking.  Starting over with a new character is rarely a completely fresh experience no matter how different the class and race is from your previous characters.  Adding artificial bariers to playing a second or third or fourth character is dumb.  Why would anyone that wants to make money go out of their way to  discourage people from continuing to spend money on their product?<br>
<br>
BTW, twinking (other than the rude twink looters) harms no one.  Dries up spawns?  Not when the zone is done right.  Take a look at Loio.  It has instant-respawn on roamers and can support a HUGE population of ultra-uber-twinks without running out of critters to slay.  What else is there?

Think on this:  what is up with &quot;No-drop&quot; gear?  I mean, take some ultimate uber weapon that is granted by a demi-god through a quest and it enters your hand and &quot;binds to your soul&quot; or some shit.  Ok.  Plausible.  Could make for some interesting dynamics or for cursed items...<br>
<br>
...but beyond something of that sort, how do you make things no drop?  You have problems giving gifts in RL?  If you bought someone a drink in a bar would you have to make them walk up to get it?  I mean, it isn't realistic to make normal, run-of-the-mill stuff no-drop.<br>
<br>
Instead, why not tone down the items?  I mean, why is it steel was soooo obsolete?  In my opinion, EQ finally made tradeskills viable.  Those that worked hard at them could create some awesome items as I think it should be.  Sure, there should be potent magic out there to be won, epics to be earned, artifacts to uncover... but, to make these items so available and necessarry for &quot;End-game&quot; play...<br>
<br>
... and why not make it a bit more random?  I mean, you want the item that has 25FR/CR on it to increase your resists for fighting dragons and whatnot.  You hack your way through a dungeon to the spot it is rumored that creature resides.  You vanquish the foe and :::RANDOM ITEM GENERATOR::: kicks in, you get a Crown of 25FR/CR.  Now, this item has a specific tag on it so that you can only own ONE TYPE of 25FR/CR device (off this particuliar foe), and a crown whould cramp your habit of wearing the Uber Helm of Death Deflection which you keep on your head, even while asleep.  BUT WAIT!!!!  Someone has just intimated to you that they won a Bracer of 25FR/CR off that same beast and they would like the crown...  is that making any sense?<br>
<br>
OR, randomize the whole freaking thing in a way that, you may get an alternate item (of nothing but sale value to vendors), or you might get the 25FR/CR gear, OR you might get an item of lesser resistance score than that.  Make it a unique item so you can only have one... attatch code that does not allow you to get more than one in a period of XX hours RL time...<br>

Yes, because we're a junkfood culture. People don't grasp the whole concept of &quot;earning&quot; stuff for themselves anymore. This is kind of like the &quot;doodspeek&quot; types you see in newbie areas that they aren't native of, begging for platinum/armor/etc, and claiming they're &quot;new&quot;. <br>
Everyone wants instant satisfaction, with the least resistance or challenge.<br>
There's a big difference between the few diehards that don't abuse the twink concept, and people who just want to run to the top - and not enjoy, as it is, the world that VI created.<br>
<br>
I guess it's just like everything else. It starts out fun, then you hand it to the masses, and somehow the pool gets a little thinned. It just takes a few morons to mess it up, and the rules and fun change. Yet, we keep playing.<br>

I mean everything that directly or indirectly requires you to slay something to obtain an item should result in a no-drop item.  I think tradeskills that result in tradable items should all ultimately be fashioned from vendor items or other sources that are inherently non-competitive.  Want to twink?  Go for it, but you can't use dropables.<br>
<br>
What would this odd mechanism accomplish?  Pretty much the only problem with twinks is when someone puts a claim in for an item for their twink versus people that are there for their mains.  Or, people that farm things for their twinks, preventing others from obtaining that gear for their main.  Making things no-drop prevents that kind of behavior.  It doesn't have many other effects.  It is VERY important to support twinking, but I think it's just as important to prevent folks from using a twink as a license for greed.<br>
<br>
IMHO, that isn't the biggest problem in EQ, though.  The single biggest problem in EQ today is competition over in-game resources.  If there are plenty of things to kill, everyone is happy.  If there are bottlenecks for &quot;must have&quot; items, people get in insane fights over it.  This is an issue of zone design and item distribution that drop or no-drop does not impact.  Zones with a respawn rate that scales can support more people of more varied skill levels (eg. Loio).  Zones with static spawn rates get clogged up (eg. Velks).  Zones with nice drops off specific static spawns encourgage camping.  Zones with distributed drops support both dungeon crawling and camping.<br>
<br>
EQ has pretty bad interzone balance.  There are a few really hot xp zones and a few really hot drop zones.  These aren't just a little better than other zones, they're phenominally better.  There are tons of zones that are completely empty.  Why?  Poor risk v. reward.  This is one that VI is well aware of, but they don't often address it.  Why not?  My guess is that whatever process they might have for zone creation and balancing, it's so archaic and onerous that it is very painful for them to balance the zones.  It's so painful that they seem to far prefer adding new zones to balancing existing ones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=veldalina>Veldalina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/24/02 3:05:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1619.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Item decay</span><hr size=1> Personally I don't like the whole item decay thing that's said to be in EQ2.  It was in DAoC, and honestly it was a pain.  When you get equipment, you want to be able to hand it down to guildies and stuff, which doesn't make a lot of sense if it's beat up to 20% decay (with the damage of the weapon or the armor class of the armor being negatively effected by this).<br>
<br>
I don't know what's fun about being the highest level in the game, having the best weapon in the game but having to farm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>another</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one after a few weeks of use because it decayed.<br>
<br>
The way it worked in DAoC was that items would color con like mobs, and if things were equal to your level or lower they'd decay slowly, but if they were above, they'd decay quickly.  So if you gave your level 1 fighter twink the best sword in the game, it not only wouldn't work that well, but it would also decay really fast and would soon be useless.  This did reduce twinking, but to be frank it was just not that much fun; better to just make a situation where characters get a disadvantage by using level-inappropriate items, but not ruining the items themselves.<br>
<br>
The worst part was when you'd level slowly (a few bad nights, taking extra deaths and losing experience - happens to all of us) and find that your level-appropriate equipment was decaying on you.  Generally stuff would decay when you'd get hit for armor or use the weapon to hit with, so melee characters even had it much worse than my cleric and caster characters did.<br>
<br>
Weapons and armor were just generally kind of boring in DAoC due to the level restrictions and such.  Getting equipment was not too exciting.  Whole sets of armor dropped fairly frequently.  They had to, because people had to get new equipment when levelling up and were always aware of what they should be wearing.  For my cleric, there was Duskwalker chain available in the level 18-24 dungeon, then a couple of different forgettable &quot;tiers&quot; of chain in the 30-45 dungeon.  There was not much of an economy, because usually if you hunted normally in the dungeon appropriate for your level, enough would drop for you to be completely outfitted in under a week.<br>
<br>
To discourage camping, items didn't often drop off of special mobs unless it was part of a quest, and when that did occur, the mob would usually spawn every 5 minutes anyway.  And quest items would always drop right into your inventory the first time you killed the mob involved, but they would not drop into the inventory of anyone that didn't specifically have that quest (and you could not repeat quests with the same character).<br>
<br>
Anyway, although the loot situation in EQ is sometimes a bit of a pain, it's at least not bland like DAoC's was.

However, that's the self-twinked.  The &quot;ebay&quot; or &quot;gift&quot; twinks are almost worse than d00ds.  IMHO, they are a problem, but only when you support selling characters.  An idiot level 1 with SODs just survives a bit longer than the common idiot -- it's a self-correcting issue.<br>
<br>
It would be pretty easy to solve the game-play issues related to ebay.  Just have VI broker the transactions and force a name change before the sold char can log on.  Add a command like /charstatus that shows the number of times that character has been sold.  From what I've experienced, pretty much everyone detests the clueless ebays.  They'd be shunned.<br>
<br>
BTW, yes, I know you aren't leaving because of twinks.  That's generally true for most of those that consider themselves twink-haters.  That's my point.  It's why twink-haters need not be considered for game design.  They'll play anyway.  Twinkers are often ready to leave the game and twinking keeps them playing.  So, in order to make more money, support twinking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1619.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1619.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1619.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1619.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1619.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1619.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
