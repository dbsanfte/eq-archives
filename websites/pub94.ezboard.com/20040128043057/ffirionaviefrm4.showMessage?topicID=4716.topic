<br>
Completing this spell requires an enchanter or necro in their high 40s or early 50s at least, in addition to some stealthy moves.  It could theoretically be done by a level 39 wizard, but most wait until their 50s, IF they do it at all.<br>
<br>
Why 39?  Well I think the reasoning behind it was to make it less likely to fizzle.  Couple that with that Mastery of the Past AAs and you have a spell that, while it might be resisted, will never fizzle. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/thewok/jarasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Some people extend this principle so far to claim that the same caster should be able to acquire it easily, and some will even go so far (though generally they learn before the end) as to say that they should be able to acquire it solo.<br>
<br>
Casters rely primarily on spells, though equipment plays a larger role in the end game, admittedly.  But compared to melee classes they are massively free of the need for advanced equipment.  So consider casters acquiring their spells in a similar sense to melees acquiring equipment.  What kind of melee wants around with the attitude that they are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>entitled</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to whatever they can use?  Even the stuff with level limits on it?  Ever hear of a ranger who hit level 55 and demanded to know why he couldn't get a primal velium bow, and isn't it unreasonable that EQ isn't designed to make it easy for him to get one, since he can now equip it?  Well, if any ranger ever did say that, he'd be laughed at by his best friends.<br>
<br>
Seriously, I don't mean to slam the original poster, but I think there is a fault in perception here.  Just because you can use a spell at a certain level doesn't mean the game is designed to give it to you.  There are any number of reasons why a spell might be usable at a level where you can't realistically acquire it under normal circumstances, just as much equipment is usable at levels where you can't realistically acquire it.  Now, if you were so handicapped by what you can't get right now that it made advancing near impossible I'd sympathize, but we all know that isn't true.  So put on a few more levels and then get that spell.  There's nothing unfair about the system, that's just the way it works.<br>

<br>
Since these spells are only usable in LDoN what does it matter if you cannot buy them before you can go on adventures? You will not get the chance to use them until you do either. <br>
<br>
I was not aware that you would be able to get into a dungeon at that level but as a level 14 you could well receive only 1 point or even less. Earning the number needed to buy these spells would be a major task. And for relatively minor reward.<br>
<br>
Instead of obsessing over having ALL the spells for every level why not do some research on them and see if they are actually any use to you first?<br>

To add insult to injury, the cleric, instead of healing me -at all- admonished me to not tank and let me die because she wasn't watching my health.  ONE mob who would not drop agro (unless our wizard had rooted it and not said anything) and I had been Immolating and Snaring the rest of the time without problem and without need to Jolt even though I had it mem'ed because of a warrior tank *laugh*.  Previous to that (and after) the only times my health dropped were from damage shields or her taking health from the party to heal.  There are other reasons, though, than this why I will remember her to not group with her again, thankfully she has an uncommon name.<br>
<br>
But back to the topic.... it's nice to have a &quot;complete&quot; spell book, but there are times that's not possible.  Drop spells, as Val was saying, researched spells, etc.  Working for spells, I agree with Val, are like working to get weapons.  At 60, I don't have my LDoN spells for earlier levels and don't expect them to be handed to me.  My beastlord at 52 doesn't have hers either.  Nor does my wizard at 54, then again, she hasn't stepped foot in a dungeon.<br>
<br>
But... I have seen the LDoN spells for rangers and beastlords misreported in level.  I found correct data on a different site.<br>
<br>
Oh... and where's my Primal Bow, I'm 60 now *smirk* <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=4716.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=4716.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4716.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=4716.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4716.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4716.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
