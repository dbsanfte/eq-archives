Steelweave, Fetid Heraldic, and other such incredible armor?<br>
Someone said on Allakhazam that a Radiant Heraldic BP<br>
would go for 50K. Sounds reasonable enough, it's a fine BP. <br>
<br>
Um, I don't even have 1/10th of a K yet. <br>

<br>
Next, you'll have to know that regular xp hunting is not the way to earn money. That's why a lot of people spend the early part of their life broke, because xp mobs and money mobs aren't usually the same thing.<br>
<br>
After that, you'll need patience. Because you're going to be spending your time killing the same mobs over and over again. The reason you'll be doing this is because in order to make money, you need to have something of value to someone else. Whether it be farming HQ bear pelts, or camping Stormfeather for that damn map piece. Or camping whatshisface in Warsliks for his earring, etc.<br>
After you do that, you'll need even MORE patience because now you'll have to sell said item.<br>
<br>
Another route is being a purely bazaar trader. This is, IMO, probably the most boring thing a person could do. What bazaar traders do is recognize trends in buying, then they buy the highly sought items at a low price and sell them back for a profit.<br>
For example, I looted 5 coldain heads, and since I wanted to off them quick I went /trader and had them up at 30pp. 5 minutes later they were sold. 5 minutes after that the person that bought them put one of them up for 70pp. I looted 3 another time, put them up for 50pp each. Sold them. Said person could have gone and sold them for a profit. There will always be someone out there with ZERO bazaar patience, such as me, who just wants to off items and sells them cheap.<br>
<br>
Another example. I saw a Reaver on sale in the bazaar for 3k. A guildmate loaned me the money and bought it for me. Reavers are going at about 7-8k typically. So technically I could go and sell this Reaver for about 8k, pay my guildmate back 3k, and have a 5k profit in just one item.<br>
I won't though because I think that's an incredibly lame thing to do with a gift from someone, and the Reaver really rocks.<br>
<br>
Some monsters drop good amounts of plat, or gems that sell for a good amount of plat to NPC merchants. This isn't the most efficient way to make money though. So rarely are people who are filthy rich that way from purely looting plat/gems. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3676<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/10/03 7:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4877.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kiloplats!</span><hr size=1> When I was last online, which was about 4 months ago, Heraldic BPs were selling for 15 to 20 thousand plat, not 50.<br>

Don't trust the prices at Allakhazam's or elsewhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also, the BP will be cheaper if you can collect all the components yourself and give them to the smith -vs- expecting to buy the finished product off of them.<br>
<br>
Providing the materials myself, I ended up with a full suit of Fierce Heraldic and it only ran me about 10K above the price of the component parts (most of which I bought in the bazaar).<br>

(Syll could solo stuff that was about 6 or 7 levels above her pretty easily so long as there was a lot of running room, and it didn't summon or cast).<br>

SK can solo decently via fear kiting, but I'm not sure how good they are at just cranking out ridiculous amounts of plat.  I was able to farm about 40K or so in a day when I was in the mood (to farm) when I was in my 50's.<br>

It is THE fastest killing method in the game.<br>
<br>
You gather a &quot;Swarm&quot; of social, non-casting/summoning mobs, using proximity aggro only.  You charm one, /pet attack, and watch your pet get whomped on.  Just before the pet dies, you break charm, and finish it yourself for full xp/cash.<br>
<br>
The technique is tricky to master; many things can go wrong.  And when they DO go wrong ==&gt; dead bard.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub142.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm57.showMessage?topicID=448.topic">The Swarm Kiting Sticky</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> at the EQdiva message boards has lots of linkies to swarming guides and discussions.<br>
<br>
Specters in Oasis are an excellent place to learn, and decent plat.  You have to wait for them to respawn, however.  The Giant Fort in Burning Woods is an excellent swarm for high 40s.  They drop very nice vendor loots and so-so coin.  It is heavily camped however, by greedy Bards like me.<br>
<br>
For you Bards out there, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub142.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm57.showMessage?topicID=462.topic">my guide to charm kiting the Geos in Crystal Caverns</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> can get you some nice gem drops.<br>
<br>
A bit of warning as well:<br>

If anyone reads this and thinks, &quot;I'm gonna make me a Bard and Swarm Kite!&quot;, please don't.  Unless you are going to learn the class properly, in ALL its multiple roles etc. you will suck, and bring shame upon us all.  Another note about swarming:  IF YOU MESS UP YOUR SWARM, STAND AND DIE!

I'm gonna come of sounding cnyincal here, but I suspect there are more players out there (even some that condem this practice) that buy there plat off sites. <br>
<br>
But most of the rich people I know made thier money buying low and selling high. There are ways of making money. When I collect hopper hides for tailoring, I get lots of HQ ones. I sit in PoK with my sewing kit auctioning handmade backpacks. Many many people buy several. I seel cheap too. I can make about 500p in a half hour. It's good because you can't put a backpack in a trader satchle and sell them in the bazaar. <br>
<br>
When I was a wee wiznerd, I spent days and days collecting spiderling and spider silks. For me the best places were east commonlands and N Ro. At one point I had a stack of silk cords (that's 600 spiderling silks). I heard someone on the market channel offering 150 plat for a stack. I sold them. Saddly, the market channel isn't what it once was. But trade skill items sell well in the bazaar. So long as you don't think you should get a 5 plat for a spider silk, you can make money that way. If you can hunt Crag spiders in EK, you can get alot of silks that way.<br>
<br>
Think of it in terms of supply and demand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3683<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/11/03 1:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4877.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kiloplats!</span><hr size=1> re: 40K plat in a day...<br>
<br>
I'd solo velium hounds in Western Wastes, and swarm kite the geonids in Wakening Lands.<br>
<br>
Those two monsters drop the primary dropped components for Imbued Royal Velium Armor, which is used in the 8th shawl quest or just as good armor.  The other parts (velium blocks / bricks, coldain temper, etc) I would just buy in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
I didn't have much trouble selling the sets for around 25K-30K.  I'd pay out a few thousand plat to the tailors, smiths, &amp; jewellers who did the combines for me.<br>
<br>
The geonids were less of a hold up than the hounds, because they could be stingy with the furs.  After a patch was the best time, with so many hounds running around it wasn't difficult to find furs for 2 sets of armor if I hung out there for a few hours.<br>
<br>
Geonids were never camped (and there's enough there to support a few full groups anyways).  Hounds were hunted by a few tailoring druids but could usually be found if you knew where to look.  You could also get them to spawn by killing mastadons &amp; brontheriums which were on the same table.  Tracking was definately a necessity though.<br>
<br>
- Syll<br>
<br>
PS: If playing a bard, get the DoT songs from PoP.  The hounds can't resist poison or disease for crap, and have low fire resistance.  That's enough to DoT the hell out of them assuming you can't find anything to charm kite them against.<br>
<br>
PPS: There are some other camps around which may not be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>as</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> profitable, but are still quite good.  Soloing the young shardwurms in Great Divide will net you a lot of biles.  Charm that named frost giant that wanders around, and get him to dual wield by giving him some weapons.

That's kinda ridiculous though, so usually what I would do is buy that Coldain teleport potion in the bazaar that takes you back to Coldain town.  I'd get a translocate to Cobalt Scar, then jet through Siren's grotto (there's a stupid logout / login bug there that works like lesser evac... not that I would ever use such a thing).  I'd pop out into Western wastes, kill whatever hounds were up, then drink my potion and pop back home.  I'd net a few furs each night.  When I had a stack of 20, I'd go slam the geonids for a few hours and get all the necessary gems.<br>

Also, while it's amusing to charm the two baby dragons out there, same thing applies <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's worth the trip.  WW is boring, lonely, it takes forever to get there, it's impossible to get a rez in, the exp is horrible (in post-pop eq)... But you can make a fortune on those velium hounds.<br>

<br>
PLEASE be considerate of others that are also in tzone and are attempting to earn some money as well and cannot do the same skill as you. It is GOD DAMME frustrating having you greedy bastards take the whole fucking zone away for yerself and leave us empty handed and sittin there doing nothing while ye run around with a huge amount o mobs chasin ye aroun.<br>
<br>
It is also very rude - VERY VERY RUDE. This game was intended for companionship an sharing mates not for takin from each other and walkin away laughin at the other person. <br>
<br>
Tha may be one reason why bards tend to have not so hot a reputation and are not so liked sometimes. *shrugs* - I know I find many bards to be damme arrogant an rude. And this is sure one reason why.<br>
<br>
Ah won't do it . . . but Ah sure feel like rootin a mob in one o those kitin frenzies when tha bard isn't payin attention . . . next rotation thru tha mob would eat him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3717<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/13/03 1:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4877.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: Swarm Kiting</span><hr size=1> In all my time in Western wastes, I've only twice encountered someone who wasn't a druid, ranger, or bard, and wasn't on their way to Necropolis or hunting dragons with a raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Once was a cleric (who I grouped up with), and once was a shaman (who I helped pull mammoths for since she couldn't track).<br>

I agree that mob-hogs are quite rude.  It is even more sickening when they are hogging green mobs for the plat, like people do in Rathe Mountains.  Rooting caster classes are also notorious for this, btw...<br>
<br>
Notice also in my original post, my admonition to bards to STAND AND DIE if they mess up.  The other thing incompetent swarming bards are notorious for is Training.<br>
<br>

This, however, would be a very BAD idea.  Because swarm kiting involves very light, proximity-only aggro to gather the swarm, (otherwise they won't aggro the pet), any form of &quot;Help&quot; from another will result in aggro transferring to YOU.  (Yes, I have seen druids try to &quot;help&quot; a swarming bard by snaring or healing, only to be rewarded with death!)<br>
