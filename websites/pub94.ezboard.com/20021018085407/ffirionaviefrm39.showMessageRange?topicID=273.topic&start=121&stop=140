From his favored perch at the top of a Steamfont windmill, his keen eyesight could make out the entrance to Ak'Anon... little no furs and clockworks going about their business, completely oblivious to the approaching cloud of terror that would soon fall upon them. The tiger had grown strong since the day he recieved his clockwork arm and he considered many little no furs to be his friends. But these very friends had caused much grief to little Charizma... sister of his best friend Sabbik and wife of his Lord Apep.<br>

Would they understand why he must do what he was about to do? <br>

<br>
The event started well enough.  The battlelines were formed, people dueled constantly pretty much.  A lot of shouting and somesuch, enjoyable stuff.<br>
<br>
When the event moved inside Ak'Anon, the dueling continued in the front entrance.  Again a whole lot of fun.  Lots of IC shouting and so on.  Then came the first gate, and that's where it began to get just a teensy bit ballsed up.<br>
<br>
For some god forsaken reason that I have yet to figure out, a lot of people decided it would be an absolutely SMASHING idea to block the entrance..  Couple of small problems with this:<br>
<br>
1.  PNP contradiction<br>
2.  Inconvienience<br>
3.  People got stuck/went AFK<br>
<br>
It took about thirty minutes to get everyone convinced that blocking the doorway was not infact the way to go.  People still dueled and somesuch, but the raid charged onto King Ak'Anon.... who kicked everyone's asses (he wiped out the ENTIRE raiding party ).<br>
<br>
There was an unfortunate set of possibly deliberate training incidents which occured as we tried to get the attackers rezzed.  After this, the raid itself ground to a halt, and a lot of defenders thought &quot;Oh screw this, I've had enough&quot; and left.  Gore was the real star of the show at this point.  Apep, unimaginable in his frustration had long since stepped back from the scene of battle (understandably, in order to realize the level of the screwups that were occuring, you had to be there, and I imagine it PO'ed him something fierce, which is a real shame, because the event looked very good), so Gore took it upon himself to kill everyone and everything that attacked him.<br>
<br>
Including me.<br>
<br>
Gore must have defeated half, if not all the defenders in a duel.  The man is great, he deserves kudos alone for kicking some IC back into an event which had been quite a large screwup from the administrative point of view, given the complete lack of GM help in the matter.  Numerous other duels raged on at the same time.<br>
<br>
A few guides showed up in an OOC capacity, Thrads and Ellishae.  Just stood by as the raid kicked itself up the ass, and with few defenders honestly bothered about fighting any longer, given what had been happening, they rampaged to King Ak'Anon.  I cannot tell you exactly what happened, for I myself had just about had enough and left.<br>
<br>
Two lessons to be learnt here IMO.<br>
<br>
1.  Defending something without PvP doesn't work.  It just doesn't.  It's not fair on the raiders and it's not fair on the people in the city.<br>
2.  GMs should be allowed to get more involved in events.  Had the PvP switch been put on, the event would have run a great deal smoother, and would have been a lot more fun.<br>
<br>
Kudos to:<br>
<br>
Apep, for having the balls to run such a gutsy event.<br>
All the high ends who dueled with respect for the strength of those they faced.<br>
Everyone who dueled, for making some positive points to the event.<br>
The people who shouted constantly in IC, gave it some real atmosphere.<br>
The people who had patience while the event was in it's &quot;complete screwup&quot; stage.<br>
<br>
Also, finally, special thanks for Apep for keeping his temper a HELL of a lot better than I would have done in the same situation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uapepsadisticdream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Apep Sadisticdream</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>~Making your dreams<br> my personal playground~<br>  Sadistic Mage Admin</span><br>  Posts: 858<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 10:16:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=273.topic&index=127>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The thousand words that follow the picture</span><hr size=1> King Died Twice <p> <img src="http://www.e2-online.net/eqsigs/sigs_apep.jpg"><b><center>"The world left in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream, no one left to see you bleed" "Come and be with me and live my twisted dream" </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kuladen>Kuladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/02 10:17:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=273.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The thousand words that follow the picture</span><hr size=1> I agree completely with bakagnome. I unfortunately didn't get to rp hardly any as I was trying to pull people out of the blocked entrance (I have reports of people trying to get out and literally being wedged so tightly in it was impossible) and other general 'calming downs' and putting out fires.I was doing most of the ooc shouting to get people to move.. sorry I wasn't in character but some things are just too important.<br>
<br>
I don't know how many other people (besides apep I guess getting the guides there to remove the blockage) talked to the GMs, but I came away with a very sour taste in my mouth. The gave a weak excuse about not knowing how to do the pvp switch thing, and then stating that they weren't allowed to get involved in a player created event. <br>
<br>
I know all of us don't spend $50 a month to play the game like people on stormhammer do, but I was very disappointed.  For two weeks I have been pleading with the gms for any concessions. I wanted to have all NPCs removed from teh zone as a joke (imagine a raiding party showing up into an empty zone) and they wouldn't do it. I wanted the whole zone turned into Pvp.. same result. Tinker's pride even petitioned for use of that steamwork dragon thing we know they can use, but to no avail. The gms wouldn't even move the King. <br>
<br>
Luckily for the defenders, the king was more than able to take care of himself... which I think surprised the defenders more than the attackers.<br>
<br>
With that out of the way.. I want to say 'I'm sorry' to the attackers. I am.. to agree with Xianya (we talked after she was filled in).. appalled at the actions taken. Gore was deliberatly trained. I witnessed this first hand. I don't have confirmation, but apparently some of Ebon storm were as well as they were ressurecting. <br>
<br>
It boggles my mind that someone would do this. I guess I'm too nice a guy in real life, but to ruin someone's fun like that.. do you know how much experience Apep lost? At level 54 losing 3 yellows is probably what.. a month of work (by how I play). Gone in like 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
The sacrifices Apep went through to bring us this event.. and this is how we repay him.<br>
<br>
He told me that he and his guild would never again be involved in player run plots, and wouldn't run any more. <br>
<br>
Its a crying shame, and I'm very disappointed. <br>

With at least the three of us dead, possibly others, the main force still tried to kill the king and made a valiant effort in getting him down to 20% before dying.<br>
<br>
After resurrecting from the griefers, we went back in and killed the king twice and the priest of discord without further incident.   All told this would have been a great event if it hadn't been for the OOC griefers that showed up.   Kudos to everyone on both sides that roleplayed through the entire event, especially the gnomes that showed up after the king died to RP being slaves that we could haul off *laugh*  Personally, I look forward to more events such as this, but not if the griefers show up. (Guild RP events will probably no longer be openly posted, to prevent this exact sort of thing). <p><br>Azhrei Hiever d'Phlith, 56th Enforcer of Innoruuk's Word

I would also like to thank all the mature Role-playing people that were there. It is a shame that a good idea and a good server would have turn out to be like this. We wanted everyone to see into our world and enjoy a different aspect of the game, but it seems there are way too many people that are still not mature enough to handle it. It is a sad day for me as well as what this server was suppose to be. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.sphosting.com/niya/niya_name_3.jpg">

That last challenger would be me. I'm afraid I didn't even realize what had happened as it happened (it never even occured to me that training was happening--chalk that up to being naive) until someone explained it to me. I'm sorry our battle was tainted and that someone stole the pleasure of your defeat from me.<br>
<br>
I would be honored to face you under different conditions.<br>

<br>
Not sure if this is the proper place to be commenting on the aftermath of the raid or not, but here I am.<br>
<br>
I had seen the posts and such about not blocking the entranceway, and I myself avoided the bottleneck.<br>
<br>
I saw my share of noble things, and my share of base and vile things. There was a lot of talk about attackers that would not accept duels. I know for a fact one of them would not accept my duel challenge, preferring instead to beat up the clockworks.<br>
<br>
I did however see many that accepted challenges. I was in fact done in by one that accepted my challenge, after which I stayed out of matters from a roleplaying standpoint; I didn't think it was &quot;right&quot; for me to get geared up all over again and race into more battle.<br>
<br>
I admit that I rejoiced when Gore fell, though I only heard about it and did not see it. Now I find that he was trained to death...that diminishes my rejoicing drastically. I saw him snipe guards in Felwithe the night before, and fell in battle with him twice, so my character is building up a great hatred. However, from what I saw in the raid today Gore was staying IC. Asdyr may hate the iksar filth, but real RPing should be commended lol.<br>
<br>
It's a shame that so many people are bitter about the whole thing, as it was one of the high points of community spirit that I've seen on the server. Great in theory and in backstory/continuing RP, but hindered by a host of game mechanic problems and some unscrupulous types.<br>

Defenders, besides the door.  I thought you did a good job of challenging.<br>
I loved this event, the completely unorganized rampage on the first attack of the king was just nuts.  I didn't know where he was I just ran around witht he group.  Hehe, you defenders didn't even need to block us when we got to the king.  I couldn't stand up in those rooms at all.  Loved the event.  Everyone should drink tea tonight. =)<br>

I had a great time watching all the duels and being involved in a few as well.  I must say my favorite was Niya, I think I might have broken her fingernail before falling dead at her feet...thanks Niya that was fun.  I tried to duel Apep, but so was everyone else and I was not able to get in there.  I think I would have at least given him a hangnail or broke a pinky toe or something to that effect, maybe next time though. <br>
<br>
I was saddend to see our King fall, but our nobel tinkers were on the job repairing him as soon as he fell and I am happy to say he is feeling much better now.  <br>
<br>
OOC: Good job to everyone that role played the event.<br>
