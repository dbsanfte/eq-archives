<br>
The latest change to slow allowing it to be dispelled by a desease cure seems to be rather silly to me.<br>
<br>
Article at :: <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4207">eq.castersrealm.com/viewa...ticle=4207</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If you have someone in your team who can cure desease the chances are you have a team of at least one person with you. Hell stomach the damn slow or loose some buffs but fight on.<br>
<br>
I used to like the fact that slows messed you up, made encounters with shaman mobs at least a tiny bit challenging (not offense to play shaman who own but the logic behind NPC shaman is dumb, hell most NPC shaman do not even have a pet!). Now as the slow is so debilitating they want to remove it arg arg arg. <br>
<br>
Whats next remove the ability for mobs to hit because it means you need a healer. <br>
<br>
I tend to wince as classes get stronger not because of any class envy as I have so many different characters any change can only help them but becasue it makes the game less challenging for the general grinde. Now with changes like the slow pffft :-)<br>
<br>
I wonder when they will down grade chromodacs so they do not cancel magic, personaly I hate fighting them because of this behavoir but I would never vote to have it removed.<br>
<br>
On a slightly different direction, I remember when eq was launched where it mattered which race you were in where you could go. Kunark continued this trend with over there and firiona vie and cabalis. Then along comes Velious and Luclin where ogres and hi elves can hold hand while they bank . . .<br>
<br>
It could be said that I could just ignore the new powers, pretend I cannot cancel slow with desease cure but I am too weak to do that :-) if the game has it I will use it. I just wish it was as tough as in the day :-)<br>
<br>
Still love it, just my fears <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In one respect, I see some of the changes removing aspects of the game that were challenging (ie. annoying) for no real reason other than that is just the way it was.  On more than one occasion, the lead guys at EQ would explain away something difficult, or even a bug in the game, as just part of the game.  Deal with it.  With the new leadership, these things are being removed.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is a fine line.  It's nice to remove things that don't take away from the game and just add heartache (hell levels for example), but you need to be careful that you don't equate something people dislike as something that has no value.  You can't just go around getting rid of everything that upsets people.  Some of these things actually serve a purpose and add to the game.<br>
<br>
As for your actual slow comment.... I think it is a good change.  I don't think the point of slow is to make it so that you have to have all your buffs removed in order to cancel slow.  I think the point of slow is to slow you down.  This is one of those things that would have been said &quot;that is the way it is supposed to be&quot; a few months ago, just because that is the way it ended up when they first made it.  It makes perfect sense to me to move slow over to a situation where it is able to be dispelled without removing every other buff on you.  It is just allowing the spell casters to actually do their job instead of having to ignore it due to the consequences.<br>

<br>
Allowing me to right click Jboots from inside a backpack would be dumbing down the game.  It's taking something that can already be done with relative ease and really doesn't affect too much.<br>
<br>
Making something like slow disease based so that it can actually be dispelled in a proper manner is &quot;fixing a bug&quot; in my opinion.  After I just spend 5 minutes buffing you into a ravenous killing machine, why should I then need to dispel every single one of those buffs to dispel some shaman dot spell just because it happened to land on your body after all my buffs.<br>
<br>
It was a good move by Verant.  Personally I think they have about 5 million other things they should be fixing first.. but hey, that's VI for ya.<br>

If you looked at it as a bug then it is a good fix.<br>
<br>
It would have been nice if they had changed cancel magic to strip hostile buffs from a person you are not trying to kill before stiping non hostile buffs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Always thought that was strange <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I guess though the dumbing feeling came from the fact that the only thing a NPC shaman ever managed to do well was to slow the tanks, that is now removed making the NPC shaman an easy target now.<br>
<br>
I have just seen a continual trend to make the game easier in general though they have continually made dragon and raid encounters harder so maybe its balanced <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Changing it into disease based was sort of a kludge I imagine.<br>

No, making a slow spell be cancelled by a cure disease spell will not lead to clicking off DoTs or MoBs that can't hit you.

How is it a Nerf when it is beneficial?  I'm don't quite get your beef with it.  You would have been happier if they went all the way and made it save vs Disease so that while it could be cured, you would probably have no chance of resisting it, assuming you don't have a whole lot of DR in your normal gear.<br>

<br>
Dumbing Down EQ would be if they said:<br>
<br>
&quot;After the next Patch we have decided to consolidate some structure in EQ, from this point forward there will only be three Classes - Tank, Caster, Healer.<br>
<br>
Existing characters have been retroactively altered to fit the new system.  Alternate Advancement is now available from level 20 on, and will allow you to 'specialize' your characters to gain abilities similar to those in the old Class structure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or maybe:<br>
<br>
&quot;In order to facilitate Player concerns we have made a change to the /CON system.  When you con a monster the following information will be displayed in addition to the usual flavor text and Color:<br>
<br>
1) Level of Mob<br>
2) What the Mob's actual Resist values are<br>
3) How much faction you will gain for killing this mob<br>
4) How much faction you will lose for killing this mob<br>
5) What loot the mob is carrying<br>
<br>
Also, we know that some of you may have difficulty sorting through all that text, so we have added a new feature called /copilot.<br>
<br>

&quot;Getting slowed by an NPC is incredibly debilitating to players, and up until now you either had to just be sad until the spell wore off or risk dispelling all of your positive buffs while trying to remove the slow.  This change should add value to classes that can cure disease and make the spell line more useful.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was there comment, they changed it because it was incredibly debilitating to players. . . seems a perfect example of making it easier.<br>
<br>
For general grinding the game is already massively in the favor of groups of players it just seems a shame to have one of the few things that I am scared of landing being basicaly easily canceled by my druid sister.<br>
<br>
Along the same path of &quot;dumbing down&quot; would be the ability to cure necro fear or mez with cure desease, maybe root as well, perhaps charm . . . I just wonder if they will decide other spells are just to powerful to not have them easily counterable.<br>
<br>
Oh well, perhaps I am the only person who wants the game to be harder than it is for normal fights and not just raids.<br>
<br>
A question, if VI proposed to add the following 2 items to the game in the bazzar for a cheap price would you vote for or against having them in the game:<br>
1) Rod of mana. Rigth click complete re fill of mana every 4 minutes<br>
2) Rod of health. Right click complete heal every 4 minutes<br>
<br>
Just curious<br>

<br>
Ah, well, I can see where you would go with that, but I don't generally like the term 'dumbing down' because to me it means you are making something so simple that a moron could now succeed and there is zero challenge.<br>
<br>
A relatively minor change like this is not going to suddenly make bad players able to succeed.  It is a tweak.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  This was there comment, they changed it because it was incredibly debilitating to players. . . seems a perfect example of making it easier.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I see it more as a balance issue.  Ever since Velious they have been adding in creatures that now can have hundreds of thousands of HP.  Maybe millions.  Melee power has scaled up drastically while caster power stays fairly constant.  Melee has become the primary component for killing some big mobs.  More big mobs AE slow nowadays.  Giving players a reasonable way to deal with slow may make it easier, in one way, but if they are dealing with a lot more mobs that slow it balances it in another.<br>
<br>
I mean, every time they add new and better gear and spells to the game, it doesn't 'dumb it down,' which is my way of thinking.  You are correct, but I think it is only making it easier for a small portion of the players, on a limited set of encounters.  EQ as a whole retains the same difficulty level after this adjustment.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  For general grinding the game is already massively in the favor of groups of players it just seems a shame to have one of the few things that I am scared of landing being basicaly easily canceled by my druid sister.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
True, but at the cost of a 1) a spell slot to keep Cure Disease up and 2) Time and Mana curing disease when she could be healing, DoTing, or Nuking.  What if it takes 3 casts of Cure Disease to finally break the Slow?  Yes, the slow is gone, but not for free.  Druid lost time and mana.  Your slow could always have been dispelled, now it just means that you won't lose your Skin and other buffs with it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  Along the same path of &quot;dumbing down&quot; would be the ability to cure necro fear or mez with cure desease, maybe root as well, perhaps charm . . . I just wonder if they will decide other spells are just to powerful to not have them easily counterable.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Maybe, but I don't think these things will happen.  There was a rationale for the slow change.  You can try to dispel Charm with Nullify Magic already, I don't think they will change that for the same reasons as they had for Slow.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  Oh well, perhaps I am the only person who wants the game to be harder than it is for normal fights and not just raids.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You can fight harder mobs you know :-)<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  1) Rod of mana. Rigth click complete re fill of mana every 4 minutes<br>
2) Rod of health. Right click complete heal every 4 minutes  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No I would not, but you can't possibly compare this to changing Slow from canceled by Cancel Magic to Cure Disease.<br>
<br>
You can level from 1 - 60 and never fight a Mob that slows.  In fact you probably WILL level from 1 - 60 and what, 5% of the mobs you fight, if that, will Slow?<br>
<br>
It seems to me that this change is really probably to balance som high end Raid type mobs with AE slow, and is not really intended to make it easier to fight a Froglok Shaman or something.<br>
<br>
I agree it makes it a little easier in certain situations, I just don't think its an unbalancing change.<br>

One spell cancels another. It still takes time and mana, plus having someone who actually has cure disease there with you.<br>

I still don't see the argument of how the game is easier because of this. I also don't feel the scales are tipped in our favor all that much.

Yes, my views on eq are squewed as I at least have a chanter monk druid team to play with. The solo game is very different and yes in past lives I have soloed :-)<br>

Seems to be the general thought is that this does not make the game much easier :-) no worries, point was not to win, point was to discuss :-)<br>

Re: Why not make Charm, Mez, Fear easier to remove too?<br>
<br>
This isn't really the same thing. <br>
<br>
These spells are so debilitating that you wouldn't think twice about dispelling any affected player, regardless of the cost (losing other buffs). After all, what effect, other than instant death, can be worse than removing someone from the fight entirely, turning them against you and/or possibly bringing a nice train back to your group (Fear)? <br>
<br>
Slow is bad but it doesn't stop you fighting entirely and can be ignored by non-melee types anyway. Charm, Mez or Fear cannot be ignored, although with Fear the player might be halfway across the zone before you realise you need to dispel anyway and Mez tends to sort itself out (you get hit).<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with the change to be honest. Look at it this way:<br>
<br>
If being Slowed was a major problem or &quot;challenge&quot; before (e.g. if you are a melee and the sole damage dealer in the group) then you would probably have been willing to lose all your buffs in order to get rid of it. It will most likely still take the same amount of time to get rid of that Slow now as it did via Dispel (it often takes several tries to successfully Cure).<br>
<br>
If being Slowed was NOT a major problem for you before (e.g. you are not a melee or there are other damage dealers in the group to cover you) then you probably won't be getting it removed by your healer now either (not worth their mana).<br>
<br>
It also forces someone to use up a valuable spell slot for a disease cure if they wish to take advantage of the new change which many won't be willing to do, even now.<br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
As a finger wiggler I suppose I have no vested interest either way in this but I don't really think it dumbs anything down.<br>
<br>
&gt;1) Rod of mana. Rigth click complete re fill of mana every 4 minutes<br>
&gt;2) Rod of health. Right click complete heal every 4 minutes<br>
<br>
Hmm...this is a little silly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
These examples are too extreme relative to the change we are discussing to be of any help. Obviously no one would vote for these things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
