<br>
Ok, this is gonna be a long post.  So here goes ----<br>
<br>
I have been reading R.A. Salvatore's <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Dark Elf Trilogy</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, and I have been thinking of how some things could be put to use in EQ.  I think we already agree that there are no Drow Elves in EQ.  But then again, they seem to be modeled after the Drow in a lot of ways.  And even if they're not Drow, they are still Dark Elves, and something can be done.<br>
<br>
That being said, I'm wondering if we might be able to get a real roleplay environment started.  I have heard for a couple of years how FV used to be.  I am only sorry that I never got to see it in it's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>heyay</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  <br>
<br>
I think this would be good for the RP guilds and good for the guilds/players who don't really RP a lot and might be interested in becoming a part of it.  This should be voluntary and no one is forced to participate.<br>
<br>
Here are some of my thoughts:<br>
<br>
Dark Elves:<br>
<br>
Keep that hatred going against the goodies. But form a community amongst yourselves in your Underworld City.  Maybe some kind of Hierarchy could be formed.  I know that in the books, there is a 1st house, 2nd house, etc.  Maybe something similar (but fit for EQ) could be formed.<br>
<br>
Basically, the guilds/races from the different cities can form a community (separate from the alliances that are already formed).  We can set a weekend or two when the guild leaders/representatives (or just players who are interested and unguilded) can meet and determine what the course will be.  Then we can work out who the enemies are and who the allies are. After all of that is ironed out, then another meeting can be held with the other races to hash out how each will be played.  Then the game is on!!!<br>
<br>
Even though I missed the last RP event (Walk Around the World and I really wanted to be there!) I still feel that that was a wonderful event.  It was good in that it did bring Neutral/Evil/Good against one another in one form or another. I also like how the Iksar showed such cohesiveness.  This is something that I would have found really attractive at this event.<br>
<br>
Yes, yes, I know.  No one wants it to impede game play.  This is what the RP tag is for.  Certain situations require RP and others do not.  However, every individual has the freedom (as they do now) to determine what is comfortable for them.  I just think that if the races could actually determine what they are about, then the world can grow and be an even more fantastic place than it already is.<br>
<br>
One other thing, I am talking about the base of this roleplay.  How the races feel about others and how they interact with one another in their home cities.  The personal RP is a by-product of the general environment.  That is where the character (much like Drizzt) can determine that they don't like how things are with their community or be more gung-ho about their community.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?  Just trying to get a discussion started.  I am very interested in the thoughts of others.  All suggestions are welcome.  No one has a stupid idea in this thread.<br>
<br>
Is there hope?  Can we bring Roleplay back to FV? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~smclynch/images/DriaSig4.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=driaann>DriaAnn</A> at: 10/9/03 5:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=seuinye>Seuinye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/9/03 6:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/Seudoll.jpg width=79 height=168></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on RP for FV</span><hr size=1> I think what you are suggesting already exists to a certain degree - in the Necropolis.  It would be nice to see more RP events... but that very walk around the world was planned for afew good months, and went through many changes before it became what it was...<br>
<br>
With the RP community diminishing in size... yes, it would be nice if a more formal ooc alliance could be created... to create the foundations for more interactions ic between darks, lights, greys, and Rebelle.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Perhaps this could speed the creation of good RP events, perhaps it would spread the word a bit better than these cluttered boards... ~shrugs~<br>
<br>
A good idea.  Let's hope our leaders in the RP community can take it and work with it. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/anseu.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zildrax>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 751<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/9/03 6:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on RP for FV</span><hr size=1> The evils do have the Necropolis, which is a gathering of evil guilds that do stuff together. Here's the link.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub219.ezboard.com/bnecropolis">pub219.ezboard.com/bnecropolis</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
The Iksar Empire has a sort of sub community of all Iksar who RP loyalty to the Empire. Skathris Ven'Sho is the only guild I know of actually devoted to the Iksar Empire, but many individuals in many different guilds and places RP being loyal to it. The Empire is not loyal to any alignment or group of soft skins, we fight for our own cause, in our own way. <br>
<br>
If it's things like that that you are talking about, only for soft skins and not for Iksar, the Necropolis and Fellowship come the closest, although those are tied more to alignment and guild rather then race. <br>
<br>
In comment to the idea about the guilds working together for RP storylines, it is very nice in theory but it can be very difficult to do. I've seen it tried with mediocre success on my old server, although I will be the first to admit it was VERY cool. If you'd like to involve the Iksar Empire in any of your stories, feel free to contact me, Kelisk or Ifrinn and we can get the word out to everyone else. *smiles*  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zildrax>Zildrax</A> at: 10/9/03 6:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=driaann>DriaAnn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Don't Mess with the Mage!<br>

This is exactly why I'm putting this out here.  I have no idea what others are doing.  Maybe some of these already formed alliances could lead the way.  Hmm.  I'll have to take a look at those sites.<br>
<br>
I am putting this idea out to the FV community to gauge interest and find out what we already do have in the community.  I really would like to see what others think of an idea such as this and allow the community to build on it.  I do think we have a good group of players here.  Seems I may have been a little off the mark in my initial post.<br>
<br>
I think more adventures and just simple RP can help us grow.  But if everyone decides they don't like the idea, then I will drop it.  I do think it's worth a shot.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I'm creating a new board (in case it can't be done in game). I'm hoping to get people together in game, but if that isn't possible, maybe a board might be better.  I'm creating something called the FV Roleplay Zone.  Devoted to Roleplay on the server.  It is still in production.  I'll advertise once it's ready.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=driaann>DriaAnn</A> at: 10/9/03 10:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=desra>desra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/10/03 2:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hostmysig.com/data/kd7apq/lgdeswhitetrans.gif width=112 height=199></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on RP for FV</span><hr size=1> This is something i would be very interested in.

<br>
There actually is a great deal of interest in role-play on this server, it's just that for a lot of people the opportunities do not seem to be there.  I was rather pleased by some of the inquiries I received from fellow players about the event after it had happened, showing interest in perhaps participating in future events.  <br>
<br>
The sad thing is that so many people do not bother to read the FV board here, and in so not doing, missed an event they might have joined.  Perhaps with a really big event, we could have a GM give a server-wide anouncement something to the effect of &quot;To those interested, a ROLE-PLAYING event....etc...<br>
<br>
The Necropolis and The Fellowship are definately the present keys to organizing events right now.  My own interest in this server was at a low until I happened to drop into the Necropolis, the channel and board info given to me by one of the dark as I was inquiring around about possable guilds to join.<br>
------------<br>
<br>
As for the term Drow...I like it still being used, as a slang term for dark elves.  This does not mean of course that if you call yourself a 'Drow' that you have to worship the Spider Queen.  Though it might be noted that there are half spider half dark elven creatures roaming about.  Lore has it that Mayong created these creatures.  One could, I suppose, Consider the 'Teir'Dal a sub race of dark elves, the 'Drow' another sub race of the same.   Like a different house...<br>
---------<br>
<br>
On houses, Well, there is the Ebon Storm, the Twilight Dark, and quite a few others, I would love to see the dark elven guilds get together and perhaps rename themselves and call them 'houses'.  With a communal board for these houses to communicate with each other.  The necropolis could be used temporarily for that, under the open area general posting thread I suppose.  <br>
Will definately watch what you can come up with for the role-playing board too.<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
We are overdue for a war between lights and darks, Neriak and the High and Wood Elves.   <br>
Perhaps the forces of Mistmoore, represented by the Horsemen of Mistmoore?  Could organize an attack on those who threaten their existance with their constant raiding of Mayong's estate?   Of course, the real drawback to attacking in the greater Faydarks is the faction hit you would get there dueling....<br>
Time to complain to the developers about the broken guildwar function again.   <br>
--<br>
<br>
The reason I say this is because I have heard some people, who were newbies at the time, say how cool this war was, inspite of not being able to participate in it.    (This might have been one involving the two leagues, Of Shadow and of Honor), and inspite of the griefers who drew the guards over to the combatants, it seems the majority of low levels at that time actually appriciated the enertainment/change in pace from just going around slaying things to level up.<br>
---<br>
<br>
Anyways, my long-winded two-cent's worth....<br>

I need to clarify something though. This is not necessarily about events but the culture of our different races/guilds/deities.<br>
<br>
I'm seeking a more solid identity for every group.  Community within a community within another community.<br>
<br>
Race/city/continent - good, bad, neutral.<br>
<br>
What does it mean and what do we feel about one another.  We have many notorious players who are well known.  We know for the most part who they are.  But what do we really know about the Wood Elves, the Iksar, the Trolls, etc.? Who are they really?  Sony has already laid out the groundwork.  We need to bring it to life.<br>

<br>
I would love to see more of the culture played out as well.<br>
<br>
The iksar seem to be pretty well done from what I have seen. You have the loyalists and the rest are pretty much outcast and treated as such.<br>
<br>
Dwarvish and gnomish culture goes the same way.<br>
<br>
The other races need a little work though (as a whole, individually this can't be done).<br>
<br>
I would like to see more distinction between the Wood Elves and High Elves. At one time they were one culture. Now they are not, but are played almost as if they are the same race. Both commonly follow Tunare, but I think that is where the similarities stop. Wood Elves are typically more uncivilized and sometimes barbaric in comparison to the High Elves. For example, an enemy is captured. The High Elves would probably opt for life imprisonment. The Wood Elves would probably kill the prisoner (not torture, they are barbaric, not evil, though in some cases they might, they are not evil, but not always good either). Wood elves are also distrustful of strangers and probably indifferent at best to their High Elf cousins (think they are snobby, or strayed from Tunare's true teachings). This is their culture as a whole, not the individual. A wood elf in say, Freeport might be the friendliest person you will ever meet, or the worst (depending on their reason for leaving the forest, those that are different then themselves are outcast in some cases).<br>
<br>
Ogres and Trolls are too commonly dependent on the dark elf or evil human culture. Trolls are not smart, but are smart enough to have some sort of an empire at one time (don't quote me on this one, I know they warred with the ogres at one point). Even before LoY I see alot of trolls in evil guilds that are ran by humans or dark elves. I expect this is mostly from the lack of trolls actaully played though. And wasn't their a troll guild? The same goes for Ogres, I know they were cursed, but I wouldn't mind seeing more and more of the ogre culture be apparent, rather then being mindless warriors used by the smarter races. Not saying anything is wrong with the current system, individually, we want to join X guild that just happens to have a so and so race as leader.<br>
<br>
Barbarians seem to do well with their culture, even when they work with others, they look down on the southrons.<br>
<br>
Frogloks, haven't seen much here. Not even sure what the culture is, never been to Gukta( or grobb oops hehe).<br>
<br>
Humans are numerous and adapt very well to anything. But they do in fact have their own culture. Lots of pontential here. They have so many relegions as well. What I would like to see is more relegious or philosophical debates between the same aligned characters. A Paladin of Mithaniel Marr will not always agree with a Paladin of Karana or even Rodcet Nife (gods maybe allies, but the church probably preached that their god is better then any other). Same with Shadowknights, Bertox SKs will probably not even get along well at all with Inny SKs. Spreading hate is duty, but catching a disease is not, and since they are evil aligned, sometimes they would be hostile to one another. This all applies to Erudites, which would see any other race as beneath them.<br>
<br>
Half elves don't typically have their own culture, they just do whatever they prefer.<br>
<br>
I don't know much about the halfling culture in EQ, in D&amp;D(3rd) they fall under the Half elf category as far as culture goes.<br>
<br>
And I don't know much about Vah Shir. Only been to Shar Vahl like twice.<br>
<br>
These suggestions are by no means telling anyone how they should play their character. But is a nice attempt to show a guildline of the cultures (as I see them and think we need more of, you might see different). Individual characters can and usually do stray from these examples. They are adventurers, not merely citizens. Though many a guild could use these examples to help set a theme within the guild. Or you could use as a background to a SL. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=falinoralastrarran>Falinor Alastrarran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soulfood!</span><br>  Posts: 345<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/11/03 11:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://thealastrarranhome.nstemp.net/SolufeinIcon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on RP for FV</span><hr size=1> I really don't think the RP community has diminished in size...I just think it has become too localized to here and there.

Lets get the cultures going here.<br>
<br>
A question to a guild(since they are a large group of similarly thinking people) would be, &quot;What place does your guild have with such and such town/city/culture.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lets make up a fictional guild.<br>
<br>
Have a good aligned guild created on the beliefs of Tunare. What function do they have in say Kelethin? Are they guardians of the city like the Emerald Warriors? Do they explore the lands to combat their enemies like the Faydark Champions? Are they more freelance and not actaully connected to the city? What do they do as part of the Wood Elf culture? What role do they have? If it is a family oriented guild, then who is related to who and how? Or are they more of a club calling each other family in some why like some in real life clubs the members call each other brothers.<br>
<br>
I know most guilds are racially mixed, but there must be quite a majority of one race or another. For example, most evil aligned guilds have a Teir'dal structure to them (Dark elves are just the most numerous evil race), and use the Dark Elf langauge(while good aligned use elvish, the most numerous good aligned race). So they would probably be of the dark elf culture. This doesn't mean they have to use drow (or heaven forbid a good aligned guild speaking elvish hehe, well if they do... good for ya, thats a tough language to learn, at least for me)<br>
<br>
We spend far too much time focusing on only a part of the cultures, that being just alignment. There are other things too. For example when I played a rogue, I had some warriors look down on me(RPwise, they loved having my DPS in the group OOC) because my way of fighting was different then theirs. I would like to see more of this kind of RP alongside the alignment. I see people use the LFG and in the comments it says &quot;Good only pls&quot;. Sorry thats not really RPing, but lets say a paladin is LFG. A necromancer asks him to join a group and the paladin responds, &quot;You follow the dark arts, I will not aid you.&quot; Now thats a bit better then &quot;No evils pls&quot; Gives more interaction. If your guild restricts what alignments you can group with, they are doing it to entice their members to RP (hopefully, there's a problem if it isn't). Now I am not saying warriors and rogues should not group. But say I am a warrior and that rogue takes agro and has to evade, my warrior is going to chuckle and ridicule the rogue. Then the rogue may smirk and BS the mob doing alot more damage then the warrior. Then again the warrior would probably come up with an excuse and say it was a lucky shot. This is just a personal example, there are other things you can do. Just remember its not all good and evil (lets not forget Law and Chaos). They took out those restrictions to let us use our imaginations, lets do that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=freelancewizard>FreelanceWizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Musician of<br>

Oh, yes, differing philosophies make for excellent RP. One thing that would go a long way in this regard, IMHO, would be coming up with some metaphysical explanations for magic (especially bardic magic, which currently has basically none). Not a lot of lore (practically none that I've seen) discusses the metaphysical underpinnings of magic; beyond that clerical and necromantic magics come from the gods, most of the Art remains in the D&amp;D vein of &quot;do X and cause Y.&quot; Some essays on metaphysics, while not canon and maybe not all in agreement with each other, would give a lot of interesting ideas to some.<br>
<br>
Of course, maybe I'm the only one interested in metaphysics, and maybe I'm the only one that considers them part of the culture of spellcasters. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.realitywerks.com/hosted-images/elludensig.png" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Coming up with metaphysics while good in theory can cause alot of friction RP wise when you encounter someones whos RP story revolves around magic being a certain way which contradicts what you have created. I think in this case it may be best to let it remain mostly vauge. Even though since Zildrax is technically a spirit I have to take some liberties with the spirit realm, I try and keep it general enough it won't contradict others roleplay. <br>
<br>
Of course, if you like the idea, go for it...*smiles* But be wary it can cause friction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=freelancewizard>FreelanceWizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Musician of<br>

<br>
I agree that no one is going to come up with a complete metaphysic of the game world; it's far too vague for that. I think the IC friction of varying views on metaphysics might be a good thing, though. Various spellcasters could contribute their points of view, and people could adopt them or debate them as they see fit. It'd certainly give the magi something to discuss on those long, lonely evenings in Norrath. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On a similar note, I find it likely that a lot of people will disagree with any singular concept of &quot;culture&quot; that's not rooted entirely in the canon. As such, a similar approach of essays -- not all of which have to agree, and most of which probably won't -- and discussions around them would seem the best way to handle things (n.b. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub219.ezboard.com/fnecropolisfrm11.showMessage?topicID=16.topic">pub219.ezboard.com/fnecro...D=16.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub219.ezboard.com/fnecropolisfrm11.showMessage?topicID=20.topic,">pub219.ezboard.com/fnecro...=20.topic,</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and, heck, that whole forum).<br>
<br>
The bigger interesting question, of course, is what's desired. Do people want a unified resource OOCly of the players' opinions, or a collection of IC thoughts? The former will serve to generate that desired &quot;roleplay environment,&quot; but those who disagree will find their RP adversely affected by things that aren't canon. You have the same issue that Zildrax mentioned about metaphysics in this case. The latter won't really unify RP, but on the other hand, it won't exclude people who don't side with the majority.<br>
<br>
One problem I can see already is that some seem to be under the impression there are only four factions -- neutral, evil, good, and Iksar. I see about eight: alignment-based evil, alignment-based good, philosophical evil, philosophical good, self-serving neutral, indifferent neutral, Iksar loyalist, and Iksar exile. None of these really get along with each other, and all of them have their own culture that's laid atop that of their basic race, class, and deity. Trying to come up with a perfect unified OOC structure of cultures and points of view for all of these is likely to cause problems. Going with a more open approach of characters stating their thoughts won't produce unification to any great degree, but it'll certainly provide more freedom.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I agree with a sentiment I hear echoed quite a bit: RP guilds should have some existence ICly and should detail what purpose they serve in the world. That, I think, would help a lot in visualizing the politics between guilds. Also, having a neutral ground where RP guilds can OOCly find out about each other and ICly make deals and such would be nice and would help increase the amount of interguild IC politics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taemien>Taemien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/12/03 9:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on RP for FV</span><hr size=1> Spell casters... yes hehe.<br>
<br>
Going to give some examples here, since examples help people come up with their own stuff.<br>
<br>
Necromancers can get their powers from many places. Some claim divine powers, which may or may not be true. They recieve their magic from divine favors from the evil god they server by spreading evil. Others practice necromancer like any other art of magic, these might be frowned on by the divine users, maybe considered heretics. Others might be cursed with the abilities, forced to use them to keep their well being.<br>
<br>
Other casters might claim divine powers as well. Such as a wizard of Tunare. And why not? I have heard of wizards claiming power from Solesuk Ro many a time.<br>
<br>
But like Elluden said, the guilds should look at themselves and see just what purpose they have. Spreading good or evil I think is a bit too general. Ask yourselves how you spread your beliefs, what your goals are. How do you make a difference in Norrath, Luclin, and the Planes of Power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zildrax>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 760<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/12/03 11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on RP for FV</span><hr size=1> Well, it's a difficult question, and one I might give a bigger reply too when I'm not trying to pull an all nighter and sorta out of it. *chuckles* <br>
<br>
However the thing about the guilds is very intresting.  Skathris Ven'Sho is very much tied to Iksar Culture. Here's a brief description of our place in it.<br>
<br>
The Skathris Ven'Sho are a small group of Iksar dedicated to upholding the ideals and beliefs of the Empire. They are officially sanctioned and recognized although they have no real authority beyond that their caste ranks give them, but they do have influence. They act as the Emperor's special agents at times, but often act on their own, gathering information, seeking out and eliminating traitors and enemies, and doing whatever else they can to help their people.  Their reputation in Cabilis has ranged from a dubious to a well respected group. <br>
<br>
So that's a small description of our place in the New Sebilisian Empire. Is that what you have in mind? *smiles* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=driaann>DriaAnn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Don't Mess with the Mage!<br>
