Very few rangers I know have Call of Flames for the sole reason that it's so difficult to get the drops at a point where they won't fall under TLC. Plus, the other items for the quest drop off greenies as well.<br>
<br>
I have Call of Flames solely due to a raid with two other people, and it was still a difficult challenge for us at a level where they had greened out to all of us. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/kolanifv/Kosig.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

However the exploit allows for ridiculous farming and is attracting huge numbers of idiots to the server.  The no &quot;no drop&quot; rules are supposed to compensate for the TLC.  However, with the exploit, we now have no &quot;no drop&quot; and also no TLC which makes FV the number one location for farming and ebaying items.  Yes, TLC isn't well-thought-out in relation to quests and yes, that sucks, but I still think it needs to be fixed - and urgently.<br>
<br>
As for getting trivial items when you are older - well, often you can buy them in the bazaar, as noted, because they are not no drop here.  Also, that is what younger guildmates are for.  And finally, before PoP introduced this exploit, it WAS still possible to get around the TLC, just more difficult.  Those with pets or dots merely needed to set the pet on the monster, or root it with a few dots, and then run out of range.  TLC would not kick in if you were far enough when the mob died.  Obviously harder to do in dungeons but it was also an option if you had no younger friends.  But, annoying enough that it was unlikely to encourage farming.<br>
<br>
As for the comment about the explorer knives in LOIO...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The risk factor is too great for people who don't TLC the MAGICAL explorer survival knives. The explorers that drop them in Lake of Ill Omen are level 20. They green at 27-28ish. They can heal themselves. The lead explorer, who is only an uncommon spawn, can LoH. The pulls are tough. Without someone who can either mesmerize or calm, you will be fighting at least three at a time. If you are very unlucky, you could wind up pulling the entire tower. There are also adds. These adds, the goblins, sarnaks, and skeletons, will fight the explorers first, so you always have to kill any add before it makes your explorer poof. The knives don't drop every kill, and you need about 700 of them. Explorers are also on Firiona Vie faction, meaning few &quot;lighties&quot; will be willing to do them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I spent from about 20-24 soloing explorers for their knives.  First of all, you can pull 2 at a time if you're careful, sometimes singles, you do NOT need a mezzer and you do not get 3 at time unless you're pretty incompetent.  Second, having adds kill your explorer was pretty rare - I think it probably happened 2 or 3 times in all the time I was killing them.  There aren't a huge number of adds.  Third, most of the explorers don't heal themselves, although the lead explorer will heal the others if he's there.  And fourth, killing them ruins your faction with Firiona Vie, true - but I'm failing to see what this has to do with exploiting the TLC loophole.  Surely that makes it all the more reason to find a young friend to help, instead of using the exploit.<br>
<br>
Yes, you need to be a bit careful to solo there, but I would suggest the real reason you don't see knives for sale in the bazaar is because at that rank everybody simply heads to Paludal Caverns these days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's not that the risk factor is too great, it's that the laziness factor is too great! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=borblefootfurtoe>borblefoot furtoe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/4/03 9:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4846.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial Loot Code</span><hr size=1> &quot;So, basically we should all play like you do? Here is a fact... there are some people who don't knoww that spoiler sites exist. There are some who know they exist but do not use them (I know at least one). So, should these people be required to give that up just to do a quest? I think not.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said I played that way,The use of spoiler sites is one of several options you have to get your coveted quest items. I neither advocate or discourage the use of spoiler sites both play styles are valid and people are free to use them or not at their discretion. Have I used spoiler sites on occasion, Aye sometimes I do. Does that mean you or anyone else has to? No you don't. <br>
<br>
If you actually bothered to read what I posted you would see that the use of spoiler sites was one of several options you have to get your quest item you want. The fact that you want to take the easy way and use and exploit is your option, until the exploit is removed at least. <br>
<br>
As Didi mentioned the ease of use of the raid exploit is one of the big reasons for the increase in the lootmongers and ebayers on this server and should be fixed ASAP. I would also advocate that the other exploits be fixed as well but as mentioned they are more difficult to use so I am not as concerned about those.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see any example of  a quest that can not be completed on this server due to TLC. <br>
<br>
As I said before they do need to look at some of the quests and flag some of the quest items to be exempted from TLC they can and have done this already for some things , they just need to go and do a better job of it. I do feel that only those quests whos rewards are intended for the higher level characters should get the exemption. I.E. the classic example of a quest that results in a level 50's item but starts out having to kill greenies. Note this does not apply to some of the progessive quests as most of them were designed to be done as you level up.<br>

It limits your group options.  Few people who have good faction with FV, as I may or may not have pointed out, wish to ruin that faction.<br>

Did you solo it with Didi when she was a Shadowknight or after, when you rerolled her into a mage?  Just curious.<br>

<br>
By risk factor being too high, I meant in comparison to easy leveling like Paludal Caverns.  I agree that laziness is a factor in the discussion.<br>
<br>
I also agree that raiding around the Trivial Loot Code is an exploit, and an exploit is an exploit.  If it TLCs, bring a lower level along to do it.

But since most agree that there are quest items that should be exempt from TLC, the case can be made that there are circumstances where using the exploit is justifiable.<br>
<br>
Doing quests at the appropriate levels always helps.  But you don't always know every quest that you need to do, or want to do when you're at these appropriate levels.  And as mentioned, some quests have steps where you must be of a higher level to complete the first part, but a subsequent step may involve things that are already TLC.  Yes, many quest items are on sale in the bazaar, and yes there are some instances where you can hire level appropriate people to help you. <br>
<br>
But then there are instances where the difficulties of obtaining a quest item will make it hard to attract eager mercenaries.  These cases involve the rare drops and/or rare spawns that are often in places people hardly ever visit.  Finding someone willing to take on a 20-50 hour camp can prove challenging.  And should you find someone, can you afford them?<br>
<br>
So you either wait as long as it takes to find someone willing to help, which could be weeks, months, etc.  Or you settle for not doing the quest (which may or may not actually be an option), or you use an exploit to get something that shouldn't be affected by TLC in the first place.<br>
<br>
I think a quest item fix should come before or at the same time as a raid bug fix.  But definitely not after.<br>

Fine, what greens, pray tell, would a level 65 farm to sell? That's what I'm asking. Whether you transfer here or come naked at 65, *what* are you going to farm to make so much money? Lots of mid to semi-high level things? Pray tell, what are they?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A good example of this is the stormfeather camp in iceclad.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, that's an awful example. It's a quest piece and shouldn't be affected by TLC (not only that, it's a quest that can't be done by someone young enough to not incur TLC killing one of the quest mobs). Or, by your logic, low level players *should* be camping this and selling it to high level characters who can't get it themselves due to TLC (once again bringing up the farming/ebay conundrum).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is also lots of money to be made selling items for PP and then selling PP on palyer auctions. Shana/boog are a good example of this.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree. Lots of money to be made and Shanana is a good example of it. HOWEVER--they are not selling anything that drops off of green-to-a-65 mobs. They are selling things that drop in Vex Thal, Elemental Planes, etc. TLC does not affect ebayers because ebayers don't WANT to farm greens--they want to sell high-end Ssra drops for 200k, etc.<br>
<br>
So far my question has not been answered. Practically speaking, what gear that drops off of green mobs would a level 65 want to farm? Not quest items, since those shouldn't be TLC to begin with. Please, enlighten me because I haven't seen jack that any 65 would care about farming. I mean, conceivably they could go farm SSoYs or FBSs, but those sell for pitifully small amounts of money relative to how long it takes to camp them. Seems they could make a lot more money either farming plat for real (a la killing guards in Paineel) or by joining a raiding guild and, 3-6 mos later, ebaying.<br>
<br>
Just tell me what you're so worried about people farming for cash. And realize that even with this workaround for TLC, farming has not increased on our server--LGuk is still there for 40-somethings to hunt in. CC is still a great place for a 30s group to hunt (barring the occasional velium farmer--which, since it's for a tradeskill, is immune to TLC).<br>

<br>
For the record, I, too, think more quest things should be taken off TLC.  Those things with more than one mob to kill and have mixed levels in the things to kil, those quests for items which can only be used at a higher level (or who have quest givers that will only talk to those of a higher level), and epics should not be on TLC in the same way that tradeskill items (or rather most of them) are not.<br>
<br>
There are two tradeskill items I know of which still triv... the greater lightstone and burned out lightstones.  The GLS is used in Wu's fighting gauntlets and the burned out is used in a poison.  The GLS and regular lightstones can also be used in a faction quest.<br>
<br>
TLC is, and always has been, broken because they were not thinking in those terms when they created the quests.  TLC was partially fixed when they exempted most tradeskill items, but it really does have a long way to go.<br>
<br>
Since TLC only affects one server, I doubt very seriously they will fix the raid bug.  Yes, it is a bug since it is not working as intended.  Does using it make it an exploit?  Was the former KEIing of groups with those below a level they could receive it an exploit?  I don't think I want to make that judgement call myself.<br>
<br>
However, I hate it when anyone, even someone who is level appropriate, monopolises a spawn or zone.  <br>
<br>
Many of the things that are farmed on other servers are not here, is that a result of TLC or the smaller population (and the ability to go other places less or uncontested) or a combination? <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">

What brother Jebbar is trying to pin down is exactly what these items are.  It was mentioned that because of the raid glitch, FV has become the number one choice for farmers and ebayers.  But what areas of the game are likely to be farmed by such folks?  A level 20-30 zone or dungeon?  A level 30-50 zone or dungeon?<br>
<br>
In times past, when the game wasn't as big, and there weren't that many &quot;uber&quot; items and high level places for the higher level folks to make money, farming of lower level content was a real problem.  Back then is when you'd likely see high level peoeple permanently camping the frenzied ghoul, or the froglok king, or that goblin that had the idol of the thorned, etc.<br>
<br>
But times have changed.  The game is a lot bigger now, and there are a lot more high end items out there to make money from.  Nowadays, lower level content is less likely to be farmed by higher level people.  It is more likely that the farming will be done by guilds in high level zones like sleepers tomb, ssra, vex thal, and PoP.  In which case, TLC is a non factor, and also the deprivation of content/opportunity for lower level folks is a non factor.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of people are still thinking of the game in times past when it comes to farming and its negative impact on level appropriate people. And this is what TLC was designed to prevent.  But nowadays, items on low level things where TLC would kick in to stop a high level from getting it, you'll not likely find a high level wanting to farm it anyways.  Which is what I believe brother Jeb was trying to point out.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, the only thing TLC is doing is creating instances where completing a quest can become more difficult than it should be.<br>

The shining metalic still sells for buckets in the Bazaar?  Just one example.  Sure, no one except perhaps a rogue who is 50+ would want the item for it's attributes, but younger levels would.  I haven't been been in LGuk lately (umm I am kinda way above level for it) so I don't know if it is still being farmed by a few exploiters.  However... if you read back, some of the issues people have had with rude zone/mob monopolisers have generally been those using the raid exploit for what ever reason.  Then again.. under the concept that no quest item should fall under TLC, that one would be farmed even then.  <br>
<br>
Just playing devil's advocate a bit, since I can see how the TLC being dropped while there is no No Drop really is a clarion call to farmers (for plat for in-game or for sale for real money doesn't really matter in this).  <br>
<br>
Jebbar claiming, in essence, that it wouldn't matter since there isn't anything a level 65 would want or couldn't out do is rather, in my mind, ludicrous.  -That- is what I was trying to point out.  Again... just because it isn't worth it for a 65 doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth it to anyone on this server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jebbar>Jebbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/6/03 7:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4846.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial Loot Code</span><hr size=1> I'm not saying the things a level 65 could farm would not be worth anything to anyone on the server. Let's just take a look at this realistically. Some level 65 goes and monopolizes the Ghoul/Archmagus area in Lower Guk. In the 8 hours that he's there, he gets 1 SMR, and some loot off the ghoul lord. How much can he sell that for? 1k maybe? 2k at the outside? The same level 65 could go to a traditional plat farm and make 4k or more in the same amount of time.<br>
<br>
Why would a level 65 farm something he can sell for, maximum, 1kpp? Especially considering he might see *one* of those items drop per day? Any smart level 65, if they actually need cash, would farm plat in a traditional plat farm, because he can make money faster (and more reliably) at it.<br>
<br>
It would take a level 65 about a month to farm 100k if he were farming greens in some old world dungeon. He could farm the same amt in less than a week if he concentrates on plat farms. If he farms places like BoT he can make that much in a day or two if he's lucky. Less than 100k plat isn't worth the trouble ebaying. Why would the level 65 want to go farm greens, when he could make more money, and exponentially faster, killing things in PoP zones that give him exp too?<br>
<br>
Lifting TLC is not a clarion call to anyone out there. Nobody who *can* farm lower-end content *wants* to. It's boring and the monetary returns just aren't there anymore. Any ebayers who want to come here are more attracted by the lack of NODROP than by any workaround for TLC.<br>
<br>
I don't know how I can make this any clearer. It's not that nobody on the server wants the stuff that can be farmed out of these low-level places--it's that the people who want the stuff don't have enough money to make farming it worthwhile to anyone who *could* farm it.<br>
<br>
Personally, when I want to go farm cash, I go to Halls of Testing with a cleric and enchanter. Splitting armor drops between only 3 people ensures everyone gets numerous pieces, all of which sell for 4k-15k. I also get pretty good exp doing it. Either that or I kill guards and make around 1200p/hr. Even if I were an evil ebayer who transfered to this server just to make $US, I still wouldn't be farming Guk, CC, etc. because there's too little money in it. You don't sell 1k plat on ebay, you sell 100k plat.<br>

It is not just 65s who might be farming and in fact I seriously doubt it is those who are 65 (much for your same reasons).  I believe (not 100% positive) the SMR (using that example) is green at 50.  Thus... it is not only a matter of 65s farming (which yes, I agree they have far better things to do), it would be more likely someone in their low 50s.  Oh.. but that's right, they are no longer considered &quot;high level&quot; because they are not 65.  50s is high level to someone in their 30s who might actually be trying to get the item when it is level appropriate.  Heck... even in mid-20s on the other servers you have people farming the wisps for the stones.  They aren't level 65 and able to go to the PoP zones for money, etc.  Heck... why do so many hunt Paladul Cavern mid-teens to mid-20s (or even later) instead of the wealth of other zones?  It is easier for them to do so.<br>

TLC becomes an issue FAR before you hit 65.  TLC is not there to hamstring those who are 65, it is there to provide a means of level appropriate hunting all along the way.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jebbar>Jebbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 279<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/03 5:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4846.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Trivial Loot Code</span><hr size=1> Actually the SMR starts triving out around 55. If you're 50, that area is actually great exp and can be done with 2 or 3 if they are good. I went from 47-52 camping that damned SMR for/with friends. Before PoP came out, it was sometimes farmed by a level 60 (highest level at the time). That was over 6 mos ago though, and now that PoP is out, it's not often you see a level 60, or a level 65, down there monopolizing spawns from people who could hunt there for exp. Before PoP came out, TLC actually had a function other than pissing people off. PoP has been out for a long time now though, and TLC is an obsolete idea.<br>
<br>
And I realize TLC was not put there to hamstring 65s, but that's what it does. In fact, it hamstrings *everyone* (you included!), and does little to nothing to help anyone (example: try to do the Veeshan's Peak key quest at your level. VP is a high level raid zone. You're going to have to camp some rare spawning green mobs to get that key. I'll bet you end up using /raid!). As we've established (to my satisfaction), there is little reason for a high level to farm low level hunting areas for anything but tradeskill drops and quest pieces. However, unless you visit spoiler sites when you roll your character and meticulously plan out what quests you're going to do and when, you will butt up against TLC at one point or another. Even if you *do* plan out all your quests, you're bound to find one you want to do that you hadn't planned on. Try starting your epic when it becomes level appropriate--I'll bet you have to get some nodrop piece off of something that is green to you.<br>
<br>
The one rule you could change/fix on this server to keep it small (read: to keep the ebayers away) is get rid of the no-NODROP rule. TLC is a non-issue anymore, unless they fix the raid workaround.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you *really* wanted to limit the f*cktard population, bring back alignments, limit shout radius, get rid of auction, make it harder to learn languages, etc. *grins*<br>

Why should I have to do that? Is there something wrong with going and hunting for the item myself? I am the one that wants to do &quot;X&quot; quest and so it should be me that does the neccessary hunting for it. Using the raid tool to overcome TLC is about getting help from friends to me..........not about exploiting a glitch. I seriously cannot see any reason TLC should have a negative impact on anyone's ability to do quests. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
