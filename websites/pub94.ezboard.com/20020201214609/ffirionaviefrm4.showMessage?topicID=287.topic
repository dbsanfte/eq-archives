The past week or two I've been on FV hasn't really been any different than starting a newb on any other server. It has been far more difficult, however.<br><br>I'll start with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the good:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Friends, it's nice to have you (Sar) and Zoro, and Kerri around, even if I can't talk to you. The droppable no drop items appeals to the loot whore in me, but at level 8 it doesn't really make any difference. I like the grouping restrictions- all of EQ should be like this. The single greatest feature of the server IMO is the lack of people. Overcrowding is the biggest turn-off EQ has for me.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The blah:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The language thing makes sense, even if it is a big pain in the butt. It sucks being a newb as well, lol (but that is expected). TLC, so far I like it, but that is only because I haven't gotten burned by it.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The bad:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Forced, permanon sucks balls when you don't know anyone around your own level. Makes the whole server like Dalnir- great place when you bring your own group. Otherwise you better be able to solo, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> especially</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> if your starting city's newb area is lame. Cuz guess what, you can't understand anyone and you have no idea who is even your level. Just adds to more downtime, which is also lame.<br><br>Now, some general opinions. RP in a game made to be &quot;Massively Multiplayer&quot; just doesn't seem like it'll work. Perhaps in some cliques everything is fine, but as a server society- no way, because everyone has their own visions and ideas of how Norrath is and it can be upsetting to people who are immersive RPers to have their experience interrupted by someone who doesn't share the same view. See other threads.<br><br>Just because some people wanted to RP differently or even have different play styles, the RP police (read: dicks) get up in arms. Unfortunately, I cannot think of any way this can be remedied. Actually, I can- no choice in choosing a server. <br><br>They could integrate a more detailed version of the Bartle test, the results of which would determine what server(s) you play on. Otherwise, someone will get their panties in a bunch over someone else.<br><br>Fortunately, I remembered over the time I spent writing this, one other server that has a very low population without the threat of being ganked every step you take (i.e. the Zeks). It's called Test.<br><br>It was just as silent in EC there as it is in EC here. You have the same options available as any blue server, it's just there aren't so many people there to abuse them. And if you're the type that likes being a hero, hey, you can find a bug before it's all patched to the main servers and save loads of people a bunch of grief.  Sorry, no witty rhetoric to end the post.<br><br>-Truant, 8th rogue  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/27/02 2:33:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=287.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Two week assessment of FV.</span><hr size=1> I like this post. It's been about two and a half weeks since I started on the server and, if anyone cares, I'll post my thoughts here in a similar format as the original poster.<br><br>The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> good</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: *On no other server would it be reasonable to go around RP all the time and not get laughed at. *Removal of no drop flags is awesome. *Lack of twinkage. My character is a warrior, and I can go around in almost full banded at 23 and feel like I'm doing pretty well. On a blue server, this would be considered pretty sub-par. *Languages. This is awesome, when I went from Faydwer to the human lands near Freeport, I really felt like I was a stranger in a strange land. <br><br>The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> blah</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: *TLC. I don't think this is the catastrophe everyone thinks it is, since you almost always can pay someone else to do your dirty work for you. But I don't see any compelling reason for it to remain. Without twinks and with very little money in the economy, pharming is pointless. *Forced /role. On one hand, I like that everyone is forced to always display their guildtag without /anon. On the other hand, it's mildly annoying not knowing where people on my /friends list are without asking them. <br><br>The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bad</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: *Lack of population. Okay, it's one thing when the aviaks in SK are not camped to the point of extinction. It's another thing when there is no one there, and it's not like warriors can really go places fast to find other groups. The thing below about &quot;cliques&quot; seems kinda right to me; I'm wondering if maybe the only way to really have fun on the server is to bring a bunch of RL friends with you. Cause otherwise you just wander around and around, hoping to have an &quot;adventure&quot; but quite probably wasting a whole night running around in empty zones. And it discourages exploration; I really think Stonebrunt is great for my level, but it's unpopulated on even the normal servers. There's no way I'm going through the Warrens just to find nobody in the zone. *One character per account. Now that I'm 23 levels into my warrior, I find myself wishing I had recreated my old character from my other server. But there's just no way I'm going to delete my warrior, so now I'm stuck, end of story.<br><br>General opinions: One of the things that makes the server population problem such an issue is that a lot of the people who ARE here are totally not RPers. I really don't care, more power to em, but to people who say &quot;Don't group with them if you wanna RP&quot;...well, Highkeep can only hold two groups, and no one was RPing in either group but me and one friend/acquaintance of mine. And it was either that or a long lonely run through the Karanas (for the second or third time of the evening) to find...what? The idea really seems to be &quot;walk around and hopefully something will happen&quot;. <br><br>And there are still jerks, still camp-stealers, d00dz, only difference is that because it might just be you and A_d00d_01 in five zones, you have to group with him anyway. The longer I play here, the more I realize why people get so worked up about people not RPing, because there really ISN'T an option. <br><br>-Aradil Swiftblade, 23rd season<br>Former member of the Fayguard<br>Child of Rallos Zek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uscully020.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scully020</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/27/02 9:24:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=287.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Two week assessment of FV.</span><hr size=1> <br>Firiona Vie is not an easy server to play.  It takes an understanding of the game, and the ability to push your class to its limits in order to survive and progress.<br><br>The TLC helps to keep the population of the server down.  Most people don't wanna play somewhere when they can not get what they want when they want it.  It causes you to have to think and plan if you want an item.  It discourages farming.  Not having items no drop is wonderful.  That way, if someone misses an item that they need, maybe someone else has it.  Please note:  when I killed one of my epic mobs the other day, the item was Lore and No Drop. <br><br> I have had a GREAT experience with a customer service rep on this server- something that never happened during the two years I was on Prexus. <br><br>The language situation I believe adds to the roleplaying situation of the server; why would a halfling and an Ogre know to speak to one another except for the halfling to say &quot;eeek&quot; and the Ogre to say &quot;yum.&quot;  The language situation is kinda difficult.  Sometimes people approach me and I can not understand them or offer to help.  All I can do is sow them and leave.<br><br>There is room on this server for the roleplayers and those who want to be &quot;the first.&quot;  There are several guilds which are large enough to do big things, and plently of independent people running around just making nuisances of themselves.  You have a choice on which direction that you can go here.  I like the fact that for a husband-wife team (my situation), this server rocks for the two of us to spend a fun afternoon exploring and trying new quests or new adventures.  However, <br>because the server population is small, it is hard for a single random person to find a group- last night, I saw 13 people in Dawnshroud peaks; with the exception of a newbie zone, that is the most people I have ever seen in one zone.  <br><br>I love the automatic anon tag, and yet I hate it.  Lost a corpse the other day, and would have loved to send a bard a tell &quot;wanna earn some pp and find a corpse?&quot; only I did not know who the bards were, nor could I shout in the zone for one (there was two other people besides me anyway).  However, as a druid, it is great to not get constant teleport requests; I can do drive-by sows if I feel like it or offer to teleport if I so chose.  I have seen how it is on a larger server, and it can be heartbreaking to watch a druid friend get pestered and insulted for not teleporting.<br><br>Because I don't know what is being used for which quest or I have an item that I suspect someone needs, my bank account is constantly full of moss, smelly hides, and miscellaneous minerals.  I think that the banker hates me.  <br><br>So I think that while the TLC, low server population, lanugage, and the ANON tags have their problem, I also think that there is a plus side.  I would be hard pressed to call anything &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; on this server because each has its own strengths and weaknesses.   I just think that being here, one has recognize that everything has its strengths and weaknesses, and if we change any part of what is present, then we are not really that much different from any other blue server.<br><br>Scully Skywatcher<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrittyeye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>grittyeye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/27/02 6:10:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=287.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Two week assessment of FV.</span><hr size=1> In regards to the grouping situation: Well, I've been playing on FV for about a month and a half now and I did not know a soul on this server when I started. I didn't even group until I was in my 11th season, I soloed the entire time because I was worried, being new to EQ, about how bad I would mess up when grouping. I still have this insecurity when grouping with players I've never met before.<br><br>I now have a number of friends I group with on a daily basis and we are all of like temperament and game playing style. I absolutely love this server, but because it is so different from the regular blue servers, I think it requires a bit of a different play style. It made me actually strive to cultivate friendships here and I'm the better for it.  If I hadn't taken the time out from leveling, to actually get to know the people around me,  I think I would've gotten very bored and frustrated very fast. If you see someone in need, help them and remember those that helped you when you were in need.<br><br>If you group with someone and find you group well with them, keep their name in your friends list, even if you only spent two hours hunting together but had a good experience with the person, chances are, he's out there looking for a group too.  If you see yourself running into the same person quite a bit in your travels, say hello once in a while, stop and chat if they are wanting to chat too. Doing this was actually how I came to be in a guild now, I kept running into this fellow everywhere I went for weeks, we would often stop and chat, I didn't realize he was an officer in his guild until he gave me an invite.  <br><br>Sure, I've been on this server for a little bit now and haven't leveled very fast but I've met alot of wonderful people and enjoy the game immensely. <br><br>On all other points in the original posts:<br>/agree with Scully, well said.  <p>Narie<br>The Bumbling Half Elf Druid<br>Now debuting in her 19th season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ublakkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 12:04:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=287.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  One month assessment</span><hr size=1> The good:<br><br>Zone populations are lighter than a regular blue server, but in the lower levels there are still plenty of people.  I suspect you have to be very agressive early on if you are a group dependant class and came here alone.  Make friends, join a guild etc. I have a permanent partner, and I play a soloable class.  I don't mind somewhat empty zones.  I would hate to be a cleric or rogue on FV, if I was anti-social at all.  The quiet is incredible.  No OOC spam, no auctions in every zone.  The world &quot;feels&quot; emptier, even if 20 people are in the zone with you.  I think this contributes to realism and RP environment.  I am much more inclined to try and talk to players I meet, and rp as well.  I also like camping something level specific and not having to wait for A_druid_Farmer_124567 to finish the camp before taking it over.  Languages are alot of fun.  None of my other characters ever learned any other languages.  My partner and I are very strict about it.  Every time we zone (and with melee only bind spots, its often) and every hour within a zone (we use a timer) we train a point of language.  At lvl 20 we have mastered elvish and dark elvish.  She has learned 50 points of Barbarian, we are feeble in 4 or 5 tongues and have a point at least in everything else.  As we travel and expand our horizons we are able to understand more and more people.  I think it helps in immersion, though perhaps lvl*10 might be more appropriate for language...<br><br>The indifferent:<br><br>TLC definately favors the experienced players.  I have a few servers and a few high level characters under my belt.  I play with my rl partner.  She plays a monk and I a Northman shaman.  Between us we have to camp about 15 things in the next 5 levels.  Without foreknowledge, either from experience, or from spoiler sites, you will find yourself buying alot of TLC items later for quests (monk epic for example starts at lvl 1).  Also the level specific camping has slowed us down considerably.  While leveling is not as important to me as it has been before, we do play alot less as well than on previous servers (average of 20 or so hours a week vs. 40-50 or even more gah!), I will not feel complete as a shaman until lvl 35 (pet at 34 and no more spell book!).  There are also alot more interesting things to do in the midlevels, and I have expensive hobbies...  trying to master tailoring, smithing, baking, brewing, pottery, and alchemy will easily cost me 25K throughout my career, so the better loot at higher levels is enticing me....  The market... Wow, it is rare indeed to buy in game without first hitting the boards here.  This is ok, but perhaps only a few percent of players actually comes here.  Maybe the bazaar will fix this up.<br><br>The bad:<br><br>&lt;this page intintionally left blank&gt;<br><br> <p>Lorec <br>Wandering Judge of the Tribunal <br>Lousy Tailor <br>Better Brewer <br>Excellent Drunk <br>Aspiring Polyglot <br></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ublakkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blakkon</A> at: 1/28/02 12:15:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhenkoffv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Henk of FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 1:58:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=287.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Four month assessment</span><hr size=1> My take, simply because I have nothing better to do at work today.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>One character per account.

You earn a reputation and if you screw it up you really only have one recourse.  Spectacular.<br><br>Languages.  The languages annoyed me at lower levels, but in my mid twenties, I find it refreshing.  You have to work a bit to communicate with those outside your “culture”.<br><br>The Blah<br><br>TLC.  I was once a big proponent of this, and I still believe in the core idea, but with only one character per account, it does not seem to be as necessary as before.<br><br>Low Population.  This is great in that there is plenty of elbow room and dungeons are rarely filled with more than two groups.  Raid competition when the upper levels start filling out should be conducive to amicable scheduling and cooperation rather than the current situation on Druzzil Ro, for instance.  On the other hand, the above poster was correct – it is really tough to be a group-dependant class.  As I move up in levels, it seems to be easier to get into a group, ironically enough.<br><br>The Bad<br><br>Reduced range of  /shout.
