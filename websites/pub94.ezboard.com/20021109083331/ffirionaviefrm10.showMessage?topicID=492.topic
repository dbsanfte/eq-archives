Blood running down his sword and off of his hand. The bodies of Felwithe citizens are strewn about, faces contorted with fear, smeared with blood. He nods to Yerig.<br>
<br>
Yerig pulls a blank scroll and a white quill from his sack. He takes a knee near a woman, or what was left of her. He dips his quill into the gaping wound in her neck and begins to scribe.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------<br>
<br>
The dead lay at my feet. Our troops covered with their blood. Many hours we killed these innocent people, the echos of their screams still pull at my mind.<br>
<br>
No heroes came today...<br>
<br>
We have called for the guilds to stand against us and we have given some the opportunity to stand by our side; but most turn their eyes. For riches and titles I'm sure. Maybe it's the smell of the dead, but I think it's more of knowing that such cowards plague our lands that is making me sick.<br>
<br>
If you have any honor at all, stand against us and stop the slaughter of your families, and feed our Lust for Blood.<br>
<br>
When you return to find your families hanging from the rafters, remember my name, remember Lust for Blood, and remember that you had the power to stop this.<br>

If your true heroes and warriors slay those enemies of worth not perform cowardly attacks on civilians. If you attack one city attack them all including your own.

But just then, when things looked their darkest, the call was answered...<br>
<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf and General Jyleel summoned all the Priests of Tunare to resurrect the dead, and joined with Heartwood Master's Soldiers of Tunare to undo the damage that had been done.<br>
<br>
The Songweavers raised their voices in song in praise to their Mother, bringing strength and courage to the people of Faydark.<br>

Firiona Vie, Tunare's own champion, returned to the Elven people to rally them to victory over the maurading hordes.  They searched far and wide until, at last, they captured every last one of the murderers.  <br>

The accused were summoned to the Plane of Justice where they were they tried by The Tribunal. <br>

<br>
<br>
Again the doors of the Lair of the bloodlust are pushed open by the hands of the Baroness Xadria High Priestess of Tunare.. <br>
<br>
This time however things have changed... She was once known as the protector of the Lord of Lust.. But she has come for a different reason today.. <br>
<br>
Walking past all those that know her and seeing many that she has never met, she walks boldly onward to to the back room where Gore resides.. Many of his followers stand in her way only trying to protect their lord.. She brushes them aside with a touch of her delicate hands... <br>
<br>
Approaching the door of the Baron she stops for only a moment...A chill runs down her spine.. She has no Fear of the Bloodlust but there is a strangeness in this place today mayhap it is just the death that surrounds this place... <br>
<br>
Throwing open the door, she sees the baron reaching for his sword, then the look of reconigtion on his face as he relaxes.. <br>
<br>
&quot;Baron Gore.. I have come here today for their are tales in the wind that you and your ambassador have been plotting against my people. You have visited and massacred my people in Felwith again..&quot; &quot;I told you before I wish to never stand against you but you continue to massacare my people, you will leave me no choice&quot;.. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will not ask this of you again Baron Gore... Your mindless attacks on Felwith and the murder of my people have to stop...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I have pulled you from the clutches of death more times than I can count.. Do not make me ensure your death by attacking my people any longer..&quot; <br>
<br>
Turning around and closing the door behind her she walks through the halls of the lust, looking at all those gathered there and wondering what the future will bring... Will they be her friends or will she stand against them in battle? Only the Baron knows the answer to this <p><p align="Center"><font face="arial" Color=CC0000><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Xadria.JPG" align="center" border="5">

Laying waste to anything on Antonica is akin to dropping yesterdays boiled egg into todays hot water. There's just so little to notice, except for in the mind of a lunatic. Perhaps the dainty Elfs could not sell their goods for a day. Only means higher prices tomorrow for those tree hugging farmers. I suppose they might notice that as a favor. The holier than thou Elfs from the cave city have always offered their throats to the blade. A price they willingly accept in keeping thier noses to the sky. They glee when another one of them dies because its one less elfperson that they have to be holier than. Another favor done the Elfs, well, done for us all by the lunatic and his mindless drones. I doubt you'll find a dwarf at home, they're all mining the moon these days. The Trolls and the Ogres wouldn't notice your passing through, and does anyone really care about the humankind? Frankly, I can't think of anything worthy of our notice. Perhaps Gore dancing a jig would be entertaining for a moment, much like the bards tales of his latest windmill slaying.<br>
<br>
Alas, as a measure of indulgeness I have located a great army to match Gores. They journey to Antonica now. You may glimpse them here: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.rathergood.com/vikings/">www.rathergood.com/vikings/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p><CENTER>
