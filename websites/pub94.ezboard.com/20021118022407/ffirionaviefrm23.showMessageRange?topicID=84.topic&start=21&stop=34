Shintou's madness frightened her...but there was also something compelling about it as well.  She knew she should have left when the first person was killed, but she couldn't make herself move, couldn't take her eyes off of what was happening around her.<br>
<br>
When Notuanot started his rampage, she came out of her stupor, and started moving toward the door.  Before she could get there, a body flew towards her forcing her to duck back to the wall again.  It landed on a table a short distance away, and the man sitting there came to his feet.  That was when she recognized Gatsu.  It had been long since she'd seen him.  She froze for moment, second guessing her decision to leave.  What if he needed help?  She was not as powerful a healer as he was a warrior, but still, she could help somewhat.  She'd had just enough to drink that night to make her foolhardy, and so moved back into the shadows and pulled out her spellbook, memorizing her best heals, as well as her best direct damage spell.  200 points of damage isn't a large amount, but every bit helps.  She smiled to herself as she memorized her spells.<br>

One of the young boys is slowly swinging the knights other weapon a blade wreathed in flames, in slow awkward circles, finally overbalancing himself from the weight he falls to the floor, the Knight with all the tenderness one could muster gently picks up the young boy and sits him down by his side. &quot;I shall tell you some tales tho I confess to being no bard if you wish to hear&quot;. <br>
He tells tales of love and battle, of honor gained and friends lost.  A sad look on his face as he recounts the countless knights he has met in his day and of either there fall from grace, or their deaths fighting the growing tide of evil.<br>
In all his innocence a young boy stands up and shouts is evil winning?  I will help, I will stand in the light.  <br>
With a sincere smile the Paladin looks to the young boy and remembers the truth of the balance.  The one often overlooked aspect rarely spoken off.<br>
Yes we are few and those of us true of heart rarer still.<br>
But in the eyes of these young I see the hope for the future.<br>
For every Knight that falls in battle defending loved ones and friends  against even overwhelming odds a new legend begins. And with every legend told, more young children are insprired to take up arms against the forces of darkness.  These will be the Heroes  of the future and the legends that will inspire yet another generation to follow the light. The truth of a Paladins might is in Victory our power legend grows and in death it grows even stronger.  No evil can match that simple truth.  The knight who killed the great evil reknowned in legend, the evil soon forgotten.  <br>
So come to me if you will, I fear no darkness, I fear no blade, I fear no evil, tis my duty to fall defending those that are weaker then I.  I will vanquish you if I may and if Erollisi calls me to her side that day I go with a smile on my face knowing that my name will ring in legend causing others to find the calling.  And knowing also that tho my battle may have been lost, I will take a large piece of you with me, and neither your victory nor your boasts has anywhere near the power that my valiant death  will bring.  So come to me and find your fate, I know in my heart that in death I become even more powerful then in life.<br>
That is the cycle of light and dark, chaos and order are but tools to a greater struggle that rages eternally between all that is good and all that is evil.  Neutrality does not exist in truth, for all will one day be forced to make a choice, to live in either a world of darkness or one bathed in light.  So claim neutraility if you will, but know in the end when the evil comes to you, it will be the forces of light who stand beside you.<br>
The Knight then picksup his weapons and walks off into his temple to thank his goddess for all those friends now lost which through their sacrifice gave all that is good the knowledge that in the end the war will  our victory regarless of numbers.<br>

I'm not neutral..I'm GOOD, and the opposite of good is bad..and if evil is the opposite of good, then evil is bad...<br>

A great Paladin can destroy all evil before him. Why you ask?<br>
Because when all is said and done, those silly neuts want to say they are GOOD, sure, I realize I'm selling out my spotlight, but hey! it gets the job done.
