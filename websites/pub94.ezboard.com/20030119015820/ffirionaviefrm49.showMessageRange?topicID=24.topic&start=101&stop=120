I was in the first group on the server to do the trials. I was in the second group on the server to successfully do the trials. Reso was *not* first. Since then we used the marks obtained to key about 5-10 people and certainly no more. We did it the same day you did as a matter of fact. Then you petitioned after using one set of marks to key your whole guild (i dont buy you sat there doing trials, i know you guys too well.). <br>
<br>
Since then we have helped our members do trials the old fashioned way. And they are all keyed for valor now.<br>
<br>
Upon entering valor we began the box of souls quest and its not a simple quest it takes alot of camping and alot of rare drops. Now listen. In my opinion you didn't acomplish anything too grand. You couldn't kill the dragon on your own so you latched on to the closest guild you could and did it thier bodies added to yours. Now your so super special for killing the dragon which you could not have done with your own people.<br>
<br>
So you got into HoH. I finished my quest roughly 4 days later. I had the entire guilds help throughout this quest people helped me when they could and camped pieces of it for me. I consider that a guild accomplishment. So it happens to be droppable on this server. Would it make you happier for me to use the box of souls and key every person by sitting at that long camp of greens in justice? will that make you shut the hell up? probably not. This is not about &quot;pride&quot; or an exploit this is reso doing what you do. Whine, whine, moan, cry, petition, whine some more and hope for the best.<br>
<br>
I actually gained somewhat of a respect for reso in ssra when you left because of the zone lag in ssra that was killing us both. But now (who didn't see it coming?) you go back to your whiney selves. And misinformed whiney selves at that.<br>
<br>
Rollen - I have met large sticks who were more intelligent in their arguements and with much more reason to have &quot;Pride&quot;. Please go away.<br>
<br>
k thx! uli~<br>
<br>
<br>
wait wait one more thing... So we are FNF/AS now? I seem to notice quite a few old AS raiding with you... are you  AS/Resolution now? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xyloxfv>XyloxFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 209<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/21/02 8:03:44 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh I feel like a pride part 3 post about right now</span><hr size=1> Ok I'll do this Griffe Style.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>difference here reside in action of your guildleader fact is Fnf/AS leader support blatant exploiting of the game reso did not.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You're right. Your leadership just couldn't control some of your members so they went ahead and cheated(as you seem to think) anyway. Grats you guys on awesome leadership.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>First it’s not a group key quest that’s a single key quest<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now you're turning into coinfist and diving the intentions of the developers and how they intended quests to work on Firiona Vie. You got some serious skills there. I'll tell you what. I'll just point your face in the direction of my previous post and you can read about the Shawl quest.. k? If you need more examples of how quests differ on Firiona Vie from other servers you can look at .. ohhh.. basically every single quest in the game.<br>
<br>
The rest of your post is pretty much useless dog shit that served no other purpose to cloud the issue so I'm gonna ignore that for now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cataline</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The most members in any of those /who in FnF I saw was 10. We have 50 members. So I guess you proved that 20% of our members were keyed allbeit one day after is relevant anyway.<br>
<br>
Gratz you on catching the Enron Scale accounting error. <br>
<br>
Why doesn't someone in Reso put out some proof that what FnF, and the rest of the server for that matter, did or does wrong with using the ability to multitask quests and share the results with your friends.<br>
<br>
Is every other quest on Firiona Vie an exploit? Should all the 8th shawls on Firiona be stripped from their owners until each person can do it individually.<br>
<br>
*long pause*<br>
<br>
No... I didn't think so. If a GM comes and strips the keys then fine, you guys were correct. Until that time you are just a bunch of whiners who are pissed off because another guild is in the same zone you thought you had all to yourselves.  We did nothing to &quot;cheat&quot; and we didn't &quot;exploit&quot; anything.  <br>
<br>
k thx,<br>

<br>
Rollen - Fuck you Fire and Farming<br>
Griffe &amp; Ichi - Agree<br>
Kzan - I am a liar who will be proved wrong in a few more posts but I wasn't lying at the time.<br>
Griffe - No really, fuck you<br>
<br>
Kurley - I think it's cheating and I'll distance myself from it but watch me spin doctor this into ST where the Reso got the first key and FaF went in first and go SO THERE.<br>
<br>
Kurley - It's exactly like when there were no no drop keys on server and the only things that were no drop were as advertised Epics (well some of them) and Newbie Notes.  Compares very well to after SOE patches FV to make ST, VP and VT keys no drop and then even patches again to make PoJ trial marks no drop.<br>
<br>
Ichi - I'm not as evil as Griffe<br>
Kzan - We aren't doing anything wrong, I mean wtf if 20 mobs stand there in Chardok and don't do anything and I kill them obviously SOE intended it.  I'm lying though.<br>
Kzan - I'll mock Rollen for not having the list of tradeable keys but I have it.  I'm lying about that too.<br>
<br>
Aailin - See my big penis<br>
Dalninil - Sebilis = Halls of Honor<br>
Kzan - You should have talked to DS leadership about disbanding guild and then letting the DS members app if you want pride in killing the dragon, I mean WTF Lithis was in this guild last year and is active and so is....<br>
<br>
Dalninil - OMG I found a secret word, I am so smart<br>
Syll - I have the list of tradeable keys<br>
Zsuz - I am a POWER GAMER and I hated doing the quest I wish we would just kill the dragon<br>
Borm - I learned everything about analogies from Kurley<br>
<br>
Kzan - I will post a bunch of lies because I seem to be on my own at the moment flinging feces.<br>
Beornn - I know nothing but I'll post lies about Reso because it makes me feel better.  And why the fuck do you work with Dreadstorm, run them over, get there first, get the loot, make vague apologies and be ready to run them over again.<br>
<br>
Samm - I'm gonna leak Reso goals on the message board, I have the sekret infoz<br>
Syll - I learned analogies from Fuvi<br>
Kzan - I'm a retard, I know nothing, I just post lies<br>
Rollen - Yes I'm still bitter we didn't do ST before FaF, I mean damnit we had the first key, no wait, fucking Vaniki<br>
Zsuz - I helped someone get a 9th Ring, why shouldn't I have one too?<br>
<br>
Kzan - OK, more people throwing feces, I'm gonna unload.  OK, lets make Reso accountable for PoV/S flags and ignore FaF and PoV/S, CoD and/or HoH.  And yes I'm a liar.<br>
Griffe - No, I mean really, fuck you<br>
<br>
Zsuz - I mean it's not easy, if a group or two go do Ssra and get an Emp Key should they get 1 key or key the whole guild?<br>
Kzan - You all suck so bad you should still be killing moss snakes, maybe if you worked with DS you could kill a Fire Beetle that Zarsiss said was so hard.  Did I mention I was a liar?<br>
Xadria - Maybe this sexy toon pic will divert the thread<br>
<br>
Zarsiss - Wizards are gods<br>
Vulrath - I like eating at buffets and trying to grab the good food before people who didn't pay<br>
Aalian - Look it's my penis from a side view<br>
Kzan - Rollen you are my idol and the slight blemish on your image pains me more than the festering wound that was once my integrity.<br>
Kzan - PS, I'm a liar.<br>
<br>
Kurley - The spin doctor gives a big thumbs up to Dawson's Creek and even though Rollen got married, that bitch Kzan still won't come across with a Ring for me.<br>
Phallen - Must pad post count so I can flame too<br>
Xylox - FaF is in HoH to promote ROLEPLAY<br>
Xadria - Souls Arisen is clerly the number one guild on server<br>
<br>
Xoraxis - I was really surprised at the fall of SA, was a total shock, you believe me right?<br>
Kzan - Please don't flame us for fucking you over DS, but dammit we NEEDED the loot so we can kill the SAME mobs we have been without the loot.<br>
Ichi - On further reflection, fuck you<br>
Puppz - Fuck you too<br>
<br>
Zsuz - Don't you love me anymore?<br>
Phallen - Postcount +1<br>
Bako - I'm gonna post you shouldn't post, I R smart~!<br>
Ichi - *huggles* for my KEI bitches<br>
Ellu - Don't you love me anymore?<br>
<br>
Kzan - I've thrown my share of shit and don't want it back, stop now.  <br>
Coinfist - FUCK YOU ALL<br>
Zsuz - If I can even smile at Coinfist maybe.... na, here's a jab dorf.  OK, but no more, from anyone.<br>
Xylox - I have 250 Smithing and a way bigger penis than Aailin and carpal tunnel syndrome.<br>
<br>
Phallen - Closer to flame worthy post count total<br>
Aailin - OK your penis is indeed bigger Xylox but I know where i can buy a bigger one than yours<br>
Shackleton - Oops, posted in the wrong thread, bye all<br>
<br>
Thraall - I can concoct an explanation for what you saw although I won't say that's the actual case because I don't want to lie.  Wow, Xylox does have a big penis, I'm out.<br>
Aluveal - My RL &gt; your RL<br>
Kzan - FaF was in the zone and it sucks that Mod Rods aren't on the ground anymore to pick up, too bad we couldn't lag you out a bit more, you almost lost again.<br>
<br>
Xylox - That penis you can buy Aailin is a fake, I have the real deal and damnit it works great.<br>
Sneez - Fuck it, I have nothing to lose, start killing shit people I shouldn't have more Spectrals that either of your guilds combined.<br>
Sneez - Have you tried a penis enlarger Thraall? I heard they work good.<br>
<br>
Cataline - I wanted to get in FaF once upon a time but rather glad I didn't now.<br>
Syll - I'm one bad ass Troubadour, by the way I knocked up the wife, did you Mr. Big Penis?<br>
Zsuz - I don't want to blanket just Reso, OK, both guilds suck.<br>
<br>
Coinfist - Fuck most especially you Kzan, Sneez you're not so bad, thought about joining Reso?  I learned analogies from Kurley.<br>
Jaranna - Given the chance I'd cheat<br>
Coinfist - I'm going to make a rational post for Zsuz to confuse the bitch<br>
Zsuz - I helped someone do Circlet of Falinkan, where is mine?  Wait I do have one, I need to think of other quests at 7am, fuck that, go with CoF.<br>
<br>
Kzan - Most people in the guild didn't even realize I left and then Kurley snuck me back in, I ran away from home and then came back hungry and still didn't have the attention I craved.<br>
Ellu - I'm still here Ichi, where is my love?  I'll sue you for it if I have to.<br>
Xylox - This is the no no drop preferred server, although you don't have to exploit no no drop, you have to atleast accept it to play on the server.<br>
<br>
Kzan - I'm still a liar.<br>
Thaall - I'm going to post some more info completely unrelated to why those FaF were on the grassy knoll.  (BTW - you can zone in and loot Exec from a previous success, so yes you are lying)  And I have a decent sized penis.<br>
<br>
Reghar - I was the SERVER FIRST Crusader /penis wave<br>
Aailin - The bought penis works great and I've seen some big penises in the Reso locker room too (/blush Eskarina) And lets talk about my penis some more.<br>
Aailin - OK, yes Xylox you have a big penis, can you stand beside Penrif and compare?<br>
<br>
Rollen - You bitch when we do post kills, you bitch when we don't post kills you're just like Bria who bitches whether or not I....<br>
Puppz - I can find one line in 40 posts and single it out, grats me.<br>
Beornn - I said I was only posting once, but you didn't believe me anyways did you?<br>
Beornn - I can't defend myself or &quot;my&quot; guild (when I think on the rise of FaF I think of some LD druid) but I can point fingers.<br>
<br>
Rollen - Ramel killed spiders in VL so much faster than me, I always looked up to him until some stupid comments in WW that began a nasty downward spiral.<br>
Bako - Fuck you Coinfist<br>
Bako - Fuck you Reghar<br>
<br>
Thraall - There is a way to chain trial (complete lie) there were FaF on the grassy knoll (completely irrelevant).  I hate people who bring up old crap like VS (wait I just did)<br>
Griffe - No really, fuck you<br>
Coinfist - Fuck you<br>
Waii - I R Euro~!<br>
<br>
Cataline - I keep logs all you cybur freaks<br>
Oafgau - Kurley doesn't know anything about what's going on in the guild, really.<br>
Cataline - A few more posts and I can flame.<br>
Cataline - Oh the flames, the flames are coming<br>
Cataline - I will post the logs unless you add to this thread Fuvi<br>
<br>
Ulia - Killing a dragon? Big fucking deal, I killed exp mobs until they dropped an item.  I mean kill Trakanon to get into VP or collect an Ebon Mace, Tolan's Bracer, Sludged Girdle and Luminescent Staff.  I respect people for getting out of my way and nothing else.<br>
<br>
Xylox - One person can get help to complete 8th Shawl and in the end one person can benefit form having an 8th Shawl, this is the same as one person can get help completing the Key for HoH and an unlimited number of people can benefit from it.<br>
<br>
14 Fire and Fury members are listed in HoH with the top person on list (the person who most recently zoned in steadily changing) in a snapshot of who was hunting where for a 20 min interval, what's your point? (maybe there is one)<br>
<br>
Fuvi - Ermok was the first member of Fire and Fury to complete the trial, Nikka who wasn't a member then but is now completed it at the same time.  Immediately after completeing the trial the flagging of FaF members began.<br>
<br>
Taking advantage of No Drop rules I gave my Mark to Sydia who didn't yet have PoP.  Completing the Trial enables 6 more people access to PoV/S is a reasonable extension of the FV ruleset.  I actually got flagged for PoS/V before completing the trial since a CotH chain was in place although I had no intention of entering either plane without completing a trial.<br>
<br>
I have since done the trial many times because I enjoy it the loot and exp is decent too.  If you had to turn the Mark of Execution into Mavuin to get the Flag FV Ruleset would allow you to sell them in Bazaar, seeing as this isn't the case it was changed to no drop.<br>
<br>
The first petition I know of, would be the one I did 2 days before a PoJ trial was ever completed on FV when I saw a link in serverwide.graffe and recognized what would come to occur.  For those who don't know links show accurate no drop tag or not for the server viewing the link.<br>

UH ???<br>
<br>
I'll just say one thing about trials in POJ. I thought it was very clear but after all not that much<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>After a failed attempt you can start the quest immediatly again but after a success you have to wait a period greater than 30 min before you can do it a second time. &lt;-- this time is unknown to me but greater than 30min.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
My guess.. Prime Executionner Vathoch, ending NPC of the Trial of execution, is a 55+ mob, so his corpse will decay in 30 minutes. Get the point or do I need to develop ?<br>
<br>
<br>
And now for the bunch of retards (yes, I do lose patience) that keep saying Reso didn't do trials...<br>
<br>
5 of us have been handed a droppable mark to get POV/PoS flag. It was the reason we started petitionning this.<br>
<br>
Reso DID spent most of the evening do trials again and again. Most of us were in Tribunals room, waiting for their turn. Some of us were keeping the way to Mavuin clear. I spent a good part of the night leading people betweent he 3 major spots of PoJ, that is Entrance, tribunals room and Mavuin cell, and this for a long time since I was in first group to finish trial that night. And I did this till way after my napping time, so that most Reso could access those planes.<br>
<br>
And before some random fucker starts saying I lie, here's an undeniable proof :<br>
<br>

And now, since I am in a talkative mood, the true story about how FnF got into Halls of Honor:<br>
<br>
I don't know how thoroughly Reso folks have explored HoH, but let me tell you that even the members of the Bataillon of Marr have to perform certain bodily functions. For this purpose, they need toilets. These toilets are, in order to do any good, connected to an extensive sewer system below the plane. One of the intrepid explorers of FnF happened to find an access to these sewers in Plane of Disease, and after a lengthy and only moderately pleasant trip, he emerged through a toilet and zoned into HoH. Can you imagine the surprise? Of course we were aware of the fact that Reso would soon petition the sheer existence of something like sanitary installations in a place like HoH, so we decided to use the opportunity as long as we could. We dragged the majority of our members through the smelly pipes and tunnels to get them flagged.<br>
<br>
We are proud of our accomplishment.<br>
<br>
And there is absolutely no need to throw shit at us. Really.<br>

Yer right....I dont care for the guild FnF.  Doesnt mean im out to get you or anything.<br>
<br>
There are people I like in FnF.  A couple I even tolerate.  A bunch I ignore and a few Id rather beat down in the arena than share the same air with.<br>
<br>
I am competative.  I am loyal.  I am probably more rottweiller than most when it comes to my attitude.  I am not a leader but if I was ever made one the only spot I would fit appropriately would be Enforcer/ Sergeant at Arms.  I dont make many appologies.<br>
<br>
On our boards when the notion is made to play nicey nice with FnF ....Im the first one to step up and gripe.  It isnt hard for me to make the choice.  Go back over the last year and read the posts your guild has made.  Look at all the crap that has been thrown our way....and some thrown back yours.  FnF isnt about playing nice....its about being number 1.  You have said it all along.  Resolution wants to be and is number 1 in my book at least and probably a lot of others too.  IMHO I think FnF would do anything they could to be stepping on our heads and climbing right over the top of us....even pretending to play nice.<br>
<br>
I for one, wont fall for that crap.  I am not a lemming.  I rattle the cage so much Rollen gets irritated with me weekly I think.  I am sure a few others do.  Hence the name &quot;The Hated One.&quot;  But I sure as hell would rather a few of my guildmates didnt like me than let your bunch con us into some lame as friendly relationship that lets you tread on us again.  Not if I can prevent it.<br>
<br>
So yeah....no hugs for you.<br>

I still need 12 to do the stupid maze quest dosnt do me much good to have the flag if I have no one to hunt with.  A bit off subject but, hey never know might get someone that wants to get flaged.  As for PoJ flag yes some folks got flag in Reso by having the mark hand to them affter I spend hour runing groups thru or buffing other groups to go thru, But I also know that we stop and CF ask us not to hand our mark and give marks to officers.  I spent the next few days sitting in PoJ running groups thru. (Bored silly) some times we fail other times we won.  We could have and should have ran the few folks that exploit mark thru as we were running so many thru the trials it wouldnt have matter.  So to say that when we went to take the dragon down we wouldnt have had enough is dreaming.  Yes we ask folks to help us on dragon I even ask if I could invite some of my friends no less.  I dont think less of it and I dont think you think less of getting in to NToV with the help of AS memebers ( and wait I like AS I even raid with them).  Anyway water under the bridge the rule key will be fixed or it wont be fixed dosnt really matter.

When I posted the % flagged, it was accurate.  Clearly between the time I logged off that night and got back from work the following day, that number basically reversed.  If people want to trade the key and get flagged, to spite this thread, to avoid getting left behind for a period of time, to see a new zone, or simply because they can, well it's difficult to stop them.<br>
<br>
Reghar - 1 key, 2 keys, 4 keys, 10 keys...any amount of keys less than having a full raid force keyed, the point is the same.<br>
<br>
Fuvi - entertaining and partially accurate, I wouldn't expect you to lose your bias.  As for analogies, just because you feel &quot;the best analogies involve sex&quot; doesn't make yours special.  And don't mention brake lines because your decision to manipulate the context of that particular analogy and word-pick is your only excuse for using it in your arguement.  And I don't like Dawson's Creek...but like being subjected to the sound of a jackhammer on a regular basis, you learn to tolerate it...although Pacey is kinda charming with his goatee now.  Dawson's forehead, however, makes him look like Uli's brother =oP<br>
<br>
Ichi - we have folks who feel the same way you do.  You guys are the folks you see covered head to toe in body paint, wearing Viking hats and holding &quot;DIE [insert football team]!&quot; signs when you watch the Grey Cup (okay...who watches the Grey Cup) or the Superbowl.  Some are serious in their disdain and some are not so serious.  However the net effect is to propagate these tensions...and I'm not so sure that it's an entirely bad thing.<br>
<br>
Some reflection and conversation with Rollen has lead me to reconsider how people take &quot;competitve ribbing&quot; however.  When FnF was on top and Reso was climbing for the brass ring, there was a lot of &quot;shit-talkin&quot; (the primal bragging, Reso Trak Attempt pic, etc...) that people still bring up to this day.  If some folks took that to heart and feel that payback is in order, well I guess they're within their rights to do so.  Likewise if people are just going through the motions of &quot;nyah nyah we're number 1!&quot;, tune into any sporting event to see the same thing.  The question is, do we ever really want to and are we williing, to move beyond that?<br>
<br>
Rollen and I have been talking for a long time as friendlies...we even go camping occassionally.  He knows and I know what we both would like to see happen.  I respect his confidance such that he can intimate those details to Reso's members as he feels necessary, if it even matters any more.  The &quot;Ssra Accord&quot; was a nice step forward - shit it's just an example of basic courtesy that both our guilds were lacking.  Reso took the first step, and despite the contents of this thread, I hope it's something that FnF can return in kind when the opportunity presents itself.  While I'm still burned at Rollen's nuptuals, the vision he and I share is for both guilds to enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
As for the droppable key issue:  I hope that in light of all the fervent petitions, SOE devotes a *little* bit of time to this server and fixes it.  And I don't mean some coder getting an email that states &quot;Make HoH key no drop asap&quot;-  I mean flagging all keys that are not intended to be droppable as no-drop so that we can move onto a new topic for flaming.<br>
<br>
BTW Fuvi, would you consider renaming Fusoe to Fukey?  I'll foot the bill.<br>
<br>
