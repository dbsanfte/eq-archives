Kelisk watched from the old balcony of Kurn's tower as a lumbering Burynai threw itself onto a young wolf in the field below, tearing its claws into flesh and bone and scale.  Survival of the fittest was the law in the wilds of Kunark, and offenders-like the wolf-paid a dear price.  So it had been for thousands of years, ever since the first primitive beasts had drunk in the air of its shores, before the God-chosen races were seeded across the lands, and so it was now.  The cycle went ever on and on, a constant reminder of the fleetingness of life, especially in these barren wastes.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
  <br>
Kelisk pulled his grappling hook and rope up next to him and aimed to throw at the next highest balcony.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Burynai had barely sunk its teeth into its kill before the ripping pain of a Scourgetail scorpion's sting tore into its back.  It shrieked once, sensing the last grains of its time slip away, and let out a final gurgling growl as the Scorpion withdrew its sting, spilling blood across the parched ground.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kelisk threw the hook twice, missing by inches both times, then re-steadied his grip and threw again, catching the hook on a stone railing.  He tugged at the line to test its hold and, once satisfied, swung out onto the wall and begun to climb.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>From the field came the charging cry of two young warriors of Cabilis as they ran at the Scourgetail, their blades glinting in the hot sunlight for just seconds before tearing into the chitin of the monstrous arachnid.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He'd passed two more balconies, and Kelisk was one climb from the roof of the ancient tower.  He set down his packs and took a long draw of Bloodwater from a flask at his belt, then stopped to gaze around the small platform.  Like the others, there was a door to the inner tower, and like the others, it was long since sealed with magics too powerful for him to break.  He'd often wondered what lay in the upper floors of the tower: none had passed the barriers at the fifth floor since many years before his hatching.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Looking down, he could just make out the tiny forms of the two young warriors cheering over the massive Scorpion's husk.  But as they sat to rest, a savage Stalker of one of the scaled wolf packs creeped behind them, preparing to pounce. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kelisk twirled his arms in the air in intricate motions, whispering incantations in a tongue lost to all but the Mystics and Patriarchs of Cabilis.  As if from nowhere, jagged spears of ice began to form over his head, condensing from what little moisture the air held. With a swift motion, he sent the spears careening down at the Stalker.  It let out a pitiful yelp as the huge shards pinned it, still living, to the dirt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sometimes, the cycle had to be interrupted.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He spun the hook in the air a final time and threw it, snagging it on the battlements of the tower.  After ensuring that a small leather pouch on his back was secure he made the final ascent and pulled himself onto the roof, where a fire and a tent waited for him.  He'd camped here for six days now, having found the place to somehow ward away the dreams.  A bizarre irony, he recognized, that a tower pf death should bring him peace!<br>
&quot;But if it works...&quot; he muttered to himself.  He peered into a small pot boiling over the fire and ladled out a mouthful of rabbit stew, tasting it delicately.  It wasn't quite done, but Kelisk would have eaten it cold, so was his appetite.  <br>
<br>
When he had slurped the last drops of the stew, he walked to the edge and squinted down to the base of the tower, straining to see movement in the fading light.  He fixed his eyes on a form on the ramp to the tower's main entrance, which by its colors was unmistakably a Bandit of the Forsaken.  After gauging its position as best he could with his eyes, he flung the pot down, and grinned as it rang off of the bandit's head with a hollow crack.  It felt strange to Kelisk to smile, lately.  He shrugged and walked back to the center of the roof.<br>
<br>
Next, he fixed the tent so that it was pitched over the fire, and the smoke filled it quickly, billowing out of the small chimneyhole in a stream that rose high into the evening sky.  Kelisk stripped off all of his armor and ducked inside in only his basic wraps.  The smoke flooded his eyes and lungs, burning him inside, and Kelisk did all he could to crouch next to the fire in the tent-turned oven and take the small pouch from his back, setting it next to him.  From inside, he pulled a handful of white powder and crushed leaves of some sort.  The Prime Hierophant of Cabilis would be annoyed to find some of this mixture gone, but Kelisk found it an acceptable risk.  He sifted it through his hands for a moment, then tossed it into the flames.  For a moment they glowed white, then they faded to a shimmering black and slowed, so that they moved visibly, slowly, like a dream.  The last of their smoke flowed out of the tent, and Kelisk took a deep breath of the cold fresh air.<br>
<br>
Then he reached back into the pouch and closed his hand on something larger than his hand, and hard as stone.  He pulled it out and gazed at it, turning it in his claws. It was the half-rotted skull of the Hierophant Zildrax Shathrais. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelisk>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil<br>Look out! ...Rar!<br>New lizard Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 864<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/03 6:46:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/CyrusVI/fullsize/keliskpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning</span><hr size=1> The fire churned before Kelisk angrily, as if awaiting some vital need that he had clumsily delayed. It was only too correct, though. The skull was here... the fire sensed it, felt it, tasted the traces of the spirit that had departed it not too long ago. It was no longer a simple flame, but something alive, and it was hungry. <br>
<br>
Kelisk looked closer at the hollow head and squinted his eyes, imagining the pale grey of the scales over the orange eyes that had held wisdom and pride, sadness and anger. He put the tip of a claw to his tongue and then placed it on the cold forehead of the skull, slowly dragging it over the exposed bone, scratching an intricate rune in its surface. He'd have never imagined before that his skill in carving bone would be useful--he'd scratched many things into the slaves of Ifrinn's skeletal slaves before for amusement, but this was hardly amusing. If he made the slightest error, it could not be done again. So, he would not. He carefully snapped a dry scale from the rotting flesh still hanging from the bone, and ran its edge over the lines of the rune, crumbling it into the grooves. There... perfect. Or so he hoped. There was nothing he could do about it now, though. He continued the strange ritual.<br>
<br>
Thrusting the skull into the air to catch the last cold rays of the sun as it sunk below the horizon, Kelisk shouted into the air loudly, his voice reaching out across the field. It had to be strong. Confident. And so, Kelisk put more breath into it as he stared into the sockets of Zildrax's eyes. On the ground below, several creatures and broodlings looked about for the source of the strange, faint voice, but could not determine its whereabouts. Not that Kelisk would have cared if they had. It was too late to worry about being found out. He moved his lips and tongue as he belted his voice out, chanting in a tongue known to few but the Iksar spiritists, and then threw his hands down, sending the skull flying into the flames, which caught it softly and began to ooze around it as if to caress its form. <br>
<br>
Kelisk leaped back onto the battlement and contorted his body in the ancient dance that he had prepared himself for, swooping his arms and tail in wide circles and jerking his head in all directions as he spun dangerously on the edge of the tower roof. Finally, he tossed his head back loosely and pulled his arms back to his chest, gathering spiritual mana from all around him, surrounding himself with it, burning in the pain of its energy until it completely enveloped him. Then, he pushed his arms forward quickly and it flowed from him into the fire. <br>
<br>
The skull was released from the black ooze of the flames and spun into the air, sparks flying in all directions from its surface. The mana mingled with the flames for a moment, then took them in, the two energies becoming one as they began to take shape. Legs grew from the mass of energy, and arms, and the rest, until a blurry humanoid mass stood several feet in the air, the skull suspended in the lump that might be a head. As it stopped spinning to fae toward Kelisk, the body rapidly defined itself: the pudgy lumps grew smoother and thinner, giving the appearance of smooth muscles and flesh, which became crossed with bumps like scales. The toes and fingers seperated and the tips sharpened to become claws. The tail became long and pointed, and the head grew a snout and rows of spines. As Kelisk watched, the shape became an Iksar. Lastly, transparent threads and materials seemed to weave themselves around the body: a thick belt and long flowing cloth spun themselves over the waist and leather and bone clung to its chest and shoulders. Then, the ghostly figure, roughly one and one half times Kelisk's size, was complete, its eyes unfocused and its head rolling slowly on its shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Zildrax?&quot; Kelisk whispered, stepping cautiously onto the flat roof.<br>
<br>
The head slowly stopped and looked up, tilted curiously to one side. Its eyes glowed a dull orange.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kelisk Mae'Lokh</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Chancellor of Skathris Ven'Sho--Patriarch of Cabilis</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=355953&quot;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Inspect Kelisk?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zildrax>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 676<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/03 9:35:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=657.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Summoning</span><hr size=1> He had never felt so serene, so empty, so untouched and unaffected by any and everything. There were no sounds, no images, no sensations…just endless emptiness and nothingness, he might have been bored, but emotions, too, were no longer there. Just a faint sensation of peace. Was this death? He almost wondered, but the desire to know the answer was lacking, and the question faded away. It seemed to last an eternity, this empty quietness, almost like a dream, but far more enveloping. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, in the distance, he heard the faintest of noises. A whisper, perhaps the wind, passing from one place to the next, but it was enough to disturb his spirit. To break the endless serenity, to remind him of the other world. He was restless now, he did not want to be here. He wasn’t conscious, his thoughts wouldn’t take shape or come together in any sensible manner, but now he longed to be alongside his people. Not here. He did not want to spend eternity asleep in this place, no, it was selfish and wasteful of his spirit to be here. He longed to suffer alongside his people, to aid them in whatever way he could, or even to watch futilely as they fought to their doom. Anything besides, this. <br>
<br>
He heard the whisper again now, this time louder. He attempted to look around for where it was coming from but found he had no body, no eyes, and nowhere to look. But he felt something calling him, and he longed to follow it’s faint voice. But how can he follow a voice coming from no direction, when he has no form? A unusual dilemma, indeed, he thought. Again, he heard the unintelligible whisper , this time much louder, and this time it awoke his memories. He remembered what he looked like, what it was like to feel, it came flowing back into his mind, and he felt himself being pulled away from the serene, empty place. Colors and shapes swirled around him, blurry and distorted, his memories and emotions coming back all at once. He felt as if he was awakening from a thousand dreams and being torn through all of them. Then, the dream broke. In a horrifying shriek of anguish and pain, the empty, serene world shattered with a brilliant flash of light. <br>
<br>
He was conscious now, he thought, but he felt strange. It was not as he remembered, and yet, it seemed very familiar. Everything he saw was distorted, and yet it was slowly taking shape. Around him, he heard endless whispers and voices, the voices of spirits. The wind, the earth, the dead, and countless others. Perhaps if he was alive, the voices would have driven him insane, but now, they didn’t bother him at all. His own form took shape, and he gazed at himself, right through himself. He seemed to be transparent now, but he still held the shape of an Iksar, thankfully. Perhaps it was just from memory or desire he held this shape currently, but nonetheless, he was proud of it. <br>
<br>
He turned his eyes upwards, into the bright, blurry world. It looked very familiar, it was at the top of Kurn’s Tower. And yet things…looked different. He saw things that he knew he hadn’t seen before, he could see the spirits and the effects they had on this place. He could feel their emotions and their thoughts, and while they were confusing, each second they seemed to become more clear. Looking past them, he saw another, one who’s spirit was still bound to a form of the living. He looked at it curiously, trying to focus his gaze and discern who it was. He had not quite adjusted to this new form. <br>
<br>
“…Zildrax?” The live bound one said, and he recognized the voice, as well as his own name. It was Kelisk. The world became much clearer and sharper now, and for the moment he blocked the other spirits from sight, focusing entirely on his old friend.<br>
