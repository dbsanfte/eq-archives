That want to make guild's that do not lvl and just kinda run around talking in character all day. I do not understand this???. I am a long time player of dungeons and dragons and many roll playing games of many sorts. Roll Playing game's whole purpose is to gain in str and item's and take on bigger and badder monster's. And the history of your character is the feats you have acomplished. I do not understand these people who just want to make a history for thier character (without actually ever doing any of it) and never acomplish anything. Wouldn't they be better served on Mirc chat or the like. <br>
<br>
I supose it wouldn't be so bad exept for the fact that most of these people are the same one's that /rude anyone in anything but leather armor for being a D00D. The so called &quot;Roll player's&quot; are really giving Roll Playing a bad name. Ive noticed alot of the server kind of backing away from roll playing because of the opinion's and coments posted on this board by the &quot;Roll player's&quot;. I think roll playing is a good thing, In fact I encourage it.<br>
<br>
 I guess what I would really like to know is.... where dose this mentality that Rollplaying has nothing to do with lvling and getting good gear come from? Your gear IS your character. It is a testament of where he has been and what he has done. It's somthing to be proud of and carry with honor. And how someone can make snide coment's and call someone esle a D00D and then pat themselfs on the back for being a good rollplayer is beyond me.<br>

See, it's fine to run around and talk in character and all, but leveling is a must too, it's not like the 'the roleplayers' are like, &quot;Hey I don't wanna do anything but run around and do my character thing&quot;. No, the thing is that they don't want 'd00d' and 'l33t' people running around like, &quot;|-|3j j00! \v/|-|47'5 up?&quot; like I see a lot. <br>
<br>
Another thing is that this is supposed to be a roleplaying server, if people wanna be excessively OOC then they can relocate to other servers so that people that want to roleplay can do it with other people that want to. It's not like I'm saying &quot;You have to be In char. all the time&quot;, but the fact remains that this server was created for roleplayers to get out and actually roleplay, something that they might not have been able to do on their previous servers.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of reasons that some people complain about the 'd00d's and how people complain about the 'roleplayers', and I can see both sides. But I can take the roleplayers side more, because I believe that even if it's a 'roleplaying preferred' server, people should atleast try to roleplay, and not just see who can get to the highest level the fastest. If you do so, that's great because you're all powerful and you 'ownz everyone' or something like that. But if you do, do so in character, it makes the game play a lot more fun.<br>
<br>
Okay, I think I'm quite done. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I've also played a ton of D&amp;D and I've played poor fighters who hunt for glory/revenge/power and I've played characters that come from wealthy backgrounds and have more stuff.<br>
<br>
Sarhea's goal(now especially) is to be the strongest warrior in Norrath.  And she's a firm believer in proving that strength by whatever means necessary. She's got some really great gear(and some junky stuff*laughs at the thought of her tattered shoulderpads *), and it's all good to her because it gives her an edge over other fighters.<br>
<br>
 But I also know of characters who won't take squat, because their character is too proud etc.  <br>
<br>
I agree that the kinds of people you're speaking of suck as bad as the &quot;d00ds&quot;, and sadly, I've seen more of them than I have the &quot;d00ds&quot;, but I still give the same advice.../ignore stops my good time from being interrupted. <br>
<br>
although I'll RP with anyone who talks to me, whether they give it back or not. And to those who won't /d me because Sar's outgeared your character.....I win.*laugh*<br>

<br>
You don't have to understand this, HoracioFV.  All you have to do is accept that that is how they wish to play, and leave them alone (or play along if you like).<br>
<br>
In a similar way, I do not understand why people come to the one roleplaying server EverQuest has and then choose not to roleplay, but I accept that some people enjoy that for whatever reason, and I leave them alone to play amongst themselves as they like. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 381<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/10/02 3:50:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rollplaying Guilds without lvling?</span><hr size=1> Its beginning...<br>

<br>
My highest level character in the one my partner ran  for over a decade (and still runs online) was a 10th level Druid, followed by a 9th level Paladin.  Since every magic item in his campaign was unique (for example, there was only one +1 short sword), having any magic items was extraordinarily rare.  The aforementioned Paladin decided to have her holy blade created by her temple--and it worked out so that the blade she wound up with fit her persona perfectly.<br>
<br>
The focus shifted from who can do the most damage (&quot;hack-n-slash&quot;) to roleplaying, being in-character, and so forth.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that EverQuest is only about smashing monsters and getting loot.  If that were the case, why bother with things like faction, with some of the sometimes-impressive scenery (like the mysterious goddesses carved in the mountains in Eastern Karanas), and with story-based quests?  I think the structure is there to roleplay around; whether you choose to ignore that or not is up to you.<br>

And it seem's to me that so many of you people have gotten it stuck in your head. That if you strive to attain these thing's you are all of a sudden struck down with the almighty d00d stick and forever lost as a rollplayer. I bet if alot of the people like this (shin im talking to you!) would just loose that attitude. You know the one im talking about (I am rollplaying d00d's must die! attitude). Everyone as a whole on friona vie and this board in particular would have a much better time. <br>
<br>
      I supose if you have played the game for a long time and you have seen all there is to see and you just want to play your &quot;roll&quot; and be left alone that's fine. Leave everyone else alone also if that is your intent. But for people that havn't, It seem's like you are missing so much. I see new things every day in everquest alot of wich are just icredible as far as a game goes. I sure wouldn't want a small minded preconcived idea that if I lvl and get the phat lewtz im gonna be damaged good's holding me back from experiancing those things.<br>
<br>
    And Robin you make it sound so unapealing &quot;smashing the monsters and getting the phat lewtz&quot;. That is what adventure is about! in Dungeons and Dragons and Everquest. You go explore and find new and interesting monster's and KILL THEM. And eventually by default you lvl up because of it. And from there you move on to the next bigger badder thing and defete IT. Story line and who your character are go hand and hand with this. You make it sound like the two oppose each other some way. They do not and if you played dungeons and dragons for 10 year's and never killed anything more than a kobold, why not just go play the sim's are dating or somthing just as drab as that? And as for seeing the things beetween the lines and the carvings in the stone.. That is part of the whole picture the whole grand scheme of things. People that lvl up and have fun killing things are not blind to that, as some would think. I certainly am not and think it is awsome the depth that was put into this game. But you can have both.. thats what im trying to open everyone's eye's to. Why dose it have to be split down the middle d00d's/rollplayers<br>
<br>
have you ever taken a d00d aside and tryed to show him your finding's. And show him the the thing's you have uncovered. Or do you just /rude /ignore him and walk off? destroying his opinion of rollplayers and forever mabey blinding his eye's to the thing's that you so covet?<br>
<br>
All im really trying to say is that if everyone looked at thing's from a different perspective. The d00d's mabey wouldn't seem so bad. And the Rollplay Jerkoff's wouldn't seem like such aloof im better than everyone stuckup's. And everyone that fall's in the gray inbeetween that just want to play the game wouldn't have to listen to both ends of the spectrum complain about the other.<br>
<br>

EverQuest was designed for people to level up in. Unless you're just shelling out 10 bucks a month to look at a 3d model saying, &quot;Hail, Soandso! Would thou care to walk across this open field with me?&quot; If so, go right ahead.<br>
<br>
If you just want to roleplay, though, and don't mind graphics, play a freakin' MUSH or something. That's ten bucks less your wasting, and you don't level up there. Other than that, EverQuest is MADE to level up in and kill things. Roleplaying is the side part. MUSHs are made to roleplay in. End of story right there. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

How does he interact with others?  etc. etc.  It's not the &quot;what&quot; that makes it RP, it's the &quot;why&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/10/02 9:27:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=347.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: EQ is a game</span><hr size=1> Do you actually know of a RP guild that has no leveling as part of its charter?

Interesting views.<br>
 <br>
Do I kill things? Yes. Frequently. A lot.<br>
 <br>
Do I level a lot? No. I don't.<br>
 <br>
I help allies. I swat a LOT of greenies. I kill things simply because my Harm Touch is back and I want to hear something scream and die in front of me.<br>
 <br>
I also do things that don't involve killing or questing. This means I don't have a steady flow of experience. I'm at a decent level (31) right now. No hurry to 60 here. I'm having fun roleplaying-as opposed to roll-playing,which is a good slang term for letting the dice do all the role-playing for you.<br>
 <br>
So yes,roleplayers will level slower than non-roleplayers. Very simply,if one does nothing but what levels one up,you WILL level up faster. Stop to smell the roses,as opposed to hunt-kill-loot-repeat...in other words,to interact with anyone in any detail past finding the next things to hunt-kill-loot-repeat...and you simply won't do as much towards leveling up.<br>
 <br>
Roleplaying does not equal not leveling-however,as a means to gain levels quickly it stinks on ice because it discards the most effective method of using one's time to do so.<br>
 <br>
Which is why most roleplayers find d00dspeak annoying. It's a glaring sign that the person is only interested in the fastest and non-creative way of doing things...and that's just not RPing squat,people. It's,to quote someone else here- &quot;Laziness&quot;.<br>

I have however met people that looked at my gear and made rude commets like &quot;I wish my big brother would give me gear like that&quot;.

I don't speak d00d and wouldn't know where to begin doing it. Are there actually honestly people out there that talk like that? Imho it's nothing more than a big myth.

As long as you do that you can play however the hell you want. You talk like a d00d you're going to be ignored and the guild you join will be branded jackass along with you. I'm all for that, it's a good check and balance mechanism. On the other servers you are laballed for being a lootwhore, or whatever ... here you are labelled for acting like a jackass and ruining the fantasy for others. If you intend a long stay here you'll learn how to behave or not. <br>

I find it very disturbing when people intone things like &quot;this is the role playing server&quot; and then blanket everyone else with a derivisve label (d00d) who does not agree without reservation to everything they say.<br>
<br>
If you want to level slowly and kill green things, have fun. This is fine by me. If you want to sit in an inn and make up stories about your pixel representation of a simulated fantasy character, wonderful. You pay your money, you can play the game in your own way.<br>
<br>
However, there are some of us who came here to do things that we could not do on other servers. The unique aspects of this server make  it possible. I have been able to do so many quests here that are camped on every other server. My level 34 warrior has almost all his crafted armor. He has done numerious weapons quests. I have helped guidlmates do many of their quests. On the other servers that I have been on the word Everquest was a misnomer, here it is possible.<br>
<br>
So, to all of your HURPS out there (Hardcore Uber Role Players): This is a special server with different rules. One of the aspects of this server is that it is roleplaying preferred. That is only one of the things that make it special. I respect and defend your right to peersue role playing situations. I pledge never to intentionally do anything to rob you of your right. However, I also would like you to understand that others came to this server specifically because of its uniqueness and have the same rights as you. I also expect that you will give other players the same considerations that you are demanding.<br>
