2003-05-02 What's New in the Magazine<br>
<br>
Volume 9, number 3 (May/June 2003) of the Annals of Improbable <br>
Research (AIR) is a special EVERYTHING issue. Highlights include:<br>
<br>
&lt;&gt; &quot;Kansas Is Flatter Than a Pancake,&quot; by  Mark Fonstad, William <br>
Pugatch, and Brandon Vogt. The co-authors present empirical <br>
evidence that this is so.<br>
<br>
&lt;&gt; &quot;Good News for Guys,&quot; by Stephen Black. The author, an eminent <br>
psychologist, discovers evidence in historical scientific <br>
literature that men are in for a most unexpected surprise, should <br>
they choose to be.<br>
<br>
&lt;&gt; &quot;Size, Timing, Everything, and Nothing,&quot; by S. Drew. A summary <br>
of the very best documented research on all four of these topics.<br>
<br>
..and much more.<br>
<br>
The issue is now at the printers, and will be arriving at <br>
subscribers' doorsteps very soon now.<br>

<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
2003-05-03 Wide-Ranging Curiosity<br>
<br>
The May/June issue of AIR also includes a special, deliciously <br>
detailed article about the work of a scientist who may well be the <br>
best and truest modern example of a prolific renaissance person.<br>
<br>
We are also publishing this article on the AIR web site, as a <br>
special ten-part series. The introduction and Part 1, together <br>
with a special index of topics explored by the researcher, will <br>
appear on Monday, May 26. Subsequently, a new part will appear <br>
every Monday and every Wednesday, until the entire article is <br>
present in all its glory. The parts can be labeled as follows:<br>
<br>
Part 1 -- The Early Years<br>
Part 2 -- An Approach to Stop Lights<br>
Part 3 -- Matters of the Mall<br>
Part 4 -- Time Hangs Heavy?<br>
Part 5 -- Motorists' Use of Sirens<br>
Part 6 -- Out Which Way<br>
Part 7 -- The Celebrated Brussels Sprouts<br>
Part 8 -- Caps, Chapel Attendance, and Perceptions of Ground Beef<br>
Part 9 -- Heavy Going, With Integrity and Gloves<br>
Part 10 -- Women in Vans ...and... Into the Future<br>

2003-05-04 Icthyology en Hotel<br>
<br>
Icthyologists who travel no longer need anguish that the hours <br>
they spend in a hotel will be &quot;down time&quot; in which they are unable <br>
to continue studying fish.<br>
<br>
Investigator Pete Shoemaker alerted us to the scientific <br>
opportunities offered by the Hotel Monaco in Chicago. The hotel's <br>
web site,<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://ratesandavailability.com/10229343.htm">ratesandavailability.com/10229343.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> , presents technical <br>
details:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The Hotel Monaco Chicago offers travelers a temporary pet <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  -- a complimentary goldfish. A companion goldfish may be <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  requested when making a reservation or at check-in and <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  is delivered to the guest's room for their stay. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Goldfish care and feeding is administered by the <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  trained hotel staff under the guidance of Chicago's <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Shedd Aquarium, a partner of the Hotel Monaco Chicago.<br>
<br>

2003-05-05 EU Chocolate Directive<br>
<br>
The science world is once again agonizing over the EU Chocolate <br>
Directive. <br>
<br>
The melodrama could come to a head this very week, on May 21 and <br>
22, in York, England, at the Society of Chemical Industry's <br>
conference on &quot;CHOCOLATE, CHOCOLATE FATS AND THE EU CHOCOLATE <br>
DIRECTIVE.&quot; <br>
<br>
Details are at <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.soci.org/SCI/events/details.jsp?eventID=EV267">www.soci.org/SCI/events/d...ntID=EV267</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
We, like nearly all other persons, organizations, and other human-<br>
affiliated entities, wish the participants well.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
2003-05-06 Gibb &amp; Rooker and the Comitology of Chocolate<br>
<br>
The British Parliament's most recent take on the Chocolate <br>
Directive, as expressed at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990707/text/90707w07.htm">www.parliament.the-statio...707w07.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> , is <br>
revealing. It consists of the following terse exchange of views <br>
between a Mr. Gibb and a Mr. Rooker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  * * *<br>
<br>
MR. GIBB: To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food <br>
if he will list the European Commission's objections to the <br>
proposed comitology provisions of the proposed EU Chocolate <br>
Directive.<br>
<br>
MR. ROOKER: The Commission objected to a part of the proposed <br>
Directive which limited its powers to make technical changes to <br>
the law. However, I am pleased to say that a new Presidency <br>
compromise has now received Commission support and I am hopeful <br>
that a Common Position will be achieved during the Finnish <br>
Presidency.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
2003-05-07 Comitology for the Masses<br>
<br>
We have received several letters asking, &quot;What is comitology?&quot;<br>
<br>
Comitology is a highly technical matter. Rather than attempt a <br>
&quot;dumbed down&quot; answer, we refer all inquiries to the experts: the <br>
European Parliament. The European Parliament's current take on <br>
comitology is expressed at <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/dors/oeil/en/inter51.htm">wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/dor...nter51.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> . This <br>
view, of course, updates the European Parliament's prior view, <br>
which can be still be seen at <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/cig/g4000c.htm">europa.eu.int/scadplus/le...g4000c.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Alternatively, one could consult Mr. Gibb and/or Mr. Rooker of the <br>
British Parliament.<br>
<br>
To sum up: if you have questions about comitology, please do not <br>
direct them to us.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
2003-05-08 Unexplosively Explosive, or Vice Versa<br>
<br>
It has been variously said that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  (a) the most interesting science is that which <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  EITHER cures OR causes problems<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  (b) the most interesting science is that which <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  BOTH cures AND causes problems<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  (c) the most interesting science is that for which <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  it is not obvious whether it will cure problems, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  or cause them, or both.<br>
<br>
Investigator Brian Josephson has alerted us to what may be an <br>
example comprising all three varieties. That example is:<br>
<br>
&quot;Destruction of Nuclear Bombs Using Ultra-High Energy Neutrino <br>
Beam,&quot; Hirotaka Sugawara, Hiroyuki Hagura, and Toshiya Sanami, <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0305062">arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0305062</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> . The authors explain their <br>
work as follows: <br>
<br>
&quot;We have shown that it is possible to eliminate the nuclear bombs <br>
from the surface of the earth utilizing the extremely high energy <br>
neutrino beam. When the neutrino beam hits a bomb, it will cause <br>
the fizzle explosion with 3% of the full strength. It seems that <br>
it is not possible to decrease the magnitude of the explosion <br>
smaller than this number at this stage. It is important to <br>
decrease this number to destroy bombs safely. We are not sure what <br>
this means when the plutonium or uranium is used to ignite the <br>
hydrogen bomb. We may just break the bomb or may lead to a full <br>
explosion.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

2003-05-09 type oof<br>
<br>
Investigator (and LFHCfS member) Dennis McClain-Furmanski has been <br>
studying the flexible functionality demanded of certain U.S. <br>
government employees. He points to U.S. federal job announcement <br>
PAX-OC-0055, listed at <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://jsearch.usajobs.opm.gov/ftva.asp?OPMControl=IL7705">jsearch.usajobs.opm.gov/f...rol=IL7705</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> , which <br>
says exactly the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;The type oof specialized experience required will be <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  identified in  the individuao position deccription <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  submitted at the time a vacancy is to be filled.&quot;<br>
<br>
Investigator McClain-Furmanski translates this as meaning: &quot;We <br>
will tell you what experience you need in order to get the job <br>
when we hire you,&quot; and adds that &quot;The ornate spelling is, of <br>
course, just icing.&quot; The spelling is also a further indication of <br>
the afore-hinted functional flexibility required of the <br>
jobholders.<br>
<br>
Investigator McClain-Furmanski conducted a brief investigation, <br>
with this result: &quot;That quote from the job announcement appears on <br>
every engineering psychologist announcement I've looked at.&quot;<br>
<br>

 <br>
Special thanks and huzzahs to Forrest Schultz and Juliet Fox of <br>
the University of Wisconsin-Stout, who hoisted it up onto the web, <br>
to Bruce, Tal, and Julian Petschek who filmed and edited the <br>
video, and of course to all the winners and other participants in <br>
the ceremony. (Who, we have been asked, are those musical <br>
performers at the very beginning? They are none other than the <br>
Dresden Dolls, whose web site is at <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/dresden/">www.brainwashed.com/dresden/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> )<br>
<br>
The Ig Nobel Board of Governors are now digesting the splendid <br>
morass that is this year's nomination pile. If you would like to <br>
nominate someone for an Ig, please do so SOON. General info about <br>
the ceremony, past winners, etc., is, as always, at <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-top.html">www.improbable.com/ig/ig-top.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
This year's ceremony will occur on Thursday evening, October 2, at <br>
Harvard's Sanders Theatre. <br>

2003-05-14 Bulletin of Wire Ropes<br>
<br>
In answer to all those who have been asking us &quot;Can you lend us <br>
your back issues of the BULLETIN OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION <br>
FOR THE STUDY OF THE ENDURANCE OF WIRE ROPES?&quot; we say to one and <br>
all: Yes, we have no back issues of the BULLETIN OF THE <br>
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR THE STUDY OF THE ENDURANCE OF WIRE <br>
ROPES. We are, and always will be grateful to Richard Wakeford for <br>
making the BULLETIN's existence known to us, but we have never <br>
knowingly possessed  a copy, nor even seen one. <br>

2003-05-15 Another Near-DEATH-BY-DISSERTATION<br>
<br>
Investigator Hauke Reddmann is yet another individual who was <br>
nearly done in by his dissertation. He writes:<br>
<br>
&quot;When my father drove me to the printing shop (I have no car) he <br>
didn't take directional advice, and in the result had to turn left <br>
where it was forbidden, across a bus lane. A bus *was* coming. The <br>
bus had very good brakes, or I couldn't write you now.&quot;<br>

2003-05-16 Fingernail Water Limerick Contest<br>
<br>
We invite you to enter the first and last annual FINGERNAIL WATER <br>
LIMERICK COMPETITION, for the best (NEWLY composed!) limerick that <br>
elucidates this research report, which was brought to our <br>
attention by investigator Carl Einar Sjøgren:<br>
<br>
&quot;Determining Water Content in Human Nails with a Portable Near-<br>
Infrared Spectrometer,&quot; Mariko Egawa, Tadao Fukuhara, Motoji <br>
Takahashi and Yukihiro Ozaki, Applied Spectroscopy, vol. 57, no. <br>
4, 2003, pp. 473-8. The authors explain that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The water content of human nail plates was determined using <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  a portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer with an InGaAs <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  photodiode array detector.  [Data] were collected from 108 <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  cut nail plates with different relative humidity and in-vivo <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  from fingernails.<br>
<br>
RULES: Please make sure your rhymes actually do, and that your <br>
limerick at least pretends to adhere to classic limerick form.<br>
<br>
PRIZE: The winning poet will receive a free, nail-biting issue of <br>
the Annals of Improbable Research. Send entries (one entry per <br>
entrant) to:<br>

2003-05-17 RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT: Sticky, Unheard Paralysis<br>
<br>
Each month we select for your special attention a research report <br>
that seems especially worth a close read. Your librarian will <br>
enjoy being asked (loudly, so other library patrons can hear it) <br>
for a copy. Here is this month's Pick-of-the-Month:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;Earwax and Level of Paralysis,&quot; J.H. Frisbie and E.H. Zahn, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Spinal Cord, vol. 41, no. 4, April 2003, pp. 247-8. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  (Thanks to W. Bradley Jacobs for bringing this to our <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  attention.) The authors, who are at Department of Veterans <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Affairs Medical Center, West Roxbury, MA, and Harvard <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Medical School, Boston, MA, respectively, explain that:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &quot;Patients with C2 tetraplegia accumulate more earwax and <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  request its removal more often than patients with lower <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  levels of paralysis.&quot;<br>

2003-05-19 MAY WE RECOMMEND: Sweat on Meat, Mutt Math<br>
<br>
BALKING AND RENEGING<br>
&quot;Probabilistic Analysis of a Repairable System With Warm Standbys <br>
Plus Balking and Reneging,&quot; Kuo-Hsiung Wang and Jau-Chuan Ke, <br>
Applied Mathematical Modelling, vol. 27, 2003, pp. 327-36. (Thanks <br>
to Tom Roberts for bringing this to our attention.) The authors <br>
are at National Chung-Hsing University and National Taichung <br>
Institute of Technology, Taiwan ROC, respectively.<br>
<br>
ACCIDENTAL SMARTS<br>
&quot;Intelligence and Behavior and Motor Vehicle Accident Mortality,&quot; <br>
B.J. O'Toole, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. 22, June <br>
1990, pp. 211-21. The author, who is at Westmead Hospital, <br>
Australia, reports that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Risk of mortality was higher for men with lower scores <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  on the army intelligence test...<br>

MUTT MATH<br>
&quot;Do Dogs Know Calculus?&quot; Timothy J. Pennings, College Mathematics <br>
Journal, vol. 34, no. 3, May 2003, pp. 178-82. (Thanks to Barry <br>
Cipra for bringing this to our attention.) The author, who is at <br>
Hope College, explains that:<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  In all calculus books appears the problem of minimizing <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  the time to get to a point on the other side of a river, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  running part of the way and swimming the rest. Isomorphic to <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  this, if you are a dog, is the problem of minimizing the <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  time to get to a ball that your master has thrown into a <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  lake. The author has made measurements of how his dog <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  retrieves the ball and finds that he indeed seems to choose <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  the optimal path... [It] is possible that [the author's dog] <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Elvis chose paths that were actually BETTER than the <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  calculated ideal path.<br>
