<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Dark Elves were being pushed back, deep into their city. The noxious smoke of burning buildings obscured everything, and since it could not escape the underground caverns, choked the fighting soldiers.<br>
<br>
A Tier'Dal General stands in a tower overlooking the large stone bridge leading from the Foreign Quarter to the Commons. His staff is gathered behind him, whispering to one another in urgent, quite voices. The General, leaning on a window, watches a runner come sprinting down the bridge, and listens to him pound up the stone steps of the tower. The door opens then, and the messenger composes himself before delivering his message.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir, we have lost most of the foreign quarter. Our few remaining soldiers are trapped in the Hall of the Brutes, and they will not survive much longer. The enemy will soon march upon the Commons, m'Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
The General waves his hand, and the messenger bows and backs out of the room. The general's staff goes silent then, and turns to look at their commander. After a long moment, he speaks.<br>
<br>
&quot;We cannot hold them here. Tell our forces to retreat behind the Third Gate, we might be able to stop them there.&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the staffers looks shocked, and speaks up.<br>
<br>
&quot;But sir, abandon an entire city section? They will burn and kill everyone here, without our protection. And we'll lose the Cauldron and the Tower, they will not leave those standing.&quot;<br>
<br>
The general straigtens, and turns slowly about to stare at the other soldier.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you doubt my order, Colonel?&quot; the General glowers at the cowering officer &quot;Perhaps you should lead a squad and slow their advance.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other officer turns a sickly shade of blue, and stammers out a 'Yes Sir' befor turning and hurrying out of the room. The general turns back to the window and watches the hapless officer lead a small group of Tier'Dal warriors across the bridge and into the foreign quarter, where smoke is already seeping into the Commons.<br>
<br>
Screams can then be heard in the tower room, drifting from the first section of Neriak. After a long moment, three armored Tier'Dal soldiers appear, running down the long stone bridge towards the Commons. They make it about half way down, before a massive fireball appears out of the smoke above them and hurls down the bridge, impacting in the middle of the three soldiers and imolating them instantly.<br>
<br>
The Tier'Dal general jerks back from the window and hurridly issues orders to his officers. The blue skinned officers leave the tower room and begin pulling back their men from the gates below. Tier'Dal soldiers and paniced citizens begin streaming thruogh the streets of the Commons, fleeing towards the questionable safety of the Third Gate. Several citizens scream, and all run faster, as another fireball slams into the tower, where the officers had just been. Hungry flames begin licking down the stairs of the fortification, and the guards hurridly slam down the porticullis.<br>
<br>
The clang of the iron gates is still echoing hollowly thruogh the cavern when the first enemy soldiers begin appearing from the foreign quarter. Black armored soldiers march down the long bridge, with massive kite shields held in front of them, protecting them from arrows that do not fly. Upon the black shields is a bright crimson tear, the dreaded symbol of the Lust for Blood.<br>
<br>
The soldiers hurry down the path and reach the closed iron gates. They back away a moment as a black-robed mage, who had been standing at the back of the line, walks forward and carefully touches the rusting steel. The robed figure chants strange, searing words, and when he stands back, the gates glow bright red and disintegrate, falling away in a flash of burning heat.<br>
<br>
The faceless soldiers of the Lust for Blood rush into the small fortification and secure it. A single guard, caught unawares, falls quickly before three flashing blades. The soldiers, once having secured the gate, do not advance. They wait instead, carefully watching the approaches to from the city. <br>
<br>
From the smokey swirl obscuring the passageway to Neriak's Foreign Quarter steps a dread figure. Twin swords, glowing with magic enchantments, are clutched in the clawed hands of the most feared warrior in all of Norrath, the Baron Gore Bloodlust. Flickering light from the burning tower dances off the polished scales of the Iksar, making him appear demonic in form. The mighty warlord walks down the long bridge, followed closely by rank upon rank of his loyal soldiers. <br>
<br>
The Baron stops upon reaching Neriak's second defense point. Another black-armored soldier stands before him, this one bearing a small officers slash upon his helm, invisible to those who do not activly seek it. A gravelly voice emerges from behind the black mask obscuring his features.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have secured the gate, Baron, and encountered no organized resitance.  It looks like they have all fled to the Third Gate, to secure the better defenses there. What are you orders, m'Lord?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Iksar looks at the officer for a moment before answering &quot;Sweep thruogh the city, kill any survivors. I will lead the army against this last gate myself&quot;<br>
<br>
The officer nods, then turns towards his contingent of men. His gravelly voice shouts orders at them. &quot;By squads! Clear this sector up, no prisoners! For the Glory of Gore!&quot; His men salute the baron before turning and crashing into the city, kicking in doors and searching for any living Tier'Dal to eliminate.<br>
<br>
Gore waits for a moment before motioning to his remaining troops. He breaks into a quick-trot, and his massed Legion follows closely behind. A dozen other black robed figures join the one that destroyed the iron gate, and they in turn follow the armored soldiers.<br>
<br>
The men march past the Tower of the Spurned, where flames can be seen as more Lust for Blood soldiers burn the amassed books and tomes of magic stored there. An old mage, who had refused to leave his treasured books, tries to fight back with his magic but is quickly overwhelmed by an entire squad of faceless attackers.<br>
<br>
Just past the burning Tower is a monstrous building, blood oozing from its widows and the scent of fear and hate reeking from its walls. The Spires of Innoruuk, home of the Dark Elven clerics, stands empty, its inhabitants having also fled the onslaught. A single squad moves into the building, searching for any stragglers, as the rest of the Legion continues on.<br>
<br>
Inside the Third Gate, panic reigns. Dark Elven civilians shout and push, trying to get as deep into the city as possible. A line of Tier'Dal warriors, Dragoons loyal to the King, stand behind the gates, facing the road down which their enemies will come. The Tier'Dal general stands with the Dragoons, ignoring the paniced civilians as he considers his options. He turns to one of his officers and issues a crisp order.<br>
<br>
&quot;Close the gates, that'll buy us time and give us a chance to regroup for a counter attack.&quot;<br>
<br>
The officer nods and hurries into the massive gate towers, determined to see the order carried out. He moves deep into the towers and approaches the gate room, where stands the mechanism used to open and close the final defenses of Neriak. He shouts orders at the engineers standing there, and they hurridly begin activating the mechanism.<br>
<br>
But the machine, having been recently built by captured gnomish slaves and never before used, explodes. The three engineers, standing next to the machine, are killed instantly, but the officer is protected somewhat by his armor and manages to escape. He hurries back to the gate, limping slightly.<br>
<br>
The general turns and screams at his officer.<br>
<br>
&quot;What in the name of Innoruuk was that? Why isn't the gate coming down? Answer me, damn you!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The officer takes a deep breathe before replying.<br>
<br>
&quot;The mechanism, sir, it exploded. We have no way to lower the gates.&quot;<br>
<br>
The general pales visably but gives himself a shake and regains his composure. He turns to a nearby robed magic-user &quot;Get the royals out of here, I don't know if we can hold them back.&quot; The wizard nods and gestures at his companions, who hurry towards the dwelling of King Neythox Thex.<br>
<br>
At that moment, the forces of the Lust for Blood appear. Making an instant decision, the general orders his own troops forward, and with a shouted battle cry they advance upon their hated foes.<br>
<br>
The Baron Gore Bloodlust, seeing his enemies attacks, motions his own troops forward. He himself runs towards the dark elves, his eyes turning blood red as he throws himself into the fray. His soldiers follow with a shouted &quot;For the Glory of Gore!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The two armies meet with a resounding crash. The narrowed walls of the cavern only serve to compound the carnage. Dark Elven Dragoons, resplendid in their custom armors, desperatly try to drive back the black-armored soldiers of the Lust for Blood, whose race and even sex are obscured by their all concealing armor.<br>
<br>
Gore drives deep into the enemy ranks, killing dark elves left and right. None can stand before him, and his blades and scales are soon drenched in blood. A small phalanx of hand-picked Bloodlust troops follows closely behind him, carefully trained to support their commander. Together, they soon break thruogh the enemy lines, and come face to face with the Tier'Dal general and his staff. <br>
<br>
The Iksar commander of the Lust for Blood immediatly hurls himself at the enemy general, who barely manages to swing his shield up in time to deflect the blow. The two groups of soldiers stand back, watching the climactic struggle.<br>
<br>
The Tier'Dal general, although initially caught off-balance, is a seasoned veteran and manages to throw off the first attack of his enemy. But Gore does not relent, pressing the general back and working down his defenses. The dark elf, sensing his strength weaken, desperalty tries to defend himself, but in vain. Seconds after the start of the battle, the Tier'Dal falls, his armor shorn to bits by the savage fury of the Baron's assault. <br>
<br>
The general's men are disenheartened by the loss of their leader, and the overwhelming Bloodlust forces drive them towards the city, where the Baron and his best troops wait. Caught between the two forces, the Tier'Dal army is soon decimated. The soldiers of the Lust for Blood, their numbers cut nearly in half, then pour into the Third Gate, and attack the mass of civilians there. Hundreds fall, but many manage to skirt around the soldiers and flee the fallen city.<br>
<br>
The Baron himself marches deep into the city, headed for the Lodge of the Damned, where he knows he can find the Dark Elven King. But the Lodge is empty, its inhabitants having wielded dark magics to escape certain death. <br>
<br>
The Baron moves his troops back to the Neriak Commons, where they all gather so that he may address them. The Baron stands before his massed army, their swords covered in blood and their armor dented and shorn in places.<br>
<br>
He says nothing, staring at his men. Instead, he raises one of his swords high above his head, saluting his loyal soldiers. The men and women of the Lust For Blood in turn scream out their battle cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;For the Glory of Gore!&quot;<br>

I never met Gore, but heard nothing but stories of his prowess. <p>Serinity Di'Marcia<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Looks like you are way ahead of the pack in the warrior catagory. I have only met REALLY new players who have never heard of you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laaennie>Laaennie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/02 5:50:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mm..</span><hr size=1> Excellent story.<br>

I also must concurr with everyone else, those of us who grew up with Gore being around whether they had met him or just heard of him will never forget. I never actually &quot;met&quot; Gore but I remember the first time I heard of him. I was in my 20s in High Keep and he was killing the guards, I never saw him but just heard him. About a month later when I was in my 30s I saw Gore for the first time and I was in awe. His composure, speech, and everything about him was soo powerful. I may not have cared for him because he was evil but I greatly miss seeing him around Norrath and Luclin. Gore will always be in my memory.  <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=491453">Laennie Trueheart</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
