Blood and bone: Sitting in Judgement<br>
<br>
A glimpse of sunlight reflecting on metal was his saving grace. Moving with agility that was baffling for one of his size, Kulivan rolled forward and under the arc of the blood hungry blade. Sharp rock shards cut the exposed skin upon his face and arms as the sword cleaved half way into the boulder he had been resting against.<br>
<br>
The air was split by a maliciously evil laugh of glee. Hollow and desolate, that laugh was one of torture and things long dead. The undead abomination advanced towards him sword swinging again for a killing blow. This time Kulivan was ready. As the rust-pitted, but sturdy long-sword completed its path, Kulivan rolled backwards this time. As he connected with the frozen turf, his left leg snapped out in a powerful blow, laying the vengeful specter upon it’s back… a full 6 feet away. <br>
<br>
With a sigh of relief he got up and dusted himself off. “Bah, ‘tis gett’n to be too easy to dispatch your ilk!” He muttered to the still form on the snowy plain. “I best get my gear, night will be com’n soon, ‘an I’m hungry as an ice bear, I is.” He spoke to himself now, which is the bane of the lone adventurer and traveler’s all acrossed Norrath. The longing for the sound of a voice to accompany them. In most cases, they are left with only their thoughts.<br>
<br>
Resting on his haunches, the gigantic barbarian began sorting through his pack for something to eat. “By The Tribunal, I am weary of rations!” He exclaimed with frustration, he threw the iron rations acrossed the wind-swept pass. He instantly regretted his action. With an oath, he slung his pack over his massive shoulders and began to descend into the 15-foot chasm, in pursuit of his carelessly discarded food. <br>
<br>
Halfway down he heard death upon the wind. Carried on the icy-wind, licking his ears with promises of what fate would do to this foolish young adventurer, he shivered at the wicked cackle of the undead creature he left atop the lip of the chasm.<br>
<br>
Hollow orbs, glowing with infernal red damnation glared over the lip of the chasm. Kulivan’s blood ran as cold as the wind that was still whispering it’s dread desires to him. He clung there, half way down the chasm, paralyzed in terror beyond all reason. The fear crawled through his entreals, caressed his bowels and permeated his bones to their marrow. <br>
<br>
No thoughts of self-preservation exist in the undead. They are unliving, unthinking, and unfeeling abominations of existence. Their only driving force is a hatred of the living. With another blood-chilling cackle the creature stepped off the ledge, landing feet first upon Kulivan. Pieces of frozen rock and turf broke off in Kulivan’s grip sending them both tumbling down the sharp throat of the chasm. Kulivan’s air exploded from his lungs as he hit the belly of the chasm with a bone-jarring collision.<br>
<br>
Groaning with blinding pain, Kulivan immediately rolled atop his putrid antagonist. He put all his weight down on it’s bony limbs, pieces of mummified flesh flew off in the wind as he clamped his monstrous hands In a vice-like grip upon the creatures arms of bone. With large snaps, he felt the bones breaking and cracking. His grin of impending triumph turned into a grunt of surprise and dismay as the thing began to rise. With a non-chalant flick of its wrist and cackle of glee the creature flung him like a rag-doll into the wall of the rocky chasm. <br>
<br>
Purple and yellow spots danced before his eyes as he watched at least two of the things spring forth from the original creature. With jaw clenched in frustration and determination, seeing double from the hit to his head, Kulivan leaped to his feet, or tried at least. His side erupted in fire, and with a cry of pain he crumpled into a heap around his broken ribs. Bony fingers entwined in his thick, blood-matted hair. <br>
<br>
With another effortless toss, Kulivan was smashed into the otherside of the chasm. He lay down awaiting his impending death. His executioner cackled in glee, sensing it’s victims surrender, it actually danced in delight! Was this damnable creature aware enough to toy with him? Evidently it could experience joy at his pending demise. <br>
<br>
It dawned on him then. It was alive. In a twisted, sick parody of its former life. As a child, Kulivan was taught that the undead skeletons that descended upon the Everfrost peaks as dusk crept in, were automations. The offspring of wild and ancient majiks, from the underbelly of the ancient peaks. Empty and decayed matter, no longer connected to the souls that once inhabited them.<br>
<br>
Oh, how his instructors were wrong. Either this was a possessing entity, or truthfully some aspect of the poor deceased soul occupied the dread form. Either way it was an abomination to life, an affront to the dignity of whomever it used to be. Ignoring his pain, Kulivan arose to his feet in time to knock aside the killing blow. He hammered the thing with both fists intertwined, mated into a weapon of sorts. Knocking it off balance, he kicked out and sent it sprawling over a low boulder onto its back.<br>
<br>
He ripped into his torn backpack and pulled out his salvation. An eldritch light glowed brightly in the dark chasm. Kulivan did not remember placing his fathers hammer into his pack. Last he saw it; it lay upon the mantle above the hearth of his families’ lodge. A symbol of his clan, Clan O’ Ryakin-Dwygar-bane, tall-brothers to the Dwarven clan; Bloodforge.<br>
<br>
That was the name his hammer carried. Dwygar’s Bloodforge. It was a symbolic gift to his ancestors from the Bloodforge clan of Dwarves. His Great-Great-Great Grandfather had earned it, fighting side by side with Grinigus Bloodforge. During the war of tears. That had been when the Dwygar, twisted subterranean cousins to the Dwarves, had risen up in attempts to conquest the dwarven nations. An alliance was forged in that war. A blood forged alliance of, Dwarven and Barbarian blood. <br>
<br>
The hammer had been past down from generation to generation. Kulivan, in reverence to his father’s spirit had not taken the hammer, to his memory. He held it now; it’s holy power radiating around him, stirring his ancestors’ animal spirits within his blood.<br>
<br>
The Foul creature leaped to its feet once again, cackling with glee. As if to say, “you could never hope to beat me…living…sweet…meat…die…eat you…rip you…tear you…. Sweet…meat…. Living…. Die….” As it sprung at him, he could swear those demonic words were whispered to him on a dark, cold wind.<br>
<br>
With a battle cry he leaped to meet it, blue fire glowing in his eyes to match it’s hellish orbs. With a symbolic hand gesture and an eldritch word, spoken in the tongue of the eternal phoenix hawk, his eyes erupted in blue flame. The flame danced upon his body, like a drunken lover, caressing his many injuries with the kisses of eternal rebirth.<br>
<br>
When he met the undead daemon, ancient hammer, striking rusted blade…not a wound remained upon him. The sword shattered into a hundred shards. His hammer met magically animated bone. Black fire erupted, flinging them both back a dozen steps. The creature let out a wail of pain…and longing. Kulivan shivered. He now knew that indeed a soul resided within this wretched, damned creature. Within that wail was not the pain of physical damage. But the scream and plea of a tortured soul begging for release. <br>
<br>
Anger grew within his breast. His blood boiled, seethed with fury. A low growl escaped Kulivan’s lips. With an arcing sweep of his massive arm, Kulivan called once more upon his animal ancestors to come to his aide. A column of flame shot from his outstretched fingers, engulfing the poor thing in cleansing flame. Smoke streaming from the animated bones it walked onward through the flame…claw-like bony fingers reaching for Kulivan’s throat. <br>
<br>
With a final prayer to his ancestor’s spirits and The Six Hammers of the north, The Tribunal, Kulivan screamed in absolute pain for this poor soul. The Bloodforged Hammer of ages past seemed to have a life of its own. It weighed nothing now. The wind was still, the cold gone. All there was lay in his hands, the arc of the hammer. Judgement. Salvation. <br>
<br>
Kulivan did not know how long he lay there weeping for the damned soul. Rocking back and forth, cradling the hammer in his arms, lying amongst the shattered bones, he cried like a wee child again. He knew that there were souls doomed to an eternal life of hunting the living. They could not help themselves. Never again would he stop his hunt. He had found his calling. He had sat in judgement of not only this damned soul, but all like it as well. They were found innocent. Somewhere, someone…would pay for his or her (its) sins. <br>
<br>
He rose to his feet, raising his ancestors’ hammer to the heavens he called out a warning. “Beware bringers of suffering. Kings of dread. I come! I have sat in judgement…and you have been found wanting…May The Tribunal be more kind in their judgement than I…for you will receive NO quarter…”<br>
