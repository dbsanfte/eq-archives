They didn't make it, they didn't discover it, and they won't be the last group there. Granted, you'd be a jerk if you were trying to pick off the mobs in the area with total disregard for their intentions, but it sounds like you were minding your own business.<br>

An apology for a mistake is all that is needed.. You did what you should have done.  An honest attempt at helping what seemed to be out of control situation for 1 mob only and ended up KSing was an accident.  You would have recieved the same welcome if you were to just sit there and watch them die.<br>
<br>
Now for hovering about waiting for a camp to open, thats a bit touchy.. I myself dont like to have others hanging out around me while I play unless they are grouped with me, friends of me or my group.  I wont ask them to leave or make any snide remarks but it does make a easy relaxed exp grind a bit uncomfortable.  Perhaps if you ask if they intended to be a while, offer up some assistance and if not accepted and would be a while then find another spot to swim.  <br>
<br>
The guy above is right, they dont own it or have exclusive rights to it; however, you seem to be good natured and asking and finding somewhere else to hang around would be more appropriate in the future.<br>

I suppose they could just ignore him and then accept his apology when he KSd the next AC pop. Not saying he would have done that, only that I can understand the lack of trust. EQ is a game of camping. Nearly every item and quest in the game has one or more camps associated with it. Nearly every exp grind has a camp associated with it. VI doesn't recognize the camps they made because they don't want to police them. It's just so much easier to tell your customers they're not using the product correctly than it is to fix the problem. Would be nice if VI would borrow a page from DAoC or even AO in regards to item/quest item drops. I have heard that the next expansion will borrow some from AO. Anyway until VI protects us from each other I guess we should just respect each other. <p><CENTER>

I played a wizard for a long time and unless someone specifically /yell'd for help, I would stand and watch them die rather than even give the slightest hint that I was going to KS.  KS'ing is NEVER a mistake for a wizard unless you're completely inept.<br>
<br>
Second, I played back when KS'ing was legal and the GMs would stand and watch and applaud the KS'er (yes, there was such a time).  So, a wizard on the scene made everyone VERY nervous.  The first thing I'd do when scouting is to reasure folks that I was scouting and would not KS.  SIT down and chat with them.  You can't cast when sitting and everyone knows it.  Being a friendly non-threatening non-KS'ing wizard will earn you a lot of respect.<br>
<br>
BTW, I still do that today as a monk when scouting typically contended camps.  People appreciate knowing that you're not going to disrupt their fun.<br>
<br>
OTH, yes you have every right to be there and watch and swim.  Saying &quot;Hi&quot; by KS'ing them was damn stupid, though. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>

I haven't really ran into this on this server, but mostly on my old one.   I am the type of person, who gets lost in Qeynos, let alone any other zone.  I hate wandering around looking for x location (bank, zoneline,whatever)for 45 minutes, so now I ask.  Most of the times that I've approached people, (at camping spots/whatever) I've come to ask for some form of directions.  It's not uncommon that I get answers such as: &quot;beat it&quot; &quot;get lost&quot; &quot;MINE!!&quot; (there's not even a mob around..) when I come remotely near them.  It puts me in a bad mood to say the least.  I try to rationalize it by thinking that maybe they've been KS'd recently, and still in a foul mood/paranoid it will happen again.  <br>
As for myself, I really don't mind when people hang out when I am camping something.  Most of the time it's soloers who just want a safe place to sit around and med up/whatnot.  If they are waiting for the same spawn, then we need to work something out.  However, I have had people hang around, as soon as the mob pops, their all over it.     So, I've had my share of considerate people/KSers at camps.  My attitude now?  I still don't mind people hanging out around me.  If you really need to KS me..then go ahead, I hope it was worth it to you.  As they say what goes around, comes around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
The sad part is, a lot of the time this is true.  I guess in the future you can ask the group to give you an estimate of how much longer  they think they'll be camping, and  to send you a tell when they finish. That way you can leave and do something else, making them a bit more at ease, and still know when the camp opens up.<br>
<br>
Not sure if I made my point..I might have rambled off topic a bit...     <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

EDIT: When I posted earlier, I did not see &quot;Inspiration Divine's&quot; post  or &quot;Mosushi's&quot;.  (I take forever to type and post..so I did not get to view them until afterward)<br>
If you infact did what Inspiration said, then I don't blame them the lest bit for wanting you gone.  If you haven'f figured it out by now, wizzys are great KS'ers..if you thought the shaman was in trouble, then maybe you should have asked if they needed help, instead of helping yourself to their xp.<br>

I didn't try to KS, i just kind of ran up, saw the mob low on health and figured, &quot;what the heck, Inferno Shock; 255dmg you have gained experience... wtf?  /apologize etc.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I posted this soon after the KS, so didn't include the events that happened (having not happened at the time of my posting) in Dalliance's post.  <br>
<br>
The previous KSer (?) she refers to was another wizard (a gnome at 34, don't know how you could mistake that for me) who levved up and killed the crocs.<br>
<br>
As for the 'cyber-stalking' :  I like to read boards while I med up or don't have much to do in-game, so I figured I would find out who was so intent on insulting me [after the many plays on the word erudite, ended up calling me Richard Cranium (a porn star, dick head (?)], and came upon his ezboard profile, whoopee.<br>
<br>
Why I am such a 'condescending dork' : <br>
<br>
a) I don't group much.  Why?  I made a wizard because I knew they had excellent soloing abilities, which meant I could play whenever I wanted (be it at 4am when i get up for work/school or at primetime when i get back) and also do various things around the house during the downtime.  Remembering what good exp the crocs were, not to mention the 15-20 minute spawn time, I felt i should take the new char down there.  Once I got to the spawn I didn't really feel like leaving and having to walk back again so I just worked on swimming instead of going elsewhere or logging (eventually maxing it out, going from 48 to 165)<br>
<br>
b) While it may sound a bit silly, even to me, I do consider erudites to be in their nature a bit uppity and/or arrogant and that comes out both on purpose, as roleplay, and through my own personality.<br>
<br>
c) As for 'powerleveling' ?  well, that's what i call getting 3/4 of a blue for every solo kill of a croc i get (as opposed to the 1/4 of a blue, or much less, I am used to in groups).  <br>
<br>
why did i get all condescending in the first place?  because I was being peppered with insults and felt some need to defend myself.  I only aggro on other people if they piss me off, albeit not very difficult after a very long day and it being so late in the evening, and Shohgun did as much.<br>
<br>
How am i AFK and still swimming around (jumping in and out of water when i get near enough to the edge)?  Easy, just jump in the water, look up, press forward and left, click on the text entry box, let go of forward and left, then I am stuck in a movement (in this case small circles forward and left on and on ad nauseaum).<br>

Sitting in my camp AFK because you're patiently waiting for us to finish is okay by my book -- until you flip out because you were trained <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  --   Nuking my mobs because you're bored and KSing one (accident or not) means you've crossed the line of just waiting and decided to take an action that conflicts with my own.<br>

I'd say that rogue had a good reason to be upset.  (although getting juvenile over it is a different story.)<br>
