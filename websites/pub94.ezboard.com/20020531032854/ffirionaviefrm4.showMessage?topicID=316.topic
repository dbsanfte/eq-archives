<br>
What precisely do you think is going to make that server different in any fundamental way?<br>
<br>
Or do you have some sort of proposition that is going to somehow get rid of all of the powergamers?<br>
<br>
There will never be a true roleplayer's utopia. I have played games where the staff tries very hard to encourage roleplaying and discourage OOC/OOG stuff and powergaming, but it can only be so successful in a game of any scale. The quality of RP is inversely proportional to the number of players you have. A true and &quot;perfect&quot; roleplay world is impossible so long as that world exists in a MMORPG, which by its very definition has a huge number of players.<br>
<br>
If EQ's gameplay did not appeal to me, there's no way I'd stick with it just for the &quot;roleplay&quot; aspect. And since EQ's gameplay does appeal to me, I'm not going to forsake my &quot;gameplay based goals&quot; of raiding for loot and advancing in levels and assisting my comrades in doing the same. To me, those are just integral aspects of the game that I have NO SHAME about enjoying. Verant obviously designed the game to be heavily based around these goals. I don't consider myself a &quot;powergamer&quot;, but rather a &quot;gamer.&quot; This isn't just a &quot;stage&quot; for me to act out a role, it's also a &quot;game&quot; with challenges that I enjoy attempting to defeat.<br>
<br>
No modification of the ruleset (or simple server label/designation) is going to change the fact that the game is strongly centered around gameplay based goals that obviously appeal to a large number of people. There are other games which deemphasize these elements of gameplay and more strongly stress roleplay... whichout butchering elements of EQ outright, Norrath will never have a world/server where the vast majority of people come to enjoy RP first and gameplay second, because most people of that &quot;type&quot; probably wouldn't gravitate towards EQ in the first place.<br>
<br>
Also, to quote your web page:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
And if you believe that Powergaming doesn't effect Roleplaying, then why did you come to FV in the first place? I'll bet anything most of you will say, &quot;To Roleplay, because I cannot Roleplay on my old server.&quot; Why can't you roleplay on your old Powergaming server, if Powergaming doesn't effect roleplaying?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Powergaming&quot; does have an affect, to a certain extent. It is nonconducive to the roleplaying atmosphere. However, this is not something that's going to get in the way of a determined and inspired roleplayer. How others play only has so much affect on how YOU play.<br>
<br>
When I first started playing EQ, I was steadfastly in character. Virtually everything I did had an &quot;in character&quot; motivation, everything I said was in character. The fact that people around be were &quot;powergaming&quot; was not what I found discouraging... it was the fact that nobody would respond to me in an manner I'd characterize as &quot;IC&quot;. One-sided RP is only fun for so long. I can tolerate 300 people around me being OOC, and doing their thing &quot;powergaming&quot; so long as I have just one or two people around me who are responding to my roleplay in a likewise manner.<br>
<br>
This is why I enjoy FV. When you say something in an &quot;in character&quot; manner, or do something (or don't do something) because of an IC motivation, you aren't laughed at, ridiculed, or, worse, ignored all the time. People at very least tend to respect roleplaying, and very often respond to it in kind. Maybe I lack vision, but I'm sorry to say, in an MMORPG or in EQ in particular, this is about the best you can probably realistically hope for.<br>
<br>
Despite that fact, I would wish you good luck, but I think that anything that would cause FV to split at this point is fundamentally a bad idea. The RPers (and players in general) are already spread pretty thin, and yes, I realize some of our RPers are leaving out of frustration anyway... but fragmenting the server is not going to make matters any better, I don't think.<br>
<br>
I hope you eventually find what you're looking for in EQ, and failing that, I hope you find it elsewhere. I'm sorry you weren't able to enjoy yourself to the extent that you wanted to here.  <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

You can't forcefeed the Roleplaying atmosphere that you wish.  There will always be other RPers with different ideas.  Even if you had no Powergamers you'd still always have clashes of what some people constitute as RP and what isn't.<br>
<br>
Examples that come to mind are Dark Elves - Some people RP a D&amp;D style RA Salvatore Drow society and others try to be more 'true' to what they believe the EQ 'version' of DEs should be.<br>
<br>
The only way you will have a 'pristine' RP environment is to be able to control it yourself.  So Neverwinter Nights, or if you can get an EQ Emulator and run your own server.<br>
<br>
As to your petition, I'm afraid it will fall on deaf ears.  Firiona Vie is virtually the lowest population server out there.  If the population dropped any further, which it would ultimately from a split, I can't see how it would be viable.  Plus you'd need 5 times the Paid Staff to even think about 'enforcing' Roleplay.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry Firiona Vie hasn't met all your expectations, but I do believe that it is pretty much the best shot VI could attempt given the limitations of the Game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bren>bren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/1/02 1:46:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hi!</span><hr size=1> What Tukka said.

i think fv has its share of slackers that slack for the sole excuse that fv is a rp pref server. hey look, a server it's cool to not excel on.<br>
<br>
shintou, your original posts about how you role play this and that were great, but this has mushroomed and gone too far. before I thought you were cool, but a little twisted. now I see you are consumed and lost.<br>
<br>
eq is a game, with levels to gain, tough enemies to vanquish, and friends to make.<br>
<br>
even when i played dungeons and dragons almost 2 decades ago, no one strived to stay at level 4 for the purpose of roleplaying. no one threw hissy fits and dice across the table when someone 'dinged' 13 or killed a named demon.<br>
<br>
if you're so interested in the game, volunteer. work inside the system and become a guide. I have a feeling tho, that would be a bad idea, because you might be the one to xloc and bind people in vp the minute they ding 50. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uraycoom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raycoom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/1/02 3:43:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hi!</span><hr size=1> Wow, he gets called a ass for even wanting a Roleplay only server???<br>
<br>
Anyway this has already been done Shintou, FV came in response to your current request. Roleplayers requested a RP only server, Verant gave Roleplayers ( and anyone else) a RP preffered server.<br>
<br>
FV in itself is a &quot;No&quot; answer to the request for a RP only server. Even if the server were labeled Roleplay Only, there would be people here that were ooc gamers and they would find some way to Justify their presence on the server, and in the end you'd Still be labeled the &quot;RP Nazi&quot; for not wanting them their. Until Roleplayers have a developer enforcing players being &quot;in character&quot; a FV model server is going to be as good as it gets for a MMORPG.<br>
<br>
G'luck though, and I don't mean that with any Sarcasm heh.<br>
<br>
Oh...One more thing, &quot;power gaming&quot; or leveling fast and seeking the best equipment you can get as fast as you can get it, is NOT ooc unless the person playing this way makes his efforts ooc-which is speaking ooc and behaving ooc. The &quot;uber guilds&quot; of this server could very easily had been and stayed in character if they chose too, alot simply don't choose too. Leveling, Destroying a level 75 Mob, and gathering equipment are all part of Roleplaying in the world of Norrath. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uleatherneckoftunare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leatherneck of Tunare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/1/02 3:44:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hi!</span><hr size=1> &quot;That doesn't happen on FV.

<br>
Thank you for characterizing me.  You've never met me.  You've never seen me play.  There are far more people out there playing than you've interacted with.<br>
<br>
&quot;The point of this is to try to get Verant to create a Pure Roleplaying Only Server, where the world will be unmolested by the legions of d00ds and powergamers who only seek to play the game in their own way, which is fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you're going to enforce this how?  Who decides what is roleplaying and what is powergaming?  Is there going to be a set ratio of time in which you cannot exceed exping and gathering equipment unless you've been IC for so long?<br>
<br>
And what if I'm rping a greedy bastard that will kill any creature he can in his quest to become filthy, stinking rich?  Is that roleplaying or is it powergaming?<br>
<br>
&quot;And if you believe that Powergaming doesn't effect Roleplaying, then why did you come to FV in the first place? I'll bet anything most of you will say, &quot;To Roleplay, because I cannot Roleplay on my old server.&quot; Why can't you roleplay on your old Powergaming server, if Powergaming doesn't effect roleplaying? Okay, I'm done Ranting.&quot;<br>
<br>
No.  Actually, I would be extremely surprised if everyone came here specifically to escape Powergaming.<br>
<br>
Personally, I came here for the added difficulties IN ADDITION to the improved chances of roleplaying.<br>
<br>
I roleplayed quite frequently on my old server.  My character has allies and enemies, family and foes.<br>
<br>
I also enjoyed the hell out of going on levelling sprees.  Does that make me *gasp* a POWERGAMER?  Oh, heaven forbid.  Someone who in addition to wanting to develop his character as a personality, wants to develop a character's abilities.<br>
<br>
While stats alone do nothing to creating a full, 3 dimensional character, it's kinda difficult to portray a relatively powerful character when you con green to a 10th lvl because you've done nothing but roleplay.  Talk about losing your realism.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't think I will not delete flames against Me, or any one trying to help in this Cause.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah.  Don't let someone else's differing opinion stand in the way of your pursuit of the ONE TRUE WAY.<br>

 While I understand your desire to be a positive force, and actually appreciate it in the spirit that it is intended, I would caution you against appearing to always defend Shintou.<br>
<br>
 In his last round of flames he insulted, belittle, mocked, and disparaged anything that did not agree with his world view. Now, since this was all in the Soapbox section that behavior could, perhaps, be understood. Afterall, that is what the Soapbox is for.<br>
<br>
 Now, last week he stormed out and (promised) said he was leaving. Well it turns out he did leave. He did not want to be in an environment where ideas could be debated, argued, or even ... gasp.. ridiculed.<br>
<br>
 So, he has now created a world where he controls all thought. If you disagree with him he will delete the post. If you flame him he will ban you. Nice exchange of ideas, eh?<br>
<br>
 While I have disagreed with you many times, I respect your ability to frame your ideas in an intellectually rational manner. I also respect that you do this is in forums that allow people to answer back in their own manner.<br>
<br>
 Shintou has withdrawn from this community. Let him hide in the world he has created, away from the dangers of disagreement. Let's not defend him.<br>

 I am not arguing that he can or cannot do something with his board. Having visited it, I can say that there is discussion in the thread. It is not merely a &quot;Petition Signing&quot;. All discussion, however, must be a total agreement with his world view or he will delete it.<br>
<br>
 My point is that he has chosen to retreat to an area where he can control every aspect of the discussion. This is not reasoned debate, it is total control. <br>
<br>
 He came here to publize his new &quot;World according to Shintou&quot; site. That is akin to my walking into the local Ford dealership and handing out advertisements for the local Chevy dealer. Boorish at best.<br>

I had a character I RP'd every second of every day I played on a normal blue and everyone loved it.  PG and RP are completely orthogonal.  One does not preclude the other.  The RP tag here is just a bonus, not the reason for being here.  Hell, I was at least as obsessed with the end-game as any FnF/Reso/CW member -- who seem to be the horrorible PG'ers that are driving you away from FV.<br>
<br>
What do they do that drives you off?  They rarely post on the board.  Of those that do, we have a couple nice RP story writers, a game-accomplishment post or two, and a flame now and then (less there than you output by far).  They pretty much do their own thing in zones 20 or 30 levels higher than your character, so I doubt you see them on even a weekly basis.  How do you even know they don't RP?<br>
<br>
Sounds to me that the very thought of someone having fun in EQ in a manner you disaprove of is what galls you.  If it bothers you so much, play in your own backyard and stop looking over the fence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwikkin23.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wikkin23</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/1/02 4:41:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hi!</span><hr size=1> Every gamer has his/her own idea of what roleplaying is. Like fingerprints, no two will be identical. If you can not find happiness in the way you roleplay your own charater, and accept the fact that others play their characters differently, then I recommend you return to whatever server you're from... or go play a single player RPG, in which you can become truely 'immersed' without the intrusion of those who do not share your ideals.<br>
I've enjoyed my time on this server so far. I'm not powerleveling (22 right now), and I have not run into as many d00ds or powergamers as you make it sound like. Just because somebody is red to me doesn't make them a powergamer. Maybe that is why lower players con green (envy). Whatever.<br>
You can only control how YOU roleplay. And you are much more likely to find others to RP with on this server, even if they don't get AS IC as you'd like. And what if you ever met somebody that was MORE IC (imagine that), and THEY insulted how YOU chose to RP... would you just agree with them? Doubt it.<br>
Anyways, I'm done :o)<br>

<br>
All I can say is: <br>
<br>
Shintou -- you should go out and buy NeverwinterNights when it comes out this year. <br>
<br>
1) it seems like what you are looking for <br>
<br>
2) you make your own game world &quot;server&quot; <br>
<br>
3) you play by your own rules <br>
<br>
4) you make the Policies on your server, Verant does not<br>
<br>
5) you decide which RPers will play with you<br>
<br>
6) you decide which d00ds you can mass-ban in a split second<br>
<br>
Seriously, this is what NeverwinterNights is all about. Its about multiplayer online fantasy RPG that puts the CONTROL in the hands of gamers and lay Dungeon Masters..... and thus taking away that control from a company entity like Verant. <br>
<br>
With the tools of TOTAL CONTROL in your hands, it is very possible to achieve Role Playing Utopia in a game like NeverwinterNights.  <br>
<br>
You decide who you get to play with. You decide who you can discriminate against. Simple equation. <br>
<br>
Granted, a game like NeverwinterNights is (by design) not meant to be a massively multiplayer game like EQ.  And that's just as good.  We will already will have tons of MMORPGs by the end of this year..... <br>

This is for those that would like something like this. This was not an attack on you or your way of playing this game. I disagree with it yes, but I was not attacking powergamers in any direct way. Now you got it moved to the Soapbox. Bah. Shame on you.<br>
<br>
Moderators, please lock this thread. I did not want this to turn into a Flaming session, I just wanted those that wished for maybe trying to get a pure roleplaying server to come and 'Sign' this electronic Petition. The same Techinque is used to get Various Anime on TV (Like Sailor Moon, Ronin Warriors, On line forces worked hard to get them back on US TV). So please, just lock it.<br>
<br>
p.s. Thanks for Wishing me luck. Appricated, but it seems Verant stomped on my petition before it got off the ground. Its all about EQ Legends.<br>

I'm actually against it. What I got from your petition is that you want a server that has the same rules as FV, except that you want people to 'take it seriously this time.'<br>
Who's going to enforce the rules of this new server. Should the GM's and Guids contact you to determine how to punish violators of your RP-code? Oh well, when you finally get everyone banned from this new more RP server, I hope you enjoy playing on the server all by yourself...<br>
