<br>
He will be a male Shadow Knight, very loyal to Thule and his beliefs, but not necessarily always a run in swinging, confrontational type. He's a cool, calculating, erudite Erudite. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Khatib is the name I've chosen, as it strikes me as sounding like a name for an Erudite. It is borrowed from middle eastern muslim society. Any feedback on the name, does it fit to y'all?<br>
<br>
Resource material, anyone? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uderganpuppyeater.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dergan Puppyeater</A> at: 9/26/02 11:29:49 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukentassolgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eats Halflings</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/26/02 4:17:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2763.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.personal.psu.edu/btk120/antoin.gif width=68 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm.</span><hr size=1> 1.  Make a (good) Erudite (with a diety, preferrably the rare Quellious) on another server and run around in Erudin talking to the various NPCs there.  This will allow you to flesh out what you're up against, if you decide to have family/plots dealing with that side.<br>
<br>
ESPECIALLY the magician's guild and the jailer staff, regarding executions...knowing what you're up against and not caring may add some dimension.<br>
<br>
Then when you first make Khatib, explore Paineel a bit.  Get a feel for how NPCs treat you.  (PCs...well, people in Paineel all tend to be people who kill guards, and are generally people who can't be bothered to go to a real dungeon.)<br>
<br>
2.  Snooty.  Arrogant.  Has the skills to back up his cool and calculating nature.  Erudites aren't just Snooty.  They're CONFIDENT and Snooty.  If Khatib isn't, then he should probably the last to speak sort of person (opens his mouth and shuts people up with the right answer, etc.)<br>
<br>
3.  Snazzy Dresser?  Vain?<br>
<br>
4.  Weapon choice.  Whatever's around, or a preference?  Spears?  Axes?  Daggers?  Stilettos?  Clubs?  Hammers?  Big Hammers?  Maces?  Staves?  Two-handed swords?  One-handed swords?<br>
<br>
Most general thought on Shadowknights is &quot;train all skills&quot; (except maybe 2HB, although there are a few good hammers out there)<br>
<br>
I'd see him using mainly staves and other &quot;non-lethal&quot; *snickers* weapons.<br>
<br>
5.  Erudites are far from the direct approach, but Shadowknights get away with it.  Focus on INT mainly, if you want to be more of a technical Shadowknight with a sort of fighting style.<br>
<br>
Although starting stats for a Erudite Shadowknight should *probably* be:<br>
<br>
STR/STA/DEX/AGI--INT/WIS/CHA<br>
75/75/75/75--122/83/75.<br>
<br>
Any stat under 75 has penalties associated with it...ESPECIALLY DEX/AGI considering you are a melee.<br>
<br>
6.  You may want to grab a shade silk robe. They look GREAT on Erudites (with hair, *do* use hair on the new models) and are good for lounging around in.  I lost mine...to the New UI 'loot too fast' bug; I do miss it; have to bother to make another...<br>
<br>
7.  Paineel doesn't have many allies--it is a very isolated city.  Be careful about who you call friend.<br>

Do the Heretics consider themselves evil, or are they like Iksar in those regards? How does Paineel society work? Caste based? Family units?<br>
<br>
Like, I'm trying to figure out Khatib's life thus far... did he grow up in a barracks, or in the home of his parents? I think I want him to be somewhat shunned by Heretic society, even though he's loyal to Thule and a sworn enemy of &quot;good&quot; Erudites.<br>
<br>
Where can I get one of those robes? Are they decent AC for a newbie, and cheap? I'm thinking I will train all weapon styles except for two handed blunt, just because I like versatility... I am going to carry this into character for the same reason; he likes versatility, but he favors a one handed blade and the use of a shield. He prefers a clean death to the brutal type from a mace and doesn't use those in battle unless he needs a prisoner, and he uses torture only when necessary... not because of any sense of mercy or guilt, but because it is a tool which can cause fear and get information, but is inefficient other than that... and efficiency is what rules his life.<br>
<br>
Are the Heretics a type of brotherhood? Like, if I meet one in a distant place, would we be all close? How large is the community of Paineel? Everyone knows everyone?<br>
<br>
Back to the outcast thing... (haha, I just realized he'd be an outcast among outcasts... yikes), I say that I may take him that way because of the way I think he would do things, and the way I think most Heretics would do things... would that set him apart, make him sort of outcast? Like, if he sometimes travels through good lands and puts on the guise of a regular Erudite who knows some magic and is skilled with a sword, like a traveller or something? Or is this an accepted thing to do, to walk unseen among the enemy?<br>
<br>
As for pre-set racial prejudices, I know I hate Erudites who aren't Heretics... what about everyone else? I mean, I know I have a general disdain for most other races... what about the high elves? Do I respect them or hate them all the more for their almost-peer level? And the Dark Elves... We have a loose alliance, right? Can I walk freely in most cities, other than Qeynos?<br>
<br>
Do Heretics, or at least the ShadowKnights, follow a code of honor? If not, would it be weird for me to have my own code of honor? How do most Erudites feel about the Iksar?<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, if you happened to wade through all this. I am very thankful to those of you who are experienced enough to share the precedences which have evolved from this interesting Verant made society... a shame I can't just do a search at google and get a ton of material <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They were called Loyalists, but that is a PC-invented word.  Eliezer made that up.  I'm not sure what NPCs call the Erudites in Erudin.  Probably by guilds--Peacekeepers and Deepwater Knights.  Ya got me.<br>

Not everyone knows everyone, but there's this general level of respect, even for Good / Neutral Erudites.<br>

Antoin does it all the time.  I often disguised myself as an enchanter when I went to see neutrals I was trying to corrupt.<br>
<br>
Order / Evil if you take the D&amp;D equivalent Lawful Evil, you get someone who works within the system but bends the rules to their end.  Corruptor-types often are &quot;Order Evil&quot; characters.  (Since the Alignment System's gone...but for the record ERU/SHD could ONLY be Order / Evil.  Alignment Change 8 if I recall.)  Officially Paineel has few enemies, but Erudites are always big on spying.  Loyalists are big on spying and diplomacy; Heretics are big on spying and sabotage/subterfuge. (There's a Heretic quest to poison the water of the Warrens.)<br>

Actually not really.<br>
<br>
Qeynos -- fixable faction, initally threatening (SK only; CLR dubious)<br>
Halas -- KOS.<br>
Surefall Glade -- KOS.<br>
Erudin -- walkable for the most part until you start questing.<br>
Rivervale -- KOS.<br>
Freeport -- walkable.<br>
Karanas -- threatening, fixable, but who cares?<br>
High Keep -- threatening, fixable.<br>
Oggok -- KOS.<br>
Grobb -- KOS.<br>
Neriak -- walkable, except the ghouls.  (ITU is needed to get to the SK guild.)<br>
Kaladim -- KOS.<br>
Ak`Anon -- threatening?<br>
Kelethin / Felwithe -- Dubious.  Yes, Dubious.<br>
Shar Vahl -- indifferent<br>
Cabilis -- KOS.<br>
FV outpost -- KOS<br>
Overthere -- apprehensive.<br>
Thurgadin -- apprehensive.<br>
Kael -- threatening.<br>
CoV -- KOS.<br>
<br>
Your options are pretty limited, but most major cities that are worth anything are fixable.  Neriak, Freeport, Qeynos are going to be your main goals and are pretty easy to get in.  High Keep is a necessity for travel.<br>
<br>
Shar Vahl is a nice touch but no guildmaster.<br>
<br>
Cabilis and Ak`Anon are nice touches...but not really required until you trash OT faction or spend too much time in Faydwer.<br>

Code of Honors are common.<br>

Erudites and Iksar sorta...well it's a mixed bag.  Half and half hate and tolerate, I'd say.  Bit of jealousy over being the &quot;true children of Thule.&quot; etc.<br>

Is there any other message boards for followers of Thule, and Erudites in general? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 616<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/5/02 9:37:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2763.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kentas-</span><hr size=1> I am intensely interested. ERU SHD.<br>
<br>
My character (and I'll call him Jack because I haven't come up with a decent name yet) is a former Paladin of Erudin who heard the calling of the Faceless. He'd spent most of his life preserving the unstable peacetime that Erudin knows today, but recently Jack grew tired of allowing his enemies to roam freely in order to prevent war. He lived for battle, and had always enjoyed the expressions of terror on the faces of his foes, which remained there long after they'd had their last breath. He had an undeniable thirst for this fear and the blood that came along with it.<br>
<br>
Jack realized that he wasn't meant to be a Paladin, but didn't know how he became one. Unknown to him (and anyone but the High Men of Erudin) were his origins. One rainy morning, many seasons ago, a broken raft drifted to a small alcove between Erudin and Paineel. On it were many mutilated adult bodies and a small bundle wrapped within a stained blanket. Fishermen at the shore had sent a page to Erudin detailing the found child; but when the small troupe of High Men arrived to transport the young Erudite back to loyalist society, a small band of Heretic spies had just overcome the last of the seafarer's and were ready to steal away into the woods with the child.<br>
<br>
A small battle ensued, with the loyalists surviving. A few days later, a researcher approached the council of High Men with a prophecy he'd found in the city library. It essentially described the arrival of the child, and foretold that he would grow to be a great crusader of fear. They did not want to kill the child, but they did not want him to become evil either. They decided that they must instill in him the virtues of The Tranquil, and have him live as holy of a life as they could. They did not realize that it was impossible to alter destiny.<br>
<br>
Later, after Jack's destructive intentions were discovered, he was arrested and prepared to be executed. He was escorted by a small team of guards to The Hole, but before he was thrown in, a brief vision came to him from the sky. A young man and a young woman were shown to him, both Erudites, but they appeared to be burning alive. The vision faded after only a moment, but the guards had seen it too. He used the opportunity to overcome his captors and cast them into certain death.<br>
<br>
Quellious stripped Jack of his clerical abilities, but Cazic-Thule allowed the disowned Paladin to worship him instead, and this was told to Jack by whispers into his mind. He approached the city of Paineel, shackles and all, and was quickly accosted. His new-found father spoke through him at this critical moment, and after much convincing he was allowed to begin his studies at the Temple of the Fell Blade.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
I was thinking that the people Jack saw in the sky were his parents, who were somehow connected to the old Erudite Heretics. They were early Heretics, back when the loyalists far outnumbered them (do they still?), and had fled capture by sailing across the ocean to Qeynos with loyalists close behind. They were caught between the Paladins of Marr at Qeynos and the Erudites behind them, and the parents were executed. The loyalists took what they believed to be an uncorrupted infant back with them, but between Qeynos and the final destination of the raft, baby Jack somehow took upon powers that were not entirely of his own and slaughtered the others.<br>
<br>
Does that sound okay?<br>
<br>

<br>
Well, here's my thoughts, opinians and observations on it, you can do with them what you will or ignore them completely. *smiles* <br>
<br>
Iksar society is structured such that everyone is born to a caste and is assigned a job, the entire society has a clear heirarchy of command and everyones place in it is very clear. Essentially, they literally have NO system to accomodate outsiders or visitors. Who would the visitors take orders from? What would they be allowed to do and not to do? If they can be orderd around by anyone, they essentially become slaves once they enter and will never leave, while if nobody can order them around they have more rights then an Iksar, and that naturally just wouldn't work.<br>
<br>
Iksar have absolutely no way, within the structure of their society, to accomodate visitors or outsiders. I tried very hard to think of an excuse, but outsiders being within Iksar cities is essentially completely unRPable for the Iksar. The exception being that they are slaves, of course. <br>
<br>
The other way would be for an outsider to join a caste, but I honestly don't see Iksar letting outsiders join a caste of theirs. It'd cause alot of political problems (Distrust would start to grow, alot of Iksar would think the Empire is desperate, stuff like that), and there just isn't too much reason for it. Not to mention to join a caste means you would be treated equally, and I can't see Iksar ever treating outsiders equally. (Although maybe they could make a special rank that is lower then even the lowest Iksar rank just for an outsider?) <br>
<br>
The relationship I see between Iksar and Erudites, well, I won't speak for the Erudites, but I see Iksar as essentially considering them as disgracing Cazic-Thule's name, worshiping him completely wrong, etc. After all, if they were true followers of Thule, they'd accept that the Iksar were his chosen and bow down and willingly become slaves. Since they do not, they are blasphemers who abuse Cazic-Thule's name. <br>
<br>
And of course, Cazic-Thule really DOES favor the Iksar over any other race. *smirks* <br>
<br>
Anyway, hope that information is of some use. Have fun and good gaming to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukentassolgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eats Halflings</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/7/02 11:07:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2763.topic&index=29>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.personal.psu.edu/btk120/antoin.gif width=68 height=146></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *nods at Daemonifuge*</span><hr size=1> *bonks self* So that's who you are!<br>

Perhaps there is a way for Seele to make use of this information..<br>
<br>
I'm very glad to see so much interest in this thread and Heretics in general, especially from some familiar names. Although my hours can be very late, I'd be happy to speak with any young Heretics in game, so shoot me a tell if you see me around.<br>
<br>
For myself, my knowledge of the NPC background surrounding Odus is very incomplete. I really need to take Antoin's suggestion and roll up a Loyalist on another server. Because I didn't want to risk getting stuck in constant contradictions with the background already in place, I have used my own NPCs and background for the basis of Fyanna, and then tried to incorporate elements from Norrath and in-game characters as they fit. As I've said elsewhere, nearly everything about Fyanna is a melting pot of references to anime, horror stories, David Lynch movies, and other games. Its all just for fun as a tip of the hat to things that I have found neat. That being said, she still adheres very strictly to the Orderly Evil alignment and upholds the principles of the Fell Knights.<br>
<br>
Fyanna is a member of the shadowy organization known as Seele, which operates from within the Hole under Paineel. The motives and goals of Seele are not known to any outside of it, although its influence can be indirectly felt throughout Norrath's history. They manipulate events on Odus and use the High Council of Paineel as a front for their activities. Seele follows a strict Timetable in its efforts to complete the Project, which is often linked to various key phrases in intercepted reports. Some of these phrases include the Bakumatsu, Human Instrumentality, the Black Lodge, and the Shinma.<br>
<br>
Fyanna's position in Seele is as the Handmaiden of Pain, a title that was awarded to her following the completion of the Riot of Blood. She was raised from infancy within the temple of Nerv to be used as a living weapon, and her entire upbringing and training were centered around that. As such, she has little or no sense of self, and follows her orders unquestioningly. Recently she was assigned to establish relations with the League of Shadows, where she performs duties as a Hitokiri, or house assassin. She has secret additional orders regarding several figures that are listed in the Project's schedule. Some of these figures know who they are...some don't.<br>
<br>
A recent relevation from Captain Nolouj shows that Fyanna is in fact the daughter of Meralith, and thus Antoin's niece. This information has been kept secret by Seele for various reasons, partly because of their involvement with the circumstances surrounding the incident, and partly out of concern that Fyanna's mental state might become unstable should she discover the truth. There is a great deal of mystery in what might actually be imbued beneath the surface of the Handmaiden's conciousness, and Seele will not tolerate a loss of their investment. <p><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/fyanna/snk_kojirou3.gif><br><b>Fyanna</b><br>Fell Knight of Thule<br>Hitokiri to the League of Shadows<br><i>There can be no salvation without destruction,</i><br><i>no hope this side of death..</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhaldrim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Haldrim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/10/02 3:03:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2763.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well, well...</span><hr size=1> I have come full circle.
