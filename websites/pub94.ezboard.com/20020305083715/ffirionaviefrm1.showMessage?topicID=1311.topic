My question therefore is how hostile are people on this server to non roleplayers?  I wouldn't do anything that should &quot;ruin the mood&quot; for anyone or anything like that, but I will be talking normally (no thees thous etc etc) and I really won't have a history or anything for my character...will people be offended by this?    And will this happer my prospects for finding groups?  Any opinions would be welcome...thanks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=viren>Viren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/8/02 3:28:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1311.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm thinking about starting a character</span><hr size=1> I'm relatively new to FV, so I can only tell you my experiences.<br><br>I'm not a die hard roleplayer by any sense of the word.  The main reason I'm at FV is because I really don't like the mood shattered.  I may not dramatize every aspect of my life ... like making some crusade over killing orcs in the commonlands ... but I do appreciate it when people don't shout about the super bowl or how high/drunk they are.<br><br>To me, that is the most important part.

Pick a class and race you like and give it a go. <br><br>I wouldn't get too hung up on how to roleplay. Some like to write novels about their character and change the way they talk, some people just use emotes, some giggle a lot, some are mostly just quiet all the time... This diversity makes the server much more interesting if you ask me.<br><br>It's tough playing for the first 15 levels or so, especially languages. Good news is, raising them is easy if you take some time and do it at a zone line (see language faq on this board).<br><br>It's nice to work up through the gear instead of landing in an oversaturated economy where everyone twinks and has lots of plats. ... I have always enjoyed the mindset that you don't NEED to best gear to survive, level and have fun. My desire to get gear has kept pace with leveling and my ability to get it myself. (Besides, it means more if you get it a piece at a time. I'm working to get rid of my silk clothes and silver jewelry now, at 29. Gives me something to go after.)<br><br>TLC doesn't stop powergamers. It's a drag sometimes, but worth it if the trade off is the return of NO DROP stuff. Speaking of TLC ... one strategy to raise cash would be to find out what low-level quest items are in demand and become a TLC mercenary...<br><br>Our population is low, which means you have to cultivate friends early on, and know where people hunt at your level if you want a steady group. Still, if your main goal is not leveling and loot, this doesn't detract much from the game.<br><br>halus<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubormwarrior.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Borm Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/8/02 3:33:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1311.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm thinking about starting a character</span><hr size=1> Well to be perfectly honest about 99.9% of all players on FV are a &quot;Live an dLet Live&quot; type of people that will respond to you exactly as you seem to desire. This is a great community of nice people who help each other out and have a lot of fun.<br><br>That being said, there is a small minority who believe that you MUST RP all the time and exactly how they define RP to be done. Frankly on my very few experiences of this in game I just ignore it.  Here on the boards, however, you will find a little more debate about the subject.<br><br> The worst that will happen, for example, if you ask &quot;May I please have a Sow&quot;, and you happen to ask one of the Hardcore Uber RPers, is that you will be told where you can find a female pig. Childish and immature, but not mean.<br><br>I love this server and would never think of going to another inspite of the fact that i RP very little.
