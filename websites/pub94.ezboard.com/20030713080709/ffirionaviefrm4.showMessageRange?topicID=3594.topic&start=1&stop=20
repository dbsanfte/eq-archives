<br>
RP doesn't require a funny speech pattern (though some RPers use that as a way to express their character's difference from themselves or even to give their character a bit more... flair) or thees and thous (though that could be used to define someone of the gentry or who sees himself as gentry or someone a bit more &quot;refined&quot;) or even using a made-up language from an entirely different game (many who use it do so to give a different bit of accent and flair in exactly the same way as those who type the sound of their character or who use thees and thous), though a speech pattern does make it evident when RP is dropped for what ever reason.   It doesn't require writing elaborate stories as or about your character (though some do as a way to continue their character out of game or to bridge things in game and give the character more depth or simply because they like to write stories).  It doesn't even require seeing one race/class or group of races/classes as wrong (though many do as a way to differentiate their character from themselves) and calling others names or not helping them.<br>
<br>
Your character doesn't know about Monday night football, he doesn't know about the latest movie or music video, he might know about how much damage he can output, he probably knows how this or that spell effect him, he probaly even has a different understanding of death since he gets a free trip to the soul binder when it happens, he probably also does know how things, like himself, reappear after a time or three and that others might have knowledge on the timing, and he most definately knows that killing things in certain places can advance his own carrer or line his pocket pretty well or might take a huge organised force (yes, even grinding for XP or cash can be integrated into RP as can raiding).<br>
<br>
Those who say they are casual RPers or don't RP much but express things as their character would (even abreviations such as SoW and KEI) even giving the character a &quot;life&quot; similar to their own and don't laugh at those who do use speech patterns (except <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>as their character might laugh at them</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) are RPing. If they are consitent, they might even be a better RPer than the person who is writing elaborate tales, or using a speech pattern.  RP is simply interactive storytelling.<br>
<br>
All I could ask of someone coming here is that they not talk like a warez d00d (unless they are trying to portray an idiot, perhaps, with a very messed up way of talking), and not say &quot;dude, u RPers r so funny&quot; or the like and give even &quot;casual&quot; RP a shot, look a the world through your character's eyes instead of your own and leave the 21-century-isms alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh... and one last thing.  RP is not standing against ebaying, server transfers, the change in ruleset, other changes SOE has decided to impose on the server, or growling about the increasing number of d00ds and those antagonistic to RP (specifically those who go out of their way to mock RPers or even exclude them).  That is an OOC stance and might well be in support of ones desire to RP and a view that these are the antithesis of RP.  These things that one might stand against don't stop the RP, but for many of us they do make it harder because RPing alone is pretty pointless since it leaves out the interactive part.  These things can also change the setting which makes the RP out of place and jarring even to the one RPing like a portrayal of Romeo and Juliette using the words written by Shakespeare but set in modern day New York, you know it doesn't fit.<br>
<br>
I am against ebaying (or any in-game use of Real World money aside from buying the software and paying for the account(s)) more because of I see it as the antithesis of RP than because of the EULA (though SOE has broken their contract with us, so why keep our contract with them?) because it is an incursion of this modern world into the fabric of the game.  I am against cross server transfers because of the threat of the arrival of even more who are anti-RP but at higher levels and because it will likely make more use of ebaying and because they have no reason (even less so than others) to have any respect for the community of FV or the RPers.  Yes, I am well aware that some who have bought characters or transferred are RPers and good people behind them.  Yes, I am aware that some who have sold characters are RPers and have good people behind them and have, in their own mind, justified why they sold.  It doesn't mean I have to agree with their actions even if I can accept the person as fine.  It doesn't mean I have to respect that choice or even accept/respect the justification for it.<br>
<br>
I put this in the soapbox because I did bring up the &quot;HOT&quot; topics at the end and know it could draw flames.  But, this is not a rant, jsut an opinion. <br>

<br>
Roleplaying isn't necessarily much.<br>
<br>
One person in my guild told me he doesn't roleplay.  I answered him, why then did he love to suicide his one character, and not the other?  That's roleplay too, giving your character a &quot;quirk&quot;.<br>
<br>
Pretty simple, if you got more than one character and find yourself treating them differently... you are roleplaying.<br>
<br>
It doesn't need to be different from you.  Your character can be conniving or honest... just like you.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
What's not roleplaying is talking non-eq terms.<br>
<br>
Things like discussing various stats and strategies of EQ are part of the game. I may tire of them in a long discussion but I wouldn't consider those entirely out of character. After all, my character is used to armor showing &quot;stats&quot;. I choose to take the world of EQ as it is, not trying too hard to fit it into what the real world is like (after all, in the real world, you only die once, there are no zones, and the /follow command doesn't work...)<br>
<br>
Talking about latest wars in RL, or politics, or who won last night's basketball game... that's OOC and definitely not stuff  a fantasy character would know about.<br>
<br>

Why is that? Because I was born and raised on the Innoruuk shard of Norrath, and was reborn here.  I also used my Po's assets to equip myself with some modest acrylia armor and a few good instruments.<br>

By your post, and your indicated preferences, we could never be friends, or even acquaintences, because of how I was raised, and how I acquired my assets.  You have indicated you do not wish to know me, you simply wish to label me as an undesirable, and be on your way.<br>

Kuladen, the typo is mine, I saw it yesterday and was amused by the fact I typoed it in in exactly the place it would be most amusing.  The quote is from Linus and in the book &quot;Just for Fun&quot; but without -my- typo.<br>
<br>
Falcolas, no I will never accept your choices.  I did not, however, ever say I did not wish to know you or that I label you as undesirable, I simply do not agree with the choices you made in transfering here and, moreso, in equipping your character with your RL checkbook.  I did not say you are a bad person for it, jsut that I do not agree with your choices.  I am free to have my opinion that those choices are wrong.  You are free to have the opinion your choices were justified for yourself.  If we did meet, if you did not rub my face in your decision (make it known to me in-character that you came from elsewhere and used money from RL to buy things), I probably wouldn't even notice... in character.  That, too, is RP.  The OOC side of me doesn't have to like your choices for the IC part of me to look at you without any judgement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siffo>Siffo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silly old Rogue</span><br>  Posts: 960<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/1/03 8:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3594.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sad</span><hr size=1> Nice Caillou.<br>

One thing I have noticed that sort of pertains to RP.<br>
<br>
I have had disagreements with some on the boards about things but almost every one of them I have met in the game at one time or another I had a  thoroughly enjoyable time with them. <br>
<br>
I have been lucky enough to rarely meet with any of the asshats, fuckmittens and greifers that have been complained about here on a regular basis. So they haven't caused me any loss of pleasure.<br>
<br>
The people of FV are alive and well and still a great bunch to wander the lands of Norrath with.<br>

Caillou...  I find it odd that you are able to discern so much of Roleplaying and yet get stuck on this point.  Roleplaying has NOTHING to do with the mechanics of EQ.  So coming from a Parallel Dimension means nothing, where your gear comes from means nothing.<br>

I don't understand.  I can only discuss OOC things Player to Player.  I cannot tell you &quot;IC&quot; about Server Transfers and Ebay unless we are Roleplaying EQ as the Matrix or something.  If I tell you IC that I have travelled from a Parallel Dimension, that is IC and is completely separate from OOC Server Transfers.  One could just as easily RP that they have always been in Norrath and there is just one Norrath.<br>

I think equipping with RL Cash is silly.  After all I would never &quot;buy&quot; a +1 Sword for a D&amp;D Character.  But in the end it is ALL just imaginary stuff.<br>

Being resentful of someone who bought plat is like being resentful of the kid in school whose parents bought him a new car.

Hmm...<br>
<br>
I can't roleplay a Troll enchanter.  I can try to keep a Troll illuison up all the time but when I zone that illusion is going to drop.  I can try to tell those around me to ignore that but it's their choice if they do or not.<br>
<br>
I can try to role-play being a vampire but it's not going to cause me to burst into flames in sunlight.<br>
<br>
I can't reolplay that my second level character is the best dueller in Norrath and will beat anyone they challenge.<br>
<br>
I can't roleplay that I am the only warrior in the world who can cast teleport spells.  I might be able to simulate gating by buying potions but how would I port a group?<br>
<br>
And, before the May 8th patch, I could not roleplay a &quot;good&quot; Dark Elf and be able to cast beneficial spells on races that Sony had set as good.  Role-playing did not allow one to escape the racial/class/deity restrictions placed on the arbitrary categories of good and evil.  Some still try to hold to these old rules.  Most don't.

At the risk of this becoming a 'Can Not! Can Too!' argument, I'll bite for a moment.  Why not?  if you are say, a HE but wanted to RP a Troll Enchanter you COULD, simply by saying that your 'natural form' was the illusion.  Not that I am suggesting peopl just go out and free-form roleplay whatever they want, but the fact remains they can.  Tier'dal can Roleplay Drow, and a Dwarf could Roleplay being an Evil Duergar who worships Lolth even if his character sheet says Brell.<br>

I fail to see the significance?  What you roleplay is what you roleplay.  If you want to Roleplay a Vampire you can do it however you want.  You can Emote being damaged by sunlight.  If your character was ACTUALLY a Vampire and was damaged by the sun it wouldn't be roleplaying.  After all C0unt Draacu1ia who never roleplayed a day in his life who was also playing a Vamp would be burned by the sun too...  Game Mechanics do not equal roleplay.  In a game like EQ, it is what you MAKE of the Game Mechanics that matters.<br>

/yawn.  What does SONY have to do with Roleplaying?  Mind you, I am actually a big fan of &quot;Color within the lines&quot; style of Roleplay.

The 'group bug' allowed you to group, but yes, the old rules did force people to tailor their play to a certain style.  But are you cognizant of the fact that a Paladin and Shadow Knight could very easily ROLEPLAY that they were best buddies despite not being able to Group or Buff one another?<br>

Do you not see that 'Grouping' is an OOC Concept?  Sure, I suppose you could Roleplay that you can enter &quot;Telepathic Union&quot; with up to 5 other people (More now with Raid Function!) and whatnot, but I usually leave stuff like that out of my Roleplay because personally, I find it clumsy and awkward.<br>

<br>
The only caveat I would add to this is that looking at the world through your characters eyes in a way that is filtered from game mechanics.<br>
<br>
I don't Roleplay 'zone lines' for example, nor do I roleplay that everyone in a town is a soulless mindless zombie who says the same sentence over and over if you attempt to speak to them.  That would be kind of creepy.<br>
<br>
I don't roleplay that a Day is about an hour, or that people spawn fully adult.  I roleplay my character had a childhood, even though EverQuest doesn't actually support that.<br>
<br>
Of course, everyone's mileage may vary.  Some choose to incorporate some or all of these elements into their roleplay.  There is MORE than enough room for EVERYONE's Roleplay style to be accomodated.<br>

I do believe that is exactly what I was saying.  While OOC I would disgree with the choice of someone who has used RL money to either buy or sell a character or in-game items, I do seperate that from the IC because I do know where the game begins and ends (but do those who buy and sell things with RL money?  They mix the worlds far more than I).  However, if the OOC information was put in front of me and kept in front of me in an OOC fashion, OOCly I would have issue with it.  No, Caillou doesn't know that PoGeorge no longer plays George, she might have the impression that George is vastly different than what he once was and, while he might have been a friend before, is somone she would rather not have an discourse with or vice-versa.<br>

You did not read my reason for not wishing transfers.  If one has transfered here and makes it into part of their RP (traveling from far far lands to these, etc), then Caillou would accept them.  It doesn't change the fact that OOC I wish transfers were not available and have sent that message to SOE.<br>

Note: I am not saying my OOC opinion -should- be espoused by anyone but myself.  Nor am I saying my OOC attitude should have to impact my RP with any individual even if they have made a choice I disagree with OOC.

<br>
The line between what is within the IC and the OOC is not in any way shape or form blurred for me.  I know where it begins and ends.  My opinions on ebaying and transfers is, as I said, purely OOC and remains there.  However, I do see them (OOCly see them) as an incursion on what I want to be here for, the RP, because they prove how much others blur the line of real and game and don't care about the RP or giving room to it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=imogenelddar>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 357<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/1/03 3:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3594.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Sad</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I hate it when I'm RPing in &quot;normal&quot;speech and folks try to say something about hey you're not RPing. where are the ye, doth, goeth....blah blah blah.

Actually, &quot;ye, doth, goeth&quot; is Early Modern English (roughly 1500-1800 AD).  Notable examples are Shakespeare (born 1564, died 1616), Queen Elizabeth (1533-1603) and the King James Bible (translated 1604-1611).  Old English was spoken from the fifth to the eleventh century AD and is essentially a foreign language.  It bears about as much resemblance to modern English as, say, German.<br>
<br>
Being that fantasy is traditionaly set in medieval times (roughly 400-1500 AD), if anything, &quot;ye, doth, goeth&quot; would be too modern.

You view RP and the game as one, while I view them separately.  To me, the game is rather shallow, hollow in scope and depth, and merely something to do while I'm roleplaying with those around me.  These purchases do not impede my, or anyone elses roleplay, instead they offer me a bit more fun in the game itself, or the chance to keep an old character alive with new friends.<br>
<br>
For example.  Falcolas is, in game terms, an agnostic bard.  He, again by game terms, sings and follows no god.  In his RP life, though... he does not sing (in fact is a horrible singer), he hums.  He has given his swords Tunare.  The game is too limited in scope - again in my opinion - to encompass who my characters are when they roleplay.<br>
<br>
So, decisions I make in the game, purchasing PP or transferring my character - simply do not affect how I roleplay my character.  Large changes, like the transfer, must be roleplayed out to preserve continuity in the character, however... it honestly does not affect who my character is, merely with whom and where he can interact.<br>
<br>
But - thank you for talking this through - your own views had me confused, until I realized we look at the game itself very differently. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=318126">Falcolas Swiftsong</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Very few of my friends roleplay and most are totally OOC 100% of the time.  I sortof just RP myself but in a magical setting.<br>
<br>
As for Sony breaking the contract I 100% agree with you.  FV was advertised as a RP preferred server and we were led to believe that it would remain that way by Sony.  After putting in countless hours and spending considerable amounts of money creating and building our characters, they have decided to change the ruleset which attracted us to the server in the first place.  <br>
<br>
In a sense this has devalued in my case the 2 characters I built here to such an extent that I am seriously considering terminating my two accounts.  My time and effort building these characters would be wasted in that case and i'm sure at least in my country I would be elligible for compensation for time and money lost.  <br>
<br>
You might laugh at that but its similiar to the post about the road going through someones house when they had previously been no indication that such a road was going through. The latter case obviously being more severe but there is a parallel.<br>
<br>
I tried to find a clause in the contract that would protect Sony from any litigation regarding server rule changes impacting on customers but couldn't find anything but i'm sure they have it covered somewhere. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
