Really =).<br><br>I have loved exploring and doing quests and such for as long as I have played EQ. I have noticed something during my two and a half years of playing and was wondering if anyone else has noticed the same thing.<br><br>During my exploring and doing quests I have found that Verant seems to have some really powerful drops or quest items made available for the first little while when a new expansion comes out. Perhaps to entice players to purchase the expansion when it is released. <br><br>Player 1:&quot;Wow lookit this incredible sword I just got!&quot;<br>Player 2:&quot;Where didya get it? Stats?&quot;<br>Player 1:&quot;Its a quest in Katta, about level 35ish to do, stats are comparable to warrior epic/ToV drops!&quot;<br>Player 2:&quot;Wow, I gotta get Luclin!!&quot;<br><br>Thirty days pass and suddenly drops and quests start getting nerfed. If they are not removed from the game, they are moved to a much harder area or made extremely rare. The weapons of Ethreal Energy quests have been nerfed. The weapons have been replaced by weapons that do not even come close to comparing to the original.<br><br>I don't object. When we first did this quest and got the longsword we were shocked. The weapon is arguably better than the warrior epic. A team of level 35's did the entire quest in a matter of hours (not counting the time to locate all the NPC's). The sword was waaaaay too powerful for the difficulty of the quest. <br><br>But doesn't this seem wrong? Not the nerfing of the quest, but this reeeks of bait and switch. When Kunark came out, there were rings droppping off mobs just outside the tunnel in dreadlands (seperating the zone's two sections) that were like 7 ac and 10 str (or something like that, its been awhile). Again off roughly level 35 mobs that suddenly dissappeared about a month after Kunark was released. Stealth nerf as it were. The necklace of superiority that used to drop in Dalnir, again a mid level dungeon is suddenly moved to a much harder area and made an ultra rare.<br><br>I can't think of any Velious examples. Mind you I didnt much like that expansion and didnt really pay too much attention to it.<br><br>Is this to reward the few and the brave that go out to explore the new expansions and do the quests? Since SoL came out I have been almost exclusively hunting on Luclin. Is this my reward? Being one of the few to get these swords? Are these just mistakes and these drops/quests should never have been there? I can understand a few mistakes but there just seems to be a trend developing. <br><br>Am I reading too much into this? Watching too much x-files or has anyone else noticed this trend too?<br> <p>Kzan Verto<BR>Giver of "da juice" (tm)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uevangelinanife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evangelina Nife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/02 5:29:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1058.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/allencraig1/Syll4.jpg width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ethreal weapon quest...someone call the conspiracy guy.</span><hr size=1>    Actually, you got it about right.

You can't blame them for nerfing it (I'm surprised it took so long, actually). <br><br>   As with manastones, or rubicite armor, or moss covered twigs, or masks of deception (not guise), or countless other items, there will always be people that found out / decided to go get one just one day too late, which always bites, but is just the luck of the draw.<br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/02 7:56:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1058.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ethreal weapon quest...someone call the conspiracy guy.</span><hr size=1> I wish I could get the Ring of the Dead for my SK.

I wish they would at least leave the items there and just make the quest harder.. Rubicite might have been uber at the time, but now, the ac and stats are mediocre and the regen is low compared to say... a fungi tunic, but that doesn't mean that people wouldn't want to get some, it was nice looking armor and the original red plate.  <br><br>It is a bait and switch, but what I hate is the fact that now there are only a few, probably no more than 30-40 on the server and the only weapons we'll get out of the same quest they did is one that isn't even good enough to use.<br><br>I guess those of us over 35 can't complain, it's our fault we didn't do the quest knowing it would be nerfed, but those too weak to do it can't be too happy.  <br><br>Did they nerf other things like the drop rate on Centis??

It wasn't balanced at all. I just sometimes wonder if Verant does this sort of thing on purprose.

I just feel bad for the folks that couldn't explore luclin because of their level, lag or couldn't do some of these quests because they couldn't find a work around with TLC.

They are a company out to make money. They get the most money off a product if they get everyone to buy it right when it comes out because of a frenzy of awesome drops happening that will likely be over soon. instead of the 1st people trying it out and deciding wether they like it or not so they can tell their friends about it.<br>The items you are talking about is a moss covered twig 3/9 1hb and moss covered stick 5/15 2hb and gem encrusted band ac 10 str 7. Also the Neckalce of Superiority. All these items plus many many more dropped off mobs that were not appropriate for the risk/reward system. Is it a mistake that after all this time playtesting that these fabulous items would drop off such low level mobs... No. Now lets take luclin for an example. It is obscene how much loot i got in a trio in 11 hours in maidens eye.. 55 war 52 cleric and me 49 monk at the time got 4 very very good usable items each, had 2 corpses lying on the ground with lore items, and 2 god level loots, with 0 risk because we were in a zone line group. Other than the puller getting harmtouched there was no risk for any participants, and the loot was dropping way too fast.There were also ac 20 int 8 wis 8  etc etc etc earrings dropping off normal mobs, and the number of mobs that had special items on them was astounding, as you could see who held bags in their hand, swords, or had strange hand graphics....<br><br>Is this a mistake on verants part that they made it blatantly obvious that if you ordered the new release in the first week you would be showered with more loot pre nerf, than in the next 4 months post nerf.<br>I think not. <p><br><img src="http://www.huffnet.net/guild/Roster/qixxlt2.jpg"><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uevangelinanife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evangelina Nife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 448<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 11:10:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1058.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/allencraig1/Syll4.jpg width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A tiny note for ya Vel ..</span><hr size=1>    Ah ha, now I see what you're talking about.<br><br>   They make sure everyone knows that when there's a new expansion, crazy loot will be available for a very short time until they fix it all, so if you want any of it, BUY IT NOW!
