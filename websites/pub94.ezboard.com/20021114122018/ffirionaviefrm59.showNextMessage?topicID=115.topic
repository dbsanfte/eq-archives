Nagafen was killed on 9-22 as scheduled.<br>
Fumin's 9-21 raid on Vox went down in a blaze of glory... with VOX STILL UP.  <br>
<br>
WE ARE RAIDING VOX for Monday 9-23  9:00pm EST.<br>
<br>
We are in need of clerics, an enchanter, wizards, and a druid Lev 52+. Please spread the word<br>
<br>
 -------- /EDIT --------------<br>
<br>
MONDAY 9:00pm EST [ 8:00pm Central, 7:00pm Mountain, 6:00pm PST ] Everfrost Entrance to Permafrost. [ Easier to port as one to Lavastorm, than vice versa.]<br>
<br>
As discussed on the Fellowship message boards earlier, it is high time both Nagafen and VOX went down every week. To that end I am testing out leading a Fellowship raid on every Monday night on whichever dragon is still standing just prior to Tuesday morning patch.<br>
<br>
For this week there are Scheduled raids on Lady Vox 9-21 Noon EST, and Nagafen 9-22 8pm EST. If either of these raids fails to kill its intended target, this raid will take that dragon.<br>
<br>
THERE WILL BE NO RESERVED ITEMS FOR THIS RAID.<br>
<br>
<br>
REQUIRED RAID PERSONEL:<br>
<br>
One level 52 Warrior for MA, 3 Clerics (one must be Lev 52+), 2-3 Monks for pulling, 3+ Paladins, 2 Enchanters (one must be lev 52+), one Shaman lev 49+, one druid Lev 52+. <br>
<br>
Getting people killed IS NOT my goal here, if essential raid personnel are not signed up by the raid date, it will be canceled; please check here on the date of the raid for cancellations. <br>
<br>
Immeasurable thanks to Findra for advice on Vox and Nagafen raids. Should Hipo be present on any raid I lead Hipo may roll as a warrior instead of a cleric on Findra’s behalf.<br>
<br>
Druids and Wizards signing up, please be prepared to port people 30-60 minutes before the start time - thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
Don't be late! I will be putting groups together at 9:00pm EST. Sign-ups get priority, but expect to have final groups announced at about 9:10pm EST. <br>
<br>
HOW TO GET THERE<br>
1. Closest Druid portal: Surefall Glades<br>
2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of West Karana<br>
<br>
I will be supping peridots for buffs. If you want a TL out at the end, make sure your destination doesn't require a TL stone, or have one to give to the wizzy.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend everyone take measures to reduce lag - nothing sucks worse than going LD right as everyone charges the dragon (possibly the highest lag moment of the raid).<br>
<br>
There will be NO GATING during the raid. If anyone gates out at any time, for any reason they are booted from the raid. Don't even have the spell memorized. If you fall in the lava, in a pit in permafrost, get massive aggro, whatever - you die. You will get rez'd (almost guaranteed 90% or better), and the raid will continue. If you gate out, you WILL train the raid when you come back. That is why I do not allow gating.<br>
<br>
********** Groups **************<br>
<br>
We require 4 – 5 groups for Nagafen and 6 for Vox, of level 45-52 players. The exceptions are: <br>
<br>
1)        clerics as low as 39 with complete heal or celestial heal, or bards as low as 44.<br>
2)        Having the sixth group of 53+ characters for buffing, giant clearing, and dragon debuff attempts is most welcome. 53+ players can attempt a debuff and get kicked out (or DOT/nuke/group heal, whatever one spell you can add before you get booted).<br>
<br>
Five ideal dragon groups would look something like the following.<br>
<br>
MT Lev 52 Required.<br>

<br>
<br>
**********Raid Roles*************<br>
<br>
Master Assist = MA      = Mixxi<br>
Second Assist = SA      = Voskor<br>
Puller                            = Jebbar<br>
Backup Puller                = Kenna, then Shano<br>

Loot master                   = Meledi<br>
Group coordinator          = Meledi<br>
Traffic control                 = TBA<br>
<br>
Please list interest in any of the unfilled above roles when signing up.<br>
<br>
<br>
********** Chat Channels ********** <br>
<br>
Please use the following chat channels:<br>
<br>
FWRAID - raid wide chat<br>
FWLISTEN - important announcements only. This is where I talk, MA posts messages, snarers announce when snares land, etc. NO CHAT HERE.<br>
FWLEAD - all group leaders (first toon listed for each group) and raid leaders will communicate here. Please use chain of command whenever possible (toons -&gt; group leaders -&gt; raid leaders)<br>
<br>
********** Floorplan **************** <br>
<br>
Go to www.eqatlas.com and familiarize yourself with the layout of both lairs. MEMORIZE BOTH MAPS. For Nagafen [ Nagafens Lair (aka Sol B) ]. For Vox [ Permafrost Keep ]<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Everfrost report in to the raid leader.<br>
2. The raid leader may tell you if the raid is short of certain classes. Check with friends if asked.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.<br>
4. The raid leader, pullers, and group Leaders will use FWLISTEN channel. All other communication should be on the FWRAID channel.<br>
5. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, and nukers).<br>
<br>
At all times do not move further forwards than your raid leader unless you are a designated puller.<br>
<br>
************ Resist Gear ************<br>
<br>
Try to acquire as much Fire and cold resist gear as possible, mages present will summon the appropriate +15 fire /cold resist all/all shoulder gear.<br>
<br>
Naggy's most deadly weapon is his AE fire breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/FR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
<br>
If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xEarring of Fire Reflection (AC1 FR5 ~26pp at Lavastorm gypsies), Gold Diamond Mask (FR10 CR10 MR3), Gold Hermatite Necklace (FR7), Gold Emerald Bracelet (AC4 FR6), Platinum Emerald Ring (AC4 FR10), Hand Woven Legging (AC8 FR10), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), and Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20).<br>
<br>
Vox's most deadly weapon is her AE cold breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/CR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible. If you are level 52, CR gear is more important that MR gear, because you will resist most of her fears if you have a bard in your group.<br>
<br>
If you don't have much, consider acquiring: 2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20), Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), and Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9 FR10 CR10 PR10). There are a wealth of other items available, especially with the addition of SoV.<br>
4. Many of the mobs in Permafrost have high cold resist - including Vox, use fire based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
<br>
Make sure both sets of resist equipment are easily accessible in one or two packs when you arrive.<br>

IF THE DRAGON UP IS NAGAFEN:<br>
<br>
[A page from Findra’s book, some excerpts from <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com/raidnag.htm">www.crimsontalon.com/raidnag.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> I recommend looking at this site in advance. ]<br>
<br>
We will port to the druid ring in Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
Our path will be (from the entrance to SolB from LS, using the eqatlas map for reference): [9] Block Crusher Trap, [12] Nox Corridor, [13] Stone Spider Room, Prep for giant killing, [15] Entrance to Fire Giant Castle (kill 2 giants), move up to the area next to the lava and pull giants. <br>
<br>
At all times prior to charging the dragon do not move further forwards than your raid leader unless you are a designated puller.<br>
<br>
When fighting giants here (loc -1180, -220) all MELEES NEED TO PUSH THE GIANTS INTO THE CORNER OF THE WALL (BEHIND THE CANDELABRA). <br>
If the giants get into the lava it is very, very bad. When the throne room [16] is cleared of giants, we will move up to it. All but the last few giant will be pulled to the throne room or the little room just before the drawbridge. We will then cross the drawbridge [18] and pull the remaining giants to the hallway before Naggy's antechamber. When all the giants are killed we move up to the antechamber for buffing.<br>
<br>
<br>
********** Buffing for Nagafen********** <br>
<br>
Remember, buffing is the longest most boring part of raids. It is also the trickiest and most important. Please be patient, pay attention and execute your duties in this phase quickly - whether it is casting a single junk buff, singing a mana song or moving and camping at the right time. Things will get done much faster if we all do this.<br>
<br>
Buffing will be done in Naggy's antechamber.<br>
<br>
Buffing will done in groups. Each group will step up to the buffing area (the center of the antechamber) and get the following buffs, in order:<br>
<br>
#01 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist cold) <br>
#02 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison) <br>
#03 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease) <br>
<br>
Once you have all 3 Junk buffs please sit to indicate that you have them.<br>
<br>
#04 shaman stamina <br>
#05 shaman Harnessing of spirit <br>
#06 cleric shield of words <br>
#07 cleric Heroic Bond <br>
#08 cleric symbol of naltron (reagent: peridot)<br>
#09 enchanter rune IV / V (reagent: peridot)<br>
#10 enchanter group resist magic <br>
#11 druid circle of winter<br>
#12 enchanter haste / clarity <br>
#13 open Chloro, Damage Shield, or open for Celestial Healing, etc.<br>
#14-15 open for bard resist songs <br>
<br>
Buffers will announce when they start and finish each buff ( buffers should make hotkeys). When the 'final' groups are posted a caster will be assigned to each buff, so check back before the raid.<br>
<br>
Fully buffed groups will camp out to the FV chatroom immediately upon getting 11 buffs (12 for casters - clarity). Haste will be reapplied just before the charge. Relog every 20 minutes to refresh summoned items.<br>
<br>
After all the melee groups and nuker groups have camped the buffers will med to full and buff themselves. When the buffers are back up to 80 mana from these final buffs everyone from the chatroom will be told to reenter the game.<br>
<br>
Remember to join FWRAID channel when you return.<br>
<br>
<br>
********** Dragon - Nagafen********** <br>
<br>
General notes: <br>
1) Everyone should have hotkeys setup to announce significant actions. Group leaders should announce when their group has engaged, casters should announce attempts to debuff, etc.<br>
<br>
2) To land spells you need to be within Naggy's melee/AoE range. Best place is right by his butt. This is why EVERYONE needs good resists, full buffs, etc.<br>
<br>
3) Healing. If we have dragon groups setup with no clerics in the melee groups, each group will have an assigned cleric (or two). When tanks need a heal they should 1) send a tell to their designated cleric (have a hotkey for this), 2) turn off attack and 3) back away from Naggy &amp; towards their cleric once they no longer have aggro. Clerics should have hotkeys to target all of their designated tanks, as well as an /rtarget hotkey. If we get 3-4 clerics each tank group will have a cleric and this will be easier.<br>
<br>
4) Pushing. 20 tanks beating on Naggy will push him around. It is imperative that Naggy NOT get pushed into the lava. Naggy gets healed by being in the lava. If Naggy starts to get close to the lava MOVE YOUSELF so that you don't make it worse. If necessary, melees should stop attacking and back away to get Naggy back into the center of his room. Same goes for pushing Naggy into walls.<br>
<br>
When all groups have reformed the MA group will enter Naggy's chamber and engage. Tanks remember to activate disciplines. Bard's priorties are 1) Elemental Rhythms, 2) Guardian Rhythms - have your best drum out. Haven't figured out what would be the best 3rd song to twist (if possible), but it needs to be low aggro. Also, bards should NOT be attacking Naggy. 1) puts you up the aggro list, 2) minimal damage output when you have a drum going, 3) Ripostes will kill you quick. We need the bards alive to keep our resists up.<br>
<br>
As soon as the MA group has engaged Naggy and has him positioned in the middle of his lair all remaining melee groups will enter and position themselves behind Naggy. MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT PUSHING NAGGY TOWARDS THE LAVA NOR INTO A WALL. The casters can move up from the antechamber to the landing at the north end of the bridge (I will have a hotkey to announce such).<br>
<br>
Healing the MT will start with paladin LoH rotation, and then the clerics will take over. It is imperative that paladins and clerics announce heals in NAGLISTEN. Furthermore, Paladins now get DA at 51 - use it when Naggy beats on you after your LoH, BUT ANNOUNCE IT SO THE CLERICS DON'T WASTE TIME TRYING TO HEAL YOU.<br>
<br>
At 60-70 debuffing will be attempted. A shaman/magician will attempt Malosi, an enchanter can attempt tash, a shaman will attempt slow, bards can twist in a debuff (magic or cold resist). This is where 53+ toons can attempt a debuff and get kicked out (or DOT/nuke/group heal, whatever one spell you can add before you get booted).<br>
<br>
At 50 nukers charge, get under Naggy and blast away. Melee's with nukes go at it as well. Remember that fire based spells have essentially zero chance of sticking (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
<br>
If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Naggy targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
Hopefully enough of us live to take him down.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
IF THE DRAGON UP IS VOX:<br>
<br>
[Excerpts from www.crimsontalon.com/raidvox.htm I recommend looking at this site in advance. ]<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We will zone into Permafrost Keep.<br>
<br>
Our path will be (using the eqatlas map for reference): [7] &quot;Flag Room&quot;, [3] &quot;King's Room&quot;, Pause to insure everyone is present, &amp; the puller will pull giants to the raid [2] Ice Giant Diplomat, to the hall at loc. approximately 900, 50. From here the raid will have the final giants pulled to it, and be buffed. It is imperative that you do not wander or move past the raid leader, or risk falling in one of a number of pit traps, if you should fall into a pit trap STAND AND DIE, do not train the raid, your corpse will be recovered at the end of the raid.<br>
<br>
Once again, at all times prior to charging the dragon do not move further forwards than your raid leader unless you are a designated puller.<br>
<br>
********** Buffing for Vox ********** <br>
<br>
Remember, buffing is the longest most boring part of raids. It is also the trickiest and most important. Please be patient, pay attention and execute your duties in this phase quickly - whether it is casting a single junk buff, singing a mana song or moving and camping at the right time. Things will get done much faster if we all do this.<br>
<br>
Buffing will be done in the hall at approximately 900, 0 while the raid waits at 900, 50.<br>
<br>
Buffing will done in groups. Each group will step up to the buffing area (at 900, 0) and get the following buffs, in order:<br>
<br>
#01 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist fire) <br>
#02 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison) <br>
#03 caster 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease) <br>
<br>
Once you have all 3 Junk buffs please sit to indicate that you have them.<br>
<br>
#04 shaman stamina <br>
#05 shaman Harnessing of spirit <br>
#06 cleric shield of words <br>
#07 cleric Heroic Bond <br>
#08 cleric symbol of naltron (reagent: peridot)<br>
#09 enchanter rune IV / V (reagent: peridot)<br>
#10 enchanter group resist magic <br>
#11 druid circle of Summer<br>
#12 enchanter haste / clarity <br>
#13 open Chloro, Damage Shield, or open for Celestial Healing, etc.<br>
#14-15 open for bard resist songs <br>
<br>
Buffers will announce when they start and finish each buff ( buffers should make hotkeys). When the 'final' groups are posted a caster will be assigned to each buff, so check back before the raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fully buffed groups will camp out to the FV chatroom immediately upon getting 11 buffs (12 for casters - clarity). Haste will be reapplied just before the charge. Relog every 20 minutes to refresh summoned items.<br>
<br>
Groups 1, and 2 will camp out at loc 925, - 10.<br>
All other groups will camp at 900, 50<br>
<br>
After all the melee groups and nuker groups have camped the buffers will med to full and buff themselves. When the buffers are back up to 80 mana from these final buffs everyone from the chatroom will be told to reenter the game.<br>
<br>
Remember to join FWLISTEN &amp; FWRAID channels when you return.<br>
<br>
********** Dragon Vox ********** <br>
<br>
General notes: <br>
1) Everyone should have hotkeys setup to announce significant actions. Group leaders should announce when their group has engaged, casters should announce attempts to debuff, etc.<br>
<br>
2) To land spells you need to be within Vox's melee/AoE range. Best place is right by his butt. This is why EVERYONE needs good resists, full buffs, etc.<br>
<br>
3) Healing. If we have dragon groups setup with no clerics in the melee groups, each group will have an assigned cleric (or two). When tanks need a heal they should 1) send a tell to their designated cleric (have a hotkey for this), 2) turn off attack and 3) back away from Vox &amp; towards their cleric once they no longer have aggro. Clerics should have hotkeys to target all of their designated tanks, as well as an /rtarget hotkey. If we get 3-4 clerics each tank group will have a cleric and this will be easier.<br>
<br>
4) Pushing. 20 tanks beating on Vox will push her around. It is imperative that Vox NOT get pushed into a wall. If Vox starts to get close to the lava MOVE YOUSELF so that you don't make it worse. MELEE BE PREPARED TO MOVE AROUND VOX AS A GROUP TO KEEP PUSHING HER AWAY FROM THE WALLS. You should always be between Vox and the nearest wall if in doubt. If necessary, melees should stop attacking and back away to get Vox back into the center of her room. Those that are between Vox and the nearest wall should not taunt. If you are near the wall and are the current agro, move away from the wall. Since Vox is a caster, it is best to have all melee on one side of Vox to push her as much as possible (now why the heck would we want to do that?), because it will interrupt her from casting Complete heal on herself, regardless of weather we manage to land any stuns or not. <br>
<br>
When all groups have reformed the MA group and SA group (groups 1 &amp; 2) will enter Vox’s chamber and engage. Tanks remember to activate disciplines. Bard's priorties are 1) Elemental Rhythms, 2) Guardian Rhythms - have your best drum out. Haven't figured out what would be the best 3rd song to twist (if possible), but it needs to be low aggro. Also, bards should NOT be attacking Vox. 1) puts you up the aggro list, 2) minimal damage output when you have a drum going, 3) Ripostes will kill you quick. We need the bards alive to keep our resists up.<br>
<br>
As soon as the MA group has engaged Vox and has her positioned in the middle of her lair all remaining melee groups will enter and position themselves behind Vox. MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT PUSHING VOX TOWARDS A NEARBY WALL. The casters can move up from the hall to the entrance of [1] Vox’s chanber (I will have a hotkey to announce such).<br>
<br>
Healing the MT will start with paladin LoH rotation, and then the clerics will take over. It is imperative that paladins and clerics announce heals in FWGLISTEN. Furthermore, Paladins now get DA at 51 - use it when Vox beats on you after your LoH, BUT ANNOUNCE IT SO THE CLERICS DON'T WASTE TIME TRYING TO HEAL YOU.<br>
<br>
If for any reason, you get feared and find yourself in the pits, stay there and die. Do not bring more mobs to the fight.<br>
<br>
Every enchanter should run to Vox and dispel two times to remove all her buffs (remember to stand within melee range). If short on enc, other classes can dispell. Vox has the old-world max of 32k hitpoints, and the dispels should remove her cleric buffs and will effectively reduce her hitpoints. Each enchanter should OOC &quot;Dispelled&quot; once two successful dispells are complete. Need a minimum of 3 dispellers.<br>
Once finished dispelling, enchanters should immediately begin mana sieving her, and continue to sieve until Vox is dead. If short on enchanters (1-2), suggest having any necros feed mana. Necros can also DoT and send in pet.<br>
<br>
Healers should remain near the rock until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the rock and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of Vox's breath range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is behind Vox outside breath range.<br>
<br>
Necros DO NOT use spells that turn Vox into a skeleton. This makes it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
<br>
Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the rock for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
At 60-70 Health:<br>
Pets are called in to attack. <br>
An enchanter can attempt tash. If Vox agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transferred to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live. If agroed, the enchanter can use this opportunity to pull Vox into the center of the room. The risk to enc tashing is rather low by the time Vox has reached the 60 percent mark. <br>
Once all dispells are done, the debufs should come. Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Vox and should OOC successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc). <br>
Bards may consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does fire resist, 1 does magic resist). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. (or DOT/nuke/group heal, whatever one spell you can add before you get booted).<br>
Everyone begins chain-stunning, bashing, and slamming Vox. Although, stuns will not actually stun her, it will interrupt her from casting heal spells. Continue to stun her until she is dead. Vox is a cleric AI and will attempt to Complete Heal herself. If she does get one off, it is not the end of the world, it will heal approximately 5k of hitpoints.<br>
<br>
At 50 Health:<br>
Nukers (other than Wizzys) charge, get under and behind Vox and blast away, when out of mana, get out of AoE / melee range. Remember to get within melee range or your spell will not land. Melee classes that cannot cast stun should nuke as well. Nuke until Vox is dead. Cold based spells may have a reduced effect (correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Vox targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
At 20 Health:<br>
Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking, get under and behind Vox and blast away.<br>
Continue to mana sieve, interrupt, and nuke Vox until dead.<br>
<br>
Hopefully enough of us live to take her down.<br>

********* LOOT ********* <br>
<br>
- Loot will be called by group leaders in channel FWLISTEN and given to the lootmaster. Only group leaders should be looting. Everything will be rolled on at the end only. A person can only win 1 item but can give it back if they win a second item (first item will be rerolled). Roll will be done on a 0-1000 random. <br>
- Need before greed - don't roll unless you are going to use the item. If no one is going to use the item ALL will roll.<br>
- ONLY the classes list below get to roll for each item. If you have a problem with this, post your reasons and I may change something, but whatever is posted when the raid starts is final.<br>
