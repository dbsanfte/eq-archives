<br>
1) M:Long well kept hair. I have discovered that I really like mustaches, not beards just mustaches. Somewhere in the 6' - 6'5&quot; range is best for me. Eyes are also a big turn on, if they are pronounced as in the catch my attention quickly it is definately a good thing.<br>
F: Short hair, about shoulder length or shorter, curly is good too../drool and again distinct eyes will get me every time. Every time. I like women shorter than I am as opposed to men which I like taller, go figure. <br>
<br>
2) M: Very hard to say. I like a lot of looks, but one of my favorites is the dressed up look, dark neutural colors shades of grey. Favorite was probally grey slacks, a black button up long sleeved shirt with a dark grey sweater over it, and boots... Mmm.<br>
F: Again my taste in clothes ranges widely but I'd say if I had to pick one, Skirt, not too short just an inch above the knee or so with wool stockings and pretty much any kind of shoe as long as it looks good with the combonation. Longsleeved shirt and maybe a sweater.... something classy looking. I like classic clothing.<br>
<br>
3) M: Cotton Boxers... silk ones just make my skin crawl don't know why * shudders *<br>
F: Cotton panties and a bra. Lace and silk again... Blech.<br>
<br>
4) Personality can go for both. I like someone who knows their mind and isn't afraid to speak it. Someone who generally knows what they are talking about and doesn't bs. I don't like people who play games I want someone straight foreward... er.. so to speak. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Confidence but not arrogance is a major turn on in anyone. A good sense of humor is always a plus.<br>
<br>
5) Not really sure, I have a hard time actually being attracted to EQ chars in any other way than &quot; Oh isn't that cute &quot; they seem a bit too souless until they have a personality behind them. From what I have played though, I really like both male and female barbarians oddly enough.<br>
<br>
6) Kuladen Obviously. Hmm other than that I don't know that many males on FV that would want to be in such a thing, or who have a sexual nature to their char. * shrugs * As for females well...

<br>
Physically, I'm attracted to just about any build except linebacker-muscular or really big and broad shouldered.  Skinny, soccer-muscles, or even soft around the middle and cuddly are all good.  Dark hair and eyes are preferable, but I've seen some very hawt blondes, too.  Hair must be long (shaggy to ponytail length) and clean, preferably straight.  Too much body hair, especially chest and back, is very bad...I'd prefer little to none, though I'd rather deal with it than have a guy wax it off.  Moderately tall to very tall...I'm rather short, only 5'3&quot;, and I like to be able to lean my cheek into a guy's chest, it's just a thing for me.  Glasses and geekiness, either technical or social science related, can be a real turn on too.  Rawr.<br>
<br>
My boyfriend, who's The One and all, is 6'3&quot;, with a thick black ponytail's worth of gorgeous hair, soulfull brown eyes, a very <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fine</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lanky body with some none-too-bulging muscles, fair complected, and quite cuddly.  Is all good.<br>
<br>
Clothes?  Oooh.  Leather pants.  Boots.  Loose tunic-y shirt.  Mmmm.<br>
<br>
Boxerbriefs.  Black and gray ones.  Boxers are also okay...but tighty-whities stink.<br>
<br>
Personality is a lot more complicated.  Empathetic in a purely comforting way, not &quot;okay, here's my advice&quot; right off like female friends are wont to do more &quot;helpful&quot;-like.  Willing to occasionally take charge rather than being a doormat, particularly in bed.  *grins*  Kinky.  Intelligence is a must...stupidity is so very unsexy.  A sense of humor is a necessity to survive.  Supportive.  Occasionally sickeningly sappily sweet, because it's needed.  Animal friendly.  Being pagan helps, being religion-tolerant is a necessity.<br>
<br>
The only guy I can begin to suggest for the males calendar would be Kuladen.  Because he's a Super Star.  *nods* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sulissaurnvelve>Sulissa UrnVelve</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/18/03 5:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=238.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ladies (among others attracted to men): What turns YOU o</span><hr size=1> Physically :  Dark hair, dark eyes, browned skin, work built not gym built.

1. Physical appearance is secondary, but there are certain details that can make one of my ilk swoon. Swarthy skin, dark hair and a lean yet muscular form. On the other hand, those of clearly Irish descent often take the cake as well. Strong hands are a must, well defined even.  The colour of his eyes is not as important as their ability for expression. Dark hair, dark skin and light eyes is absolutely yummy, though. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. How would I dress him ? Barechested, barefooted, in a kilt. To take him out in public, flannel and jeans.   <br>
<br>
3. While the thought of him going &quot;commando&quot; is intriguing, I'd prefer boxers. Airy and easily accessible.  <br>
<br>
4. Nikki Sixx once said &quot;The perfect woman is a lady on your arm and a whore in the bedroom.&quot; I suppose that would be true of men as well, as long as they were more gentleman than lady in public. A sense of humour -- required. Someone who can think beyond the next football game (and I don't mean the playoffs). I'd much prefer someone with whom I had a stormy relationship with as long as he challenged me than someone I had a stable relationship with if he bored me.  Some degree of manners is desired, but I'd prefer for him not to drape a cloak over a puddle for me. <br>
<br>
5. As for the EQ fantasy man, very hard to say since I'd prefer an amalgam of several different races. Over all, I'd have to say barbarian male since he's the &quot;big brawny Celtic&quot; looking guy, but something can be said for the lean form of the Teir Dal and Erudite.  High Elven men are just icky. <br>

<br>
3. Briefs or Boxers? Nothing<br>
<br>
4. What personality traits leave you begging for more? High intelligence, the ability for original thought.  Class (Really big on manners) and a sense of personal style.<br>

I like guys that are a little taller, a little darker, a little more rugged.  I *really* like facial hair, most especially beard.  Beyond that, I really love a good smile.  That crooked kind of grin a la Tom Selleck and Tom Cruise gets me every time.  I also really like a guy with dark eyes.<br>

Those combo things are the best.  I just love it when my guy wears those.  Only problem, though, is it's a little harder getting your hand inside &lt;wicked grin&gt;<br>

A great sense of humor does it for me every time.  When he can make me laugh when I feeling at my absolute worst, that's the sexiest thing in the world and turns me on like nothing else.  Also, when he take time to notice what I'm wearing.  If I'm all dressed up and he makes a point to say something and then mess up my lipstick, he is *so* getting some that night.<br>

&lt;blush&gt; It's all about the barbarians.  Preferably the pre-Luclin models.  One with the long mustache and the blue around one eye?  Dark hair...&lt;rawr&gt;.  I've always had a thing for the barbies.<br>

((**may offend**)) I like a man who can deal damage..not because its a insecurity thing for him, but because he loves me and knows nothing turns me on more.

Just about any body type but too musclebound.  I have a thing about hands, and long fingernails on a guy is a turn-off.  A cute butt is a good thing ;p  Long hair, short hair, whatever color it doesn't matter as long as they have a look of their own.  My boyfriend is 6' 4&quot; with long blonde hair and green eyes, and not scrawny but not super muscled *shrugs*<br>
2) naked is good but if I have to pick I'd say dress slacks and shirt with a tie...<br>
3) boxers, the boxer-briefs, nothing... but not whitey-tighties<br>
4) I like mellowness.  Too much sports watching is a bad thing.  I also like someone that doesn't cling, and lets me have my alone time.  I'm not the kinda girl that expects someone to open doors for me, cause I can get them perfectly well on my own.  I have to be able to talk to him.  Liking similar kinds of music is a bonus.  <br>
5) Almost any dark elf except the ones with red eyes or mismatching colored facial hair.  Wood elves, especially the blonde ones.  Red-headed humans and the blondies too.  Barbarians with red hair...  The occasional high elf is good looking.  Something about scrawny pale guys. *shrugs*  I don't think any of the half-elves are particularly attractive.  Erudites, gnomes, halflings, ogres, trolls, Iksar and Vah Shir just don't do it for me.<br>
6) Calendar *ponders*  Kagemaru, Hilgar, Ialdar, Chaeolwyn (though he's not really around anymore)  I don't run into many dark elves so I'd have a hard time picking one that I think is drool worthy.<br>

1. What PHYSICALLY turns you on?<br>
<br>
Dark hair long enough to run my fingers through.  Eyes... colour doesn't matter as much, but I can read people better through their eyes.  Tall as or taller than me... being 6 foot tall it gets overly intimidating to have a guy shorter than me.<br>
<br>
2. If you could dress your fantasy man, what would he wear?<br>
<br>
Black silk shirt... black pants... that sort of thing... medium length black leather jacket.<br>

I agree with others... Boxerbriefs all the way!  <br>

Gentleman with a great sense of humor.  And I typically go for smart, computer guys.<br>

<br>
I've had three long-term relationships in my life, and the men involved couldn't be more different from each other.  <br>
<br>
The first was an Apprentice Electrician (read: always broke) with wavy dark hair, golden-brown eyes and a rumpled, gentle expression.  Think Hugh Grant, but stocky.  He won me over with his sincerity, kindness and keen intelligence.  He was calm, placid and extremely easy-going.  Short-sighted, he wore glasses.  No chest hair, very little facial hair and  5'11&quot; in height.  Very small social circle of close friends.  Non-drinker.<br>
<br>
My next boyfriend was a Systems Analyst (read: very big bucks).  6'4&quot; in height, very overweight, dressed in full business atire including briefcase.  Straight, short-cropped blonde hair, pale blue eyes, and hair everywhere! Front, back and shoulders.  (Must have been bears climbing his family tree!)  Quite bright (obviously) but only within his area of expertise - very much a specialist.  Lots of casual friends and acquaintances.  He introduced me to computers.  A very patient person generally, he could turn cold and dismissive without warning.  Not the kind of person who really let you get too close.<br>
<br>
Last bf and now my husband:  6'2&quot;, lanky, blue-green eyes, heavily receeding dark brown, straight hair (he started losing it in high school apparently) which I keep trimmed ultra-short for that nifty 'velcro' feel.   Vibrant, energetic, crazy sense of humour.  Very, very clever, he's a factory worker with college background, who loves life.  Small collection of close friends, lots of acquaintances.  Small amount of chest hair, close-trimmed goatee.   Always makes me feel cherished!<br>
