Some keep repeating the Sony mantra of &quot;there are no camps&quot;, but to be honest, the player base does recognize and respect camps as a rule, and that's a good thing. <br>
It's only shitty camps like SF that bring out the worst in people, who then resort to the &quot;there are no camps&quot; lame defense. So KSing is against the PnP, but camp stealing is still against the accepted code of ethics of the player base.<br>
<br>
That said, it isn't clear to me that Borm was camp stealing, I don't know that Kortoha was indeed camping it, as a matter of fact, Borm does say he was there for a few hours I think?<br>
<br>
The main difference between camp stealing and kill stealing is not morals or ethics, but the letter of Sony's rules, as they can't enforce camp stealing from the information they have in their logs, that's all. <p><table><br>

Since you are playing devil's advocate there, I can't comment on you saying that personally.  However, I do have a big problem with this.  Who is to say who &quot;owns&quot; a camp that should be recognized and respected?  I mean, there are a huge number of people that have camped Stormfeather from time to time.  Thus, there is potentially one person who has spent days camping Stormfeather over a period of time.  That could be months or even *shudders* years.  Keeping that in mind, who &quot;owns&quot; the SF camp in the following situation:<br>
<br>
Person X who is sitting at the SF area right now and has been sitting there for two days in a row<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Person Y who has spent two days over all waiting for SF, even though those two days might have happened a month ago?<br>
<br>
It's not so cut and dry when looked at in that light.  These two have spent the same amount of time &quot;camping&quot; Stormfeather.  Maybe we should ask SOE for a new feature that keeps track of how long a person has been camping a certain creature.  Then anyone can show up at a camping spot, and if someone is there, they can type something like /howlongStormfeather (player name) and it will report back how long overall this person has been waiting for Stormfeather and how many times said player has actually killed it.<br>
<br>
Do you think that will change things?  Me either.  But I still respectfully disagree that one person should be recognized over another for a specific target just because they have been there longer *currently* <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=544939">Shaveil</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Yes, you chose the sit-and-wait for 48 hours method while Borm chose the come-in-when-he-is-on method. The fact that he used an alt is a moot point. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
So your idea is even if somebody is sitting at a static spawn point waiting for a mob to pop you can just turn up and damage it first?<br>
<br>
So as a ranger I can go to any camp anywhere regardless of it being camped and (given that I have a bow) pull any mob and then claim &quot;SOE doesn't respect camps&quot;.  Thats pure BS.<br>
<br>
I spoke to a GM once regarding Lodizal and KS'ing and the GM basically told me this<br>
<br>
&quot;While SOE doesn't respect camps, the players decide what is right and wrong when it comes to camping&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about this, OOT AC, 6 mins spawn random Cyclops, Pirate, Ogre, Goblin, Ancient Cyclops.  Can take up to 24 hours to spawn the AC.  Can this be camped or are you allowed to wait till the AC spawns and then do a damage first KS?  <br>
<br>
Answer: yes you can KS, is it right though?<br>
<br>
<br>
Some monk in Lower Guk camping Raster with a shaman friend, some non monk logs back in from a few days ago on their alt to check their farm and raster pops.  Monks getting buffed for the fight because he's around the same level and would die without buffs.  Can the farmer pull raster and say oh well first blood?<br>
<br>
Answer: yes, would the playerbase like it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Glyphed in Srra, lets say Resolution has just killed the triggers and he pops, Can FnF run in now and kill him and then claim First Blood?? <br>
<br>
Answer: yes they can, would they do it,  No, why not?.<br>
<br>
<br>
You people that are trying to defend blatant killstealing with the &quot;Sony doesn't respect camps&quot; may just find yourselfs griefed in the same way in the future and please if you do don't come here and whine about it.<br>
<br>
I've been playing on FV for 2 years now and I feel that 99% of the server does respect a persons camp and I feels its an accepted part of our server.  Take your &quot;SOE&quot; excuse and risk the consequences of being shunned when you ks people.<br>
<br>
<br>
One thing I would like to ask and something which has'nt been mentioned here yet.  Was Kortoha there before you turned up Borm?<br>

I've heard it complained that somebody out there is pretty much ganking Stormfeather on a daily basis, and I wrongly assumed from Borm's first post that he was the person doing this.  I was quite obviously in the wrong here.  I have needlessly and hastily attacked him here, and I regret doing so now.  I apologize for also thinking he was a member of Resolution.  My initial post was based largely around that assumption. ( Tribulation/Resolution !  got 'em mixed up ! Ack. )  I thought it quite unreasonable that an alt of a very high-level guild would basically be keeping Stormfeather to theirselves.  I apologize for the error.  Mostly it is upsetting to me when high-level characters run rampant over the hunting grounds of those &quot;lower&quot; than them.  This looks to be what Kortoha did.  But I don't know, I wasn't there, and I should have kept my fingers off the keyboard last night.<br>
<br>
I do not hate the higher-level folks here.  Most of them are very gracious, decent people.  I have aided a number of folks in achieving pieces for their epics, and helped people in Fire and Fury camp for their lucid shards.  Resolution recently was very nice to a bunch of us mid-50s folks and dragged us all the way to the Plane of Mischief, even allowing us to hunt and die at their sides.  It was one of the best experiences of my EQ life.  I was not angry at people that are uber, I was angry about what I perceived was using that uberness to monopolize a very controversial and ugly spawn point.  Again I was incorrect in my assumptions.  I assumed, and made an ass out of not &quot;u,&quot; but only &quot;me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Borm, please accept my humblest apologies for my unjustifed attack on you and your integrity.  I can only hope you will forgive me.  I really feel like a dumbass for jumping to conclusions like this.  My apologies to Resolution for wrongly associating you with this mess.  And I apologize to the moderatin' team, you all do a top-notch job, both in-game and out. Feel free to give me a title like &quot;Assclown of the Month, March, 2003,&quot; for what I've done here.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=decius1@firionavie>Decius1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 299<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/29/03 3:03:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2845.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Kortoha, Vindicators of Norrath, YOU KSing Dog</span><hr size=1> /applaud Elsbet<br>

<br>
It means you kill it and it is yours. Does that mean that attacking it after someone else draws agro first is legal? Yes. Does it mean that person is honorable for doing it? No. <br>
<br>
I am not gonna make a judgement on who was right or wrong. I am gonna tell you Guide/GM reaction. Guides/GMs are not going to do anything on a free-for-all type of mob. The reason is because before they can arrive and witness the act, it is already over. No they are not gonna camp alongside you for 12 hours to be sure you don't get KSed. <br>
<br>
Now, if you have a /reported confession of the person saying he KSed you, they WILL take action. The alleged confession posted here will not fly. So the bottom line is nothing is going to happen. <br>

It is unfortunate that camps like this exist. It just brews bad feelings. <br>
