<br>
Yesterday I was hunting on the Moon again, in an area that is called Marus Seru. To be frank, I donít like this place very much. Sure, it is a good hunting area, and the guards tend to be nice even to us dark elves. But unfortunately there is bright sunshine the entire day which disturbs my meditation permanently.<br>
I was grouping with Sanayn, a young feline bard, very friendly (as most kitties are), and her regeneration powers made a very useful addition. My skelly likewise was happy to be together with Sanayn.<br>
After a few hours hunting those grabbers and hoppers, doggies and sandrunners around there, we sat down a while to refresh our bodies and minds, when suddenly a small stone was tossed by someone at my skellies shoulder, nearly knocking it off. What an insult, my poor innocent skelly attacked from behind without warning.<br>
Then I saw the offender: It was a rather tall, blonde, human warrior, sitting on a hill nearby, wielding a glittering sword in his hands, wearing a suit of bright armor. At once I felt what he was: A paladin! One of those evil evil beings hunting down mercilessly all members of our race, slaughtering our innocent skellies. I started to tremble and felt very uncomfortable. I thought whether I should flee, but then preferred to confront him, with words of course Å as I always do.<br>
I hailed him, and to my surprise he answered in Dark Elvish: ëGreetings!Å<br>
A paladin willingly speaking our language, a strange being indeed.<br>
Sanayn obviously didnít realize my or his feelings and asked him directly to join our forces. I pouted and shivered. Would he continue to toss things at my skelly? Would he insult me? All the paladins I have met so far were very bad guys. I had never insulted a paladin before, but the insults I heard from the mouths of paladins had been disgusting. I was pondering: ìMaybe it is a good sign that he started to speak in Dark Elven language. As long as Sanayn would be with me to protect me, we could try it; I should be extremely careful thoughÖí<br>
While I was thinking this way, the paladin suddenly said: 'Don't usually hunt with<br>
necromancers, but sheís the nicest bone raiser I've come across . Why not?'<br>
I was surprised: ëNicest bone raiserÅ? Me? Words I would never had expected from a paladin. I wondered why he thought that way. I donít know how I look in the eyes of the humans, but I was wearing one of those Iksar Pariah masks at that time; so maybe he didnít think this way because of my looks. Maybe it was just the fact, that I didnít attack or insult him. But Iíd never do that; I just want peace with everybody who respects my dark heritage.<br>
So I answered: 'There are other races in this group as well... and you'll see I don't bite. You may join, if you want. Might I know your name please?'<br>
ëI am Bakanome, paladin from Freeport. Maybe you donít know me, but I have heard of you. I have friends that have met you before, one of them is Kimaya. If she can deal with you, I can as well! 30th season paladin at your service!Å<br>
Well the last sentence was not meant for me but rather for Sanayn.<br>
I still felt a bit nervous. In school I had learned to avoid contact with any paladin, and my previous encounters with other paladins had taught me the same.<br>
'First time I group with a paladin, but so be it....', I mumbled. 'You, you, you won't kill my skelly, Bakanome?'<br>
'Not if your skelly doesn't kill me, and so far, at the faires, he hasn't tried.' Bakanome smiled.<br>
ëMy skelly wouldnít hurt anyone!Å, I replied. And Sanayn also said: ëI can testify it s a good skelly! He doesnít bite.'<br>
'I think I'll just pretend it's a human shadowknight skelly', was his reaction.<br>
We resumed hunting, while I was still pondering whether there was a difference between human and dark elven made skellies.<br>
The hunting went surprisingly well. Sure, the paladin watched me cautiously, as if I might try to attack him from behind any time. But I also watched him all the time.<br>
While we were resting again after a tough fight, Sanayn asked Bakanome: ëItís a great sword, you have, Bakanome. What sort is it?Å<br>
'It actually has a name, Xotal, but the base is called Ghoulbane. It has magical powers against undead.'<br>
I shrugged: ëMy skelly, my poor innocent skellyÅ. if you scratch it, I will, I willÖí<br>
Bakanome laughed. ëRelax, bone raiser. As I said, I wonít hurt it unless it hurts me.Å<br>
Another Vah Shir joined our forces, Inaudax, a young beast lord. I welcomed him:<br>
ëNice to meet you, feline friend!Å<br>
Bakanome said: 'I must say, you are one of the more charming necromancers I have come across, Teiraa. I simply do not fight for or alongside shadowknights of necromancers full stop. Usually. But I have made very, very rare exceptions.'<br>
Obviously he hadnít expected that we dark elfies also know the word ëfriendÅ.<br>
I sighed: 'I usually don't group paladins as well, too many have insulted me... they call me ink blotch or use even dirtier words... We also have feelings and are very sensitive, and we are a race with a long venerable history as well.Å<br>
'Not so I. I honour each and every person who shows me honour themselves, regardless of class or kin. By the way, I can see my house from here!'<br>
I was surprised. We were on Luclin, but, yes! Many people I have met in Marus Seru told me that it was possible to see Norrath. But for me the sky was much too bright. I could only guess that there was something like a disk on the sky, but couldnít see it very clear.<br>
Bakanome told me, that his sword, Xotal, had magical powers that could allow me to see Norrath. I should have a look at Norrath through itís aura, because it might make it a little easier to see for me. He lifted the sword, turned it into my direction, and suddenly I was engulfed in a gray aura, and the sky darkened and changed itís color. Yes, there was it, Norrath! I could see it very clear now, like a huge marble on the sky. It was bigger than I though of, and was shining in dark green color, slowly changing into dark red, then to crimson. The change of colors was obviously an effect of the sword.<br>
I was just wondering what the real color of Norrath might be, but suddenly there was a bright flash of light that knocked me down. Yikes! The sword had changed itís mind, it was no longer filtering the light but rather intensifying it. The flash was so immense that I was blinded for several minutes. I felt that Bakanome put the sword away and gave me support that I wouldnít fall down.<br>
After I had calmed down, I asked him: ëAre you sure, that your sword likes me?Å He replied: 'I don't know, you know how swords are. Donít be worried though.' But I was worried; not about Bakanome himself, but his sword was really terrible. I should be more cautious the next time. But I have seen Norrath, this wonderful world. When would I be able to enter Neriak, this beautiful dark city, again? I felt that homesickness was growing in my heart. When again?<br>
