That's impossible. While my own parents had been killed long before they could tell me the tales, my old mentor that took me in afterwards often used such stories to keep us youngsters in line. &quot;If'n ya git caut, da Skin Takers will be a'takin yer hands&quot;  or so he claimed.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And Maelgroth, how does he fit in? With Gray's vanishing I haven't paid as much attention ta the new arrivals as I used ta. Of course the whole Renux deal took some time ta settle too. I think its time for another inspection of the D'Aryth security again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  she thought to herself as her breathing settled down. Pausing briefly to make sure her sudden departure hadn't been noticed by the young League member, the thought that perhaps the chest had been stolen crossed her mind.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No, that wouldn't work- those smart chests would recognize who could and who couldn't use it. If a rogue came in to try and steal it they'd just find his corpse next to the chest the following day.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she realized. Now the question came as to whether she should report back to Nystyre with her discovery. Technically the contract had been fulfilled. But this was a Shadow involved now, things changed a bit.<br>
<br>
  She had always sought out the newcomers to measure the possibility of gaining their alliance in her own quest for self preservation against Gray's plottings. Knowing what she now knew, this Maelgroth might prove useful to her own plans. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course his magics would prove troublesome if their paths went against each other. No better to learn more, the more leverage she had the better. At least better to have some in case the necromancer did side with Gray.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she concluded.<br>
<br>
   Then her thoughts turned to the old woman who had left the shack, Maelgroth hadn't mentioned anything about a mother in her hearing, but she had been busy as well. A grandmother perhaps? In any event she was connected in some way to this. <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Better to follow the old woman, who knows where she might lead me to</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri concluded as she tried to remember the old woman's route. Fortunately the old woman didn't travel too fast and to one who was born and raised in these streets Kyri was quick to find her target and maintain enough distance to observe while not appearing to except to the most paranoid of eyes.<br>
<br>
  The old woman appeared to be in no hurry in her wanderings making her way. Kyri noticed some eyes were indeed following her, the underlings of the Truth Finders- who actually seemed to number quiet a few among her snitches, and truth was purely optional she had found as well. Since she seldom returned to her home city her presence was often noted among the mighty as her reputation had grown a bit through her adventures- let alone the ones the common folk hadn't heard about. The assassin's guild had its own networks after all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guess i should lave a false trail or two then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thoguht as she felt the eyes on her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The old woman won't get too far ahead</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri figured as she made a detour to the bank watching the old woman head to the second gate. Chatting idly with the banker, who for some reason started closing and locking everything in arms reach when he saw her enter, she lingered and took out a few coins. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yes i'm just picking up some pocket change,nothing to see</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she muttered to herself as she left.<br>
<br>
   Picking up the trail again, Kyri was a bit surprised to find the woman move on to the 3rd gate. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What would an old woman from too poor to move out of the foreign quarter be doing here?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri wondered. Now very curious, making sure she still wasn't being followed, even checking for unseen watchers. Kyri moved into the 3rd gate herself.<br>
<br>
  She wasn't exactly a regular here either, at least during the day. But she did have an excuse, one she hadn't really done much with for some time if questioned. In the end her tracking didn't have far to go as the old woman stepped into the great temple to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
  Kyri stopped, not willing to enter the temple of a lesser divinity such as Innoruuk, the priests there recalled her from her youth when she first heard the call of Lord Platinum as she watched these priests demand payment before releasing their scrolls of learning to the younger priests. Naturally she would not be welcome there and might cause a commotion to get her noticed. And notice was a bad thing.<br>
<br>
  Slipping to plan B, she moved past the temple to the Furrier Royale and slipped inside. Now it had been a long time since she had done any tailoring but she still remember the basics. While she had no desire to pick up that trade again, she ordered a few patterns to keep up appearances, and at least it WAS a legitimate reason for her to come to the third gate for any spying eyes to report. <br>
<br>
  The real reason why she came this way was that the owner of the shop was actually an agent of house De'Vir, one to whom she had passed messages back and forth for those times when it wasn't appropriate for her to appear too often at the De'Vir estates. From what she knew, this &quot;tailor&quot; was rather high up in the ranks, chosen for his ability to pass things along and keep quiet. Kyri suspected he had a false tooth with a poison capsule in case of capture.<br>
<br>
  &quot;So will that be all?&quot; the tailor asked packing up the patterns.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes that's all for today, some sewing might help relax me.&quot; Kyri answered sending some coins which hid a small scrap of paper she had hastily scrawled on her way here.<br>
<br>
  Taking the coins and note, while pretending not to see the note, the tailor smiled and said &quot;Well then, enjoy your rest. Perhaps i'll see you again if you need to relax some more.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Smiling back Kyri answered &quot;Yes if i discover i need more patterns to put together i'll defintiely be coming back.&quot;<br>
<br>
   As she left the shop the tailor/agent looked briefly at the hastily scrawled riddle that he would be passing on to Lord De'vir. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Remember what was taken, the boogyman might still live.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>   Well His Lordship might be able to make sense of this gibberish, but i sure don't. But they don't pay me for that.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the tailor mused as Kyri left . Putting the note in among the next batch of dispatches to be delivered the tailor went back to business.<br>
<br>
   Kyri decided since she was so close, to visit the guild halls of the Ebon Mask. She was still amused by the front they maintained as none of the members wore a piercing weapon, rather relying on swords like there were some group of warriors. Disguising one's self to limit your combat effectiveness never seemed prudent to her. The place was a bit more chaotic than usual, the feud of the two houses was certainly good for business it seemed. A lot of the faces here seemed new to her. The young novices she had left now grown into useful members of the Mask. Few equalled her skill now though- including some of her old trainers she noticed. <br>
<br>
   Her business there complete, she stopped to pick up some fishing gear and made her way back to the moat around the temple. The old woman would surely still be there since Kyri's side trips only took a few minutes. In any case Kyri knew where she lived. While frowned upon by the watch usually, some folk sought to fish in the moat around the temple, fed by underground streams to ensure a steady supply of fish. And of course the watch could always be paid to look the other way if the fisher agreed to stay out of the main passageway.<br>
<br>
  Making the appropriate brides Kyri tossed out her line in a spot behind the enterance to the Temple. Far enough away to not be noticed but close enough to be able to see anyone coming or going from the second gate. Not the best fisher around Kyri figured at worst she'd have a couple of fish for supper tonight. nything extra she'd pass along to some urchin to feed whatever den of pickpockets the urchin was from. Greedy she might be, but Kyri did pay her debts and having been taken in by one such group in her own youth she owed those groups a helping hand from time to time.<br>
<br>
  And so Kyri sat back and idly wondered if her first bite would come off the fishing line, or from her intended target.<br>
