3 words...<br>
United we stand.<br>
<br>
Face it, you won't see much of the high-level content of EverQuest on your own. It was designed to be hard, to be conquered by the combined effort of a large roup of people.<br>
<br>
Don't throw stones to the so-called Uber-Guilds, as far as I know we (as Resolution) don't call ourselves this way. We refer as ourselves as friends, as a family.<br>
<br>
Yes, it's not easy to join the ranks of those pretending to push farther and farther the challenges, but if you expect to see everything just by snapping fingers and tap foot while it comes served to your feet, then good luck. You'll starve.<br>
<br>
You have to work your way up, to win harder and harder challenges.<br>
<br>
Now Ogah says it's none of our (as the FV comunity) business... Pffff... You were trusted among us, and by the position you had, we trusted you and made us through you more powerfull, best fitted to new, harder challenges.<br>
<br>
Yet you turn your back now. And we learn that not only that, but you also cheated on others before. Not only it's the business of ALL people here, it's also a duty to point out at people like you. If all that was said about you is true, then it's also obvious that you're not one to have the slightest scruple. Serion's hopeless in this department, guys like you don't feel bad when they rip others.<br>

Obviously Ogah/Akane/Joe or whatever he will be in his next reroll really isnt sorry for what he did.  <br>
<br>
Imo if he was sorry for it, and wanted to salvage any last scrap of integrity and honor he had.. All the gear that he is currently selling in the bazarre would have been given to back to the people who helped him earn it.  The folks who gave him another chance.  Resolution.<br>
<br>
I'm more sorry for the people who trusted him than anything else.  I hope you guys can recover quickly and dont let it jade you to think that everyone is like that.<br>

The situation with uberguilds being gated IS a problem with the game... Its why I left behind several 55+ characters on other servers.

FnF has some pretty tough entry requirements. Yet we still get people applying and getting in. I am sure the folks in Reso are experiencing the same thing.<br>
<br>
Don't like FnF or Reso? Thats fine. Do what Awakened souls did. Start your own guild. I hear they pretty much cleared PoG last weekend. Got a nice Enchanter Robe too. Congrats you guys.<br>
<br>
There is absolutely NOTHING that prevents people from playing the high end game that YOU can't overcome if you put your mind to it. As proof, I point to the many different types of high end guilds on many different servers who's numbers range anywhere from 30 to 300. Getting to play in the high end game in EQ is no different than trying to achieve anything in life. If you want it bad enough just work hard for it.<br>

Joe has reimbursed me for the Nabiki account.<br>

Charles (shoug) sent me his home phone number lastnight and I called him.  After some conversation, it does not appear that he had any involvment with the stealing of Nabiki (other than as a moneychanger), and I want to thank him for his assistance and patience.  <br>
<br>
As promised to Joe and Charles, since I have been reimbursed I will be canceling the complaints I lodged via PayPal and the IFCC.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your comments in this thread.  I found some of them insightful, and learned from the different perspectives presented.<br>

<br>
While you are right, Kzan, about the gating here on FV and MANY other servers, that is not actually the case on some.<br>
<br>
Several uberguilds (FoH, etc) have admitted to having VI employees in their midst at one time or another. Most of these guilds have a 'blackball' policy... if ONE person dislikes you, you cannot get in.<br>
<br>
Since in the past, VI employees were members... you can see where this is a VERY sticky situation.<br>
<br>
Add to that the fact that many uberguilds have some disagreeable sorts as members (reference this thread), and you can see why I have a problem with it.<br>
<br>
Sometimes real assholes can gain the respect and ear of persons with influence... and ruin things for people they don't like.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest reasons I left my old server is because disagreeable people in my own guild were ruining the high level game for those I thought were quality people... both by keeping them out of our guild, and by smearing some of them bad enough to keep them out of other guilds. It was creating a guild of people who either WERE disagreeable (read: assholes) or were willing to let the assholes run rampant.<br>
<br>
While this doesn't happen here, I feel very strongly about disagreeable people being allowed to influence whether or not and when people experience the high level game.<br>
<br>
There is, in my opinion, no reason why one person should have to expend significantly more effort to get into the high level game. There is also no reason to have to deal with small minded people when you are playing a game for fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=885.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=885.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=885.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=885.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=885.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
