Even with the most trivial of mobs, like newbie mobs (fire beetles, decaying skeletons, etc.) do you think it should still be frowned upon to attack a mob that is already engaged?<br>
Should the person whom had already engaged the mob have every right to comment to the person who stole the kill about their KSing?<br>

<br>
That said, it's not worth making a big deal out of it if somebody KSes your fire beetle.  It's not as if theres a shortage of them and in the time you spend complaining you likely could have killed four beetles.  Mistakes happen and everybody has killstolen at one time or another.  Lipping off to someone because they KS a minor mob from you once probably isn't very wise.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if somebody is following you around, KSing half of the mobs you engage, that's harassment and should be reported.<br>
<br>
But remember that there's a chance that the people KSing fire beetles and the like are true newbies and don't yet understand what KSing is and why it's wrong.  They should be asked to stop and should have it politely explained to them that what they're doing is frowned upon and against the rules of the game (this, in my opinion, is not something that needs to be roleplayed... it an aspect of gameplay guidelines/etiquette... from an in character perspective, it's difficult to roleplay KSing as something that's wrong unless you're RPing such a rude, hateful or proud character that they can't tolerate someone helping them in battle.) <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT><BR>

I currently have a level 4 rogue, I was 3 at the time. About a blue bulb from 4. Saw a decaying skeleton, normally wouldn't bother. This one had a staff though, and the corpse I was waiting to collect in QH had some bone chips on it too so I was like, why not? Could be a cracked staff, 1pp loot is obviously good at 3. I attack, get a shot in, here comes this monk and BAM, skeleton dead. I said &quot;excuse me&quot; and was given a &quot;your excused.&quot; So I sent a tell saying &quot;Did you not notice the mob was engaged or do you just KS like that usually?&quot; Yeah, it was a rude tell, but so is KSing. I didn't expect much more. Turned out to be the other person who suddenly makes a big deal. I get flamed for being a noob, though I had to explain having a new character and being a noob are 2 different things. Apparently only a noob would comment that they were KSed of a skellie like that.<br>
/shrug<br>
While I was running around going about my business, this person is standing there unable to do more than flame me. I was just amused by the whole thing. Person tells me about all their other high end characters and how I'm a noob, yet their reasoning behind KSing was &quot;cut me some slack, I'm a monk it had a stick that turned out to be a 2hb so I dropped it noob.&quot; Just sounded kinda silly to me.<br>
<br>
Oh well, hell of a long story for something so simple eh? KSing to me is KSing, regardless of the mob, unless someone didn't notice it was engaged, easy to do with lvl one mobs that can die so quickly. When it's out of pure greed because this person wanted a staff though, I think that's just plain wack. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukentassolgaard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kentas Solgaard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Eats Halflings</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/1/02 9:16:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=999.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.personal.psu.edu/students/b/t/btk120/MOKONA.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Avarice is one of the seven.</span><hr size=1> Yeah, this idiot was being greedy.<br>
<br>
KSing happens.  Whether it's accidental (they were trying to help) or purposeful (they were trying to help and just hoping you'd die) it's a fact of life.  How you handle it is another story.<br>
<br>
If all this idiot can do is follow you around and tell high levels about you, or KS you back, /ignore him, then lead him through the Freeport sewers.  I've always appreciated the fact that they're not easily navigable, and the ones from West to East now have those zombie drowned citizens, who will make short work of him if he falls.<br>
<br>
(Yes, I know, someone came on and bitched about how someone did this with the Nektulos guards, but when it happens to you, you get cruel too.)<br>
<br>
My dad was playing his rogue and needed baking supplies.  He got yelled at for KSing a bat.  A BAT.  I laughed hard, insulted his intelligence, announced to the zone that I was putting him on ignore--it was a bat--and went about my merry way.  Most of them were already yelling at him to shut up.<br>
<br>
My Rallos experience decided it wanted to say something:<br>
<br>
Here, moron, have a plat for the staff and get back to your pharming druid on your carebear server, before I decide to loot it off your corpse.<br>

Rare, but it's happened to me a few times, especially at earlier levels, especially over monsters with staves (go figure).<br>
<br>
What annoys me more are the ones who are KSing for loot and then, when informed that they were attempting to (or succeeded at) stealing your kill, claim they were &quot;just trying to help&quot;.<br>
<br>
I learned, early on on &quot;Orc Hill&quot; in the Greater Faydark, how to deal with these people.  I step back from the monster and let the monster aggro on them so they can take the damage from the monster they're trying to steal.  I've surprised and enraged a few people by doing that, but I don't feel it's my responsibility to stand there and take the damage so that someone else can steal the experience and the loot.<br>
<br>
When I am &quot;just trying to help&quot;, I toss around damage shields (Shield of Brambles) and the occasional damage over time spell (Stinging Swarm, which, it appears, don't have the effect of stealing kills like direct damage spells do), and  I'll heal someone who's in dire straits.<br>

One is a question - easy to help with spells, but how to you help as a melee type. I see someone gets squashed by a mob - only way to help is engage the mob, maybe KS. Otherwise, the guy may die - dilemma. <br>
<br>
Another - advice. If the KSer say he just wanted to help - well, have him give you the loot then. You lost the exp. but the loot (staff? hehe) is still recoverable if the intentions were honorable. I would never keep the loot from any mob killed to help.<br>

And I don't consider it KSing if someone's /yelled for help.<br>

As for meleers, make sure the person really needs help.  I've had a number of would-be-saviors come rushing up to &quot;help&quot; me when I've got most, if not all, of my hit points and mana.  If there's no /yell, then ask if they need or want your help.  Don't assume they do.<br>

I've only had two KSers offer the loot, after I told them they stole my kill, and I turned it down both times.  All the others I've been KSed by dove in, looted, and jetted out ASAP.<br>

<br>
And yes, even if you are just killing bats 50 feet from the gate in Qeynos, it is KSing. Just starting out on this server when it went live, there was a LOT of competition in the newbie zones even for the basic MOBS. I generally didn't say much if it was a bat, snake, beetle or rat, but the Gnoll Pups and Decaying Skels are rarer (not rare, but there are fewer) and they drop things that are useful. Like bone chips for one quest, small bags and coin, rusty weapons that you need as a poor young newbie. <br>
<br>
And if someone yells for help, it is not KSing, obviously. <p>Palantiri, Ranger of Norrath<BR>Sacred Jesters Of Quellious, Woodfellas<BR>Cosmos Mariner, Destination Unknown<BR>www.angelfire.com/games2/NNB/ <BR><BR>Dohneagle of Firiona Vie<BR><BR>Why is it that every MOB you are hunting is never found unless you are on a corpse run, when they are at every turn?<BR>
