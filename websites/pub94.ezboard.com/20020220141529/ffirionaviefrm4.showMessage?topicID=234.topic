Need some advice</span><hr size=1> Alright, as I mentioned in another post, I've only had one situation where the sexual harrassment really ticked me off. I will not mention any names in this so as not to let this incident become more than it is, and I honestly thought it was just a one time run-in with a jerk, but that was not to be. This is kinda long.<br><br>Last week, this jerk, (who is guilded which shocks me)  who I vaguely remembered from my newbie days as being a d00d, comes up to me and my friend, also a female,  just comes up and tells us flat out what nice (insert female body part here) we have. Of course, it was typed in caps as well, always the sign of a twit. Anyway, my friend proceeds to tell him off, I say a few things, he makes more suggestive comments about &quot;giving it to us&quot; blah blah blah, typical pig. He finally leaves, I remembered his name in case I ever had the displeasure again, and that was that. <br><br>Well, last night, I'm with my group of regular friends, all males and they all know that I'm pretty easy going, unless someone really ticks me off. Well, this jerk is there again, and he comes up to my group asking for someone to please bind him, as he keeps dying and it's a long CR. Well, the only people in the group that can bind are yours truly and one of my friends. <br>Maybe this is petty of me but I refuse to help someone like that. I let my friends know in group chat what this guy had done and that I refuse to do a damn thing for him, if they wanted to that was fine but I wouldn't lift a finger. Upon hearing of what he had done, they didn't want to help him either. So I let him know that we wouldn't help him and exactly why we wouldn't help him either. He then trys being nice to me in /tell, no apology mind you, just trying to be nice so he can get what he wants. I saw no apology forthcoming so I didn't change my stance. He finally leaves, and I figure once again, that's the end of it.<br><br>Well, evidently there isn't anyone else in the zone that will bind him either, no idea why, people,including me, are usually really nice about binding there, it's a rough area and usually pretty populated. About 30 minutes later he comes back with a guildmate in tow. My friend knows the guildmate and says he's a nice fellow, so the guildmate trys to smooth things out, all the while, the jerk is standing around saying &quot;Haha, um, yeah&quot; no actual complete sentences, no apology, no intelligent conversation. He's still not getting a bind. Well, the guildmate needed a bind and he was a nice fellow so my friend bound him, but we still didn't bind the jerk. He finally left after realizing it just wasn't going to happen.<br><br>Now, I'm sure I handled this wrong, but seeing as the guy never apoligized and just stood around and laughed about the whole thing, what would've been the best way to handle it?<br><br> <p>Narie<br>The Bumbling Half Elf Druid<br>Now debuting in her 14th season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/15/02 7:41:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Situation I was in..

Need some advice</span><hr size=1> /agree<br><br>You handled it just fine.<br><br>There are WAY too many goofs that pull &quot;cyber&quot; stunts here.  The other side of the coin is that they are not all men.  On the old server there were a number of female characters....some RL Women, some not, that &quot;cyber&quot; talked for a number of reasons: to gain power in guild, gain pp, gain items, coax a player to group with them a lot or cast buffs on them or whatever...<br><br>On gal I know of, who was a RL gal, worked her way into a guild, up the ranks and destroyed 2-3 players with this activity.  Now if you look at it from a RP point of view that actually probably really happens in our &quot;Norath of RP&quot;.  Evil women using all of their assets to get what they want.  But the sad truth is that she had a bad rep and this guild lost a few good people who were probably nice fellows, but easy prey.<br><br>But back to the point.  Yes you did fine and stick to your guns.  Dont buff or bind people who are mean.  MEAN PEOPLE SUCK!<br><br>You can RP mean as long as you let the person know in an /OOC tell that its all in fun RP cuz otherwise you are just an ass.

Just because we are playing a game doesn't mean you owe any favors to someone who's been a jerk toward you, any more than you do anywhere else.  And if anyone tries to say that you do, just explain to them why you won't help the guy.  You'll only be doing your bit to keep our server nice and healthy, by publicizing the reputations of those that have earned bad ones.<br><br>Valquiss<br><br>P.S.  Oh, agree, btw, Kimaya.  I was making general statements about people who've been jerks in the past and your right to hold a grudge, but in specific about sexual harassment like that, report it.  Report it.  I'm with you 120% on that.  Scroll back to the lines in question on your screen, enter /report (insert jerk's name here) and then petition it.  That report command makes sure you have the evidence for later.  And I've lost at least one rightous arguement by not doing that. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A> at: 1/16/02 12:35:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 1:52:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=234.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Situation I was in..
