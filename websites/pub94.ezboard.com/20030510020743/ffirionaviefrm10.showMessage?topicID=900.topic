<br>
The Faydark was as cheerful as ever. The birds chirped in the canopy above, and Elven voices carried far on the breeze. Kullgen stood with the other members of the Shadows, staring down the hill at the entrance to the Pale City of Felwithe, but her mind was farther south, and a week in the past.<br>
<br>
She could still hear Shintou's shouts echoing against the bark and in the loam. If she closed her eyes to focus, his face appeared before her, staring with empty eyes into her own. <br>
<br>
Kullgen stabbed her blade into the ground, and rubbed at her left wrist. He had clutched her hands not far from here as he clung to life, and she'd felt his Touch lance through her like cold fire. It wasn't the first Touch she'd taken, but it was the only of its kind she'd ever known. As she'd fallen to the ground, her eyes staring blankly, she'd felt hollow, barren. Where her own Hate had sat there was only a desolate coldness. She hadn't thought it possible, but ... <br>
<br>
&quot;Kullgen.&quot; She turned, blinking, to face Cora's scaled snout. &quot;The Priestesses are done with the blessings, and I've finished with my magicks. The Shadows are ready.&quot; She nodded, and pulled her sword from the earth. The Knight ignored the numbness in her left hand, and tightened her grip with the right. <br>
<br>
The League marched on the lands of the Light under her direction that day. Kullgen had hoped it would stir her, that seeing the blood flow from the children of Tunare and Brell would stoke her rage once more, and fill the steel void in her chest. Instead, as she swung at Elf, Dwarf, Human and runtling, her fury wouldn't come. She swung out of reflex rather than true malice, and her mind repeatedly strayed to the passionless face of the halfbreed that had at once inspired and stolen the Hate from her very soul.<br>

<br>
The numbness had gotten worse.<br>
<br>
The Knight couldn't tell, however, if its terrible coldness had spread up from the tingling in her left wrist, or down from the ache in her chest. Either way, her left arm was nearly useless, and she sat leaning against a withered tree in New Tanaan.<br>
<br>
She hadn't told Evariel. She couldn't summon the energy for the conversation, the questions it would bring. Once, she'd have hidden the wound from the Bonecaster to avoid seeing worry in her blue eyes, but now she stayed quiet out of weariness and apathy. Besides, it had been days since she'd seen her fiancee, who was studying and training hard at the Teir`dal outpost in Kunark. <br>
<br>
Kullgen refused to set foot near the cursed place. He was there, wasting his time on the Sarnaks. He, the one that had caused this pain, the one thing she could summon a morsel of emotion over. The only flickering of Hate left in her burned for the Knight, and kept her breathing. If only she were strong enough ... <br>
<br>
She tried flexing her hand, but watched in resignation as the fingers barely twitched. She'd never fell him in this state. Soon, if the spread of the cold ... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nothing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wasn't stopped, it would sprawl across her like a rash, a slithering weakness eating her from within. <br>
<br>
She wondered if he felt different since he'd sucked the Hate from her bones and left her shattered, or if not even her small infusion made any difference. Certainly, he was still wallowing in self-pity. No, no  - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>meditating</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The thought of her pain, her empty sacrifice wasted made her grit her teeth. <br>
<br>
Kullgen stood slowly, and staggered. The Hollow, as she had taken to calling it in her mind, was sliding down her ribs. Next her left leg would go, she figured. He was the key, she knew. Somehow ... if she were to beat him, crippled and wounded as she was, so far below his rank ... <br>
<br>
It was hopeless, but it was the only answer she could muster. With clenched jaw, and a weary sigh, she touched the Stone that led to the Overthere, intent on one answer or another. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kullgendphlith>Kullgen dPhlith</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~subacca/spin.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>NOT A MAN</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/14/03 1:44:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=900.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~subacca/come_here.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hollow Within</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THREE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
The Kunark sun blasted down on her helm as she stalked about the Outpost. Sweat ran in streams down her temples and neck, and she called out once more.<br>
<br>
&quot;SHINAI!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing. For once, he wasn't near the outpost, and had left off his Sarnak genocide for the moment. She sighed. Once, she'd have cursed and struck out at a nearby rhino or walking cactus, but now she simply sighed. Her theory would go untested, it seemed, and she'd remain numb, crippled.<br>
<br>
The lightest touch to the pages of the book sent her back to New Tanaan, and she wandered aimlessly, mindlessly. As she neared the neutral center of the Plane, she saw him. For a moment, disappointment flared that she had come upon him in the peace-enforced city, but perhaps she'd have an answer after all.<br>
<br>
&quot;There you are.&quot; She stepped in front of him, and let her shield fall to her feet, baring her withered arm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Kullgen?&quot; No malice. No anger. Nothing. He seemed as soulless as she felt. <br>
<br>
She only had one true question for him. &quot;Why? Why did you come that day in the Forest?&quot;<br>
<br>
They spoke in enforced civility for a time, and whether it was her apathy or his reasonings, she felt her last spark of Hate smother. The Hollow in her called out to the empty in his own soul, and for she found herself confiding in the halfbreed, and he seemed to understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;My passion,&quot; he intoned, &quot;was raped out of me by the neutralic machine. It died as I saw my dream burn away in their own blasts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kullgen's eyes narrowed. &quot;At least your enemies are the ones that stole it from you. Mine was stabbed in the spine by someone I thought an ally.&quot; Perhaps Kaileena had taught him something after all, she mused.<br>
<br>
Shintou was uncomfortable speaking in the neutral section of the Plane, and she followed him to the Outpost. She told him of the effect of his Hand, the Touch he'd used on her, and how she could barely lift her blade. &quot;I'd thought,&quot; she muttered, &quot;that if I found you, and looked at you that at least my Hate would stir again, or at least I'd end the numbness on your blade. When I used my Touch on you, something was sucked from me, Shinai. When you reacted, and used yours, my flesh withered.&quot;<br>
<br>
He shruged at the puckered flesh of her arm. &quot;Maybe if we did it again, the Hatred would flow back within you? I've never known the Malious Hand to do that... I ... I'm sorry Kullgen. I don't know what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not even now could she hate him. He hadn't intended it, and was as perplexed as she was. She leaned on her sword like an old woman's cane. &quot;All we can do is try. Either it will work, or it will end me. Either is preferable to this ... nothingness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shintou sighed, and shook his head. &quot;I have a hard time hating you, Kullgen. I have no reason to.&quot;<br>
<br>
For the first time in a week, the Knight felt a slight bubble of emotion as she smirked. &quot;Since when does Shintou Shinai need a reason?&quot;<br>
<br>
They walked out of the sight of the over-zealous guards, and Shintou's fist began to glow a fierce, sickly green she'd seen before. Without another word, he struck, unleashing the Hate into her chest.<br>
<br>
The heat was unbearble. She burned from the inside out as her lifeblood splattered the halfbreed's face. Kullgen felt the twisting, searing pain shoot down her arms, her torso, her legs, and she fell to her knees. She lived, but was bleeding heavily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well?&quot; The Knight demanded. <br>
<br>
&quot;It ... &quot; she croaked, unable to squeeze the other words out through her spasming throat. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>...burns oh Father it burns but it BURNS I feel it fire pain hatehatehate ... </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She could smell the seared flesh of her chest and arms, and she looked up, her eyes blazing through her own blood. Her Hate had been returned even stronger, but at what cost?<br>
<br>
Shintou sneered at her. &quot;That one didn't even penetrate! Come now, surely you have more than that in you. Get up!&quot;<br>
Kullgen tried to push herself up, but fell back into the sand as her charred arms gave out under her. &quot;Worthless!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You let this halfbreed easily knock you to your knees.&quot; <br>
<br>
She rose up, staggering, under the power of her legs alone. Her shield and sword hung at her sides, limp. &quot;I can't ...&quot; she grunted, trying to move her arms and failing. &quot;I have only magicks - &quot; <br>
<br>
Kullgen threw herself against the Knight, and released the Hate that had so recently come back to her. He staggered a bit, but he was barely bruised. She tossed her weak Knight's spells at him, but did not, could not, strike with her weapon.<br>
<br>
Her magicks did little. &quot;You keep depending on those spells and you will get nowhere.&quot; He struck at her with his bare fists. &quot;Will yourself to move...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're right,&quot; she muttered, casting another spear of disease. &quot;These spells are weak.&quot; She sat, and laid her useless arms in her lap.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kullgen - &quot;<br>
<br>
She looked up. &quot;But others are stronger.&quot; Kullgen bared her throat, and shook her head. &quot;If this body can't be healed, I'll find another way. Send me home, Elf.&quot; <br>
<br>
He nodded, but paused. &quot;You'll find your answers when you find where your Hate is directed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You said it yourself, the Father is always watching. It all happens for a reason.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, he ended her stay in the Outpost, and sent her soul screaming back to Neriak.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>They all staggered under the weight of her armor, but they carried her on. The merchants that found her, broken and charred, in the Foreign Quarter took her up and bore her to the Temple, to the High Priestess, before discarding her and returning to their duties.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the first time she'd been brought unconcious to the Priestess. Long ago, when she was but a young adult with a dagger and a sneaky disposition, she'd been brought here after dying at the hand of a human Paladin. She'd struck out in Hate at the man, and the Father had blessed her (cursed her? she often wondered) in that moment. <br>
<br>
Master Tolax told her once that he'd been awakened by the piercing, terrible voice of the Father, and told to retrieve her body, and to bring her to the Temple to be reborn in Hate. He had, and her life was given to the Lodge. Without them, she'd have died, and she served as much out of gratitude as obligation.<br>
<br>
But this time ... this time there was no one to speak for her, no one to guide the Priestess. She saw the Knight's burned flesh, and the muscles atrophied by pain. She saw the handprint seared into her chest, and the crisp skin that flaked around the shadowed fingers.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Harm Touch,&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the healer mumbled, confused. She'd seen enough of them to recognize the signs, but she'd never seen ... this. The twisting of the muscles, as if they'd tried to wriggle out of her skin at the contact. The arms were twisted, pulled up with taut sinews, and the right hand was clamped around the hilt of a sword, still. <br>
<br>
The Knight lived, but she was deeply unconcious. The healer supposed that was for the best; those burns couldn't be pleasant. She sent a prayer to the Father, and set to her duties as best she could.<br>
<br>
Her mortal ears didn't hear what the nearly-dead Knight did: Innoruuk's hissing laughter. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Am I dead?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kullgen wondered silently, floating amidst the gray nothingness. Finally, the pain was nowhere to be found, but neither was her body it seemed. She had no sense of up or down, had no head to move to check. There was nothing but gray waste, and her own whirling consciousness.<br>
<br>
The Void. So many cursed it each day without truly knowing of what they spoke. This terrible, unending nothing was horrifying, and she began to wonder if she'd prefer endless agony and suffering, as long as it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>something.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> As soon as the thought snaped across whatever her mind consisted of now, a dark spot began to pulse in front of her, throbbing in the gray. Had she eyes, she'd have wept for the sheer differentness of it, for the joy of something to focus on. <br>
<br>
The sphere began to grow, and a low hum emitted from its depths. The sound penetrated through Kullgen's being with a steady rhythm, almost like her missing heartbeat. The darkness, however, radiated a malevolence unmatched, and as her joy was replaced with horror, she realized it wasn't growing, but pulling her <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>into</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it. She was overtaken, and blasted apart.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
Cold. It was the first thing she felt, and was immediately followed by &quot;hard&quot;. Kullgen opened an eye and found her face pressed into a rough stone floor. She lay on her left side, and was amazed to feel the cracks and bumps pressing into her arm, briefly grateful to feel anything at all. She planted her right palm against the floor, and eased herself up onto her feet.<br>
<br>
The room was sparsely lit, only a few guttering candles flickered before her, nestled together on a low wooden table nearby. They did little good. The shadows hung like drapes in the corners, and obscured the ceiling, making it impossible to judge the size of the chamber. Kullgen edged closer to the dim light; she was not alone.<br>
<br>
The presence was everywhere at once, behind her, to her sides, above her. It wasn't pleased. &quot;I know your thoughts, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Knight</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,&quot; a rasping voice spat the words, and Kullgen felt a trill of panic race along her spine. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh no, no no no ...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;I chose you.&quot;<br>
<br>
She fell to her knees without thought. &quot;Father, I - &quot;<br>
<br>
A soundless roar shook her bones. &quot;You do not speak.&quot; She nodded, tears streaming down her face. &quot;You failed me. Shintou Shinai is my pet, Child, and my tool. I use him, like I use all of you disgusting bags of filth. He was to raise your Hate, to force it out with his treachery and taunts. I sent him to the Faydark. I put the words in his mouth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kullgen shook her head slightly, and opened her mouth to spew assurances. She was knocked backwards, and pinned to the floor by an unseen force at her throat. &quot;You think,&quot; the voice was close to her face, louder yet softer in tone, &quot;that you struck out at him in Hate? If only you were that strong.''<br>
The pressure on her throat eased, and she took a gasping breath. &quot;You fought out of fear. His words terrified you.&quot; <br>
<br>
She felt the truth between her ribs like claws. He was right, of course; Shintou's words of how the dark would never triumph against the soulless neutralic horde had chilled her, and she'd attacked him as a child wails to avoid a chore. She'd been horrified, because he voiced the same doubts she'd had, but he'd done it aloud, and in the face of their enemies. Kullgen had simply wanted to stop him from speaking, and had flown at him in fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do those pitiful fighters teach in the Lodge, Child? What is the first rule of the Knighthood, and of Neriak's people as a whole?&quot; She was afraid to speak, but the voice answered for her. &quot;Do. Not. Fear. You feared failure, and in so doing, failed. You disgust me, you false Knight.&quot; <br>
<br>
She was lifted by the throat by the unseen hand, and held aloft with her toes barely grazing the soild floor. &quot;It wasn't Shintou that Touched you, girl. It was me. I withered that body, I sapped you of your fighting strength to punish you.&quot; Kullgen fell into a crumpled heap, weeping.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are a Knight no longer, but you are still my servant. I am not through with you yet. Even after death, your shriveled corpse will dance at my hand. You will spread my Hate, and be forced to walk among the whole as a crippled reminder of the price of failure.&quot; <br>
<br>
The shadows streaked towards her until she was engulfed once more in the Void, but the voice sounded in the nothing one last time.<br>
<br>
&quot;You live yet, Bonecaster.&quot;<br>

<br>
While no bards would sing the tale in musty, smoky taverns, and no historian would spend her days studying each blow, to Kullgen the battle was epic. Some of the blood soaking into the earth was her foe's, but most was her own. Leaning heavily on her staff and panting, the apprentice stood triumphant over the corpse of the black wolf.<br>
<br>
After she'd caught her breath, and bound her wounds tightly, she knelt, wincing, and drew her knife. She made short work of the skinning; her right hand was still as deft and sure as it had ever been. She dragged herself to her feet once more, and staggered back to the welcome shadow of Neriak's entrance, her left foot leaving a snake's trail behind her in the dirt.<br>
<br>
The wall was cool against her cheek, and she debated sitting down. Rising was such a chore now with her traitorous leg and arm, but standing wasn't very much better. Carefully, and with agonizing slowness, she slid down the wall, and closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You cannot leave yet,&quot; the Priestess warned. &quot;You are not strong enough, and we have much more work to do on that leg.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kullgen pushed herself onto her feet, clutching the bed for stability. Her eyes blazed. She could see the pity in the woman's eyes, the disgust at her deformed arm and scarred, stretched skin. She'd seen it for days, ever since she'd woken to the steel brush scouring the burnt flesh. Kullgen's throat still ached from the screaming.<br>
<br>
&quot;The only way I'm staying another minute in this stinking, festering room is if you kill me.&quot; She snatched a dark robe from the back of a nearby chair, and covered herself. The sleeves were long enough that they hid her twisted left arm, and Kullgen was grateful. She couldn't bear to see it.<br>
<br>
The Priestess threw up her hands. &quot;Fine. Go. But if I find you here again because you've fallen, or made your wounds worse because of your pride, I'll let you rot.&quot; The woman tossed a dark staff at Kullgen. It had a skull mounted atop it, and the eye sockets gleamed. &quot;Master Tolax brought that by. You'll need it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The staff clattered to the ground, and Kullgen glared at the healer's retreating back. The blow to her ego was tremendous. Once able to nimbly dodge and feint, now she couldn't even catch a stick, and bending over to retrieve it seemed tantamount to swimming the Timorous Deep with bricks tied to her legs. <br>
<br>
She couldn't, however, walk without support, and she bent at the knees trying to get closer to the grinning skull. Kullgen had to let go of the bed to grasp at the staff, and for a brief moment her fingers grazed the wood and bone. She clutched desperately, lost her balance, and tipped over onto her side.<br>
<br>
Kullgen lay there for what seemed hours, clenching her jaw and fighting back tears of rage and frustration. She stared into the empty eyesockets of the face, and wondered if it felt as helpless as she did.<br>
<br>
She had fallen on her right side, her good side, and had to roll to her stomach to free her arm. Thankfully, her better half was still strong - a painful reminder of her former power - and she was able to push herself to her knees and snatch up the staff. With a lot of cursing, Kullgen pulled herself to her feet, and wondered how she was supposed to live in this shell. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The cold stone was seeping into her joints, and Kullgen knew if she didn't get up now, she'd face even more pain later. A passing young enchanter stopped to offer her a hand, but a snarl and a few choice epithets send him fleeing.<br>
<br>
If she couldn't do it alone, she wouldn't do it at all.<br>

<br>
The trek took ages. Kullgen had to stop often and rest against a tree, panting, but in the end she finally passed into the East Commonlands. She had to train close to home, now, since travelling was so much more difficult. As a young Knight she'd trotted off all around the world seeking new sights and new foes, but she'd never set foot in the Commonlands. <br>
<br>
Her eyes burned in the glare of the sun, and she was momentarily blinded as she stepped from the damp shade of Nektulos forest. As her vision adjusted, she called a minion to her for whatever protection it would offer. Joner swayed at her side, waiting patiently for her to collect herself, and after a short rest they followed the worn path out into the hills. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kullgen?&quot; <br>
<br>
The bonecaster turned, and found herself face to face with the crimson eyes of Kailena. She gestured a greeting, and flicked a glance down to her dead arm, making sure it was covered. &quot;Hello, Kailena. Your hunt goes well, I hope.&quot; <br>
<br>
The young Knight nodded. She was fresh to her power, having recently been called to the Father's service. For a moment, Kullgen wondered if the universe could only take a fixed number of unholy Knights, and for every new one that is born, another must die.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm glad to see you,&quot; Kailena said with a sigh. &quot;I wanted to ask you about this sword - &quot; <br>
<br>
Kullgen's shoulders tensed. &quot;I'm not the one to ask any longer. Seek out Tallonar.&quot; Her voice was flat, but her palm itched to hold the blade's hilt. <br>
<br>
The Knight blinked, and nodded. &quot;Yes, I'd heard rumor in the Halls but ... is it true?&quot; She peered at the scarred side of Kullgen's neck, and at the misshapen lump under the sleeve. &quot;Did Shintou do that?&quot; <br>
<br>
A snort burst from Kullgen, and she shook her head, turning the melted skin from view. &quot;He was the vessel, but it was not him. I'm sure he'd like to think it was, but this was the work of the Father.&quot; She swallowed, and leaned on her staff. &quot;I'd rather not speak of it now.&quot; <br>
<br>
After deciding they'd be much more deadly together, Kullgen let Kailena lead. The Knight was familiar with the area, and they were soon looking down at a small camp of orcs, Deathfists by the cut of their tunics. &quot;We must wait for one to wander off,&quot; Kullgen advised, but Kailena disagreed, grinning at her sword. <br>
<br>
&quot;We can handle them. This new strength of mine is more than match for those green bastards.&quot; She flicked a bit of dried blood from her armor, and sighed happily. &quot;It's amazing. I feel like a completely new woman.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kullgen's hand tightened on her staff. &quot;I know the feeling.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kailena pointed to the nearest orc; he stood near the edge of the camp, and might come alone if his cries weren't too loud. &quot;Get ready,&quot; she warned, and shot an arrow into the creature's leg. He wailed in pain before limping up the hill, and two of his fellow Legionnaires followed. <br>
<br>
&quot;The more the merrier,&quot; Kailena cackled as she swung, her blade slicing into the stomach of her first attacker. Kullgen sent Joner in to help, and muttered a few incantations. One, and then another orc fell, and Kailena was hacking at the last when it suddenly exploded at the chest. Both women were covered in Orc gore, and Kailena wiped her face. &quot;That always feels so, so good.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kailena had Touched the Orc, just to feel the pleasure of the Father's power course through her, and Kullgen blinked. The pain of her loss seared through her, as fresh as ever. She could feel the empty hollow in her chest throb, where the power had rested, and she had to breathe deeply to stop her head from swimming.<br>
<br>
Her mourning was interrupted by the slash of claws in her back, and Kailena's warning cry, &quot;Get back!&quot; It was a kodiak, and the Knight lept between its teeth and Kullgen's thin robes. Kullgen staggered back, once again reminded of her physical weakness, and something within the Bonecaster burst. <br>
<br>
She watched the new Knight swing and feint, dodge and bash, with great interest. Heat flared low in her belly, and spread up, licking at her cheeks. Her breath came faster through parted lips, and with a slight gesture she called Joner back to her side, leaving Kailena to fight the bear alone. <br>
<br>
Kullgen's eyes blazed as the Knight took a nasty swipe to the leg, and began bleeding heavily. The scent of blood made the Bonecaster's nostrils flare, and she bit her bottom lip in anticipation. Though Kailena was wounding the bear severely, her own life was ebbing faster and faster. As she crumpled to the ground, unconscious, Kullgen traced a glyph in the air with shaking fingers, and drained the bear's remaining life and healed her own wounds. <br>
<br>
She leaned over the dying woman, and her smile would have frozen the heart of anyone passing. &quot;Who is powerful now?&quot; she asked the air, and knelt slowly. She dipped her fingers in the wound at Kailena's thigh, and brought them to her lips. &quot;Are you afraid?&quot; she whispered, fighting back a manic giggle, and watched as the woman's skin turned from deep, glowing blue to a dusky slate. <br>
<br>
She leaned over the barely living body. Kullgen wanted to see the life exit from the Knight's eyes. As she moved, however, the Common's sun glinted off the silver badge upon Kailena's chest, and the flash was ice water on Kullgen's hate-fevered brain. She gasped, and shook her head, trying to clear the remaining fog. Kailena was League, and an ally; she couldn't let her die. Kullgen ripped off the hem of her gown and tied the gushing wound tightly. Se cried out the words to drain her own life and replace Kailena's, and after a few chantings, the Knight was awake, but still gravely wounded. <br>
<br>
If Kailena had heard Kullgen's words, or had any suspicion, she hid it well. Kullgen's grim face was easily mistaken for worry, and she made no move to explain otherwise.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was close,&quot; Kailena groaned, and Kullgen nodded absently. For the first time since her punishment, she felt strong. Not in body, of course; a stiff wind could shatter her tormented bones. She was strong in mind. She was strong in will. <br>
<br>
She was strong in Hate. <br>
<br>
<br>
