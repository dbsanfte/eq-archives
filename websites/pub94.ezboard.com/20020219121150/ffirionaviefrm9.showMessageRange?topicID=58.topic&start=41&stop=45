<br>
<br>
READ the Constitution. READ the powers Given to the Federal Government by that Document. Further PAY close attention and catch the portion that STATES that any power NOT delegated to the Federal Government falls to the States and the people of the Country.<br>
<br>
What does that mean? It means if the Constitution doesnt say the Fed has the power..... IT DOESNT.<br>
<br>
The claus that states the Fed can make and pass/enforce laws to ensure the delegated powers is used in conjuction with a claus to thwart that intent. But the fact remains... if the Constitution does not specifically give the power to the Federal Government... IT doesnt have it and is not allowed to USURP it through creative thinking. If the Federal Government needs/wants a power not given in the Constitution it MUST get an amendment added to gain that power.<br>
<br>
Our Federal Government is a LONG ways past its Constitutional powers. <br>
<br>
Our Federal Courts also abuse the power they have assigned themselves. Again read the Constitution, the power that the Supreme Court determines Constitutionality of ANY thing is NOT given in that Document. It was gained as a compromise between Thomas Jefferson and the Court of his time.And it has remained so since. I dont mind having the Court do this since no where in the Constitution does it actaully address who should.<br>
<br>
I do, however, mind when the Court makes new laws by their decision. Or as some say... changes the intent or meaning of a law.<br>
<br>
Fortunately so far the Supreme Court has seldom (IMO) abused this power. But the Lower Courts do it all the time. Instead of simply ruling on the merits of a case and determining legality they go on to make sweeping statements that change the original intent of a law. Or they make decisions based NOT on fact of law but on what the individual Judges think should be.<br>
<br>
And Intent IS part of what determines what a law should mean. The refusal of the current crop of idiots that act as Judges to recognize this at times, doesnt change that fact. Under our system the Legislature MAKES laws, all the courts can do is determine if a law was broken, and per above determine constitutional issues.<br>
<br>
When intent is removed from why a law was passed , you have the mess we have now. Any one with a good mind can then pick to pieces the words used to write the law. They can twist and turn the intended meaning into what ever will best suit THEM and their current client.<br>
<br>
Intent can and is determinable. The history around the passage, the debates in its passage all indicate why and what a law was meant to do. The statements made AND recorded by the Legislator at the time of the creation of the law all go to prove intent. AND in some cases the STATEMENTS made to the Court by the legislature while a trial or review is in progress.<br>
<br>
Precendent is a means used to help with intent (in a way) it establishes that what a previous court ruled should be taken into consideration by a current court. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/31/01 11:24:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Left Wingers</span><hr size=1> Well, despite what the Constitution actually says, we do in fact have a system now where the Federal Government has the power over the State Governments. Whether or not it is right is a matter of debate. We had a rather heated debate in this country in the early 1860's that settled the matter by force, and the Federals won.<br>
<br>
Further back, Jefferson and his folk thought the power should reside with the states, while Hamilton and his ilk thought otherwise. Jefferson also believed that there would be a revolution in almost every generation because people would find a way to take his carefully thought out document and find a way to shred it and take over power. By and large it has worked, although as previously stated, whatever the intent was, the reality is that the power resides in DC, not Albany, Sacramento or Springfield.<br>
<br>
Would anyone argue that the Federal Government did not have the power to force desegregation on the south? As the document is written, the laws of Alabama should supercede those of the Federal Government, but if that had been allowed to hold we might still see many Jim Crow laws in place there. Would creationism still be the only science taught in Tennessee? In a time of drought should a state that is primarily in the mountains be allowed to dam a river for it's own use without regard to those who live in states that are further downstream? Or pollute that river?<br>
<br>
If we want a return to decentralized power, we must look at the consequences that such an action would produce, both good and bad.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/1/01 7:07:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Left Wingers</span><hr size=1> Federal Law supercedes State Law. The Bill of rights supercedes the right of the States.<br>
<br>
This was not considered in the early years as there was a movement that claimed Federal Law only applied to actions between States and not actions WITHIN States.<br>
<br>
Slavery was an aboration of the document. No one had the force of will to say NO to the concept since it was in use at the time.<br>
<br>
Jim Crow laws ARE a violation of the Constitution as written. The Document and the purpose of it is to provide a level field across all States. In this area the Federal Government is SUPPOSED to have power.<br>
<br>
The Civil War did not prove that State Governments werent the intended Power in the System. It proved that the Majority could and would enforce its will on the minority when it was thought necassary to protect the integrity of the whole. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/1/01 9:10:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Left Wingers</span><hr size=1> In any sphere of authority were the Federal Government is supposed to have power, that power supercedes the States. It is clearly stated in the Constitution that Federal Power SUPERCEDES State Power.<br>
<br>
A STRONG Federal Government is needed. BUT only in the areas that it is legally given the power to act. It is true that over the years since the Civil War the Federal Government has slowly increased in power. That doesnt mean that the Civil War gave it the right to do so. And it doesnt mean the War was about the Federal Government usurping legitimate State Authority.<br>
<br>
Also the failure of previous generations to use the power of the Federal Government as intended does not negate the ability of Future generations to use that power.<br>
<br>
At the same time the failure of previous generations to rein in the seizure of unauthorized power by the Federal Government does not legitimize that power. It makes it difficult to roll back, but it doesnt make it somehow legal because it is so.<br>
<br>
Big Brother is a danger not an ally. The Federal Government is and always will be Big Brother. It MUST exsist. But we must be more vigilent that it not usurp more power than it is allowed to have. And we need to begin the process of reverseing the power it has unconstititutional gained over the last 200 years.<br>
<br>
Failure to reign in the power grabbing of the Federal Government will eventually lead to a totalitarian Government and then the people will either have to live with it or once again revolt. I couldnt even begin to guess when the tilt will be so bad that enough people will decide to revolt... it doesnt take THAT big a percentage of the population to have a revolution...but if the grab of power is not reigned in, it will happen someday. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upalantiri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palantiri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/1/01 3:11:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Left Wingers</span><hr size=1> No, the Civil War did not change the Constitution, it was just the event that ended up deciding for us who would be the eventual winner when the State Governments disagreed with the Federal Government.
