The merchants had just set up their tents, and the city had not yet shaken off its slumber. Still Cronadan had noticed more guards posted on the walls and at the city gates then usual. Where the guards had been almost relaxed the night before, tension now permeated their ranks. <br>
<br>
The former assassin found a corner near the gate to Hollowshade Moor, and began taking account of his supplies. The guards at the gate paid no attention to the dark skinned Rogue close by. The Grimlings had gained the upper hand in the Moor, and the guards were preparing for a possible assault by the mean spirited creatures. Putting the last of his gear on, Cronadan decided to see for himself how much of a threat these Grimlings actually posed.<br>
<br>
A stiff breeze blew from the east as he walked along the main road that led straight through Hollowshade Moor. It was close to noon now, and the rumble in his stomach told the Tier'dal that it was time to choke down some vegetables that Kimaya had given him last night. He stopped on a bridge, and decided to rest there for a while. Off to the south, on top of a small hill, a battle was taking place. Cronadan's keen Tier'dal eyesight, not dimmed by his time among the light races, told him that a band of young Vah Shir were under attack by a Grimling witchdoctor. Although it was daylight, bright flashes of the creatures spells were clearly visible. Of the three companions, one Vah Shir had already fallen to the Grimling. The other two were fleeing towards the bridge where Cronadan stood.<br>
<br>
Cronadan acted quickly and pulled Tormentor from its sheath. The Vah Shir were about to run past the dark clad Tier'dal standing in the middle of the bridge when two Shuriken streaked past their faces only to strike the Grimling Shaman in the chest. With blinding speed, Cronadan's Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies was loosed from its sheath, and the Rogue attacked the creature with his full fury. The young Vah Shir were safely across the bridge now, and continued their retreat to Shar Vahl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tyay streea dos e'trit!&quot; Cronadan snarled as his blades bit deep into the flesh of the surprised Grimling. Sensing, its defeat, the Shaman turned and fled across the bridge, deeper into the Moor. With battle fury in his eyes, the Rogue gave chase. Despite the Grimling's wounds, she was able to put some distance between her and the unbridled fury that was on her heels. It was not enough however. Tormentor was thrust deep in her back. She would not be able to shout a curse since the blade had skillfully pierced her lung.<br>
<br>
As Cronadan wiped his blades on the gnarled hair of the the fallen Grimling, he was beset by a sizable patrol of Grimling soldiers who witnessed the fall of their Shaman. The Tier'dal fought like a lion, as the Grimlings fell at his feet. Minutes passed, and the attackers did not relent. The Rogue was near death before he remembered the strange &quot;gate&quot; potion he had kept with him since his encounter with the Cazic Cenobite a few nights earlier in the Feerrott. Crondan pulled it from his pouch, and drank it as quickly as he could. In seconds he was surrounded by strands of glowing mana, while unconsciousness took him.<br>
<br>
The Rogue did not know how long he had been unconscious, but he found himself on top of a small pyramid housed in some sort of structure. With great effort, he climbed down from the pyramid, falling to one knee due to his wounds. Using first aid skills acquired over many seasons of travel, Cronadan bandaged where he could to prevent further injury. He looked around and noticed strange vines clinging to the stonework of this structure. Then the familiar smell of jungle peat filled his nostrils. He hid in the shadows and moved closer to one of the exits of this room and his horror nearly overwhelmed him. A room off to the right contained three Tae Ew priests. Slapping himself flat against the wall, Cronadan realized the danger he was in. The &quot;gate&quot; potion teleported him to the middle of the Accursed Temple of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
He gathered his thoughts for a moment, and tried to quell his fears. The Rogue had spent eight seasons fighting the Tae Ew in the Feerrott. If he were captured, his death would surely be a slow torturous one. Cronadan swallowed hard, and slipped past the priests. He continued down the winding corridor, still hiding in what shadows he could find. The time drew near for the priests to pray to their god, and Cronadan used this to his advantage. He easily slipped past the roaming priests, distracted by their trance-like march towards a part of the temple few but the most devout worshippers of Cazic Thule have seen. Fierce Jungle Raptors, used as guard dogs by the temple priests, did not detect Cronadan as he quietly made his way through a maze of tunnels.<br>
<br>
Through trial and error, the Tier'dal found a doorway that led to a courtyard. He had heard stories in the past that this courtyard led to the exit. Scanning for a possible escape route, Cronadan noticed this area was open to the sky and very well guarded. There were heavily armed Tae Ew along the balcony who had been kept at their post while the prayer service was going on. The Rogue slumped into a dark corner, and wondered if an escape was even possible.<br>
<br>
A shrill call echoed throughout the temple at that moment. Once the call was heard by the guards along the balcony, they all immediately dropped to their knees and bowed their heads low in prayer. The Lizardman tongue sounded harsh to the Tier'dal Rogue, but he welcomed the call nevertheless. Cronadan did not think. With his heart beating in his throat, he bolted across the courtyard as the guards were at prayer. Once inside the dark, enclosed hallway he slipped into the shadows once more.<br>
<br>
He leaned against a wall in a far corner, trying to calm his breathing and heartrate. Looking up, he noticed the torches that were close by were flickering away from him, towards the hallways end. He got up slowly and made his way down the hallway, using the direction of the torches' flickering as a guide. Soon he felt a cool breeze hit his face, as he finally emerged from the temple into the jungle of Feerrott. A lone mosquito landed on the Tier'dal's neck and bit him as he walked into the jungle. For once, Cronadan did not curse the insects. He simple smiled, and made his way to Oggok, the fear that gripped his heart only hours before had all but left him. <br>
