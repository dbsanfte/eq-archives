<br>
I'm gonna just play the damn game and let you all do your thing.  No one is going to tell ME how I'm gonna play, nor will I try enforce my views on anyone.  <br>
<br>
If you wanna powergame, feel free.  If you wanna roleplay, more power to you.  If you wanna pump out hot air and frustration faster than Oscar Meyer can pump-out weiners, go right-a-frickin-head.<br>
<br>
Shintou, by assuming everything is going down the shithole, you are mandating your own destiny.  You'll become more irate, more frustrated, you'll berate those who don't adopt your playstyle, they'll become more resistant and start fighting back.  Self-fullfilling prophecy.  <br>
<br>
Just fricking play.  Have fun.  Or get another hobby.<br>

<br>
I'm new to the server (only level 12), so if that changes how you view my response, well, I can't help that. Having read through many, many of the posts here on the forums, it seems to me that Shintou is one of the reasons I came to this server. I am a huge fan of RP (D&amp;D when I was very young, Whitewolf era since, and yes I have done Vampire LARPs), and although I have not had the pleasure of encountering Shintou in game, I think if all of us cared as much as he does, FV would be a better server overall.<br>
<br>
Ahem, that said, I don't think the issue of using shortcuts (e.g. omw, brb) is necessarily bad or contrary to RP, or even really the main concern here. In certain circumstances, typing everything out would actually be contrary to RP. For example, typing &quot;add&quot; mid-fight is analogous to me shouting &quot;behind you!&quot; and takes about as long. If I type &quot;behind you!&quot;, that takes longer than it would &quot;in character&quot; to shout &quot;behind you!&quot;, and would not maintain the RP feel of it. (If the person dies while you're giving the warning, it defeats the purpose of the warning in the first place.)<br>
<br>
I think the problem, in this case, is illustrated by an example given in another thread. I will present it as a hypothetical example since I can't remember enough particulars and see no need to involve specific names. An evil guild PLs an RL friend of the leader of the guild. The friend chooses to play a character that has a character concept contrary to the very nature of the guild doing the PLing. The only explanation given is &quot;We're RL friends and this is what friends do.&quot; Perhaps some psuedo-RP reasoning is given (i.e. both feel they are &quot;using&quot; the other, or some quick backstory is artificially invented that was never done in game, or something). <br>
<br>
Is it intrinsically wrong for a friend to PL another friend? In my opinion, no, not necessarily.<br>
<br>
Could it be considered &quot;unfair&quot; to people not as fortunate, who don't have high level friends on FV? Possibly. Irrelevant though.<br>
<br>
Is this contrary to the spirit of the server? Yes, definitely. The weird psuedo-explanation is actually worse because it suggests to others that RPing is &quot;Do whatever you want and explain it later&quot; instead of &quot;Figure out who your character is, and act how that character would act at all times.&quot;<br>
<br>
Can this eventually lead to a degradation of RP on the server? Likely so. This is because it gives us a bunch of high level people who, for whatever reason, have not experienced the character development inherent to levelling from 1-60. The fact that PLing is &quot;their thing&quot; leads me to think that they won't be much interested in developing their character after the fact. Having a bunch of high-level guilds where the people are into RP would be an awesome experience. Having a bunch of high-level guilds where the people all got PLed, well, that suggests the word &quot;uber&quot;, which we consider A Bad Thing for FV.<br>
<br>
Do I care about a degradation of RP on the server? Absolutely. RP is WHY I'm here. This server has been a dream for me since I starting playing EQ, and I have the same fears many others have that it might be lost or tainted, for the reasons already suggested.<br>
<br>
So I guess, if that's what Shintou was saying, then I agree with him totally. And to bring it to the original poster, that's why I care about PLing (on THIS server, on a normal blue server it would be totally, 100% acceptable in my eyes). Sorry for all the rambling, and it's great to be here on FV <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Also, it looks to me like there's a whole lot of common ground that's surfaced, so I thought I'd sum up the two main topics and -- you guessed it -- my take!<br>
<br>
Topic 1 (most common) - People have varying tolerances for differences in how people RP (or choose not to) in FV.  Some people like to gripe about it, some people like to get bossy, some people just live and let live.<br>
<br>
My opinion: No one is required to like anything I or anyone else does.  Hey, no one even has to CARE!  If something really grits on your nerves and you seriously need to vent about it, that's what the Soapbox is here for.  Of course, there can be a can of worms as others take advantage of their own right to disagree.  But so long as folks refrain from getting profane, demanding or insulting, I figure it's all good.<br>
<br>
My request: Please keep those rants out of game, except in /tells to people you know and don't mind.  As I've said before, even d00dz don't break my RP environment quite so quickly as someone griping about how someone RP's.  Also, please don't expect anyone to play the way you'd like any more than you'd play the way they like.<br>
<br>
Topic 2 (Championed by Shintou) - Non-RP has keel-hauled RPers on the other servers.  We don't want that to happen here.<br>
<br>
My opinion: As I’ve said, I understand this fear.  I’ve seen things go south in other environments, and I don’t want it to happen here, either. However, I don’t think hostility towards those we don’t consider RPers is the way to prevent that -- I’ve already posted details on that one.  But as folks keep saying that RPing frequently elicits RPing in return, I personally suspect the best we can do is to keep actively fostering that sense of community.  Hopefully, it will bear out.<br>
<br>
My request: Please give this server, and the players in it, the chance to succeed or fail before passing judgement.  As for those whose play-style is so very different from your own, please allow yourself to ignore them and focus on the RP you do enjoy.  <br>
<br>
I’ve had a really hard time with this one myself on a couple different points, but I’ve come to a conclusion: none of my “solutions” would actually do a darn thing to resolve what I see wrong in the game.  In fact, judgmental hostility actively hurts the environment only for people who care about the RP environment in the first place – RPers.  So I’ve moved to “live and let live” and have been much more able to focus on those who do respond to RP.<br>
<br>
Topic 3 (I’m making this one up) – Twinking is as IC for FV as it is relevant to RL.<br>
<br>
Why: I have a friend who’s dating a rich guy.  He takes her places neither of us could ever afford, and does so every weekend.  She gets really nice things.  I’ll admit to rolling my eyes at 16-yr-old twinks in BMWs, but I’ll also admit that I wish her friend would buy ME a car.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My request: Get him to buy me a car!  Seriously though, I am happy for her.  My talk with her today is making me re-think the whole twinking thing in EQ, so I thought I’d share.<br>

(Watch the Jackie Chan cartoon!)<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with folks doing what they want and coming up with a RP reason to justify it -- so long as it actually does justify it, however unprobable the reason.<br>
<br>
Why?  I see people do things like that ALL THE TIME in RL.  People do whatever they feel like and justify it later according to their own excuses and mores.  Does it have to make sense?  Does it even USUALLY make sense?  Nope.<br>

<br>
Lets say that i was a leader of a group in an area and after doing a /who, i saw 2 people i knew who were of the same class and around the same level that could be used in my group. I would ask the character i enjoyed playing with first if he would like to join us regardless to whether he was LFG or not and the other was...simply because i enjoyed his company. this is a fact. many of us are RP'ers here and enjoy the atmosphere of an RP'ing group. I have seen as of late many posts of people looking for groups and not being able to find one. This is not to suggest that this IS the reason why many have had a hard time finding groups...but if you fall into the non-RP department it could affect you.<br>

<br>
(The following is drawn from my own non-EQ RPing experiences. Take it as you will.)<br>
<br>
Say my friend gets a million dollars, totally randomly. I would (hopefully) not be jealous and would be very happy for him. His life is a lot better now, and life for everyone moves on.<br>
<br>
Now, say you're playing a (random example) LARP with this same friend and a bunch of other people. The Storyteller gives your friend some totally overpowering item or ability, and makes up some brief story of how he gets it (&quot;A long lost relative died and left you this magic amulet. Enjoy.&quot;). Would you be just as happy for him? Maybe, in a way, but both you and he (and ESPECIALLY everyone else) realize how much this is going to change the dynamics of the game. The game has suddenly become less fun for everyone else because one person has gotten some kind of help that doesn't really follow from the rest of the storyline. People might feel that all their efforts are stupid when the big rewards are handed out essentially at random, as they perceive it. Many people, sometimes good RPers who are assets to the game, will say &quot;WTF, that's BS&quot; and won't play anymore. The rest of the game has changed for everyone else who remains because now all of a sudden there is this stupid magic amulet that this one player has, and everyone has to rearrange their storyline.<br>
<br>
The key here is that RP, for it to stay RP, has to be more &quot;realistic&quot; in some ways than RL, or it's not fun. Almost all of the game rulebooks (and my own gaming experiences) I've read stress over and over (for storytellers) that you MUST be fair and equitable to your players or the game will be ruined for everyone. <br>
<br>
In the above situation, eventually you end up with no RPers (because they've all left) and a Storyteller who is handing out magic amulets like candy because all the players who stay whine for one (or they leave).<br>
<br>
If player XXX on the other side of the world gets a magic amulet (e.g. Uber_gear_01), will that affect me? Probably not, since I might never see that person. But if a bunch of people start getting amulets, well, then it does affect me. And I've played on the uber servers before, and, well, I came to FV in part to get away from that, and I know many other RPers here feel the same way. If all the RPers leave, where does that leave RP on FV?<br>
<br>
EDIT: The issue isn't about twinking so much, per se, because it seems perfectly valid for an older player to pass along items to a newer player when the older player is done with them, or something similar. It's just, some part of me says that more twinking is going to lead to a rise in the number of &quot;d00d&quot; people who don't RP, followed by a decrease in the number of people who make this server fun. I'm probably, hopefully wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A> at: 1/15/02 10:45:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrimwyrd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimwyrd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/15/02 8:35:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=229.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: On Justification</span><hr size=1> I guess I'm lucky. I don't see the problem here on Firoina Vie. Every one of the &quot;ubers&quot; I've bumped into were very nice and they roleplayed (or, at least, failed to speak dude-speak at me).<br>
<br>
Let's see. One of the most &quot;uber&quot; people I've met would have to be Restoria (congrats again on the epic, milady). I bumped into her in the Freeport bank, and we briefly discussed the fact that we both served Karana (her as a cleric and I as a druid). We spoke in character for a bit, and she ended up giving me a couple knick-knacks from her overflowing bank. It was very kind of her and completely &quot;in character&quot;.<br>
<br>
Another &quot;uber&quot; sort I've met briefly was Auno. I saw him at the Freeport Fishing Tournament (which he won, congrats again Master Fisher). Not many &quot;ubers&quot; on other servers would master fishing or bother to go to a fishing event, but that's the kind of thing that is great about FV.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on. The bottom line is that most people who are already 50+ on this server have completely respected my desire to roleplay, no matter how &quot;uber&quot; they are.<br>
<br>
On the occasions when people say things like &quot;what class r u?&quot; I usually respond &quot;I serve Karana, the Storm Lord, as one of His druids&quot;. This lets people know that I am not interested in conversing in dude-speak, and most people pick up on that right away. They either start speaking in-character themselves, or just leave me alone.<br>
<br>
In fact, the only people over the last several weeks that have &quot;disrespected&quot; my roleplaying experience have been dudes in the 5th-20th level range who simply just don't get it.<br>
<br>
Oh well, like I said, I haven't found the high-level characters on this server to be at all disrespectful of my roleplaying experience and it took me only two minutes on another server last night to remind me of how bad things are elsewhere. <p>Grimwyrd Storm<BR>

First of all, Shintou's words and the ideas behind them are not, in any way, shape, or form, racist, and it belittles actual persons of color's experiences with racism in the material world to make that comparison.  In other words, the comparison is not only inaccurate and insulting to a member of this message board, but it's insulting to those who've actually experienced racism, or other oppressions, first-hand.<br>
<br>
Shintou has expressed the opinion that people should roleplay on Firiona Vie.  I agree with him.  Asking others to roleplay, even being insistent that they do, is not &quot;intolerant&quot;.  It's an exercise in social, political, ideological, and discursive power in order to establish or reinforce a norm--in other words, it's an effort to discipline other players.  And I'm completely alright with that, especially on this server.  We should be putting pressure on non-roleplayers to roleplay.<br>
<br>
There is an underlying belief in the U.S. that &quot;freedom&quot; means freedom from social pressure to conform, and that any discursive regime that enforces social behavior is inherently evil, and I suspect your analysis of Shintou's opinion as being comparable to racism stems from this kind of thinking.  There really is no &quot;outside&quot; to these kinds of pressures, however, and  I might point out, in an ironic twist, that your analysis of Shintou's post is, itself, an effort to enforce a social code--one in opposition to Shintou's--and falls into the very same intolerance you decry him for.<br>

Racism is about content--the &quot;WHAT&quot;.  Racism can be polite--even 'scientific'.  That's the &quot;HOW&quot;.  If you want to compare Shintou's position to racism, then you have to argue that the content (the &quot;WHAT&quot;) rather than the delivery (the &quot;HOW&quot;) is comparable to racism.<br>
<br>
Further, to quote Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., being a fanatic or an extremist is not always bad: &quot;...the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be&quot; (&quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;).<br>

If Shin is a fanatic for roleplaying, what kind of extremist does that make you?<br>

<br>
Oh yeah, and I'm the one thats taking this way too seriously, right?<br>
<br>
Maybe YOU need help, because you are playing a frikken Racecard so you can powergame in a RPG! Come on, what kind of crap is that?<br>
<br>
But since you seem to be confused, let me give you a better example.<br>
<br>
Let me say this before I get labeled not only as a Racist, but a Sexist pig, knowing you.<br>
This has NOTHING to do with the two sexes involved!<br>
<br>
This is like, Bathrooms.<br>
<br>
In this case, you have twenty Bathrooms.<br>
They used to be Dual purpose bathrooms.<br>
<br>
But, the Males for the most part kept Dirtying up the bathrooms.<br>
Leaving the Seat up, and other things, you know.<br>
And the Males kinda got tired of that Funny Smell in the Bathrooms.<br>
<br>
So the Management stoped using Dual purpose Bathrooms, and Labeled the Bathrooms, 'Male' and 'Female.<br>
19 Males, 1 Female.<br>
<br>
Their were WAY more Males in the office then Females.<br>
And everything was bliss.<br>
<br>
Now, tell me, what is the only reason the Males would want to use the Females bathroom? ((Other then anything Perverse, dang it))<br>
<br>
Roleplayers and Non Roleplayers are two different animals. Completly Different.<br>
<br>
You can't have Males in the Female Bathroom, it just doesn't work.<br>
It just doesn't work.<br>

Powergamers and Roleplayers are not &quot;necessarily&quot; two different kinds of animals.<br>
<br>
I've met many &quot;uber&quot; people who were roleplayers. Just because they enjoy the style/tactics/prestige/etc of the end-game, that doesn't mean they can't/won't roleplay.<br>
<br>
Some people like a challenge, and hurry to the end-game as quickly as possible. Some people would rather roleplay &quot;movers and shakers&quot; out killing dragons and challenging the gods, instead of roleplaying average adventurers out hunting a_young_goblin_02. That's their business and their right.<br>
<br>
If some 50+ uber people are near you and failing to roleplay, then /ignore them and go about your business. It's very rare (specially on such a lightly populated server) that someone can ruin the game for you without your permission. You have to &quot;let&quot; them ruin it by acknowledging and interracting with them. If they force themselves on you (by training, harassing, etc), then have them removed by GMs. Otherwise, just ignore them and play on. <p>Grimwyrd Storm<BR>

I was afraid it would here, too, since it's a hugely volatile topic and almost can't exist without misunderstandings.  Hopefully I can clarify what I read as being meant, and it will obliviate the need to further this particular aspect of the discussion.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the word that should have been used was bigotry.  We don't use it as frequently in common parlance (and yes, I DO use words like common parlance in an everyday sentence :P ) so that's probably why the more common word &quot;racism&quot; was used.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bigotry</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> \Big&quot;ot*ry\, n. [Cf. F. bigoterie.] 1. The state of mind of a bigot; obstinate and unreasoning attachment of one's own belief and opinions, with narrow-minded intolerance of beliefs opposed to them.<br>
<br>
As to the use of the word bigotry -- I personally think it would have been appropriate.  The war of words that has been waged has been over the issue of tolerance, and how the intolerant should or should not be allowed to treat those with whom they disagree.  At the time the word was used, there had been a demand that all those who do not roleplay (or who powergame) leave the server.  The only more intolerant suggestions I can think of involve violating VI's rules of fair play.  And then there was the intolerance toward the &quot;intolerant&quot;, and things just deteriorated.<br>
<br>
This is very much the reason I started this thread, why I wanted so much to understand the reasons for those who were making these demands.  I am so very, deeply apalled by intolerance that I actively have to work hard to not be a knee-jerk bigot towards those whom I perceive to be promoting bigotry.  Maybe it's my upbringing (my parents are intolerant).<br>
<br>
Well anyway, hopefully that snips that misunderstanding. <p>---<BR>

If we let any one person, or group of people, start dictating who and who does not belong here based on RP standards, I cannot forsee that making this server anything other than... trying to find non-inflammatory words here.  I'll just say &quot;wrong&quot;.<br>
<br>
I've already posted a couple of my experiences with online RP communities, so I won't repeat myself on where I'm coming from.  But I am used to being disagreed with on major issues almost everywhere I've been in the past.  I'm so used to it that it actually surprises me when someone vocally agrees with me.  That means that, when the hounds are loosed, I'm used to being one of the first to be hounded.  Even though that hasn't happened here (yet?), I've been burned often enough that even the ghost of the RP police still makes my blood feel, literally, cold.<br>
<br>
Shintou (sorry to point to you again, but again you're the most active proponent to point to):<br>
<br>
I know you've been burned by anti-RP powergaming on other servers, badly burned.  A lot of us have, so I think most of us here understand where you're coming from -- even those of us who haven't posted in support of your desire for powerlevellers to leave.  But as much as you fear that powerlevelling and twinking will take over the server and make it unsafe for roleplaying, some of us fear that loosing your hounds of exclusion will not only eviscerate powerlevellers who (in some opinions) do not interfere with RP, they'll start looking for non-PL prey once they're gone.  I know you have stated quite clearly that you only object to powerlevellers and endgame-now style of players.  However, there is no guarantee that it will stop there, whether or not you would support &quot;the next step&quot; when someone waves the more-IC-than-thou banner.<br>
<br>
Whether you agree with it or not, do you understand that fear?  And whether you understand it or not, are you willing to give them a chance to integrate into the RP society the way many have (at least tried to) already?  <br>
<br>
Because if endgamers come in and do start actively driving down roleplaying, 100 plat says that a posse would form in defense of RP whether you lead it or not...<br>

First, I chose to write my congressperson a nice letter explaining the economic and social pitfalls this policy might have.<br>
<br>
Or second, I start posting leaflets all over demanding that all latin americans leave at once and that they are polluting this country and they have no place being here.<br>

Shin has done the second. Not the first. Thats where I see the parallel.<br>

Were the ones preaching tolerance and trying to reason with Shin. All we get back is ranting and ravings and no clear answers from him. He has defined prefered. Yet he still demands we &quot;get off his server&quot;.<br>
<br>
You call that not taking this too seriously? Hmmm.<br>
<br>
Anyways, still waiting for an answer from him about a specific example of how a powergamer has interfered with his roleplay experience. I doubt we will ever get one. More likely we will get more accusations that we don't roleplay (he has never met me in game so how would he know?) and more demands to leave this server. Or maybe more messages all in caps about not taking this too seriously.<br>
<br>
This will be my last post on the subject. Not because I think any side has won or anything. Mostly because I grow weary with trying to reason with a madman.<br>
