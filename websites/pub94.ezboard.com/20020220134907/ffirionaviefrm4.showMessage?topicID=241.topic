Your wrong and disruptive for being uber roleplayers. Get off our server. Your anti-social kind not wanted. <br>
<br>
The funny thing about all this crap is this: All this bitching, about roleplaying and non-roleplaying exists only on these boards. I still have yet to see an example from the nazi how his in game enjoyment was affected. I'm guessing that most of these posters (like myself) are at work and on the Internet, wishing they were playing EQ instead.  I have yet to be assaulted in game by a role playing nazi for my limited use of thier role playing dictionary. Nor have I heard of a non-roleplayer assualting a roleplayer for roleplaying.<br>
<br>
 Viewing someone else being helped by someone of higher level did not affect your game. The crap that happened on other servers did not directly affect you. You post some vague crap about how &quot;the other server fell apart&quot; cause of guilds being high end. Whatever, get a grip. How did this directly affect you?  Give me a concrete example of a specific incident on another server how a uber-guild (whatever) affected your role-playing snobishness. I seen the uber-guilds on other servers, but they never ever affected me directly. <br>
The only thing that ever bothered me on other servers was seeing level 1 twinks in super-armor.  Did the &quot;twinks&quot; directly affect me? No, the twinks did not directly affect me. Just as 2 people power leveling and a high level guild raiding things does not affect you.<br>
<br>
My cup is half-full and looking to fill up here on FV. Is your cup half-empty and looking for bottom?<br>
<br>
<br>
Seriously, I don't want to see anyone leave FV. Even the people here that are the nazis. The world takes all kinds. Doesn't mean you have to hold hands to exist in it together.<br>
The world is not a perfect place, FV is not a perfect world. <br>
One day you will mature and accept the fact that not only is the world not perfect, it is unfair.<br>

<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Though... it IS entertaining in a crude, Fox-entertainment sort of way. Having already done the top uberguild thing twice now in a peculiar way its kind of relaxing to watch other people deal with it this time without being directly affected (yet at least).<br>

The &quot;nazi&quot; simply warns that those things are already seeded on FV, and he goes on to make a plea that FV remain true to it's intended audiance. It's a futile plea, I'll grant you that, but it is his perogative to make it. While not a strict RPer, I understand his concerns and his anger at yet another server on a downward spiral. As FV plummets into the darkness to meet it's own unremarkable destiny amongst the other blue servers the effects will be felt by all of our players. You, Auno1, will wonder why you ever came here, but if you have any pride at all, you will whimper quietly at your loss rather than be subject to I told you so. RPers and PGers alike will find that they never left their old corrupt servers. <br>
<br>
Now you can be blind to all of that, or you can be angry that you are part of the demise of FV, but you are intelligent enough to know the reasons why. It really doesn't matter, and that's what the resident &quot;nazi&quot; needs to realize. It's going to happen. FV is like a barrel of ducks to a bird hunter and a long lost ego to an EQ uberwanabe. I intend to go about my busines and enjoy what good that remains of FV and hop ship to the next great game when the stench finally turns me. Not a big deal, but then I'm a professional fun haver and it don't matter much to me where I find it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uauno1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Auno1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 4:09:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Fanning the flames: Uber roleplayer</span><hr size=1> How did these so called uber-guilds on other servers affect you Molly? The same thing happens outside of a guild, outside of anything being uber,  roleplaying or non-roleplaying:<br>
People fighting over spawns<br>
<br>
Ever seen a the fighting that goes on over single spawns outside splitpaw by single, soling people? How is this different<br>
from uber guilds fighting over spawn Z?<br>
<br>
  If this &quot;mob spawns&quot; is your complaint about non-rolepayers, big, uber(whatever) guilds on other servers, I suggest a different game for you. This is one of the design flaws of EQ. The &quot;mob spawn&quot; issue happens if people are RP, non-RP, being uber or whatever. I have personally watched Bane in guk fighting with others over Ghoulbane camp here on FV. To the point, of being considered camp stealing. Bane imo is probably the best RP I have seen on FV, but how was that behavior role-playing?  Its just the nature of EQ, regardless of role-playing.<br>
<br>
Everyone in EQ on a server is not on the same team. We play in a world that has hard rules, that we must deal with. (ie, mob x only spawns every z days) The only cure to this ill would be to play a standalone RPG, where there is no other people in your world.<br>
Or you could try something like pencil and paper D and D. <br>
Where everyone in your world and game adventure is on the same team.<br>

RP Nazi in game will find my ignore list as fast a d00d.  I've run into no in game Nazi' and only a couple of d00ds and even they weren't that bad.<br>
<br>
I peaked in on the old server and it was a zoo.  I have no desire to go back.  My frustrations here are far overcome by the tighter and more respectful community on this server.<br>

So defenders of the RP server I'm with you all the way!<br>

The problem is not that people hate uberguilds, or camping, or any of that. The problem is that people (myself included) fear that the rise of uberguilds, especially if the uberguilds drift away from RP, might possibly lead to the downfall of RP on the server. <br>
<br>
The idea is that if the uberguilds do not hold to any RP standards (no accusations here, this is in the abstract), it will discourage others from doing the same. RPers who get to high level now must compromise their RP for the sake of getting high-end gear. This attitude trickles down from the top, since newbies aren't going to RP if none of the high levels do. And so on, and so on. That's the concern.<br>
<br>
To address camping issues...<br>
<br>
Situation 1:<br>
I'm camping solo somewhere for some item or spawn or something, minding my own business. A group of paladins come up to me and say &quot;We claim this ground in the name of Antonius Bayle, move along or die, you overgrown brownie. *laugh*&quot; I laugh in their face and stay. A heated discussion begins. One of them duels me, and I die. The camp is theirs, and I've had some good clean RP fun and go on my way.<br>
<br>
Situation 2:<br>
I'm camping solo somewhere for some item or spawn or something, minding my own business. A group of paladins come up and don't say anything, start attacking my spawns. I challenge them. The leader says &quot;u suk n00b, this 0ur camp n0w&quot; and threatens to invoke PnP on me. I wouldn't invoke PnP back, I'd just leave. And I don't care that I lost the camp, I care that I lost the camp and it doesn't even make sense why. You have become more frustrated (200)! and I'm that much closer to leaving the server.<br>
<br>
To recap, problem = potential decline of RP, problem &lt;&gt; uberguilds or spawn rates or anything like that. <br>
<br>
P.S. As has been said, the word &quot;nazi&quot; is not appropriate here, imho. In my mind, a person using it undermines their credibility when they might otherwise have valid points.<br>
<br>

<br>
There are so few people on FV as compared to the size of the world, you will always be able to go somewhere else and find solitude in RP.  <br>
<br>
And I wouldn't be surprised if no &quot;Uber&quot; guild ever shows up on FV.  There certainly aren't any yet (a small group of 50 + getting some epics and killing a few dragons does not an uber guild make).  <br>
<br>
I've seen this too many times on too many other servers.  1 or 2 guilds bust out of the gates, do alot of cool stuff and then finally.. eventually.. hit their limit.  Then they try to expand to move on to new goals. <br>
<br>
Well guess what, That expansion into true &quot;uberness&quot; may not happen on this server.  For a couple of reasons..<br>
<br>
1)  There is a low server population to begin with.<br>
2)  You have limitations on who can guild and group together.<br>
3)  You have a higher percentage of people who are roleplayers and would rather burn in hell than join any guild that could possibly be considered &quot;Uber&quot;<br>
<br>
Just sit back, relax, and rp to your hearts content.  There is no &quot;uber&quot; on this server and there probably never will be.  If by some miracle people do make it up to the stage of utter uberness where no mob on Norrath remains safe... Good for them.  Congratulations.. Welcome to the world of total, absolute, complete ... Boredom.<br>

<br>
Dueling was infact a gentleman's method of resolving issues. Evil people dont duel. They lie, cheat and backstab. And I certainly wouldn't want to see anyone cheat on a duel and cause another to lose xp on this server. From a strcitly human point of view, a dispute over camps should be worked out in /ooc. Unless of course your comfy with dueling. Then just go for it. But I wouldn't encourage dueling as a method of conflict resolution in any circumstance, roleplay server or not.<br>
