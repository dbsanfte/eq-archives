Harassing other players is wrong. It doesn't have to be sexual harassment either. Just paging someone and cursing at them all the time is harassment. It's evil, nasty, wrong and hopefully a banable offense. Now in some cases, if someone yells at me, and I did something at that instant to tick them off -- I don't mind so much, but if abuse continues, day in, day out.. that's ridiculous.<br>
<br>
10 years ago I was harassed on muds -- I was young, niave and didn't know how to handle it. I do now, and I haven't been harassed in ages. Frankly, I can harass right back and make the person wish they hadn't been born. Or I just ignore. I don't care what they say and what a person who is harassing says is ignoreable, in my book -- though if it continued I'd /report them just for the sake of saving other people from being subjected to that kind of treatment.<br>
<br>
However, I have to say one thing. Telling your guild that they cannot talk to someone or they will be removed from your guild is the lowest, vilest form of blackmail and control. Frankly, if it was me, I would say: Fine, by bye guild. No one -- I mean no one, tells me who and who I cannot talk to. I don't care if you hate their guts, keep your personal reasons to yourself. Let people choose who they want to talk to. If she screwed over the whole guild its likely most of them wouldn't want to talk to her anyhow so you wouldn't have to worry, but demanding that people do not, or they will be punished is just pathetic. Keep your damn problems to yourself and stop trying to make everyone miserable just because you hate that person. I'm so sick of seeing from game to game to game one person making a hard time for another person and trying to turn folks who don't even know that person against them because THEY had problems with them. And often, they are the ONLY one who had a problem with them. Shit folks, like people judge for themselves for a change. <br>
<br>
Unless a person has repeatedly and consistantly fucked people over, I don't want to hear about it.<br>

<br>
Let it be known that Achsia is in my guild... she is under my care.<br>
<br>
I know her well.. and if anything I cannot believe that you would say such things.<br>
<br>
I have met you as my gnome... and I know the trouble you can create over such little things as a shadowman camp in WCommons... I would have hoped that you would have grown up by now.<br>
<br>
What you are doing is HARASSMENT and is being logged. If you continue to do so, you are facing an account ban... I can PROMISE you this.<br>
<br>
Also let it be known that not ONE Qu'ellar d'Orthae'Chath is welcome on any raid I host as long as you continue to pursue this course of action.<br>
<br>
When she joined my guild I was approached by several of you trying to *warn* me of her and her actions. This slander CAN AND WILL BE REPAID if you continue down this path... and I can guarantee I know MANY more people than you can imagine.<br>
<br>
I also offer any current guildmember that wishes to leave such a backstabbing organization sanctuary within the Archons.. this is your only chance.<br>
<br>
And for the record.. she joined our guild quietly.. and said nothing but kind things about you. It was YOU who started this.. not her. I heard the strife from your mouths first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sebraei>Sebraei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 2:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stalking on EQ</span><hr size=1> Achsia really needs to step up and speak, there is this impression here that this has something to do with some secretative relationship going on. *laughs*<br>
Achsia was OOC, ALL THE TIME.  She was requested SEVERAL times to stop, she didn't.  She got fed up felt picked on she left.  After that she said things about Tae being mean, an ogre, that he picked on her etc, which then lead some how to some mysterious stalking senario that I just can't even believe is being said.  As a matter of fact it was ME who begged and pleaded for Tae to disband her ass before THIS occured.  He defended her constantly giving her chance after chance, until the OOC/d00d speak in guild got soo unbelievable bad, that it was a damn coffee clutch.  He put his foot down, and wounded her ego.  <br>
There were no other posts to the boards other than the bitchy down right threatening, STALKING post from you Syrienne.<br>

If you're talking about me, I've never had a relationship with achsia, never persued one, nor have I ever wanted one.  She can tell you that herself.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I have persued NO in-game relationships at all, as I have no interest in that.<br>
<br>
Also, you keep referring to some &quot;missing post&quot;.  The only post missing is yours, Syrienne... and once again I say, you should be happy that Sebraei did you the favor of deleting it.  I truly wish she hadn't now.  But, what's done, is done.  Stop threatening me and my guild, in game and out.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind also... YOU started this thread of hate and flame... and I have to wonder... how would someone go about slandering the &quot;good name&quot; of someone else in EQ without fear of repurcussions from the GM's?  why, they'd start a nasty thread on EZ Board to gain general support outside of game that would be reflected inside of game... who has done that?  Have we done that?  Have we started some huge conspiracy theory over Achsia?  No... it seems you have, though.<br>
<br>
For the rest of you reading this thread... as a couple of reasonable people have stated... you don't have a clue what's going on... why Syrienne chose to start this here is beyond me, but my post on my board stands as is.  Read it before you judge it.  (and I never threatened to disband anyone... never had to as no one in guild wanted to have anything to do with achsia after she left) <p>Taedarian Rah`d`Vharc<br>

Any normal rational person in your position, Syrienne, would have tried to verify facts before making threats to an entire guild of people, petitioning (which, if you did you did because there was nothing to /report), and starting a hate thread on a public message board... instead of taking a bunch of hearsay and blowing it all out of proportion.<br>
<br>
The only reason for this thread started by you was and is to create a problem in game.  Doesn't that make you guilty of everything you accuse us of? <p>Taedarian Rah`d`Vharc<br>

You have never heard anything from me concerning achsia or anything else, other than an ezboard message privately telling you not to post on our board.<br>
<br>
You have YET to state who has been contacting you &quot;repeatedly&quot; from my guild... which makes me wonder if anyone ever has.  Irregardless, once again, it is for this reason I posted the message on our own boards telling people not to have contact with achsia.  This thread right here.  I also stated that she's been on ignore for a very long time.  I have no contact with her.  I have no contact with you.  So quit saying I do.<br>
<br>
And I'd love to speak to Jindrack about this situation.  I have nothing to fear as I've done nothing wrong.  It's not I who's making threats, insulting or harassing people.<br>
<br>
What the hell you think you've &quot;won&quot; is beyond me... course, maybe you consider this some sort of mind-game... you have some serious issues though. <p>Taedarian Rah`d`Vharc<br>

 Because I am dilgent at documenting everything.. <br>
<br>
<br>
is what she said.  And logs or not, she must know WHO she's supposedly getting harassing tells from... if they exist at all.  Instead... she started this because Imasu sent her a tell and asked her not to have contact with us... and since she wants us to have no contact with achsia, which we don't... and we want no contact with Syrienne... hmmm... wouldn't you think that woulda ended the situation?<br>
<br>
Let's face it:  Syrienne doesn't want to end it, regardless of what she says, or she wouldn't have done this.  Had she had an honest desire to end things and truly WAS getting unwanted tells... her /report and petition would be enough.  Wouldn't they?  Instead... she wants to cause chaos and dissent, and turn people against my guild with the &quot;mob mentality&quot; as someone so eloquently put it.<br>
<br>
It's amazing how quick people are to judge a situation they know nothing about, too.  Did it ever occur to anyone she doesn't have logs even though she &quot;diligently documents everything&quot; because there are no such tells?  If there are any tells, I certainly don't know about them, other than the one from imasu telling her to not post on our board. <p>Taedarian Rah`d`Vharc<br>
