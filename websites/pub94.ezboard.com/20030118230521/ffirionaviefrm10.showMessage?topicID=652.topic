Or not quite lonely, really... more of feeling alone in the center of great big swirling of love, the warm joy of friendships and the laughing indifference of enmities rushing to and fro all around a huge hole in the middle filled with nothing and everything all at once.  There were too many open moments that grew too silent, quiet enough for the unaskable questions to bubble up and start yammering.  She almost wanted to return to the time when the questions were as simple as &quot;Who am I?&quot;, &quot;What's my favorite color&quot;, and &quot;Where was my home in the time before I bemember?&quot;<br>
<br>
Though it turned out the answers were as simple as the questions, they spawned even more questions she wasn't quite sure she wanted to keep.  When the queries of &quot;who?&quot; and &quot;where?&quot; become &quot;why, and how, and does it matter?&quot; -- how does one answer?  And when those questions deepen their sting to &quot;do <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> even matter?&quot;, it's time to stop wallowing in the darker shadows in oneself and set out to brighten those in others.<br>
<br>
But she didn't want to, not yet.  She'd been too long on her own, wandered too far down the solitary path of this-and-that, seeing and speaking to nobody in particular.  Everything seemed bigger lately, more complex, and it made her want to rest.  So she set her cheek against the cold, rough bark of the tree into which she nestled, closing her eyes against the silvery moonlight.  <br>
<br>
She was alone, and she felt crowded by the rippling reflections of nothingness. <p><p align="center">

She wasn't quite sure where because she hadn't been paying attention to much of anything for the past couple of days.  Everything still blended, still swirled around in her head like sugar and sand forming muddled, complex patterns that didn't make any sense.  Absently, she munched on something sweet while she thought of the faces and voices she hadn't felt in so long, yet longed for.<br>
<br>
Her meandering mind was caught by a tiny, impatient sigh wafting up from her satchel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aren't you DONE yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
She just kept on aimlessly as she dropped the rest of her treat down for Nerriwiggle to finish up, then stopped abruptly as it flew back upward to bounce against her nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not THAT, you big goofyhead!  I mean your... sillystoopymopeynothin!&quot;  <br>
<br>
She couldn't see it, but she felt the impression of a small pink tongue being stuck out at her, so she stopped and scowled into her satchel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Am NOT sillystoopymopey... oh.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down at her hands holding the satchel open, and saw frosting mixed with dust along her fingertips that hadn't been washed since... she couldn't remember.  She bit her lip as she ran her fingers through her hair, which quickly got caught in the many matted knots and snarls among the tarnished silver strands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bitt!&quot;  She yelped as she tried to disentangle from her hair without pulling on it too hard, echoed by the tinkling of pixie laughter from the pack that flailed behind her as she spun.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yay!  You haven't been funny in FOREVER, with all that blinking and sighing and stuffs!&quot;  Nerriwiggle flitted up and out of the satchel clapping her hands.  She then slowed into a flutter around Kimaya's head, stopping to cup her chin with her delicate hand.  &quot;You'll hafta cut it out.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stopped and sighed, then finally whispered &quot;Yah, I guess I will.  But the quiet's been kinda nice... eeeeee!&quot;  Her eyes cleared from the ennui to see a small pixie brandishing huge scissors toward her hair.  She turned and ran, one hand clutching her satchel to her while the other was still stuck fast in her hair.  <br>
<br>
She leapt easily over the craggy rocks, but the tall grass of the Stonebrunts playfully tickled at her ankles as she zipped by, responding to Nerri's cries of &quot;Catch her roots, catch her!&quot;  And while she stumbled to keep her balance at the speed of a wolf running from the shears, she started laughing again.  The quiet time for sighs and silence was gone, and once again it was time to play.<br>
<br>
So she stopped sighing and played.  It was as simple as that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=652.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=652.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=652.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=652.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=652.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=652.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
