<br>
If the only restriction set on items is &quot;NBG&quot;, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> yes</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, a rogue can roll on a high AC shield if he keeps a set of AC armor in a weight reducing bag for the times when he has to act as tank in his cleric/druid heavy guild... and a warrior is entitled to roll on a high int item if he considers himself a professional blacksmith who's tradeskilling would be greatly helped by the boost.  They're not greedy for asking, they can actually use the item in question (even if not as much as someone else could).<br>
<br>
If you don't want the warrior to end up w/ a piece of hybrid armor, or a rogue to end up with a high AC shield, just lay that out in the rules before you start.<br>
<br>
Someone else said it in a different thread, but the best thing you can do is be clear about the loot rules from the start.<br>

Need Before Greed means that you should not roll on an item that you will have only extremely situational use for when there are others present who would use it often or full time.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can put restrictions on which classes are eligible for an item, but the problem with that is that there might not be anyone present of the eligible classes who wants it, and in that case, I think it's great if it goes to someone who has a rare/tertiary use for it gets it... like using Bladestopper for the Rune clicks, or the torque for tradeskills.<br>
<br>
Of course, I guess it's not realistic to expect everyone to be considerate of other peoples' needs in light of their own need/greed.<br>
<br>
If you aren't sure if you would use the item in question very often, don't roll against people you know really want and would use it.  It's pretty simple.  At least that's how I feel. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

In that situation, if I grouped a lot, it wouldn't be &quot;extremely situational use&quot;.  It'd be pretty damn often.<br>
<br>
   Bladestopper is AC 25, +50 HP, +15 STA.<br>
<br>
   Clay Guardian shield is AC 25, +55 HP (costs about 600 plat)<br>
<br>
   The stamina on Bladestopper makes it a better shield than clay guardian, but a rogue can't use Clay Guardian due to the class limitations.<br>
<br>
   If a rogue said &quot;Hey, speaking for myself, I tank an awful lot in my guild because we only have a couple warriors and 500 clerics&quot;, I don't think that's being greedy.<br>
<br>
   A Paladin would get better use out of it for sure.  They'd use it more often, and they'd benefit from the stamina more.   I suppose I'm disagreeing with your characterization of anyone asking for an item that doesn't fit your idea of the optimal character to receive the item being &quot;greedy&quot;.<br>
<br>
   Speaking personally, I haven't ever had a problem w/ loot distribution here on FV.  In the one open raid I joined (/cheer Saurix) the loot rules were clear and concise.  Everything else has been grouping w/ friends and NBG and worked out fine.<br>

I am not interested in what your opinions are as to how well the raid leaders loot systems work. I am also not interseted in what your opinion is as to wether or not you have decided I am greedy for wanting to make use of the shield in question.<br>
<br>
What I am and was interested in was wether or not a shield with high enough AC would let me be a more effective light tank for working with lower level adventurers. And the reasoning why or why not. As I had never seen a shield with this level of AC that I could equip it had never occured to me that it might be effective till now. <br>
<br>
If you do not know the answer to this please be quiet and let some one who does know some thing answer.<br>

Given that this thread was started based on a loot dispute, I don't find it particularly strange or unacceptable that it's turned into a debate on what constitutes a fair loot policy and how a person should treat and interpret NBG loot rules.<br>
<br>
But to attempt to answer your question, I don't think that a 25 AC difference is worth the melee damage you're going to lose as a rogue by giving up your secondary weapon, unless you have a really lame secondary weapon, even if you are tanking.  Rogues make poor tanks overall anyhow, possibly the worst of all the melee classes, especially given the fact that their strength is damage output, and by facing an NPC toe to toe, a rogue is giving up a big portion of what makes him so effective (namely, backstab.)  Not to mention the aggro you are giving up by making fewer attacks.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in a situation where there is no other tank in the group, it would probably be better to attempt some other strategy than straight tanking.  Fear kiting, or taunt kiting, pet tanking, ect. or try hard to find a warrior, shadow knight, paladin or even ranger or monk to join the group to do the tanking.<br>
<br>
Will a 25 AC boost help you tank?  Of course (though there is a practical AC cap of 1200-1300), but as has been noted, you probably won't notice it without parsing.  The fact that you'll have to tank <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> longer</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> due to your loss of dual wield or 2H weapon damage likely will totally offset the advantage you will have in tanking better due to higher AC/HP.<br>
<br>
At least that's how it seems to me. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

<br>
Saga is still relatively &quot;tank-lite&quot; though we have picked up a few rangers and another warrior or two.  Hence, the reason Siffo still performs as a tank on many occassions.<br>
<br>
Bjond, <br>
<br>
Again I don't know you, but I would like to make an observation based upon the commentary that you have made here.  It seems to me that you have singled out Siffo for no apparent reason and decided to tell him that he is greedy.  He may be lacking in knowledge as to what is the best gear for his class, etc, but he is not greedy.<br>
<br>
You really should give individuals the benefit of the doubt before you assume that everyone is just like you in level of knowledge regarding Everquest.  Many of us are still learning.  I think that overall you have made some excellent points about how loot distribution could be handled more effectively during raids, and perhaps folks who lead raids will take those suggestions under consideration in future.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that is what you should focus on instead of telling Siffo that he is greedy, or referring to the opinions of those whom you think are greedy as &quot;Siffoisms&quot;.    <br>
<br>
I was proud to see that Siffo was able look beyond your name calling and re-establish the focus of his original question.  He is even receiving good answers to his inquiry thanks to Tukka.<br>

<br>
Thank you Tukka, I appreciate yours and Bippins answers. <br>
<br>
When I had asked the question about the sheild it was very obvious that the initial dispute was over. The fact that Bjorn wanted to keep it going by attacking my integrity clouded the fact that I was just trying to learn something about shields and armor and how viable they are.<br>
<br>
I use many forms of strategies to work with unconventional groups. A lot of times I have more AC than any warriors or paladins there and in a lot of places kiting doesnt work do to add cogestion or no one that can snare. If I had alternatives I would be using them but I don't, it is just me the rogue tank and I have to live with it. Then add a mutiple pull where I am trying to keep aggro of a few targets. Because I am the tank for the group I normaly get aggro first and unless they get real lucky in their hits I have to loose it intentionaly to back stab and once I do back stab I have to literaly evade and back out of the locale aggro range to try and get the mob to turn from me and even then the mob will often turn right back to me when I get close.<br>
<br>
So I figure I need to increase my AC and lower my aggro some this should allow me absorb more damge and still use my evade to get backstabs.<br>
<br>
Like I said it is unconventional but then I still solo sometimes at 47 which by common opinion rogues can't do either,<br>
<br>
Maybe it will work maybe it won't since no one seems to have tried it I guess I will have to and see how much difference it makes. That silly shield would have answered the question and if it hadn't worked, well I do know some young paladins that would have used it.<br>

I have to say that one of the great things about Saga is the fact that we often have folks fighting in less &quot;ideal&quot; groups and we still do reasonably well.<br>
<br>
Give me an unconventional group anytime over your standard &quot;dream group&quot;.  I find experimentation, uncertainty, and near death experiences much more entertaining than knowing that you and your group have little chance of death.<br>
<br>
Examples of a recent groups:  A bard, two paladins, two druids and a rogue in Kedge.  Fun! Fun! Fun! <br>
<br>
Or 4 druids, a bard and a rogue in The Grey acting as a group.  Ah...nothing like it. <p><img src=http://webpages.marshall.edu/~parsons6/Tuppensig.jpg>

In general, if you don't know you want it and deserve it over others, don't roll or ask for it unless it's been thrown open as a tradable/sellable.  If you don't want to hear that you've done something greedy, don't ask if something you've done fits that description; ie. don't ask questions in the soapbox when you want reasurances and not answers.

IIRC, you're a bard.  Would *you* roll on it over a pal/sk?  You could use the rune.  Assuming monk is on the class list, I could use it.  More AC/hp helps pulling.  I use a rainbow at times for resists during pulls.  You don't need to do damage as a pulling monk.  That's all VERY situational.  The whole point is that if you have doubts that your usage would not be among the top of those on the raid, you shouldn't be rolling.  I know I'd never roll on it unless it was open as a tradable.  Likely you, too.  We'd never really use it enough to make keeping it worthwhile.  C'mon, would you even THINK of rolling on a contested item for purely speculative experimental use?<br>
<br>
Whether it's greed or not is all based on how much extra weight you put on your own desire for an item versus how much basic utility the item provides to you and others.  If it provides little utility to you, but you're rolling against those that it has great utility for, that's greed.  When you don't know the utilities, you're just admitting all you have is desire and you aren't considering the utilities at all.  Sure you might be uninformed, but that doesn't make it any less greedy.

   On bladestopper, no.  Fekk tying up my off-hand with a shield.  I keep a sword that gives +15 AC in my offhand, but I'm not losin attacks to pickup AC.  Only shields I'd want are back slot ones like Lodizal shield, excepting maybe some really nice resist shield that I could pair off with drums of the beast if I acquired them someday (drums of the beast can be used in primary slot).<br>
<br>
   However, I did put up a fuss in a Permafrost group I was in once.  We had a group w/ a druid, a cleric, myself, a ranger, and 2 tanks.  A mammoth hide cloak dropped (little AC, nice chunk of +WIS).  The druid got it.  Then we got another for the cleric.  (I agreed with both of those decisions).  Well, a 3rd one dropped.  The Ranger claimed NBG, I felt we should all roll for it.  The ranger could get better use out of it, but we all knew it was a crappy ranger item that he'd use for like 2 levels then sell.  As it was, he put up more of a fuss that he needed it because he could get better use out of it (cuz rangers are wis casters), so we gave it to him...<br>
<br>
...I saw him selling it a week later.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I DO NOT CARE ABOUT LOOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
We are talking about pixels and lines of code in a game, not real things. The issue this thread started on wasn't about the loot. It was that many consider it very bad form and without honor to take some thing won in a NBG roll and sell it a few hours later.<br>
<br>
If you knew many of the people from Saga you would understand. Sure an UBER STICK OF THWACKING would be nice. But the real enjoyment is getting it with guildmates and friends. Hell some of the guild members actually repel plat and we have to sit on them and force them to take items they can use.<br>
<br>
Your perspective is so oddly skewed on this because it doesn't occur to you that I really don't care about plat or loot any more than I would care about buying Park Place in Monopoly. It is all just bits in a game and mean nothing beyond the enjoyment of playing.<br>
<br>
If you could get past your fixation with greed and XP you would find a whole new higher plan of enjoyment in Ever Quest.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You asked for an opinion and you got it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I asked about using a shield in a very specific situation. The greed thing you keep on going on about is your fixation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If you don't care about loot, why'd you roll?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It's part of the game silly. Its exciting and fun to be part of a random roll. As it is I rarely roll unless it is just a sell it item. This was a special case because I thought I might have a good use for the item.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  What you say matters a lot less than what you do.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
See you do get some things right. I am quite comfortable with my actions. I don't get belligerent when some one disagrees, I explain. If they still don't get it oh well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  In case you haven't caught on, I'm arguing pricinpals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Reread the first part. You are espousing a personal dichotomy and fixation. I was trying to find out about using a shield.(Nothing important but it is spelled principles)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  BTW, I hate to break it to you, but there are no Zen masters. No such beast. Lots of students, no masters. Zen is a joke.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Other than the blaring inconsistency of this statement I harken back to the phrase.&quot;For those that understand no explanation is required. For those that do not understand there is no explanation&quot;<br>
