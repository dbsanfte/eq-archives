Vall, I could pull at least half of your post out and find a direct comparison on my Bristlebane logs. That's why I'm here. I didn't want to abandon my &quot;uber&quot; 36 monk, Lord knows I put some work into him, but my enjoyment is in the RP.<br>
<br>
I haven't any horror stories of encounters with d00ds here, but I have countless times had to deal with folks who have no intention of RPing their character. Direct interaction, via say, with others around. Why must I suspend my gaming because you don't want to play the 'preferred' way? If I deal with you as my character would, why can't you make the attempt to do the same? Or go find someone who plays like you do?<br>
<br>
Yes, I find it a bit distressing that the non-RPers here are getting hassled the same way that we did on other servers. I don't agree with that. But I also don't see many of you accepting the fact that there are RPers here (gasp!), and that they would like to play that way without catering to you. For a change.<br>
<br>
One last note, for clarity. None of this was directed at anyone in particular. None of this applies to my dealings with folks like FaF, because I've HAD no dealings with them. In fact, they have acted like I had thought the non-RPers would here: they leveled fast and got out of our lowbie areas, stuck together for their playstyle, and don't insist we cater to them. Bravo, for all that I don't know you.<br>
<br>
In short, please don't run up to me asking to group with your soft self in LoIO, and be offended when I /snarl at you. That's what I was told I'd be ALLOWED to do here.<br>

From Aradune's post at the bottom of the forums, referring to FV:<br>
<br>
***<br>
First, just what are we going to call it? As I’d mentioned in an earlier post, we do hesitate to call it an ‘RP’ server for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1. We feel all of our servers are Role Playing Servers and that EverQuest is indeed a Role Playing Game.<br>
<br>
2. We feel it’s pretty much impossible to define what Role Playing is verbally, much less via a rule set.<br>
<br>
The idea then came up to call it the ‘Alignment’ server, since a character’s alignment is pretty key to many of the features we’re implementing. But, to me, that still doesn’t speak to what the server is really all about. From my perspective it’s an RP server, an Alignment server, a hard-core ‘Seige Perilous’ style server, and, quite simply, an experiment server, where we’re implementing some potential ideas for the long-term future, as well as some features we’d probably have put in the game originally, given 20/20 hindsight.<br>
***<br>
<br>
So, FV was named &quot;roleplaying preferred&quot; because (1) VI wanted to maintain the idea that, actually, ALL of their servers were really RP, and (2) they did not want to impose their own idea of RP on people and thereby limit RP innovation. But, in the end, Brad calls it an &quot;RP server&quot;, not an &quot;RP preferred server&quot;. <br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with what the server is now, or in what direction the server is evolving. But hopefully this might lay to rest the incorrect notion that FV was created and originally intended as a server just &quot;with a different ruleset, and if people RP on it, that's cool&quot;. It was intended by VI for RP (if you care what VI thinks, I don't necessarily. And yes, I am an avid RPer.)<br>
<br>

<br>
I mean, really. It's just a game.<br>
<br>
I roleplay. Only ocassionally on Bristlebane, when I'm hanging out with some friends who also like to RP, but pretty much all the time on FV (the ocassional ooc /t,/g,/gu notwithstanding). I also run into a lot of people who don't RP. (People who talk like d00ds.) Or don't RP within the &quot;vision&quot; I have for my character. (Softskins who want to group with me.) <br>
<br>
Now, I really wish the d00ds would at least make an effort to speak normally and PRETEND to RP on this server for my sake, but is it really worth getting pissed off about if they don't? Just ignore them (you don't have to /ignore if they're not harrassing you; just pretend they aren't there, is it so hard?) and move on.<br>
<br>
The other folks, who RP but don't mesh well with my character, well, I tend to get in IC arguments with them. A lot. It usually ends with each of us calling the other a blithering fool and moving on, but hey, that's RP. You don't have to get along with everyone.<br>
<br>
And sure, it may be IC for my character to go around being incredibly rude and condescending to softskins, and trying to drive them out of &quot;his&quot; territory via /duel, but if they choose not to accept, that's their prerogative. Consensual combat is a VERY IMPORTANT facet of RP in a game like this. Once you add open PvP, there's no RP anymore. People just gank you and call it RP. RP is not being ganked. RP is being threatened, exchanging a few &quot;poses&quot; (emotes) and then, maybe fighting, maybe not, maybe one guy runs away, maybe one guy just decides he doesn't want to fight and wants to stay right where he is. Maybe he has the flu IRL and doesn't want to fight. We should respect that.<br>
<br>
It's NOT that hard to just pretend someone isn't there and move on. A game of this scope practically requires it. Of course not everyone's gonna meet your personal vision of RP. Find the ones who do, and play with them. FV has the highest concentration of RPers of any available server, and that's why I play on it. My glass is half full. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 3:01:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A stand for all the d00ds, phat l3wt3rs, twinks, ubers, </span><hr size=1> /agree smallcutepuppy<br>

This post was supposed to be a stand for everyone who wasn't a roleplayer, to show their side of the story. That d00d probably called you an asshole for a reason, which my examples and skits were to present.<br>
<br>
It was also meant that it's ironic how some of these roleplayers think they know what's best for the game, and that everybody else who doesn't play like them (I.e. power levels, twinks, doesn't roleplay) should be banned from the server. <br>
<br>
THAT was my point. I'd like to add that you people should stop trying to say what Verant meant. They've got a Customer Service team that works as their mouth, not some player they no nothing about. They said it was a server with an alternate ruleset. The end. Go express your conspiracy theories about what they meant about roleplay preferred elsewhere.<br>

 I am not saying that is how I interpreted it when FV was created. I came here for many things, RP was and is at the top of the list. I RP pretty well for a MAWNAM (middle aged white north american male), but I will never be able to immerse myself to the extent some of you can.<br>
<br>
Recently the massively unrational and poorly thought out arguments that blatently told people to either conform to some people's idea of RP or leave made me angry. I took stands that I believe are true, but not necessarily what I would personally like to see. My analyst side took over and forced me to present arguments in an attempt to balance the sides.<br>
<br>
If you ever have need for a poorly leveling barbarian to take up a sword in your defense we will have a good time. Borm is a very stupid and straight forward warrior. Just do not use too many big words in his presence and you will be alright. (Think large dog). <br>
<br>
I just do not want to see anyone chased off this server because of his/her RP views. If a d00d comes here bashing RP then you will think I am Shintou reborn.<br>

<br>
Anyway, accept the fact that you don't belong here, and enjoy the game. I know I don't belong on FV, but I like it here for many other reasons so I'm staying. I'm not so insecure about my intentions or so guilt-riden that I have to manufacture a defense for it. It's very plain and simple. FV was launched for the roleplayers. I'm not a roleplayer, much. I'll respond in like context when presented with it, but I pretty much just want to do the exp hunt, dungeon crawling, video game part. I don't think I'm harming any true RPers game with my quiet style. I want to get to the end-game, but having been there before I'm not rushed to it. I'm rather enjoying the availability of all those low and mid level dungeons that I didn't do the first few times around. I think the RPers have to RP our presence because, right or wrong, we ain't leaving. Likewise, since the RPers are the only reason this server exists, we owe them utter courtesy and respect. They will eventually lose this server to us and the PGers to come, and that's pretty messed up for them.<br>

End-game guilds are the nails in the RP coffin. Argue amongst yourselves on that if you want. Right now there's 1 nail, and that's not so bad, really. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 4:25:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wow, my point was just taken out back and molested by 17</span><hr size=1> /agree Hrain. If someone is going to play on this server and not RP, your attitude is exactly the one I hope they have. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Borm, I see nothing wrong with saying &quot;If you aren't going to RP, I would prefer that you play on a different server.&quot; There's nothing nasty about that, just stating a preference. That's my stance. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you ever have need for a poorly leveling barbarian to take up a sword in your defense we will have a good time.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't doubt it, although Aradil is more than capable of defending himself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Vall said, &quot;I'm sick of seeing regular players being kicked around and intimidated by some guy who thinks Firiona Vie was created for roleplayers only. It wasn't. That's why it's called preferred.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then you said, &quot;I'd like to add that you people should stop trying to say what Verant meant.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to hold people to their exact wording, but this is a pretty blatant contradiction. If you're going to get nasty, at least try to be consistent. And no one here has made personal accusations, Vall, at least that I remember, certainly nothing like &quot;scum of the earth&quot;. Except maybe the people who say &quot;RP nazi&quot;. &quot;Powergamer&quot; and &quot;uberguild&quot; are I think only offensive to people who are ashamed (?) to be in that category. <br>
<br>
And no, I'm not perfect either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvallshadowstrife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vall Shadowstrife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 5:12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wow, my point was just taken out back and molested by 17</span><hr size=1> Addressed, in order of poster.<br>

&quot;Non-roleplayers don't have a side of their story. Otherwise, they'd be roleplayers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course they don't! It's foolish to think that people who don't roleplay are NEVER bothered by roleplayers. Why, we roleplayers are better than those non-roleplayers. I can't understand why those non-roleplayers get angry when we yell at them in character, or tell them that they don't belong on that server. <br>
<br>
In case you can't tell, that was dripping with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
To the person who said I was contradicting myself:<br>
<br>
I was paraphrasing exactly what Verant said.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
