I think the group had just lost someone and I was filling a vacant spot.  One of the characters in our group was doing all the looting, so I figured he was MLing.<br>
<br>
Right off the bat, I don't really like master looting in pickup groups.  First of all, you often don't know the people you're grouping with, and if they're to be trusted.  Second, it's inconvenient even if you are trusting, because oftentimes in pickup groups, people come and go, and trying to evenly figure out how to split the loot in those situations can be more trouble than it's worth.<br>
<br>
However, when I'm the newcomer in an already formed group, I'm not inclined to tell the group to stop doing what they've been doing, as that can create its own complications.<br>
<br>
So we're in this group, and we're pulling from the earth wing to the four-way junction.  Early on, a spectral parchment drops and is looted by the MLer.  It's possible that I'm the only one (besides the looter) who noticed it, because nobody said anything.  At this point I had all but one of my level 63/64, so I don't get all excited over a ML drop, so I didn't celebrate it.<br>
<br>
Later we move to the table/forge room and start clearing there.  The first named we killed there dropped a thunderous ring a spirit, and the next one we killed dropped the drums and a spectral parchment.  At this point someone asks if we should roll, and I suggest we wait until the end (or until someone leaves) to roll since we hadn't rolled on anything up to that point yet.  They accept, we fight some more and kill another named and get another ring.<br>
<br>
At this point the cleric has to leave and she asks for the jord meat we'd collected up to that point.  Nobody answers her at first, as we're talking about rolling on the stuff we got.  The cleric starts getting impatient, repeatedly asking for the meat, and someone else in the group says &quot;Give her the meat already&quot;, and the MLer says &quot;I destroyed it.&quot;  At first we're not sure if he's joking or not.  He gives her 1 jord meat.  She asks for the rest, and he says he destroyed it.  Okay, I could see how a newbie to the zone may make that mistake (even though the cleric claims she said up front at the beginning that she wanted the meat, and the MLer was level 65).<br>
<br>
So then we got to the loot we're rolling on.  I say, &quot;Okay, so we've got two rings, a drum, and 2 (or was it 3) spectral parchments?&quot; (I wasn't sure if two of the nameds had dropped parchments or just one, but I distinctively remembered that two drops).  The MLer says &quot;Only one spectral&quot;.  I ask him to check his inventory again.  He says &quot;No, just one spectral and the EP we got earlier&quot;.<br>
<br>
Despite my insistence that two SPs had been looted, the MLer maintained that he only had the one.  Anyway, we rolled on the stuff and I won the SP that he did concede that.  However, the MLer (a warrior) rolled on the parchment despite the fact that I asked at one point (not during a fight or anything, when nobody was busy or AFK)  if we were doing NGB, one person replied &quot;Yes.&quot; and nobody objected.  Anyway, he got the highest roll and when I noticed that we were moving on to roll for other stuff and I hadn't yet been handed my parchment, I asked &quot;I won the parchment, didn't I?&quot; and he says &quot;I rolled higher, though. ;P&quot;--again, he might have been joking/teasing, but given the rest of his behavior I'm not inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Someone remarks &quot;You can't use it&quot; and he gives me the parchment without any more of a struggle.<br>
<br>
By the way, I checked the log file and he did indeed loot two parchments (one at 15:31:33 and the other at 18:04:00), so it's not just my faulty memory at work here.<br>
<br>
So the only conclusion I can come to is that A) he destroyed the parchment, thinking it was only ethereal (still a really stupid thing to do, as you will sometimes find someone in BoT who wants the EPs if not for themselves, for a friend or alt), B) it was in his inventory and he just didn't do a thorough check of all of his bags despite my insistence that an additional SP was looted or C) He was a greedy fucking liar.<br>
<br>
I'm leaning towards C.<br>
<br>
I'm not posting the name though, since most of you don't know me well enough to trust my word over his.  My friends who do know/trust me will be receiving a warning about the greed and/or incompetence of this individual.<br>
<br>
The lesson I've learned here is to be very wary MLing in pickup groups and to speak up &quot;for the record&quot; whenever I notice someone loot something of value.<br>
<br>
A lesson for all you would-be MLers out there, though:<br>
<br>
1) Don't be a greedy prick.<br>
<br>
2) If you don't know what something is for or if it has any value, ASK the group or look it up before destroying it.<br>
<br>
3) Pay attention to what you loot and where you put it, and if someone asks you to check your inventory for an item, do a proper job of it.<br>
<br>
Here's a couple others, peeves of mine that I noticed in my MLer that are less serious, but still somewhat annoying:<br>
<br>
4) Don't volunteer yourself as MLer if you have a common lore item that drops in the area banked.  The MLer should be able to keep the area clear of corpses by themselves if possible.<br>
<br>
5) When your group drops a named NPC, don't stand crouched over the corpse for 20 seconds making silly remarks without looting the corpse or even saying what the mob had, especially when you're the MT and the enchanter has a mob mezzed.<br>

One they are right there next to the corpse when it falls and can loot it faster and two the caster has to break med to loot which slows the group down.  <br>
<br>
Course if you have good melees who don't loot every mob as it drops then free for all isn't bad.  Those though are the exception not the rule in pick up groups.  <br>

I don't have enough friends who play as much as I do around my level range for me to forsake pickup groups, and sometimes you WILL meet some cool new people in pickup groups.<br>
<br>
In places like BoT, I really think that one of the better policies that might serve is the old fashioned &quot;alpha loot&quot; or some variant on it.  So you can loot until you get a diamond/raw diamond/whatever, then you don't loot (except to clear corpses, ect.) until everyone else gets a gem.<br>
<br>
Personally that's the rule I tend to follow when I'm in a group that's not MLing, even if I don't tell the group that's what I'm doing.  I get my gem, and wait until I see 5 or more gems drop before looting again, unless a corpse has been lying around for a pull or two without anybody looting it, then I'll play garbageman, and if it gets me paid, cool. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I try not to be too greedy, but people can't be too generous either.  If you're about to leave a group and you haven't looted any diamonds or good vendor loot yet, speak up and chances are there will be at least one generous individual in the group willing to part with one of theirs. <p>--Velsor<br>

I am blessed to have a number of good friends, and I don't need to join pickup groups, but it stinks when people are coming and going at different times.  I do the best I can at ensuring fair compensation for people's work, but it's just the nature of the game that people who are around at the end of the night will end up with a bigger share.<br>
<br>
Still, I'm very much not a greedy person, and I think I do a good job of being the ML.  I love to make jokes and goof around, but I don't fart around with the group's proceeds.  Sounds like your ML Warrior was a real bastard.  I would never take advantage of my group, I am nothing without them.  I don't really want the role, but I know I can trust myself to be honest, so I end up taking that job, even though it's often a huge headache and I have to dig up the calculator and take a bunch of notes to keep things fair.  EQ's system just isn't user-friendly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oafgau>Oafgau</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/03 5:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3987.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Master looters who suck.</span><hr size=1> Need Specs Velsor?

It's fine if, as a caster, you don't mind not getting anything. But if you need money for spells, it's a pain as you can guarantee the Melee's will split the lion's share amongst them.<br>
<br>
Done Alpha looting. Problem there is forgetting who was next to loot.<br>
<br>
Done ML. Works if the groups going to start and end together so all can get a fair split. Or you know the group and know you'll get your fair share later.<br>
<br>
Best method of looting? Depends on who your with and if you trust them. For a pickup group, Alpha's the best looting bases with a condition to 'special' loot.<br>
<br>
Alpha looted recently and the leader declared that gems would be rolled for - but once you won a gem you didn't roll again until everyone had won a gem. Same applied for kit drops. Everything else went to the looter with auto split off. Nice additional rule, though, was Clerics were to loot twice every other round to cover for regents. Something I think most people forget - that Temperance, Symbol or Virtue has cost the Cleric a gem - commonly a Peridot worth 11pp approx. As they get pestered to cast these on the MA and SA, and even on the puller, the cleric's often out of pocket to start with. Oh, and Peridots were split between clerics and were not counted towards loot in addition to the loot twice rule. I expect that, in an area that was richer in drops, though, that rule might have been altered.<br>
<br>
Then again - the group was mostly known to each other, so there was an intrisic level of trust there.<br>
<br>
Usually wind up as Master Looter - or at least the seller (tend to have the highest CHA, and faction). It is *very* important you trust the person selling / splitting.<br>
<br>
But the simple rule is - when joining a group, check what the loot policy is. If there's something specific you're looking for - say so. Speak early on, or live with the consequences. After all - what if that Warrior was the only person in the group who *wanted* to loot? If everyone else was full or near max weight? Unless you speak out, you'll not know and therefor not be able to judge if you even want to stick with the group (Would you join a pick-up group where all Blue Diamonds were going to one person, but that person also got an even split of all other loot?) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baldisking>Baldisking</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 380<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/03 10:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3987.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Master looters who suck.</span><hr size=1> /agree   I've seen some greedy bastards out there.<br>
<br>
I do not group much at all outside my guild.  If I do, it is often a group with 2 or 3 of my guildies in that I can trust.  I always prefer ML in my groups, and most often I must admit it is me ML'ing (lots of bag space as I do not need to carry dots etc).<br>
<br>
If you ML IMHO you have a duty to check if people need items that drop.  Luckily as I group in guild we run effectively NBG, no arguments.  No lying takes place and no grumbling occurs.<br>
<br>
To ML and hold back items is a disgrace and I hope you burn forever in hell.  To steal from those you group with is repugnant.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I have noticed since breaking 61 after a long break from EQ that in general I find a lot of the 'poppers' as I call them have are not in this level range.  Or is it just me?  You know the type, have no idea how to level outside of paludal /yawn PoV /yawn etc.  The 'If it is not outdoors or an easy zone dont go in types?  I never met those types anyway, I live in Seb/KC/Veksar (I want that bloody lupine if it kills me, I am OWED!).  Don't find many poppers there but when I have met them, disaster!   They loot everything in sight, no idea how to play their class AND have zero flexibility.  Anyway, nuff said. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dessirra>dessirra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/03 11:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3987.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Master looters who suck.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I will use this post from now on when you say you dont wanna be MLer  you are forever ML queen in our groups MUHAHA<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>

I preffer a ML situation, dont mind doing it mmyself except that I get encumbered quickly due to caster style STR (weak as usual). ML needs to be done by someone the entire group trusts though, and these sort of situations like in this post really ruin the whole concept for everyone. *Sighs* <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

I learned that in pickup groups you should forget about loot, you won't get it if you want to be efficient (and I pull the second a monster drops). This always happened and will keep happening, the only way out is friends/guild. <p>Silenius<br>

<br>
Velsor, whoever looted for you gives us proper ML'ers a bad name :P<br>
<br>
Some of us keep tabs and do our best to loot divy fairly. I almost ALWAYS roll on good loot right away though so no one forgets at all, as we get it. Easier that way.<br>
<br>
(unless its a raid, can't roll during a raid of course)<br>
<br>
Out of the loot when I ML my consideration is first: Cleric, to compensate cleric first for dots spent. Second would be to do the rolls, third would be to divide everything else up fairly. If there's some special thing only a baker would want or whatever, folks get asked if so and so can have. (Like who wants the durned hobgoblin meat, or the hero parts, or whatever <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
If someone leaves, they usually get loot from me later as I write down what we had up until that moment and then start fresh counter for the 'new' group. I keep a notebook beside me and if its a pickup group what changes rapidly, then I keep copious notes to make sure eveyrone gets treated fairly.<br>
<br>
sometimes I've divvied up the saleable loot amongst folks leaving keeping some for the rest of the group. Sometimes it may not be exactly perfect, but its not perfect in alpha loot either, because in alpha loot sometimes you get an empty corpse, and many groups still consider that 'you' looted, on to the next!<br>

<br>
Looting was not alpha either -- We had a Master-caller who had a list and ran down the list over and over. It worked out well. We all knew each other - and it was agreed upon that any Major Items would be rolled upon ie - NBG was the call on weapons and armor and spells and such . . . gems, and such were takes for the pocket. It worked out well. Money was auto-split each pickup.<br>
<br>
I have been in groups as a cleric and had to sit and med and damme if most folks ferget there is a cleric keeping their sorry skinny asses alive. If I get up to run half way across a room to pick up a loot then I either get bitched at for not medding or I  lose precious time not medding. This is when ML is important and HONOR is also important.
