a 11th season Paladin was bothering me in Gfay while I was RPing some duels, so being one who has always fought a duel even when I know I 'll lose I don't ever really think about<br>
the &quot;level&quot; range when RPing duels, if someone steps up to me and talks smack then I feel, like I do you should be willing to die for your words right? It is RP after all, so as I sat going through spells to fight a Warrior who had RP challenged me yet had not hit /duel, I told the young pally he better move along or he would die, he didn't so I hit the duel button thinking that he would get the hint that I would gladly kill him for annoying me and decline and move on.<br>
<br>
Well he didn't ge the hint and said he wanted me to take off all my armor and put away my weapons (you know those really fast high damage 1HB the Enchanters use to tank with hehehe) and fight him with out spells.<br>
<br>
So here it would be a 41st chanter &quot;boxing&quot; against a fully armed 11th season Paladin, now I think at 11 he should of had at least 250 to 300 HP depending on gear, as a pure caster who is naked with no DMG shield I have maybe 600-650 HPs self buffed with DMG shield up I can pull off a little over a grand, but he said no magic, no buffs, no weapons nothing.<br>
<br>
So to get to my point, for one I think he would have kicked my ass, because I have no skill points in H2H, but the question I ask is How many of you Melees (besides Monks)<br>
keep your punching skill up? And do those that Duel wield<br>
like Warriors, Rogues, Bards, Rangers do you get a dual attack empty handed? Not just the double, but a hit with both the primary and off hand? <br>
<br>
I know a odd question, but I do know some of you melees are really into your skills and even keep up the odd ones like 2HB<br>
so please tell me a little about empty handed fighting.<br>
<br>
Oh and in the end the Pally got bored of me ignoring him and decided to attack me I think he got three hits on my rune shield before my duel wielding animation with Celerity<br>
chopped him into little bits, needless to say he was much calmer and not as quick to act like a clown when he came back for his corpse, as far as the other duels, the Warrior had to leave before we could duel, but I did duel two Rangers, both challenged me one was 5 seasons younger than me, the other was 5 seasons higher. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chasefv>ChaseFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/1/03 2:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: interesting duel proposition</span><hr size=1> I am utterly psychotic about my weapon skills. I have all of them maxed at the pre-50 cap: 1HS, 2HS, 1HB, 2HB, H2H, Throwing, Archery, Piercing, Kick. It was really just a goal I had, but I also wanted to be able to maximize my ability to put to good use any weapon I might have the good fortune to stumble upon. The likelihood that I will ever win a roll on such a weapon is slim, but on the off-chance I get lucky, I'll be ready to wield whatever I get. Granted, I spread out my skills as much as possible before hitting 40, but several skills had lagged a little behind (specifically 2HB, throwing, H2H), so I had to practice these skills specifically while fear-kiting in Jaggedpine or Eastern Wastes.<br>
<br>
That being said, with a STR in the 140's, I punch for 12 max, IIRC (haven't intentionally H2H'd since I capped the skill). I am able to attack with both hands as a dual wielder. I think it would be interesting to do a boxing match duel... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=589241"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chase</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Been meaning to raise it.  And yes, I punch offhand.  It was useful yesterday... I died ahead of a raid and waited for them to get to me for the rez, so in the mean time I went about trying to get as much loot as I could.  I went to Rathe Mountains and managed to punch to death a lizard with a rusty short sword (barely took damage, too), then used that to beat up another one with a bronze spear.  Also managed to pickpocket about 50pp from the giants.<br>

STA wise to beat me all the way down, I'll have to try it and find out, now I am interested in this idea. I think I'll become the one fisted tanking Enchanter, it shouldn't be hard to raise the skill a few points, I was at 15 in 1HB two weeks ago and have not been playing much but with Celerity and rampage cast on myself in a easy group where CC was not a issue<br>
I got my 1HB up to 80-85 now. ( I decided to work on my<br>
1HB skill because I have two weapons that have procs that I want to use in duels to interrupt casters, plus with Werewolf form or Boon of Garu cast on myself I can melee real fast for faction hunting in places like the Warrens.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=synim>synim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tich Greyskull<br>

took for ever though all my stamina was gone hehehe.<br>
I had a great duel against my lovely wife Diamante last week<br>
we are close in levels i think she was 38 and I was 41.<br>
She hits way harder than me and can heals and has good MR gear where as I have tons of mana with my INT well over 200, the duel lasted 15+ minutes and ended with a melee fight because we where both OOM, I barely won that I had 46 HPs left and had been OOM for over 3 minutes she was hitting for 25 dd with her hammer I was hitting for 10-15 but with my hatse recast on me alot quicker than she was, what saved me was putting away my sacrificial skull hammer and pulling out my staff of writhing which procs a 48dd spell but with the PvP restriction it hits in the very low 30s with her resists even lower, but I waited until my hammer proced its DEX/STR boost with a small DMG shield made just enough difference, now I have a shaded staff 22 DLY 10 DMG<br>
I bought just for dueling casters, no proc but +SV to everything but fire in think. this will be fun, depending on resists if I can get a mez off on a pure caster, mana sieve until they are oom, which will leave me close to oom, blind them then step in for the melee, most casters I know now have not meleed since they where level 5, most never with 1HB. This will be fun to experiment with.<br>
Should be fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zaithfv>ZaithFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Quellious<br>

there is limits and Enchanters get pretty nice as they gain seasons as well, though as far as duels go the classes are serverly unbalanced, in the end it starts to even out, SKs are tough no doubt, but they are not un-beatible. One day, maybe not soon but one day old friend I will make ye cry like a little woodelfie girl MUAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zaithfv>ZaithFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of Quellious<br>
