<br>
You are approached by someon you do not know, you strike up a good RP conversation, decide to go hunting somewhere, <br>
<br>
The hunting goes great, everything in in character, the people are fun, but you begin to realize the main tank is taking less damage than you would expect and is killing faster.<br>
<br>
Also they parse on pp and items.<br>
<br>
After a while you ask to examine them, they say sure.<br>
<br>
You find to your horror they are twinked up the jacksie. What do you do? <br>
<br>
What has changed at this point?<br>
<br>
Do  you continue grouping, do you break character to get cranky. Has the nice person become nasty . . . <br>
<br>
Do you disrespect them even though they know there class just because they have nice items?<br>

The twit in a few bits of patchwork with a rusty weapon can't really afford to piss everyone off too much, or they hurt their chances of getting what they want. So they tend to leave once their attitude starts costing them. The guy who doesn't need anything and is a self-centered jackass will not pay any particularly uncomfortable price for stepping on toes, and is more likely to stick around.<br>

(Aradune's Fiery avenger was given to him by Karana :P)<br>
And, i know people who has managed to obtain all the best stuff in the game before level 20 simply by being an exceptionally good buisnessman (For some people, doing business is what makes EQ enjoyable), and on our server you can obtain even nicer items this way because of 'NO DROP' items being quite uncommon.<br>
<br>
Judge people by character, not by gear unless you want to express your jealousy or prejudice (This is the way it works in real life as well).<br>
<br>
(My own gear is way below the average standards of level 40 paladins, but i like it anyways...makes me look handsome :P)<br>

<br>
UNLESS <br>
<br>
they're so over equipped that they inhibit me from doing my job in a group. <br>
<br>
For instance, Im a monk. I enjoy pulling, and am still learning how to do so as a monk. Grouping with Twinked Warrior X who demands he/she pull due to a Twinked AC of 1200 at lvl 10 is *not* my idea of exciting OR a good time OR an educational experience. <br>
<br>
If all I was interested in was getting phat experience, grouping with Twinked Warrior X might appeal to me a great deal. But I want to learn and to raise my skills as a puller. Having Twinked Warrior X reduce my job to being a secondary tank/damage dealer/bystander at a point in time when I should be learning and honing my skills as a puller is actually detrimental to me.<br>
<br>
I realize that at higher levels there are times when monks do not pull, and they are sometimes asked merely to be damage dealers, and will gladly accept that role then. *smiles* But I want to learn while I still can, in the lower levels, when a mistake on my part while Im learning may not cause my party to lose vast amounts of time as a result.<br>
<br>
In an instance like this, I would likely try to find another group to get involved with. And in all likelyhood, Twinked Warrior X would be able to compensate for my departure anyway.<br>
<br>
There are other instances, too, where twinks can significantly disrupt the balance of a group. For instance, twinked rogues can make it almost impossible for an untwinked warrior to hold aggro, thus pulling taunt from the main tank, leading to possible troubles for everyone... <br>
<br>
In the end, I will group with people based on who they are, not what they wear, and try to find ways around any difficult circumstances that might arise from an imbalance created by gear.<br>
<br>
But there are times when twinking can create problems that might not be there otherwise.<br>

<br>
Actually, my experience is completely the opposite.  Twinks are often long time players of EQ who have grouped with every other type of class, and probably has a very good idea of everyone's role in the group and how to make the group function best.  Twinks know how to do their jobs very well, and also have insight into what the other members of the group are doing.<br>
<br>
In my own experience, the twink's biggest problem is that they are boooorrrrring.  Seriously, about all you see out of a twink in a typical grind is:<br>
<br>
Incoming message<br>
Mana reports<br>
Add messages<br>
<br>
It's all business with them, as most of them just want to get through these low levels as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
That being said, I did hear the following exchange out in Greater Fay last night...<br>
<br>
twink shouts, 'What level do Centi Warspears proc?'<br>
person shouts, 'They don't proc'<br>
person shouts, 'So the answer is, never'<br>
twink shouts, 'So it'll always only hit for 20?'<br>
person shouts, 'What level are you?'<br>
twink shouts, 'Level 2'<br>
twink shouts, 'Why can't you guys use OOC on this server anyway...'<br>
......<br>
<br>
yea.<br>
<br>
Apparently doing 20 point of damage per swing to mobs that have between 16 and 48 hitpoints just wasn't good enough.  Metinks it's people like that which gives twinks a bad name.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

(ooc)<br>
   Skill can depend on whether the twink collected their items through another charry they own, through friends/relatives/relations, or through ebay. Some still bother to learn the finer points of their class though their clothes play their class through their youth.

Unless they're dark elf lasses, then I'm keenly interested. Aye, it's true, I've got a thing for blue women. Karana forgive my forbidden desires!<br>
<br>
But seriously, I DO care deeply about what I am wearing, because I want to fight well and look good doing it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
But I don't care what others wear. Life's far too short to be caught up in gear envy. Are the people around you fun to be with? If the answer is yes, have fun!<br>
<br>
If you find yourself overly concerned with the gear of others, try the following:<br>
1. Open eqclient.ini file in your Everquest folder.<br>
2. Make sure &quot;InspectOthers=FALSE&quot;<br>
3. Make sure &quot;ShowInspectMessage=FALSE&quot;<br>
4. Relax<br>
5. Do your own thing!<br>

Ok, I like this one. To all those who have ever grouped with me, you have grouped with a twink. Sorry about that. You see as a young lad of 8 I ran from Qeynos to the Field of Bone, all by myself, no special gear or anything. Upon getting there I came across my Lizards. From that point on, I have been a twink. Everytime they came across some cleric only item.......they gave it to the ONLY cleric they knew. And even if they had not I would have remained loyal to the Lizards, wether mean ones like the Ven Sho, funny ones like PA, confused ones who are actually goblins, or even complete RP ones...because it's my job...and because nobody else will. :P<br>

<br>
To answer my own question<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Do you continue grouping, do you break character to get cranky. Has the nice person become nasty . . . <br>
<br>
Do you disrespect them even though they know there class just because they have nice items?<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Hell yes I continue to group with them, I have found a nice fun functional person, they do NOT get to escape just because they are over equipped.<br>
<br>
Hell no do I disrespect them, depending on the RP of the character I am playing i might tease them about who they slept with / killed / parents where stuck up etc to have gotten nice stuff, but then again maybe my character does not even care. In rl I do not care as long as they are fun nice and functional.<br>
<br>
The point of this thread was to make folks give over equiped people a chance. Once you have grouped with them, then judge them. To be fair, I might be less tolerant of someone who is twinked up da jacksie. This means if they are dumb I am more likely to kick em, if they are rude I am more likely to kick em. But I gives em a chance.<br>
<br>
In general I give most folks a chance, alot of people are missing either a) fun, b) skill, c) that unknown quality that makes you want to play with them for hundreds of hours :-) so I am not going to limit my play based on equipment.<br>
<br>
If the person is fun skillful and underequiped, hell I would work to get them equiped :-)<br>
<br>
Judge the person not the equip and that goes both directions. Met a warrior once who only liked to wear leather, ooh that was a hard one to work with but in every other way he rocked so . . . .  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
