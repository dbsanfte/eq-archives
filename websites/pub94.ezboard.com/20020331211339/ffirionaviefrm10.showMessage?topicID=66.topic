The leaves, clap in their golden armor, glissened in the new rays of light as the broke through the boughs. Drops of mouning dew lay thick on the carpet of high grass. The day beacken a young preist of Tunare to seek out his most favorite, secluded location in order to give praise to the Mother of all for the gorgeous day.<br>
 Clad in not but his initiates tunic, he made his pilgrimage along the path which lay just outside the grand gates of Felwithe. In no time he found himself in the deeper forest and lost himself in thankful prayer. While on the path he noticed a movement. Not something out of the place here in the woods as the forest teemed with life. But this movement came with the harsh grunts of a foul language. Ieglios knew nothing of the tongue he heard only that it was NOT elven and did not sound like it was in the mood for conversation. <br>
 Ducking behind a large fallen tree, he nervously peered toward the source of the disturbance. As he had suspected.<br>
 &quot;Orcs!&quot; he wispered, surprising himself that he had actually said the name aloud.<br>
  One of the three orcs glanced cautiously in his direction but, thank the Mother, did not appear to think too much about it. They appeared to be moving a crate and where not too happy about being the ones doing all the work. <br>
 Ieglios knew that if orcs where here they would be up to nothing good. The foul cursed creatures where notorious poachers and destroyers of Tunares blessed trees.Alone and unprepared he could do nothing to stop whatever foul plan they were carrying out.<br>
 Suddenly the lead orc shouted something which appeared to be a warning, all of the foul creatures drew steel as they looked to the clearing some yards away. <br>
 There in the morning light stood a creature of breathtaking beutty. Majestic and noble, it's fur glisstenedd a silver hue. Its pure white coat clean and free from all blemishes. The unicorn shook its horned head at the orcs and speaking in elvish said &quot;You are not welcome here, you will leave now or pay for you imputance with you pathetic lives.&quot;<br>
 &quot;We no afraid of yu,horney horse.&quot; The lead orcs spit out in a very unelvish elf tongue which made Ieglious's skin crawl.<br>
 &quot;We serve the dark ones, and they will skin you soon enuf&quot;...with that he let out a rumbling laugh. <br>
 With out moving the unicorn had appeared before the orcs, one movement, barely perceivable being so fast, found the horn of the unicorn protruding from the centurions back.The centurions now limp body lay on the ground fouling the earth with its black putrecence.<br>
 With equal ease the unicorn did lay the other two orcs down by there comrade. The unicorn wiped its bloodied horn in the tall grass and soon stumbled. Wincing in the burning pain the unicorn lay down. A small trickle of blood trailed from its left shank, where one of the orcs had slashed its scimitar at it during the brief struggle. A green-grey substance could be faintly seen mixed with the blood.Poison... <br>
 Ieglios arose  from his hiding place and rushed to the aid of the fallen creature. He prayed to Tunare for the blessings that would remove the taint from the noble creatures blood. Soon a soft warm gloow came from his hands as he gently caressed the Unicorn's mane. <br>
 Soon the unicorns eye focused upon the young elf cleric.<br>
 &quot;Thank you Ieglios, son of Gelglion, and noble servant of Tunare. I am very grateful for your prayers. The mother wishes you to perform one more task for her before you leave.You see these orcs are not the root of what is going on here in Faydark. Many things are hidden under the shroud of Darkness and our lady needs noble folk such as you to take up the cause and take th battle to them. The road before you is long and will take you to far off lands. Are you up to the task?&quot;<br>
 &quot;I ...am honored ..great one&quot; he stammered. &quot;I will do as Tunare bids, what shall she have of me?&quot;<br>
 &quot; You  are to gather the elves who would fight against the evil coming. Only elves may join you, as the other races may have been tainted by the Darkness. Only the chosen of Tunare and those who have at least one parent who is numbered as one can perform this task. You are to gather your strength and serve the good of all, you must seek out the noble dwarves of Velious and ally yourself against the giants who persecute both them and our lady there. Once you have gained their trust and assistance you must go and seek the dragons.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Dragons?&quot; Ieglios gulped. &quot;Uh what would I want to do with a dragon?&quot; <br>
 &quot;They too oppose the giants, they are wise and noble, and will only deal with those they deem worthy and honorable. You must ally with them in order to defeat the coming Darkness...all of Norath depends upon this for if Innoruuk has his way all is lost.&quot; With that the unicorn rose and said &quot;You have the strength and have been touched by Tunare herself, go and build a company the likes of which shall return your people to their rightful lands.&quot;<br>
 The unicorn strode off and soon disappeared in the mists. <br>
 &quot;A company? Hmmm, a Company of the Unicorn. Yes, I think that will do nicely&quot; Ieglios thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=66.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=66.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=66.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=66.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=66.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
