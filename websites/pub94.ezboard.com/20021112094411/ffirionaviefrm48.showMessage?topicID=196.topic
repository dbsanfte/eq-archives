<br>
Greetings – I am Vulrath, a Vah Shir Shaman of the 16th circle and this is the history of my life:<br>
<br>
I was raised as an only cub – this is rather rare as most of my brethren have many litter-mates. My mother Uumielle died in labor shortly after my birth, along with my unborn brothers and sisters. My father Voluriss was a high-level ambassador for the Vah Shir assigned to Shadowhaven and was often away during my early years, so I was partially raised by Spiritist Fehril, one of the High Shamen of Shar Vahl. There was no animosity because of this arrangement – the time I spent with my father was always joyous as well as many fond memories of my Uncle Fehril. I remember my father being there as my paw was pressed into my personal acrylia slate and I became a citizen of the Vah Shir. Through my juvenile years, I was always trying to follow in the paws of my father – studying politics and participating in debates on a wide range of topics. When I reached my 24th season, I was overjoyed to be appointed as a lower-level diplomat to one of the Trade Barons in Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
        As I made my way through Shadeweaver’s Thicket on my first diplomatic trip to Shadowhaven I was attacked and poisoned by a Saurek Darkclaw where none had been seen for some time – only the quick actions of the Shar Vahl guards in fighting off the creature and carrying my weakened body back to Spiritist Fehril saved my life. With the poison coursing through my veins, the light began to dim, but my Uncle Fehril called upon all the help of the spirits to purge the poison from my body. Due to the extent of my physical wounds, I drifted in and out of a coma for weeks. When I awoke, I was informed of the death of my father in a foiled assassination attempt on one of the Shadowhaven rulers on the same day I was attacked.<br>
<br>
I felt that things couldn’t have gotten worse when I started hearing voices. At first I thought nothing of it – it could have been the effect of the poison. But soon, the voices came more often and louder. Afraid of loosing my mind, I finally went to my uncle with this news. To my surprise he was overjoyed, and explained to me that I was hearing the voices of my spirit ancestors, a rare and greatly admired gift among my people. He explained how he saved me from the poison, and that the great spiritual forces involved in purging the poison from my body had opened my mind to these and other gifts, which he promised to teach me. Honestly, I was very saddened by this newfound ability. My whole life, all I wanted to do was follow in my father’s paws. I was getting ready to find a pretty feline and settle down with cubs of my own, but these events had changed my life beyond repair.<br>
<br>
        To counteract my sadness and grief, I dedicated myself to learning about my newfound abilities from my Uncle and the other Vah Shir shamen. They taught me how to listen to the spirits for guidance and even channel their incredible powers to aid me. With these new powers came the knowledge and guidance of not only my ancestors, but my own past lives, which had even spanned to new worlds and different races of beings. I completed my Dar Khura training in just 2 seasons, but the feelings of loss, sadness and longing for resolution soon returned. I began to feel the need to find something. I wasn’t sure what I was looking for but I could feel a desire to leave my city and family and venture out into the world to find whatever it was. On my 27th naming day, the Elder Spiritist Grawleh approached me, put his paws on my shoulders and told me that the only way to resolve the conflict within me was to follow the will of the spirits and leave Shar Vahl until I found what my soul required. With a heavy heart I said goodbye to my people and set out for Shadowhaven.<br>
<br>
        This is where I am today. I feel the need to find something, but I’m not sure what it is exactly. Worse than this, from my first few days in Shadowhaven, I am beginning to suspect that my father’s murder was no accident. The Trade Baron I was originally assigned to will not see me and noone seems to know where the ruler my father served has gone, but he hasn’t been seen since shortly after my father’s death. My father doesn’t speak to me through the spirits as my other ancestors do, so I feel his soul isn’t at peace as I continue to look for answers.<br>
<br>
These are my goals: to find the answers to the peculiarities surrounding my father’s death and my attack, to venture into the world and not only discover what my soul is looking for but to find it and gain peace, and to use my knowledge of the spirit world to help other adventurers who I travel with.<br>
My years of diplomatic training have fostered a great tolerance of different races and peoples within me. Although I don’t serve a deity as many other races do (I don’t understand this concept – why not listen to the voices of the spirits instead of one single voice?), I believe in the forces of good and will aid in the crusade against the many evil creatures that infect our land.<br>

<br>
&lt;What business does he have here?,&gt; she cautiously pondered.<br>
<br>
Rhatha made his way across the room, seemingly not noticing her; but the predator inside of her told her differently.<br>
<br>
A hand casually fell to the Half Elf’s side and the close proximity of her belted whip as she watched the Vah stop to exchange words with another. Keen elven ears easily listened to the conversation, the talk of spirits stirring her curiosity even more.<br>
<br>
With a patience honed by years of the hunt, Journai bid her time - feigning indifference while all the while waiting for her chance to approach. <br>
<br>
&lt;There, he is leaving, &gt; the Ranger thought with no little relief.<br>
<br>
The coast clear, the black clad Ranger dismounted from her perched vantage point – risking the claustrophobia that always threatened to overwhelm her when indoors.<br>
<br>
“Brother Vulrath?,” she asked in a pleasant tone of voice; her manner clearly more relaxed now that Rhatha was gone.<br>
<br>
The Vah that had been speaking with the Animist but moments before, turned his attention to the pretty Half Elf Maiden.<br>
<br>
“I am Journai Fa’Wander. Daughter of the One Mother. Sister to All. Ranger of Tunare... It is always an honor to meet a member of your noble race. I owe your peoples so much...”<br>
<br>
Journai’s eyes lit up with a warmth that betrayed the sincerity of her words.<br>
<br>
“I could not help but overhear you speaking with Brother Rhatha.”<br>
<br>
Utteringthe Vah’s name gave the woman moment to pause, her gaze quickly scanning the shop as if the mere mention of him could somehow summon his presence.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps I could help you on your journey.”<br>

<br>
My friends, it has been many moons since I have last spoken with you and much has happened in my life. I feel it is best to start where I left off…<br>
<br>
After arriving in Shadowhaven, I spent the next months wandering the streets without purpose. I didn’t know what to do or what my soul required for me to be at peace so I continued to wander Shadowhaven and the Bazaar searching yet not knowing what I was searching for. At the end of 2 months, things were looking bad. My meager funds were running out, and without my studies to concentrate on, the depression from my fathers murder had returned.<br>
<br>
But one night changed everything for me. That night, I was visited by the great Ratha Sha’Naya, a Khati Sha and hero of my people. I was so ashamed of the path that my life had taken that I was unable to meet his steady gaze. Yet he spoke to me as a brother! He offered his help and made me feel that I was not alone in my situation. As he left, I heard a soft rustle at my window and turned with surprise to behold a beautiful maiden of a race I had never before seen. She introduced herself as Journai Fa’Wander – a Half Elf Ranger in the service of Tunare, and friend to all Vah Shir. As we talked, my surprise at meeting my first half-elf diminished and I could tell that this person was warm and genuinely concerned with the events of my life. On taking her leave of me, she also added her offer of assistance to those of the great Ratha. For the first time in many months I felt true friendship and compassion from these two great adventurers.<br>
<br>
That night I spent in deep soul-searching. The care shown me by Ratha and Journai made me ashamed of my months of idleness and for the first time made me set my life to a purpose. I decided that I must first find out all of the details of my father’s death and try to put his soul at peace. With this resolve, I set out the next day determined to find Trade Baron Ooblieth whom I had been assigned to as a diplomat before my attack, and speak with him about my father.<br>
<br>
This proved harder than I imagined. For days I searched the city and could find no trace of Ooblieth. Finally, stopping in The Lost Turnip Inn, my searches paid off. After a little conversation a few pints of ale and a couple gold pieces, the innkeeper revealed to me that around the time of my father’s death, Ooblieth had suffered some type of financial misfortune and was removed from his office by the High Council. Since then he had been seen consorting with many of the criminal inhabitants of the city. He told me that he had been seen working with a band of dwarvish pickpockets that frequented the bank area in the southern area of the city at night, hoping to catch unwary travelers off-guard. I thanked the innkeeper, paid my tab, and set out to find Ooblieth.<br>
<br>
I waited until dusk and crept silently towards the bank. My Vah Shir night vision and reflexes helped me move silently and swiftly towards my target and I concealed myself in the shadows of a neighboring building overlooking the bank. After a few minutes, I spotted the band of dwarvish pickpockets casually hidden among the crates and barrels of a neighboring bakery. Among them was a human who didn’t fit the image of a pickpocket. His clothes might have been considered fine once, but now they hung loosely off of him and were worn and stained with food and mud. The man was slightly overweight, yet his skin seemed to hang from him as if he had once been enormous, but had lost a great deal of weight lately. At first glance, Ooblieth looked like a typical lazy merchant, but his eyes gave him away. They were the cold, hard, calculating eyes of a criminal and they scanned the streets with an intensity that betrayed his appearance<br>
<br>
I waited patiently until morning when the pickpockets split up. I slipped out of the shadows and began to follow Ooblieth through the maze of alleys behind the stores of Shadowhaven, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal myself. At last, we passed into a deep alley where the light and sounds of the streets hardly penetrated. The musty smell of dirt and decay and the steady drip of water made this alley feel like an animal’s lair. Ooblieth was heading towards the far end where a pile of boxes and a stretched canvas tarp made a crude shelter but I sprang into action. I called upon the powers of the spirits to reach out from the netherworld and root Ooblieth in place. As the cold, spirit hands closed upon his legs, he screamed in fright and began to struggle for freedom. At that moment, I stepped out from the shadows and approached him. “You! But, but…you’re dead!”, Ooblieth gasped and struggled harder.<br>
<br>
Unbidden, a growl came from my throat and I flexed my claws and spoke with menace, “As you can see, I am far from dead. Tell me what you know of my attack and my father’s murder or the spirits of my people will make you wish for a quick death that I will not grant you”. Overcome with fear, Ooblieth slumped in the grip of the spirits and the light seemed to go out of his eyes. He then began to relate to me a story that filled me with a mixture of fear and rage.<br>
<br>
“As you know, I was once a Trade Barron in this city”, Ooblieth began. “No pleasures were denied me and everything was possible for a price. Power, money, women even the souls of Vah such as yourself. Despite this, there were still those more powerful than me. I was required to report to a member of the High Council, Agearoth and it was he that held the ability to revoke my trade license if he chose.” Ooblieth continued, “Upon first meeting Agearoth I could smell the scent of corruption about him. You see, those of us with the taint, can sense our own kind and are drawn to it. I tried bribery at first, but he saw through that and spoke plainly to me, ‘You may trade without reserve or fear of punishment, Ooblieth, and I don’t require your petty bribes. But one day I will need you to take care of a “problem” for me and you will do it or you will find yourself without more than just your trade license.’ When he said this, his eyes never changed – they remained cold and hard. I knew right away that no amount of money or influence would work on this man and my only choice was to agree to his proposal.” “About a year ago he again called me to his chambers and commanded me to perform a service for him. He explained that there was a young Vah Shir coming to Shadowhaven to be a liaison between me and Shar Vahl. As he said this, his eyes bored into me and held me in their grip, and as he continued, my blood ran cold. He told me that if you ever reached Shadowhaven, I would not survive the night. And so I arranged a little ‘accident’ for you.” “ We knew you would be coming through Shadeweaver’s Thicket, so we released a Saurek Darkclaw where we knew you would pass. Unfortunately I was required to bring Agearoth your head to prove your death, but when the Saurek didn’t return we assumed it had run off into the thicket to eat your corpse. No matter how many times I assured Agearoth you had been killed, without proof, he was enraged. He stripped me of my title, licence and property and sent me into the streets with the warning that if he ever saw me again, I would not survive.” “Shortly after this, I heard that there was an assassination attempt on Agearoth and he disappeared. I was too terrified to show my face around the Council Chambers to make sure but the rumors in the street say that he is now in hiding. So I have been on the streets ever since – eating from refuse piles, sleeping in the dirt and trying to steal a few silver to sleep in an inn again or have a warm meal.”<br>
<br>
His story complete, Ooblieth sagged in the grip of the spirits like a rag doll. “Go ahead and kill me Vulrath”, he said. “I would rather be dead than live like a rat in a pile of filth for the rest of my life.” Shaking with rage, I raised my hand and began to chant to the spirits. Ooblieth closed his eyes expecting the final blast of spiritual energy that would rend his body, but when I dropped my hand, the spiritual force holding him disappeared and he dropped to the ground in a heap. “I refuse to become what you are, Ooblieth.”, I said. “Your life now is punishment enough for the pain you have caused and your story has given me the information I need.” And without another word I turned away from the filth, back towards the streets of Shadowhaven to ponder my next move.<br>
