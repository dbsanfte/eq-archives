I've recently been bitten by TLC (Symbol of Tunare quests... didn't start early enough) but I figure I can come up with a workaround. I'm not ready to trash it.<br>
<br>
I absolutely disagree with bugs that allow guilding and grouping of opposing alignments - this really gets into &quot;Why not just play on a normal server?&quot; territory, and goes against the spirit of the server, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
So far the language restrictions have caused me the most headache... Perhaps making it a little easier to learn languages would be cool.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I'm really happy with the ruleset.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=castinareleas>CastinarEleas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 12:13:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Change?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2.

I think he was talking about learning by putting points into it at the guild (once you've started learning a language).

<br>
I agree with your idea of the grouping as well --- it opens some RP possibilities that will completely be restricted otherwise.  <br>
<br>
For myself, I'm content working around the buff/heal problems (make the grouping a bit more difficult, but more worthwhile when it is successful, IMO <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

Put it back if server ever gets crowded enough that farmers are a problem. At a minimum, all quest items and all trade-skill items must be obtainable at any level.<br>
<br>
Alignment -- let anyone group with anyone if neutral invites; ie. bless the bug (if it is a bug). Same with guilding. It is just plain pointless to have good&amp;evil if they can't interact directly. That's the fun of it. Good/good and evil/evil is boring. Keep the buffing restrictions.<br>
<br>
Alignment change -- not with a /command. Force people that want to change to go into a city of predominately that alignment and talk to an NPC there to obtain a change; ie. you have to really live the alignment to change it. If you want to put the work in, you should be able to become just about any alignment you want.<br>
<br>
Remove the forced /roleplay. It's a nice thought, but it makes it terribly hard to build groups; eg. need to find a cleric, which clerics are on now? You can only ask the ones that spring to mind by name. Grouping should be promoted in all ways and this inhibits grouping. If you don't see the problem now, you will see it when you reach 40+ and by 50+, it will be a severe hardship.<br>
<br>
Languages -- I like the changes a lot, but I'd have capped them at 10*level, not 5*(level+1). Level 10 or so is when people start doing a lot of traveling and meeting new people. The language issue is a nice touch, but it's a bit too much of a barrier as is. Socializing is good and should be promoted.<br>
<br>
Languages part II -- NPCs should only speak their native tongue, not &quot;universal&quot;. This provides another incentive to learn languages other than &quot;I can't talk to anyone&quot;. Same thing for quest notes and other written materiels. Native tongue (this one should go into all servers, not just FV).<br>
<br>
Languages, the revenge -- NPC vendors should only work as they do now if you have mastered the language.  If you haven't, they should increase sale prices and decrease buy prices.  This would be another incentive other than a need to communicate with other PCs (pc-to-pc talk really should be a pretty basic ability).<br>
<br>
Auction -- I'm of two minds here. With the huge down-times associated with solo'ing, /auc in every zone gives you something to do and also gives a much better chance of finding the merchant or buyer you need. 'Course, if you can setup a group, you won't have time for this nonsense. Maybe if this board was more popular, the trade sections here will eventually cover it (or if /vendorme goes live).<br>
<br>
High-elf guards -- make some low-level pinkies for the darks to hunt in Faydwer. The dark races should be encouraged to attack and kill good race NPCs in just about every good NPC city or outpost. After all, they're evil. They should not only be able to go out and be evil, they should be rewarded in game for it. Good race folk should have extremely severe penalties for attacking other good race NPCs.<br>
<br>
Evil quests -- slaving!  Evils should have a way to take prisoners back and sell them.  The game badly needs some good/evil interaction where each side is encouraged to do things appropriate for their alignment.<br>
<br>
Good quests -- slaving part II.  Goods should have a way to rescue slaves (both combat/raid and stealth style).  PC slaves might be going a bit too far, but NPC would be quite fun for both sides. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ustormtower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormtower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Travelling Circus</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 1:44:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here's my take on it:</span><hr size=1> I like Bjond's ideas on languages.

<br>
<br>
Re:  Good vs. Evil<br>
<br>
Yeah ... we do need to see some type of storyline developing that is NOT GM-run.  Instead of the day-in and day-out frozen status that it is now, we should see the Commonlands getting overrun by the dark elves now and then ... and then next week, see a small squadron of good guards guarding the area from the commonlands to the bridge when the Freeporters battle back.<br>
<br>
Or, how about: with the opening of the Luclin portals, we'll see an invasion army taking over entire zones starting from the portals.  It would be interesting to see if the Iksar are actually ambitious enough to rush into ShadowHaven and take over Feydwer from two fronts -- the ocean and the portal.<br>

Now many may not aggree with her role-play choices, but it is not their character. I commend her for trying though and think it should be allowed. Now i know that many of you disagree with me but i think slight changes in alignment should be allowed for any race to almost any alignment. <br>
how would we keep the balance? when a person makes a drastic alignment change, like DE to a neutral alignment, they become KOS to their respective race instantaineously and there they stand and must improve from there. if as drastic as evil to good, they become KOS to ALL evil races. The good still hate them also, so very careful work must be done to increase their faction. now i do not think that a Cleric or Druid should be allowed to cross their god for that would destroy their character's ability to perform their abilities being they come from 'their god' as i see it in role-play. If this could be allowed, then converting would be possible and full role-play possibilies would exist. Now what would stop all from doing this kind of change? Making good from KOS is a VERY tedious thing as i see it seems every town is split into 3 or more factions. For example, lets say this DE went to Crushbone to raise faction...killing orcs helps with guards...not the merchants. So i do think it should be possible as long as the class considered does not need to worship a god to function. This probably is only my dream because im sure the coding involved would probably be too much for the benefits given as Verant would see it. I am curious to see all of your opinions on this idea though. &quot;<br>

Dhugal -- yeah, I'd like to see people changing religions and not just their alignment.  Currently, we're stuck in a &quot;your religion and class determines the flexibility of your alignment&quot;.  Real roleplaying would lead to very mutable characters.<br>
<br>
Of course, we'll have to take consequences of changes in religion.  Going from Mithaniel Marr to Erollisi Marr should not have too many repurcussions ... but Innothule to Erollisi?  Ouch ... Innothule should be hunting you down the way Hera (Greek goddess) punished anyone who defied her.<br>
<br>
To support that idea, I'd suggest &quot;missionary&quot; NPCs for various religions (maybe in the Bazaar) where you can undergo a quest.  Finish the quest, and you can change religions.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Another thought along the same lines, but this is probably impossible:  How about &quot;multiclassing&quot;.  A character starts life as a street rat (rogue), using his hide, sneak, and &quot;critical hits from the back side&quot; to survive ... he eventually earns a living as a scout and learns how to survive in the wilderness (ranger) ... a period of war comes along and he is drafted into the army (warrior).<br>

<br>
For instance if it wasn't for the obvious problems with LD, I'd like to see the /invite command only work in cities. Yes, I realize this is shocking and nasty, with many problems. But I like the thought of forcing people to meet in cities and form groups. An exception could be that guildmates can be invited to your group in any zone.<br>
<br>
Basically any further restrictions that forced people to socialize and come together would be fun for me.<br>
<br>
But I realize people HATE restrictions. They are already crying about all the ones that are in place and the low server population.<br>
<br>
SO, how about more incentives (sort of like the Sullon Zek XP Bonus):<br>
<br>
- Higher group XP bonuses (to encourage social behavior)<br>
- XP bonuses when all members of a group are same race or maybe same religion (to encourage unity of purpose for roleplaying).<br>
- General XP bonuses to those of evil or good alignments, so that people will take a stand! (Seems like many people are going Neutral for grouping reasons and I hate to see Good/Evil discouraged for game mechanics reasons on an RP server. Of course I'd hate seeing Good and Evil in the same group/guild even more!)<br>
- XP bonus if guilded (again, encourage social behavior)<br>
<br>
Anyway, feel free to think of more &quot;incentives&quot; and I'll probably support them to increase the server population. However, I will not support ANY easing of current &quot;restrictions&quot; on FV.<br>

Human warrior goes out and learns tell around level 14, then becomes a mage and learns tell past 14.

Heck if he felt like it he could gather the stuff and smith his own magicaly enhanced weapons.

Oh and if your group is of to many opposing alighnments you can get an EXP penalty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/01 1:18:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'd do it backwards of that Grim ..</span><hr size=1>  .. penalty for same alignment, penalty for same guild, penalty for same race.

I absolutely want to group with both evil and good and do it often.  It makes for some fantastic RP'ing and people work out why they're stuck helping each other.  All the restrictions are far too narrow-minded and parochial.  They stifle player creativity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrimwyrd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimwyrd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/01 2:25:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'd do it backwards of that Grim ..</span><hr size=1> Hehe, I'm not sure I get your arguments Bjond.<br>
<br>
One thing is sure: people don't want, and will not stand for, penalties.<br>
<br>
And if you think a group of six people of the same race and/or religion equals a boring pack of clones nodding in harmony, which will only interact by agreeing with people... then you've met some pretty bland people.<br>
<br>
The only reason I mentioned people of similar race and/or deity grouping together, is because that was one of the stated ideas Verant had for this server. That's why there is no common tongue.<br>
<br>
Verant wanted people to meet and form sub-communites based on the race of their home town to give the server a more interesting flavor. They wanted to see young trolls grouping with other young trolls and getting to know each other to give the community a more diverse flavor. I agree that diversity is the key fun roleplay, but you have to develop your own racial identity before you can be diverse from/to anyone else. The other blue servers are so cookie-cutter and lacking in roleplay that they only difference race makes is &quot;what your toon looks like dewd&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you wanted a server full of diversity where dark elven shadow knights grouped with high elven paladins and if you think all the FV restrictions are far too narrow-minded and parochial...then I gotta ask...&quot;Why are you playing on this server at all when you don't like the ruleset?&quot; If you're just looking for low population, then there's always Antonius Bayle.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point is this: I liked the rule set and moved here because of it. I like all the restrictions and my creativity has not been stifled.<br>
<br>
Now I see many people posting that they don't like the rule set and want to yell at Verant for changes. If you want to go back to the way other blue servers are handled, then move back to one of the twenty-some servers that have the normal rule set and leave this one alone.<br>
<br>
If Verant feels they need to get the server population up, let them come up with incentives for people to come here. But don't repeal all the rules that the majority of us came here for.<br>
