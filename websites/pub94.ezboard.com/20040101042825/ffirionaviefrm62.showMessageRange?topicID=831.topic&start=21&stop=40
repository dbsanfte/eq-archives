<br>
Not every gay couple wants children, nor does every gay couple even want to get married.  But neither does every straight couple.<br>
<br>
Even if only 1 gay couple wanted to marry and have children, and none other did, my sense of equality is that they should have that option just like everyone else.<br>

Also I am not advocating single parent adoption either. I would not trust a large percentage of single males to raise a daughter not of their bloodline. I will concede that I have less of a problem if any at all of a lesbian couple raising a child, but there have been many studies showing that young boys need a positive male influence in their upbringing.<br>

Couldn't it also be that Disney's tolerance and progressive stance towards gay people is what attracts gay men, and not the children?<br>
<br>
I know that when I job search, one of the first things I look for is how gay people are treated there.  I guess that since  you are presumably heterosexual, this is a concern you never have to think about.<br>

Its about kids, at least when we talk about adoption.<br>
<br>
We need to do whats best for them.  <br>
<br>
I am going to make some points....its going to take some time so forgive the long post.<br>
<br>
The Current foster system is fooked.  My Dad was a foster kid up to 11 years old.  He had a few good places but mostly bad.  He never said he was sexually molested but he was sure as hell abused.  He has told me stories of his past that would make most grown men cry.  I see how some of his personality quirks came to be and I can accept him better now that i know his past.<br>
<br>
My sister got a degree in social work.  She interned with the state...placing foster kids.  She threw stats at me about numbers of sexually abused kids... numbers of those kids that abuse other kids... etc etc.  Its pretty high.<br>
<br>
Now throw in the number of people out there who abuse kids.  Throw in the number that sexually abuse kids.<br>
<br>
Throw in that though I believe some people are born gay ....but also some are a product of their environment...ie sexually abused as children...suffer psychological scars.... etc etc.  Add in that those that were offended against....have a high percentage of offending others.<br>
<br>
Throw in that many of these kids in the foster system have no idea of stability.... sense of family.... sense of right and wrong.  They are already behind the 8 ball in so many aspects psychologially and socially.<br>
<br>
What does this leave you?  A fricking mess for sure.  So...whats most important?  The Kids.  Not only the kids needing placement....but the kids that are already in homes where you are thinking of placing these kids.  Its about kids.  Not about gay people feeling more whole by being parents or whatever.<br>
<br>
Would some Gay couple make great foster parents?  Hell yes.  Are some heterosexuall couples lousy parents....let alone horrific foster parents....hell yes...just watch the news.<br>
<br>
But... how do we decide who gets kids?  How do we evaluate people to make those decisions?  What are the parameters?  What are the likely factors that &quot;may&quot; affect a child placed in one place vs another.  <br>
<br>
Take all of those into consideration and start wiping out blanket approvals of foster care and maybe kids will end up in the right places.<br>
<br>
Do I think Gay couples should be allowed to be foster parents or adopt children?  Not until there is a method of evaluating them to make sure it is a safe environment....but I would hold every heterosexual couple to the same standards.<br>
<br>
If they meet the requirements...then I would bet they are just as capable of being great parents as anyone else.<br>
<br>
The key is going to be what are the standards.  Religion?  Sexual exposure (ie does the couple gay friend bob and his mate flash sex toys and talk about explicit acts in front of the kid?)  Do Gay couples have a tendency to have permiscuous(sp) relationships....does this crush the stability?  Stats wise do they only stay together for short periods of time?  <br>
<br>
There is so much to consider....just saying Gay people deserve it....well isnt going to fly....because this isnt about Gay people....its about kids....and what is best for them.<br>
<br>
Just My opinion.<br>

Adoption is for the benefit of BOTH parent and child.<br>
<br>
Certainly, if you asked someone who wanted to adopt why they wanted to adopt, one of their reasons might be to give a good home to a child who otherwise might be neglected.  But just as likely is the reasoning that they actually want a child because it provides some emotional benefit for them.  <br>
<br>
For example, a number of studies indicate that african american children are less likely to be adopted than white children.  This offers some evidence that potential adoptive parents are not purely concerned about the welfare of children as children. If this was the case, racial preferences would not exist.<br>
<br>
A counter to this would be that some people might think that african american children would be harmed if they had white parents.  But the reality of this logic is that african american children will not be adopted at all.  This is hardly in the best interest of the child.<br>
<br>
Adoption agencies already investigate potential adoptive parents before entrusting them with a child.  This process can be used to screen gay parents as well.  Using stereotypes of gay couples in an effort to hold them to a more stringent adoption process, thus treating similarly situated individuals differently, violates Equal Protection.<br>
<br>
Of course that our Supreme Court is hostile to hearing dometic issues (Ie, domestic violence, marriage, and adoption) means that it is unlikely it would say the same thing any time soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=itchibumbashalots>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hated One</span><br>  Posts: 983<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/4/03 2:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Case Against Same-Sex Marriage...</span><hr size=1> I disagree that it isnt about kids....because that is what is should be about.<br>
<br>
Like I said.  The evaluation process should be equal...but as you include gay couples....it would have to be a whole new evaluation system...one that also met many of the differences that gay couples would have vs non gay.  For example...does Bob dress in drag during the work week?  Is Bob going to be dropping little Billy off at school?  How will this affect Billy's ability to be accepted at school?  Get my point?<br>
<br>
It is different.  On the whole...if each child could be placed in a safe heterosexual environment...that would be my choice.  But I also will not ignore the fact that there are many gay couples out there who would make great parents.  My cousin would be a great Dad...I have no doubt...but he leads a permiscuous life....many partners some who are flamboyantly gay....and how would the adopted childs friends react to that?  Would he be able to keep friends?  Would he be ostrosized(sp) at school?<br>
<br>
It may be argued that its societies fault for not being more accepting but that is besides the point.  It is about kids.... how placing them one place vs another affects their chance at a stable &quot;normal&quot; (however you want to define that....i expect comment) upbringing that allows them to be happy and successful in life.  A child will have no choice in the matter....should he or she be placed in a situation that they will have to defend for the rest of their childhood?  Is that fair to the child?<br>

She brings home three different men a week.  She drops Billy off at school, and his friends oogle her and make fun of him.<br>
<br>
What's the difference?  The screening process would certainly take care of either case.<br>
<br>
Going back to stereotypes... <br>
...that some (a very very small minority) gay people dress in drag does not mean they would do so when dropping their kid off at school.  A lot of straight men have crossdressing fetishes as well, this doesn't mean they go out in public that way in inappropriate environments.  There need not be a new &quot;Drag&quot; questionaiire in the screening process just because gay people can adopt as well.<br>
<br>
As &quot;for the kids...&quot;<br>
...certainly these are noble sentiments, and I agree that it should be for the kids as well.  But I am not willing to say that the parents have no stake in these matters and that all of their interests are subsumed to the best interest of the child.<br>
<br>
Under your logic, we would require adoption agencies to accede to the discriminatory inclinations of homophobic people in the community.  This was rejected by the Supreme Court in Palmore v. Sidoti, where the court explicitly rejected the &quot;Best interests of the Child&quot; argument put forth by a divorced father who sought to claim custody over his child because his ex-wife married a black man.  The father argued that by allowing the child to remain with his mother, the child would be made fun of because of her black husband.  <br>
<br>
There the court held, &quot;Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=robingoodfellow>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/4/03 2:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/689americanpeacesign.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Case Against Same-Sex Marriage...</span><hr size=1> Itchi:<br>

The picture of lesbian mothers' children that emerges from results of existing research is thus one of general engagement in social life with peers, with fathers, and with mothers' adult friends--both male and female, both heterosexual and homosexual. Studies in this area to date are few, and the data emerging from them are sketchy. On the basis of existing research findings, however, fears about children of lesbians and gay men being sexually abused by adults, ostracized by peers, or isolated in single-sex lesbian or gay communities are unfounded. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=itchibumbashalots>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hated One</span><br>  Posts: 984<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/4/03 3:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Case Against Same-Sex Marriage...</span><hr size=1> Nice article...<br>
<br>
Looks like they need to do a lot more research on gay men.<br>
<br>
The question i have....and i had a hard time peeling it out of that article...was were they only looking at gay parents who already had kids?  or at gay parents who adopted kids?<br>
<br>
There is going to be a whole gambit of difference if its an adopted kid vs your own kid....ie 2 weeks ago the Foster parents who fed their own kids and let the foster kids rot.<br>
<br>

<br>
The situation with regards to adoption vs. divorced is somewhat complicated, actually.  Some adoptive parents, especially in lesbian and gay couples, are the partners of the kids' biological parents.<br>
<br>
However, since most states did not allow gay or lesbian adoptions until recently, and many still do not, I'd presume that most of the households studied were gay and lesbian parents who already had kids.<br>
<br>
This winds up leading to the second point.  Most courts presume the mother's going to be the better parent, so more women wind up with the kids after a divorce than men.  Sometimes, courts will recognize the claim that homosexuality is grounds for declaring one of the two parents unfit.  This compounds the legal problems for a gay father gaining custody of his kids.  It's not surprising that if the sample of parents are primarily the gay and lesbian biological parents, then most of those households are lesbian, given the judicial system's tendency to give mothers custody. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3873<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/4/03 5:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Case Against Same-Sex Marriage...</span><hr size=1> I'm a heterosexual male.

I don't mean that they harass you about it, it's the opposite.  I get so many comments from friends and neighbours about how refreshing it is that I'm affectionate w/ my son, or how great it is that I take him out for a stroller ride, and whatever, that it makes me feel like I'm an abnormality and doing something wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I do not believe that men are patently less nurturing than women are.  I think society does a damned good job of trying to convince people of that though, even when it's not intending to.  <br>

As far as Disney goes. Disney is a very good company to work for. There's no company in the world that is perfect to work for, but they go out of their way to make ALL their workers feel comfortable with the wages and benefits they provide. For the most part, I think Disney is a very good example setter for the rest of the corporate world to follow. <br>

As far as gay parenting goes...why don't you ask the kid who he/she would rather stay with? A parent that physically or sexually abuses them, or a gay person? If I was a kid, I would opt to stay with the gay person that's not beating my ass in. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kurley>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1285<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/27/03 11:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ItchibumBashalots is wrong.</span><hr size=1> As far a same sex parenting/adoption goes:  lesbians will pave the way.<br>
<br>
No facetiousness intended.  Whether its some sort of preprogrammed biological/neurological function or a product of what the media has ingrained in the average citizen, society is currently more open to the notion of two women kissing and living in a sexual union than two men - although that is slowly changing.<br>
<br>
Countless teen movies, directly or indirectly, incorporate the notion that two women mingly is sexy, while the majority of mainstream movies (such as the &quot;Rules of Attraction&quot;, which I just recently saw), typically portray that at least one of the men involved in a homoerotic encounter are &quot;confused&quot; or &quot;misguided&quot;.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately both common depictions of homoeroticism/homosexuality are one-dimensional (sorry guys, not ever lesbian duo is just waiting for a man to jump in there and show them a good time, nor is every instance of male-male attraction fraught with one male being straight whilst the other male is sure that he can convert him).  The fact is, however, that the notion of lesbians finds &quot;wider&quot; acceptance.<br>
<br>
And therein lies the pathway to acceptance.<br>
<br>
My sister-in-law, who is younger and arguably &quot;hipper&quot; than my wife and myself, is what I would consider a fairly staunch Catholic.  Her husband comes from a long line of hardcore Irish Catholics.  They live in a very pleasant coastal community along the British Columbia coast and have two sons, ages 2 and 4.<br>
<br>
Some time ago, my sister-in-law began chatting to us about the mid-twenties single mother (boy aged 3) who moved in across the street.  My sister and brother in-law got along very well with this woman and their children played together regularly.  Then one day, a few month later, a friend of the single mother moved in.  Long story short, eventually everyone in the neighborhood came to realize that this was a lesbian couple, who recently got married by the way, raising a child.<br>
<br>
While the ins and outs of the whole issue would take a post longer than anyone wants to read, the upshot is that despite my sister and brother-in-law's hardcore Catholic beliefs, everyone gets along just grand.  Now, how much of this can be attributed to the fact that the couple are lesbians, or to the fact that their household is stable and their child is &quot;well adjusted&quot;, I'd wager it is a bit of the former but primarily due to the latter, which is what truly matters in the end.  <br>
<br>
However despite the apparent social success of this case, of which I have been imparted a large amount of first hand knowledge, I've wondered:  if it were two men, and not two women, would the outcome have been as amiable?  Given some time, hopefully yes.<br>
<br>
If our social programs were properly funded and had enough resources, the approriateness of having a child raised or adopted into any particular household would be measured in depth on a case by case basis - regardless of sexual orientation.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fvellu>fvellu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy</b></span><br>  Posts: 470<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/27/03 12:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ItchibumBashalots is wrong.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No facetiousness intended.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> BOOO hisss BOOOO **jeer** <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showMessageRange?topicID=831.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showPrevMessage?topicID=831.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showNextMessage?topicID=831.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=831.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.threadControl?topicID=831.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=831.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=831.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62>In the Real Life News</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
