I don't want to cause any grief and I don't have an axe to grind.  Few times I ve been group with you seem nice enough.  All I am trying to say is that you have to be flexible and give hunting parties respect.  I am not saying you will not some times wipe out hunting parties when your pull paths wrong or you wont disrupt them for a time.  What I am saying is you need to talk to them and get them to understand what is going on and kind of agree to be inconvenient.<br>
<br>
The part about pulling I just felt I had to make a comment about.  I just though back when we had the silly idea of sieving gore before we puller to the kill spot and 3 chanters are running around in circles with Gore casting mana sieve on her.  What a Joke only reason I like is she is so slow.  My point being here is I think you might be being to defensive in my view you would have been better off saying that you made a mistake and would try to taken in to account other groups.  We have left Ssra temple before (not often) so faf could have a shot a mob with out all the lag that comes from having an extra 30 folks trying to do something in the zone at the same time.  I mean if faf and us can get along in a zone I think you can get along with small hunting parities.  Try not to think of this as a flame but advice that you can take or ignore.  Really have nothing against NC or you in.  Good luck on your raids and good hunting.<br>

Usually 2 or 3 group zone in buff and attack Gore where ever we find her, but we usually check with who ever is in the zone just to see hwere they are.  Most time when we enter a zone to raid we send quick tells asking where groups are so we can coordiante with them and hopefully not get them killed.  Anyway this post is just to say that I ve seen Gore killed at the tunnel also, just not the normal spot when we were first startign out on her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fumin@firionavie>Fumin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/02 10:07:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=143>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kethlar of the Norrathers Call</span><hr size=1> Kethlar in all honesty did you EVER even LOOK at some information about Gore?

Kethlar one of the basic rules of any raid or killing of a major beast in the game is to know something about it.  &quot;We had no choice&quot;, if you had known anything about DL or Gore you would have known you had a MAJOR choice.  To pull or not to pull and wait for LD tank.  To know that Gore moves around and that it isn't the critical moment to attack.  Next time for the sake of others, know something - anything about the beast in question. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhayannonn>RhayannonN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/8/02 11:02:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1934.topic&index=144>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Does anyone read posts in it's entirety?</span><hr size=1> Geez ... how this went WAY out of context<br>
<br>
This was based on a decision, to pull a mob, to a spot where it's been pulled before by many others (admitantly through this thread so don't comment to me on it whether yu feel it's right wrong or indifferent) ... A younger group was XP grinding in the spot that the mob was being pulled to... they were told to stand back for the pull ... they were pissed but were forwarned, and they stood back ... NO-ONE was trained ... noone's camp spot was stolen... no-one from that party was killed ... I can't tell you how many times i've been XP grinding somewhere at all different levels and an entire raid party entered the zone to pull a specific mob and i was asked to stand back .. SO WHAT LOL !! ... ever think it would be fun at such a low level to be able to watch something that in time you'll get to experience too?.. Just last week I was XP grinding myself in UP ... a guild came in ...in mass quantity .. told us to stand back for they were pulling Crushbone, and we did ... we sat back and watched for a good 1/2 hour of this guild in action ... they pulled Crushbone to the zone line instead of going in and getting him .. SO WHAT! ... its how THEY thought it would work best ... who is anyone to judge their choice for their raid group ... i mean come on already ... <br>
<br>
AND for anyone to say &quot;Hey,NC on the NOT TO DO or ASSIST list&quot; is absolutely ridiculous ... an isolated incident does not make or break a guild for chastizing ... power mongrules i tell ya ... and to read all that name calling and then in the same paragraph to hear Kethlar be called immature is sorta sounding a little bit of an oxy moron to me ... potty mouth potty mouth LOL ... but best off is hearing how NC is known for not supporting their own ... all members are supported ... and if you're not worthy of support, you wind up not being a member soon enough<br>
<br>
I think this has gotten enough flamage over something totally not so big ...

<br>
But before commenting, make sure you read what happened.  We were not notified and when we were, it was already pulled.  At that time, we were not notified by  the raid leader or any of the NC.  And again, we would have gladly moved.  That was only part of my rant.<br>
<br>
But i will say again, we have it resolved.  <br>
<br>
I understand that people are now voicing their opinions on what happened to them on other raids and of course this is fine.  After all, its a rant board.<br>

They weren't forwarned. Both sides has owned up to that.<br>
<br>
When you try to downlplay it you suddenly state that they were forwarned, and that they at the time felt it wasn't much of a deal. <br>

i shall not do to onto you, how u just did onto me ... i am better than that ... we speak in-game nearly everyday, and hunt together quite a few times a week ... there was absolutely NO need for you to post what u posted regarding my character...<br>

Opir, you are truly one napoleon issued ass.  Nice way to show friendship to someone you claim you like alot.  You are no-ones friend Opir.  A sturdy dwarf you call yourself.  I'd say it's more like a dumb clueless opinionated midget.  <br>
<br>
I read this thread, numerous times, and although, it seems that the group was not &quot;for&quot;warned, they were warned as soon as she sent a  tell to NC's raid leader.  Where did Rhayannon lie?  Where did she come in late?  Her post was the very next day of the start of thread.  If I can recall, she even said so.<br>
<br>
Opir, stick to the basics and facts and stop trying to read between the lines.  Dwarfs like you are too small to read between the lines and you just F**k yourself up when you try.  You are an opinion self righteous dreamer.  You know not anything other than adding flamage to a dead issue.  How many times did both parties claim the issue was resolved, but I see your assanign 1/2 cents spewed on and on.  <br>
<br>
No-one cares what you have to say Opir.  You are a dumb, useless bivvy of nonesense.  You must still live at home with your mum and get to come out of your room for meals or something cause noone with 1/2 of a life would continue on and on like you have.  Get out of denial and realize noone likes you or what you have to say.<br>

It was a fervent flame, if a little low on details still high on the emotional scale. Perhaps a bit low on spelling, grammar and rhethorics, but on the other hand it was a pure ad hominem, and self-admitted to.<br>

=================================<br>
<br>
I really just came to say the above but reading some of the posts and coming on what Saurix (Khallim) said, I just have to say something.<br>
<br>
<br>
WTF?  Uh that incident you described Saurix happened what 4 or 5 months ago.  Kinda shows me what kind of personality you are if your dragging something that happened from waaaaay back when.  I was what pretty young back then...season wize and that was my second and LAST Nagafen raid ever.  I've never spoken, grouped or said anything negative about you since then...and then from out of &amp;&amp;*^ing nowhere...?  I know in your deep twisted mind Saurix you got this deep infatuation with me or something to remember me for this 1 incident that happened so long ago and then drag it up again.  *L*  <br>
<br>
I have to say I feel sorta sorry for you.<br>
<br>
oh well,<br>

Nice to know your self-centered attitude hasn't changed. You calling anyone else immature or whiny or whatever else in this thread is utterly laughable.<br>

Why are you continuing on with this thread and flaming me yet again when we (with BOTH our guild leaders) came upon a settlement and we BOTH agree to leave the issue?  <br>
<br>
Uh doesn't this prove that you are a &quot;snotty&quot; brat?  Obviously you just can't let it go.<br>
<br>
This matter between Saurix and myself is a matter HE drudged up not I.  I am responding to accusations/statements he made against me WITHOUT provocation...get it?<br>
<br>
Ariane please drop the matter as we agreed to do or else prove yourself as everything I described you to be as before.<br>
