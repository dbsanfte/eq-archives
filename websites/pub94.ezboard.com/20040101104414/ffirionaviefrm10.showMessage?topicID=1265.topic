Her good arm comes up shakily as her right hand wipes away a crusty and sticky substance from her eyes...The blackened ichor from so many nights ago. As eyes slowly open to the darkness, she can feel a heated, yet cool substance pour freely from her eyes...A plague has overcome them...Darkness is all she sees, no light, although she can feel the heat and warmth of something in the distance.<br>
<br>
Trembling, she sits up, feeling the droplets from her eyes dripping down her neck, over her collarbone and down beneath her mail. She smells at the air...It is riddled with the purest and darkest of plagues she has ever smelled or tasted. Her body shivers in sickly delight, before wiping at her eyes again.<br>
<br>
Standing now, her body trembling, she can feel her own flesh crawling as plagues mingle and course through her body. As she walks, both her good arm and infested one outstretched, she stumbles about, going to the source of the stench. The place is familiar to her in an odd way and somehow, as if having walked these paths before, she moves onward. Her hands pass by objects that nearly explode, puss oozing from them at even the greatest of brushes. She can smell death everywhere within the maddening plague. Sounds of a distant pulsating rings through her mind with every step, as if the very heavens are being hammered down...She can hear the oozing of something...But cannot place it. Bubbling comes from the waters beneath stones, her feet dragging along.<br>
<br>
Continuing onward, she begins to hear more and more creatures about her, but none attack...It sounded almost as though they backed away faster then they had approached...Curious and then frightened by the out-of-place Half Elf. In the back of her mind, she barely hears the sounds of fighting near her...<br>
<br>
Stone...her chain enwrapped feet continue to hit stone, just as her hands touch to a wall cold as death, yet she moves, finding her feet hit stairs she continues upon them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again...The hissing...She hears it well, but is not afraid. Her left arm shakes madly as she brings it up to wipe, yet again, at eyes she cannot see with.<br>
<br>
Pounding..As she reaches the end of so many stairs and corridors, she hears it once more. Here, the stench of the plague worsens and she breaths in deeply...The blackened veins offshooting further over her body. Behind her a trail is upon the ground of poxed blood and puss...Having leaked from her left arm where two fingers are missing.<br>
<br>
She feels the air about her shift too late and before she can dodge a possible oncoming blow, a large, massive and hot hand comes down upon her good arm, taking hold of it...Gently.<br>
<br>
Turning towards the thing that grabbed at her, she goes to demand what it thinks it is doing. her mouth opens, but no sounds come forth, save for teeth upon teeth and the sounding of the poxed blood being swished about as her tongue tries to work out words.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Do not try. It is a wasted effort.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*The creature speaks to her, in a voice she does not recognize. Still holding her arm, it lifts her up and by it roughly, and next thing Katomi knows, she is flung up, only to land on the creature's supposed shoulder which is covered in plates, sitting upright, her body nearly pinned between them. It's arm then slides down to take hold of her hand, leading it to something around it's own neck. A high-plated collar? She does not know, but she takes the hint immediately.<br>
<br>
Just as she takes hold, pounding begins again...The creature moves. As it does so, she can feel the gentle touch of a cloth hung above the creature's head wafting to and fro'. As it moves, she can hear more battles around it...Something has deemed that the creature that carries her must not fall...And fighting ensues.<br>
<br>
Katomi kept her grip sturdy, while her plagued arm continued to shake. She did not fear death, finding it was only a testing by HIM. Death teaches you what you did wrong and only those worthy enough to try again...or those who are simply overlooked...are granted life anew. A bit lesser when last they roamed, but alive once more. As her arm moves about she brings it to her mouth, sucking on the bloody puss that comes forth. She lets a silent sigh escape from her cracked and bloody lips, she <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">knows</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> this place, yet she does not know how. The being she rides upon lifts it's head slightly to the sounding of the sigh, it's booming slurred speach hitting the foul air.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;HE wishes to see you now. I can take you no further.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*He leans over and Katomi finds herself sliding off of the creature's shoulder, her entire body trembling once more as the plauges move through her quicker as the stronger stench assaults her nostrils.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
~HE...~ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*She thinks to herself...*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ~No...The creature must have meant another...He MUST have!~<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*She turns around, feeling the ichor continue to pour from her eyes, still no sight granted to them. The creature that carried her is gone, yet she did not hear the pounding of it having departed. In the distance, the ringing of a scythe echos as something is stuck down.<br>
<br>
Awkwardly, she finds her feet moving, approaching the thickest part of the scent of the plague. Her hands still held out, she lets out a sickend gasp as her marred left hand falls into another's marred hand...One much, much larger than her own.<br>
<br>
Her mind reels, thinking back on the words the creature spoke and she stumbles back, falling...Only to find herself beginning to be bound. Tendrils of shadow come from all regions of the grand room and her own shadow, locking down over her body so she is left standing, her left arm still moving about, though contained.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;I imagined you would be returning much, much later little one...&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;I have no need to tell you not to worry, I know you're smarter than that.

No, not in the least.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*The being before her is silent a moment, thinking things unknown to Katomi. Her own mind clears finally and she knows what is now happening...She is in THE VERY BOWELS of the Ruins of Lxanvom! And  she is the audience to a very irritated Plaguebringer! Bertoxxulous!!! HIM! With the shadows still keeping her bound, she cloes her sightless eyes, in the only respect she can manage as seh is prone to the shadow tendrils.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Ahh...Still true to those that lead you. An undying traight, one of many which I undoubtably selected you for.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*A sigh eminates from HIM, as HIS decayed arm reaches out and what remains of HIS own flesh crawls as it touches to Katomi's plagued cheek.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;This was not meant to touch you little one...Not yet. That you survived it is enough proof to me though, that my intentions have not been futile in their attempts.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*As HE speaks to her mind once more, voice booming to nearly painful levels, she opens her eyes again, defying that which binds her. She IS a shadowwalker, she CAN break this! her left arm trembling violently, she brings it up, no surprise found on the face of The Plaguebringer as HE looks down at the display. With something as simple as a passing thought by HIM, the shadow tendrils snap apart and fade to become Katomi's shadow once more, as her plagued hand touches gently to the back of HIS which still rests upon her cheek. No longer is it just the blackened ichor falling from her eyes, but her own tears come freely, mixtures of emotions tumbling down. So much she wants to give thanks for, so many questions...here she stands...With HIM and she has been robbed of the means she would have used to voice such.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;You must go now lttle one...But I cannot allow you to remember. The blood of the one you had taken shall soon be devoured by the plagues I manifested within you, and you shall no longer have permittance to walk here.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
~NO!~ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*Her mind sceams out in the deepest and darkest despair she has ever felt...Here she is, before her very GOD! The one she does everything for...And HE is to cast her out! Before she can try to run, to flee, to try to hide in some pitiful desperate measure, as if hiding from HIM were truly possible, she feels herself being lifted by those hands...By the hands that had once placed the deadliest of plagues within her...Darkness already sets within her eyes, but now her mind fails...<br>
<br>
No scent, no sight, no voice, nothing...Pure void of darkness about her, she is not and she is...<br>
<br>
Shadows open up within the City of the Dead...The Necropolis...A sickening sound of things being torn so seldom moved...And her body is flung hard within, and she rolls...coming to a stop...Her body is riddled with a deadlier pox then before...<br>
<br>
She does not move.*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><CENTER><TABLE>
