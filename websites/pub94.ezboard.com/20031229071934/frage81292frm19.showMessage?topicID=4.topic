They are the remnants of three<br>
very old Tier'dal families, lost to antiquity. Worship there is technically of Rallos Zek and Cazic-thule --<br>
the Prince of Hate is not followed -- but actually everyone serves the Lord of Mistmoore, willingly or <br>
unwillingly. We are vessels of blood, breeding stock, an investment in the future. The Lord there is a <br>
connoisseur of blood, not surprisingly, and takes great pains to keep the bloodlines pure. <br>
<br>
I would have grown up to be a servitor in the castle, like my mother and father, and eventually, been <br>
made into an undead, depending on my status. Since a little girl, I have lived with blood and the <br>
knowledge of blood. I learned to water our garden with blood. I love flowers. My mother used to say <br>
&quot;blood makes the flowers grow&quot;, and would smile when I brought home small creatures to let their blood <br>
out upon the roses. We had magical fruits that grew, strawberries that gushed sweetly, hotly as blood <br>
once you bit into them, their enchantment revealed. And blood oranges, and pomegranates. On hot <br>
nights in the summer, the vampires would sweat blood, so infused with it were they in this luscious <br>
environment.<br>
<br>
I hunted, and I grew, and I was trained, to the sword, to etiquette, dancing, etc. as a noble. I was told that I *was* noble, that our families had been originally selected for the purity of their Tier'dal heritage, and <br>
that the Lord Mistmoore had picked the three families himself to sojourn to and build his estate. I was <br>
trained to serve what I was taught were my betters, so that I would be pleasing to the Vampires. When <br>
of appropriate age, I was taught the arts of pains, both inflicting and receiving. I was taught patience <br>
and how to bow my head. I was instructed on the service of another's body, both personal and intimate, <br>
and how to yield my own.<br>
<br>
When not otherwise occupied, I spent my time in the valley, often hiding and watching others come and <br>
go. I learned additional fighting techniques by observing foreigners come and attack our people. Strangers<br>
are not welcome in Mistmoore, nearly always. I yearned within to be allowed to go abroad, but only those <br>
who had already been blood-bonded to a vampire were allowed to leave, except for those very very few <br>
who fled the valley. The last person to successfully leave the enclave had been a great-great-aunt of <br>
mine, and I heard that she had taken service to one named Najena, and dwelt within those halls, a legend, <br>
and untouchable by revenge from here.<br>
<br>
When I was sixteen, however, I was selected. Not for blood ritual, but to be made a vampire directly. <br>
The Lord favored hair the color of mine in women, and I had been noticed. I was outraged. I did not wish <br>
to be denied the long life I could expect, only retiring to become immortal at the end. But there was no <br>
appeal. <br>
<br>
I took the only other choice I had, and fled, following a party of barbarians, with two strange women, <br>
the likes I'd never seen before, out of the hills, through the forest, and into the Faydwer. By hiding and <br>
moving quietly from there, I was able to make my way to Neriak, home of the Tier'dal for some time now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/4/02 3:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter II:  Neriak</span><hr size=1> Ayida stood on the grass, watching people go to and fro between the guards, the red of their livery standing out against the gray stone. She sighed at the gaping hole in the earth which led to her destination, dreading entering the city. Cities felt like masses of people jammed in too close together, and Freeport, the only city she'd actually been through, had been a living nightmare of everything foreign. She sighed again, thinking that while she could at least understand the &quot;words&quot; that people were using here, that the few Tier'dal she'd spoken to already clearly were so culturally different from her that meanings were not quite the same. <br>
<br>
Her accent was odd sounding to them, she could tell. They looked at her with confusion and suspicion, and<br>
her body language was different too. One actually accused her of being an enchantress using another form,<br>
though the short sword swung under his nose abruptly terminated that discussion.<br>
<br>
With trepidation, she walked up through the guards, unchallenged, and into Neriak. <br>
<br>
After a week, her resources were exhausted. No one would hire her, and few would speak to her more than a word or two. The only offers she'd gotten so far had been crude catcalls on the street, and one tavern owner who wanted her for his brothel, telling her that she might be able to earn room and board if she worked hard.<br>
<br>
There were non-Tier'dal wandering around daily, and the folk of her heritage for the most part seemed<br>
degenerate in their purity. Few showed the strength and focus of purity of will. <br>
<br>
Finally, she went to the building of the warriors guild, for the second time, prepared to be sneered at again. A woman in plate armor was in the lower hall, and surprisingly, spoke to her courteously. &quot;You think you can<br>
fight, little daugher?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I do, my lady. I am willing to prove it in the Arena.&quot;<br>
&quot;Very well then, go and be tested. If you bring a note back for me, I will accept you as a trainee.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her test went well, the trainer lent her several weapons, and was impressed by the speed with which she<br>
could sheath and unsheath them, switching in a moment's notice from two-handed to one-handed. Though<br>
defeated easily, her techniques were commented on favorably, and a sealed note was passed to the Lady of the Cauldron, and a new career was embarked upon, albeit one with little supporrt - trainees were expected to fend totally for themselves, but a roof, even in a barracks was preferable to cold stone streets.<br>
<br>
                            **************<br>
<br>
She was sitting on the edge of the water, in a remote corner of the docks, when she noticed that she was<br>
being observed. The lady was beautiful, and obviously well appointed. She seemed a bit distant, and her voice resonated low and as if from far away. &quot;Who are you, little one?&quot;, she was asked. <br>
<br>
Ayida stood up and curtsied. &quot;I am Ayida, noble Lady.&quot; The woman laughed, with complex overtones of<br>
emotion that Ayida didn't quite understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did you call me here?&quot;, she was asked, again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I called no one, Lady.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why am I here? You must have called me. Or something in you did. Tell me of yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayida proceeded to give an account of herself. The woman nodded, then smiled enigmatically. &quot;How would you like patronage?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I would appreciate it, my lady, if I had anything to offer in return.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You do, child. Much to offer. You will do as I say, and train, and learn. You will service me, and be of service to me. Do you understand? Will you obey?&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayida considered this carefully. Just getting enough food was difficult. And she had been getting more<br>
attention than she liked recently from several in the city that made her nervous. This lady felt oddly<br>
different, strange and yet familiar, though she could not identify the source. She decided to gamble a bit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Lady. I will. If you will shelter and protect me. I swear.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear also, child. Learn to be mine, and I will succor you. In token of my oath, accept this armor, and this sword. Now go forth and train. Learn well, learn quick. I may have need of you soon. When you have anything to report, return here, and think of me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayida took a tabard of complex weave, greaves, oddly colored, but attractive, and a long thin black sword,<br>
that only reflected dully even under a bright light. She stripped, and put the armor on, belted the sword to her side, and bowed to her new employer. &quot;I am ready, Mistress.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Then go. I have other things to attend to.&quot; <br>
<br>
The strange woman disappeared in front of her. Ayida stared at the ground in front of her, wondering what<br>
had just happened. And what was her employer's name? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 12:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter III:  Ayanamii Ekitenshi</span><hr size=1> Another week went by, then two. Ayida spent her time learning the forest of Nektulos, and how to slaughter<br>
the creatures within, what her limits were, and how to fight most efficiently when it was for real. She sat and listened in Taverns and Shops, and made a pest of herself at the Bank, sitting in a corner listening until a guard would tell her to leave. <br>
<br>
An Iksar was having trouble one day at the Bank, looking for a few specific stores, and others standing around were mocking him in Tier'dal. Ayida bowed before him, and offered to show him where the stores were. In perfect Tier'dal, the Iksar replied to her, and Ayida smiled inwardly at the sudden silence in the Bank. He then and there handed her a crystalline two-handed blade, publicly, and Ayida refused it, also publicly, to drive the point of the Lesson the Iksar clearly wished to teach home. After she escorted him to a nearby store, the sword was offered again, privately, and this time Ayida took it, with sincere thanks for his extreme generosity.<br>
<br>
Twice in these weeks, Ayida heard the name &quot;Ayanamii&quot; as a person who hated Tier'dal and dueled them, and eventually found out about a group she belonged to, called &quot;Circle of Sisters&quot;. She traveled to Freeport again, this time to work and train in the yard there, and while there, saw several of this group running around, and later saw two Rogues of this group impersonating Tier'dal in Neriak itself. <br>
<br>
Back in Nektulos, she was one day hailed by a Shadowknight named Shintou Shinai. Ayida talked to him for<br>
several minutes, and was intrigued by his obvious enthusiasm, but his talk of Hate and his obvious fanaticism concerned her. There seemed to be a flaw in this gem, casting confused shadows upon everything he said. He also mentioned this &quot;Ayanamii&quot; peson, and how he would drive her into Hate, but his spirit seemed diffused and unable to concentrate. He eventually hurried off to meet another, and Ayida was left feeling conflicted about this man and his goals. She decided that it was time to investigate the knowledge of Hate. <br>
<br>
It was not something she had much experience with, she preferred to try driving out all emotion while killing,<br>
trying to learn to see the killing from a new perspective, the one the warrior sages speak of in books. She<br>
went and spoke to several disciples of Innoruuk, then decided to test her new knowledge. She traveled again to Freeport, and paid silvers to people in a tavern across from the Circle of Sisters Hall there, in order to hear stories about them. After a day or so, she learned more, and decided to see if she could provoke this Ayanamii.<br>
<br>
Ayida waited until she saw her entering a courtyard in Freeport, then followed her out to the East Commons, calling out &quot;Ayanamii, Daughter of Innoruuk, Shining star in His Eyes, I come to seek a Lesson in Hate from you&quot;. The monk stopped, then turned rapidly and denied worshipping Innoruuk, clearly enraged. Ayida laughed to herself, and continued the dicussion, &quot;But oh Monk, Innoruuk favors you. All Tier'dal know of the Hatred of Ayanamii, and we are told to seek you out for Lessons. &quot;<br>
<br>
The monk responded, &quot;The only lesson I will teach you is how to lie in the ground.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I am young, but I am willing to duel you, Monk. You shall surely defeat me, but I would be humbly grateful of the Lesson from one such as yourself. If I can go back to Neriak and say &quot;the great monk, Ayanamii, Child of Hate, defeated me in a duel today&quot;, my status would rise far more than if I defeated any number of Tier'dal of my own rank&quot;. All lies of course, but by now the monk was sweating, and trembling with rage, a fey light in her eyes. <br>
<br>
Ayida smiled again to herself. It was hardly sport to provoke this monk. From the tavern across from the<br>
guildhall of the Circle, She had learnt of the duel between Shintou and Ayanamii, and the results thereof, of<br>
Shintou's fall to weakness, and Ayanamii's near madness at the release of her own Rage. But already Ayida<br>
had duplicated the Shintou's effort, albeit with foreknowledge of the way it went the last time, and losing in a duel to someone ages above her (she was only season 6) in experience was a small price to pay for<br>
satisfaction. Indeed the duel, when finally provoked by the Monk in her anger, lasted only 3 or 4 blows. So the monk was left looking angry and shamed, and Ayida began the slow journey back from Neriak to reclaim her broken body.<br>
<br>
Ayida decided to tell others of this duel, and incite them to provoke the monk as well, particularly other young Tier'dal, but anyone would do. If enough came to her, calling her Daughter of Innoruuk, Child of Hate, and asked for lessons, it might eventually drive the Ayanamii permanently mad. Ayida decided that Hate was an excellent way to control others, but that its Lessons might well be taken in moderation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/5/02 12:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chapter IV:  Blood</span><hr size=1> (note:  this chapter is presented here in edited form, due to the content of the original chapter).<br>
<br>
The next several weeks were a turmoil. <br>
<br>
Mistress Dalninil had given her goals to meet for training, and the few times she failed to meet them she was<br>
lashed and tortured.<br>
<br>
She saw Dalninil rarely, and in odd circumstances. She would appear suddenly and would disappear as rapidly.  Once she made an odd comment &quot;Oops, summoned,&quot; and simply vanished. There was something here that Ayida could not figure out, but was sure that it would become clear eventually. More equipment showed up and was bestowed upon her whenever her goals were exceeded.<br>
<br>
Ayida began doing small things for her mistress, dressing her, and tending to her bath, sleeping at the foot of Dalninil's bed when she wasn't off camping in some remote location after hunting. She kept Dalninil's chamber tidy, but rarely saw anyone else, and frequently slept alone in the room. In fact, Dalninil was always there at the beginning, or when she woke up, but never both.<br>
<br>
There were other folk she met, new friends. She began hunting with a young necromancer, who talked of their becoming friends. She found two Tier'dal, a young priestess of Innoruuk and an Enchantress, who had traveled to Ogguk and contract bound a young Ogre to them. They were glad of her company, and the hunting was profitable. She met the strange shadowknight, Eldraed, who seemed fond of her, and the Ogre, Bramurg, who clearly wanted her to join Norrath's Soldiers of Chaos.<br>
<br>
She saw more new races and strange folk than she had ever seen before. Their languages were strange, and their behavior even more so. Few seemed to understand the concepts of honor and duty, and some were clearly lacking in manners and breeding, but there were enough others who did, of human and ogre and troll races, that Ayida sometimes found herself with strange hunting companions that she could rarely<br>
communicate with. <br>
<br>
Then one night Dalninil showed up and said &quot;What will you do for me, Pet?&quot; (She frequently called Ayida Pet,<br>
though in the few times they'd been in public called her &quot;my servant&quot; or &quot;my slave&quot;.) Ayida knew the correct<br>
response, and answered &quot;Anything Mistress&quot;. &quot;We'll find out tonight, my Pet. Are you ready.&quot;<br>
                            <br>
Adrenaline surged through Ayida's veins, and her blood pounded within her. Hadn't she already been doing<br>
everything she was told? What test was this?<br>
<br>
The &quot;are you ready&quot; had not been a question, and Ayida merely bowed her head, and followed Dalninil. They<br>
entered into 3rd Gate, and passed within the House of the Dead to an upper room, with racks and torture<br>
implements. Ayida found herself nervous.<br>
<br>
Their first stop was a room, laid out in ritual manner, with an altar. Here Ayida witnessed as Dalninil sacrificed a young high elf to Innoruuk, the sacrifice, the chants of the Priestess as she gave this soul to her god, as she clearly drew power from the ritual. Such activities were not totally new to Ayida - vampires have their own habits and customs, and she had witnessed, participated in, and been trained from early on to such things. Finally the elf lay motionless within the manacles, and the closing ceremony was performed.<br>
<br>
Then Dalninil led her to another room, one lacking an altar. The testing and ritual that ensued was charged with lust and pain. Clearly designed to bring both participants to a fever pitch of emotion, with ancient ritualistic exchanges of give and take. The ritual had a sharply familiar edge to it that Ayida could not quite recognize, perhaps a variation on one she had been told about.<br>
                           <br>
Included in the ritual was a piercing of her tongue, and a skull-shaped barbell was given to her as a mark of her ownership by Dalninil. <br>
<br>
Only in the final part of the ritual did Ayida recognize it as a variation of the Ritual of the Blood, the exchanging of blood between a vampire and its victim, in order to mark the victim as a slave or servant.  As it took hold, she was suddenly part of Dalninil as she knew that Dalninil was now part of her. And this allowed her to see into Dalninil and understand. Vampire no. Undead, yes. Some kind of..ghost….who could manifest. <br>
<br>
Ayida looked up at Dalninil above her, smiled, and stammered, &quot;my Mistress. I am yours.&quot;, knowing that her<br>
destiny had led her directly across two continents, from a home where this ritual was the sum of one's life, to a place where it rarely occurred, and yet had still happened. Had her relating the story of her life to Dalninil given her this idea? Regardless, Ayida knew she was home at last, as Dalninil smiled back at her, &quot;Yes, my pet, you are&quot;, and then Ayida fainted.<br>
<br>
When she awoke, she was back in Dalninil's chambers, lying in the bed, tucked in, her flesh whole and<br>
unmarked, the strange feel of the piercing still in her mouth. She rolled over and fell back asleep. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/6/02 9:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Intermission One</span><hr size=1> just a little note I scrawled sometime back that I'd like to preserve.... we were having a discussion at the time about using the in-House private message system available to the guild I was in, and I penned this as a reply in the discussion. Feel free to ignore, I'm just archiving...<br>
                   ************************************************************<br>
<br>
&quot;I always have zero messages, oh well,&quot; murmured Ayida.<br>
<br>
A wood elf crawls out of the forest, its eyes are limpid pools, its skin is pale tan, with ruddy cheeks, its<br>
posture is slouchy and its skin twitches reflexively. Its mouth opens and out comes a crawling whine,<br>
obsequious in tone, but high pitched and scratchy -- a grotesque cariacature of Ayida's own voice --<br>
<br>
&quot;Nooo. nooo.. .No intrigues for poor pitiful Ayida. Who would want to intrigue with a pet, anyway. <br>
Excuse me for breathing, oh gods, I'm so depressed....(trails off into a pathetic whining whimper,<br>
sniffling)....might as well be a wood elf. ....&quot;<br>
<br>
the wood elf's whining is abruptly stilled by having a 2-inch diameter lance rammed through its torso and out<br>
the other side. Its thin blood trickles down the golden-white bone of the lance, then as quickly, the lance is<br>
gone, leaving a hand sized hole in the gut of the elf. It collapses to the ground, now a crumpled ball of flesh, its clothing a testimony to garish bad taste.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shut UP, worm! I was *not* feeling sorry for myself, I was just stating a fact that I had received no private messages. Gah. These things are everywhere in the Faydark. Why did I ever come here?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bushes begin to rustle again, and without even looking, the lance flickers once more, pulling another<br>
dead wood elf out from behind them.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I *don't* need a running commentary on everything I say out loud. And I used to wonder why people<br>
hated wood elves....maybe if we cut all their tongues out.... <br>

Mistress Dalninil was of the House of Sel'quar. She<br>
had been a living priestess, and her background was a complex mixture of status and the lack thereof. Dalninil had sought power, and found it. Her stab at becoming the Matron of Sel'quar had failed, and she had paid the price. But her power was now arguably greater as an undead than as a mortal, though subject to the demands of the owner of the souldagger into which Genashai, the new Matron of Sel'quar, had summoned her.<br>
<br>
Ayida found delight and delirium in the new bond to Dalninil. The presence of her mistress now always lurked in the background of her mind, and as Dalninil seemed to feed off the strength of her pet, Ayida also received strength from the bond, in like measure, though not always in the same way. It was an intimacy unlike any other, as she had been taught, but the reality caused the words of the teaching to pale in comparison, as usual. Fire as a word held no match to the actuality of Fire. And Dalninil was fire and ice in her body, her mind, her heart, her soul. <br>
<br>
Dalninil spoke to her of her past, and Ayida lived part of it directly in the new intensity of the bloodbond.<br>
Through this, she learned a bit of others. One of these was the noble knight - Braellar Ka'Jartan. Dalninil had<br>
advised her that it would be acceptable to speak to him -- and that she had, just barely, mentioned Ayida to him.<br>
<br>
One day, while hunting Orcs in the Oasis, Ayida remembered him, and sent out her thought in the manner<br>
approved by the gods. She introduced herself briefly as a young warrioress of the Cauldron, though she did<br>
not mention Dalninil more than in passing. To be judged on her own merit was as important to her as any<br>
young warrior, and relationships are often better developed separately than by relying on the merits of<br>
another. Ayida wanted advice on her hunting, and what strategies she should be developing. Here was<br>
someone who might speak to her of such, if she was careful and polite.<br>
<br>
To her surprise, Braellar asked her where she was, and before she could clear the next infusion of Orcs,<br>
Braellar was standing there on a dune, looking as cool and poised and handsome in his armor as could be<br>
imagined. The sun beat down hot, and he even complained of the heat and the heaviness of the armor, but to her he looked like a black and red sapphire, cut from the stone of the earth - dazzling and impermeable.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was in the area, and wanted to see you with my own eyes.&quot; His voice was surprisingly warm, a voice<br>
confident and poised.<br>
<br>
Ayida curtseyed before him, then knelt. They exchanged politenesses, and she spoke of her origin, and her<br>
desire to improve herself as a warrior. After awhile, Ayida began to wonder what was going on. Several times she had to excuse herself to stop and slay an Orc with her current hunting companion, but Braellar never suggested that they move. Neither did he seem impatient. Even after the conversation dwindled past any tiny topic that Ayida could dredge up to speak of, he sat there.<br>
<br>
Finally, she asked, &quot;Excuse me, my lord, is there ought you would wish of me?&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. I'd like to see you fight a few more battles, if you would.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly, my lord.&quot; Ayida got up and shot a wandering Orc with her bow, then she and her companion slew it.  Yet before she could attract the attention of another, Braellar suddenly sprang up and ran over the dune to the Orc Monument, guarded constantly by four orcs stationed there, as well as many Orc pilgrims who traveled to it in a steady stream, constantly wandering in from the south.<br>
<br>
Ayida ran to the top of the dune, and watched as he attacked one, then another. By the time he had moved to the third, the other two chasing him, the shock of watching him had washed over. In that moment she had realized that he could himself easily kill all these and many more. Therefore what he was doing was<br>
meaningless, unless he was expecting a particular reaction. What should she do? Clearly fighting one orc at a time was not what he had wished to observe. Now the choice was hers, run down and begin fighting beside him, and trust in him to keep her alive, or not, as he wished. Or stand there until he slew them, watching helplessly. Several of the orcs there would have been too much for her, even one on one. She had studied them, and was sure.<br>
<br>
All this in the flash of a few seconds.<br>
<br>
Ayida called out Ase, Ase (As-shay, Aa-shay - May it be so, May it be so), her rarely used battlecry, and<br>
sped down the hill and attacked the biggest orc he was fighting. As she turned on them, so too they turned<br>
on her, as Braellar stopped, turned and waited for her to attract all their attention. <br>
<br>
Her sole companion from the hill followed moments later, and she praised Vorrador's resolve in this situation.<br>
He had sat and waited politely while she had been interrogated, and had helped her kill when needed. Now he joined her in a combat in which he clearly had no obligation but that as one hunting companion to another, in a battle the terms of which she learned after that he had no inkling. Later she thought about who was braver.<br>
<br>
As the orcs focused on Ayida and Vorrador, Braellar pulled back a bit, and watched. Ayida was too busy<br>
fighting to notice what he was doing particularly, though from time to time a spell washed over her, or an orc that she was engaged with. The flurry of blows never seemed to end, and orc after orc came over the hill and joined the battle.<br>
<br>
Quickly the sword in her hands became heavy, and attacks slipped by her guard and wounded her. The healing helped some, but the decline was steady though slow. Finally, she was gasping, drinking in large gulps of air as her lungs burned in the hot sun, and blood ran down a dozen wounds on her body. Another orc came over the hill, and she attacked it before it even knew she was there. The bloodlust of the berserk was upon her, and she determined to fight until she died, or until Braellar called halt. She killed that one, then another.<br>
<br>
Suddenly there were no orcs in sight, even across the wind driven dunes to the east and north. Corpses lay<br>
sprawled all over. Ayida noticed that her companion had received much more healing that she, and smiled to<br>
herself, then looked down, and noticed that she was near unto bleeding to death, only a fraction away.<br>
<br>
Shaking and unsteady, she turned to Lord Braellar. He waved at her and her companion &quot;Here. Come up onto<br>
this rock outcropping and sit.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ayida staggered over to the rock and sat down, her back to a cliff. Somewhere between 14 and 20 orcs were dead, she estimated, in a fraction of the time it normally would have taken to kill them, even if she could. She remembered now Braellar slew at least one troublesome priest himself, as it stood off and cast spells. The rest was a fog of blood and entrails, and flashing swords.<br>
<br>
After a rest period, Braellar approached her, and abruptly offered her a position in House Sel'quar. Ayida was<br>
stunned. Again, revelation flooded her, as she realized the purpose of the exercise. She had been tested. She felt foolish not to have figured it out sooner. As a reflex, she rejected the offer, then apologized. &quot;Lord<br>
Ka'Jartan. I know little of your House. Of your ways, the requirements, the customs,. .. &quot;. He waved a hand,<br>
cutting her off.<br>
<br>
&quot;I realize that. You will need to take time to learn us, and us you. Your position will be small, as will your<br>
duties and responsibilities at first. If you are found suitable, you may be allowed to stay. If you choose to<br>
leave, and do so responsibly, it will be allowed.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If you ask me again, Lord, I will accept then. I just wanted to make sure. But….&quot; Before she could continue<br>
her explanation, he asked her again. This time, Ayida had enough grace to accept. Explanations, including<br>
Dalninil, could wait until later. <br>
<br>
Ayida only hoped that Dalninil would approve. But Braellar had impressed her, and she did not wish to<br>
disappoint him. Now there were two in Sel'quar she felt ties with. Both bound to her by honor, and one by<br>
blood. Hopefully there would be a place for her there, though she would of course remove herself if<br>
commanded by Dalninil, or asked by Braellar.<br>
<br>
Braellar pulled her to one side, and spoke to her quietly and softly, giving her some information she would need to survive in the early days in the House. It was clear that this information was necessary, and just as clear that he was not obligated to give it to her. She wanted to return a confidence to him, but what did she know? Ah. Just as he turned to leave, she managed to stammer out &quot;I am already Mistress Dalninil's Pet&quot;. He looked at her, clearly amused, laughed, and. . . as quickly as he had appeared. .. . was gone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/7/02 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Humility</span><hr size=1> Her first weeks in House Sel'quar were spent walking lightly and quietly. Her position in the House was very<br>
very minor, though several comments were made about the usefulness of having a warrior ready to stand and die in the front lines.<br>
<br>
Ayida spent most of her time hunting with Jana, a young necromancer. As Jana progressed faster and faster, she learned to hunt alone and Ayida saw her less and less. But Ayida had also met Alandriel, Calalia, and their ogre, Grumsh. Alandriel was a priestess of Innoruuk, Calalia was an enchantress, and Grummsh was their warrior bodyguard. The hunting was effective and profitable for all. <br>
<br>
It was during this time that Ayida was attacked by Lady Shea, a foolish paladin in Freeport. The guards didn't seem to view the High Elf with any more friendship than Ayida did, and they looked the other way as she was slain in front of them. After this, Ayida started looking for other paladins to slay.<br>
<br>
Ayida slew orcs (untrustworthy allies at best, savage fools for the most part), creatures of the forest who<br>
crossed her path, put a severe dent in the crocodile plague in the Oasis. <br>
<br>
Master Braellar joined Ayida and Mistress Dalninil one day, as they went to Najena. Dalninil wanted to show<br>
the place to her pet, and the Master apparently had no significant plans, so he joined them. He and Master<br>
Velve in particular had assisted her with some equipment, some on loan, and some given. Today he had a<br>
pretty black breastplate for her to wear, much better than the alloy chain she was wearing. <br>
<br>
Some hunting ensued in Najena. Master Braellar instructed her on several topics, including tips on hunting with her betters, how to avoid obtaining the attention of a creature much larger than she was by limiting her taunting, how to maneuver more effectively around to strike someone from behind when it was preoccupied with someone else, how to most effectively hunt with a shadowknight. It was enlightening. <br>
<br>
Her new confidence was peaked, and her bloodlust was running high. Ayida spoke boldly to him of learning<br>
enough to take his position in the House, tempered only by her careful phraseology in couching it in terms of a compliment. His eyes twinkled as he regarded her, but suddenly, too late, caution came back to her. &quot;Wait<br>
here&quot;, he said. &quot;I'll bring us something to kill.&quot; His tone was light as well, but fear swept over her. His bearing<br>
and manner said that he was offended by her presumptuousness, and she knew that a lesson was about to be demonstrated. <br>
<br>
Braellar brought back the Widowmistress. Ayida paled. This was her great-great-aunt. Already wounded<br>
severely by trailing her through half of Najena back to the front rooms, Braellar was grim, and his skill, nerve, and courage were of a state that overwhelmed her, making her latest comment seem foolish and full of bravado. He smiled at Ayida, a fierce smile, and said &quot;kill&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ayida leapt into combat, knowing this time that her life was forfeit as a result of her loose tongue. And so it<br>
was. One cannot run from a rogue whose expertise lies in striking from behind, and with her aunt had come<br>
numerous other denizens of the deep, all howling for blood. Mistress Dalninil made it back to the Lavastorm<br>
Mountains, but Ayida stood and died, with Braellar. <br>
<br>
The lesson was pointed, and cutting, and burned in her memory. After being revived by her Mistress, Ayida<br>
cast herself on the ground before Braellar, and calling him &quot;Master&quot; for the first time, thanked him for the<br>
lesson, saying &quot;I can offer no excuse, Master Braellar, for my tongue. But I have learned the lesson, and I<br>
shall not forget.&quot; Her respect for him rose. He had demonstrated that tolerance and assistance have a limit,<br>
and shown her clearly the boundaries. He was gracious to her. Dalninil smirked at her, and Ayida felt that<br>
there might be punishment later, for embarrassing her Mistress.<br>
<br>
Then Mistress Dalninil and Master Braellar went back into the Halls of Najena, and slew her aunt, and took her stiletto. The lesson was complete. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/8/02 1:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Knight</span><hr size=1> One day Ayida met a shadowknight in West Commons, who stopped and spoke to her. He was a Lord, and<br>
Ayida was frankly surprised when he did more than nod, and stopped her for conversation. She assumed that he might be &quot;looking for a good time&quot;, and quickly let him know that she was the pet of Dalninil Venorsh, and that any requests regarding her would have to be sent to her Mistress. He smiled, and agreed, then asked her to pass greetings to Masters Braellar and Velve. Later he spoke to her Mistress, asking if Ayida would be available for some work that he needed performed for some of the necromancers of the Lodge of the Dead.<br>
<br>
Dalninil informed her that such work was acceptable, as long as it didn't interfere with her training or her other duties.<br>
<br>
So when the Knight contacted her again, she was ready to accept. He informed her that if she performed<br>
satisfactorily and quickly, he would reward her with some nice boots that would assist her training. He wanted her to obtain, however necessary, a number of beetle eyes from an island in Erud's Crossing, and a tusk from a Wooly Mammoth in the wastes of Everfrost. These appeared to be daunting tasks, not the least of which was that they involved crossing territory into which she had never traveled. Just getting through Qeynos, and the guards of Halas in Everfrost was likely to be an involved process.<br>
<br>
It turned out that the humans of Qeynos had no more breeding or sense of culture than those in Freeport,<br>
and though many were frankly dubious about associating with her, she could travel about the town. The<br>
temple of Bertoxxulous in the Qeynos catacombs was of assistance, providing her with names and contacts<br>
where she could eat, and sleep, and shop.<br>
<br>
The tiny island of Erud's crossing was peculiar. It was the site of a dormant volcano, and there were strange cat people there. It was necessary to slay several of them to obtain &quot;permission&quot; to hunt the rare beetles which crawled out of cracks in the rock of the cinder cone. Ayida slept and killed there for several day, and slew the Erudite paladin who tried to the claim the interior of the cone as his &quot;meditation&quot; place. Finally she had the required number of fragile beetle eyes, and move back through Qeynos, pausing in Blackburrow to slay several hundred gnolls who dropped like flies before her sword.<br>
<br>
Everfrost was a different matter. The native wildlife to the snow and ice was of no more concern to her than the gnolls had been, but the guards of Halas were a different story. They were hostile, and patrolled regularly, particularly the access routes to the lowlands east of the mountain passes. It was here that Ayida first actually stopped and met some Druids. Druids seemed to be a breed apart. They scorned the civilizations which they came from, and lived apart in the wilderness. At least they seemed to understand the chain of life and death, that the strong fed on the weak, and they did not view her own killing with distain, but rather seemed to admire her as a natural predator. <br>
<br>
They were meek enough to pay her the respect due to a Tier'dal, and their skills were obviously useful. She<br>
filed the information away in her head, and went back to hunting a way to evade the guards. Once viewed as a strategic assessment, it merely became a logistical problem, and the next time one moved to intercept a wandering goblin, Ayida ran by on the opposite hill while his attention was engaged. <br>
<br>
Wooly mammoths are large, and the damage they dish out was disproportionate to their apparent danger. It<br>
became necessary to make the trip from Qeynos naked, and once again avoid notice. Eventually, with care,<br>
Ayida managed to slay one single-handedly, but the tusk it bore was not clearly identifiable as such. Others<br>
were hunting these creatures, but there were no Tier'dal in the area. An Erudite wizardess assisted her in<br>
obtaining several more of the tusks from various mammoths, and finally she found one would surely be<br>
suitable.<br>
<br>
The trip back through the Karanas was relatively uneventful, surprisingly. And when Ayida met the<br>
Shadowknight in 3rd Gate, he rewarded her with a very nice pair of green boots which were surprisingly as<br>
hard as plate. As he smiled at her, she realized that it was possible that he actually was attracted to her,<br>
specifically, and wondered why. The look in his eyes was complicated, and Ayida knew that she needed to<br>
tread carefully. <br>
<br>
&quot;That was done very well, and very quickly. I thought it would take you longer. If you like, I will have more<br>
work for you in the future&quot;. <br>
<br>
Ayida bowed, and nodded. Over time, he kept coming up with tasks. Some felt trivial, and others were more<br>
complicated, but within the grasp of diligence and hard work. Sometimes, there would only be a note left,<br>
&quot;Bring me such-and-so an item&quot;. Other times he would meet her at a wizard portal, where his companions<br>
would stop and relax while he took her over to the side and chatted. Ayida was careful to keep her Mistress<br>
informed, and even more careful to behave very properly with him. A high ranking Knight was not someone you wished to offend, and Ayida did not wish to become embroiled in any &quot;intrigues&quot;. Her duties and her mind were clear. As long as his jobs for her did not involve politics, and as long as it did not come to preoccupy her, she was comfortable with it. <br>
<br>
His behavior remained exemplary. And when it became clear that his love of killing for the joy of it rivaled hers, she enjoyed spending a bit of time with him rampaging through a zone like the Commons, slaying everything as fast as possible, never stopping to even check the corpses. In addition to the boots, other &quot;gifts&quot; came her way.<br>
<br>
Ayida discovered that he had been searching for an apprentice. He wanted a shadowknight, someone young, to train properly. Ayida found several that she knew and recommended the Knight to them, and them to the Knight. But none of them were accepted. One had no interest, another found a League to join, one was not sufficiently dedicated, another had the wrong attitude and personality for what he wanted. He himself confessed that he had been looking for sometime, and that he had also not found anyone. He encouraged Ayida to keep sending him candidates, but as each was rejected, she learned more to look for, and was able to help screen them. Young dedicated unattached shadowknights were rare. It became clear to Ayida that at least part of the his largess to her was a thank you for the assistance, and part stemmed from his frustrated desire to contribute something meaningful to the training of another.<br>
<br>
Ayida redoubled her efforts to become more useful to her mistress, and to be worthy of this misappropriated<br>
attention from the Knight. Then there came a time when she did not hear from him. And decided that he must have found his apprentice.<br>
<br>
At this time, also, Jana, Alandriel, Calalia, and Grumsh all disappeared, as well as a couple of more casual<br>
hunting compansion. Abruptly, totally. Apparently gone into the void, not seen unto this day. Finding someone to hunt with became difficult. She was either too young or too old to hunt effectively with nearly everyone else in the House. And half of Antonica seemed overrun with do-gooders: wood elves, high elves, good priestesses. This went on for several weeks, and her training slowed to a pathetic crawl. Something had to be done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/10/02 2:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Velve...</span><hr size=1> During this time, Ayida had occasion to reflect. One day she stood before the Shadowed Men in Western<br>
Commons, and remembered Master Velve, and cried quietly, to herself, alone.<br>
<br>
It was foolish to cry, of course. And he would probably have reminded her that it was weak, in that funny<br>
semi-harsh, semi-gentle way he had.<br>
<br>
Ayida remembered meeting him. He was a brusque man, to outward eyes. Someone with little tolerance for<br>
suffering fools gladly. Master Braellar seemed so gentle at times that one could be tempted to forget how<br>
dangerous he really was. But when meeting Master Velve no one had any doubt of it. The two of them were<br>
very different in some ways, but both were excellent representatives of the Knights of Shadow, both worthy<br>
of being used as role-models.<br>
<br>
Velve's actions, from the first, had been noble. He had politely let her know that if she had any equipment<br>
needs, that he would consider them. He had neither embraced her presence in the House, nor openly sneered at her, as several had done early in her tenure. There was no dishonor in anyone sneering at a pet of course.<br>
<br>
And her skills and age were nothing much to brag about yet either. But he had merely appraised her quietly,<br>
no emotion showing, and gone on his way. <br>
<br>
One day he came to her, and suggested that she could use a bit of individual training. Ayida accepted,<br>
gratefully, and wondered how this was going to happen. He asked if she knew of anything near by, worthy of her to hunt. By this point there were few sources of hunting between High Pass and the Ocean of Tears which did not either require a large hunting group, or which were too trivial to bother with. Then she remembered the Shadowmen. Velve thought that this was an excellent idea.<br>
<br>
The journey there was quick. Nearly all the shadowed men were still beyond her ability alone. Velve gently<br>
taunted them one by one from their encampment, and with his considerable assistance, Ayida slew them, one by one. It was tedious and wearying, and difficult, even with his skill. He personally could have slain all of them easily. But it exhausted many of his resources to so carefully manage the fight that Ayida could learn herself. <br>
<br>
Watching this, Ayida felt embarrassed to be such a burden. When he suggested a change, she agreed quickly, hoping to spare him from having to work with such a poor student. However, to her surprise, he wasn't done.<br>
<br>
He merely suggested that Zobok come and join them. As a shaman, he pointed out, Zobok's skill were much<br>
more oriented toward making this difficult task easier. And so Ayida met Zobok, a large bear that came<br>
wandering over a hill. In fact, for a good while, she only ever saw Zobok as a bear, and one day when he<br>
changed into an Ogre, she was actually surprised. Even unto this day, she thought to herself, &quot;I think of Zobok as a bear first.&quot;<br>
<br>
The hunting became significantly easier, as he had predicted, and the green hills around the area started<br>
looking like a shadowed man graveyard. Only the occasional weapon lying on the ground, with a neatly<br>
lettered sign in the grass &quot;A shadowed man's corpse&quot;, dotted the hillside.<br>
<br>
At that time she was in her mid 20s, and the experience of the training pushed her rapidly up. One time,<br>
Keudaael wandered by, and cast enchanter's spells on Zobok and Velve. Another time, Mistress Dalninil came to check on her, and received the report from Velve with some satisfaction, healed everyone, and left. <br>
<br>
But several days were spent solely in Velve and Zobok's company. It was an odd thing. Zobok at times<br>
seemed to not remember any of this. She put it off to his being a bear, and never worried about it. <br>
<br>
But during this time, Ayida learned to appreciate Velve, and in her mind assigned him the title &quot;Master&quot; for his skill and as a mark of her respect, as she had already done with Master Braeller. He spoke to her at length, regarding many topics. And asked her of herself. He never looked down on her, and always corrected her deed, or her speech, without prejudice. She learned much of Neriak that she had never known before, and her accent improved slightly as well. He was a Tier'dal patriot, outspoken and opinionated. He spoke well, however, and his words seemed more than dogma or propaganda. They were more like a code to live by, a system of responsibility and authority and with a certain amount of natural arrogance from someone who was qualified to judge, and dared to.<br>
<br>
Both there with the shadowed men, obtaining the tempers he needed for his smithing, and later, in Iceclad, as he taught her to hunt the cougars, she learned much. Including why she liked this man.<br>
<br>
Ayida's mind was brought back to the present. &quot;Pa'don me, meussus. Ay'm lookin' fer a rapier, heah.&quot; Ayida<br>
looked up at the man in plate in annoyance, her thought processes interrupted. She saw that he was a knight of another order. &quot;Are you a paladin?&quot;, Ayida asked, brightly. &quot;Ah a'am. You're a cute little elf. Wahy don't yu let me show yu a gude time then, and if you let me kiss you and iffen you he'lp me get dis here rapier, ay'll show you a good time&quot;. <br>
<br>
It was too much. Thinking of Velve, and then being interrupted by this idiot. Ayida challenged him to a duel on the spot. It took some taunting and insults to convince him that she was serious, as he kept wanting to call her &quot;lil' lady&quot;. Finally she got through to him that she only thought of him with contempt, and he agreed to the duel. <br>
<br>
As she left his carcass lying in the green grass, her spirit felt uplifted. Velve's lessons had not been in vain.<br>
Though he had disappeared into Velious, lost in an apparent cave-in, she would honor his memory. And<br>
continue it to honor it with the slaughter of idiots who had no respect for her people, the Tier'dal. She turned and headed back to Neriak, to go and do something she had never done before: look on the place as home, and also go fishing by the waterfall. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/02 9:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Picnics and a Quest</span><hr size=1> One day Eldraed came to her again. Her knight of the quests, and he whose time she had enjoyed, walking<br>
through various common zones, the two of them slaughtering all in their path, leaving an abattoir of bodies in their wake.<br>
<br>
Upon query, she discovered that he had not found his shadowknight apprentice. And this time he was looking at her differently. He was even more personable, more charming that he had been before. And so they laughed, and he took her on a few picnics.<br>
<br>
The first one was to Mistmoore. They slaughtered their way into the graveyard and even into the castle itself.  He watched her as she slew the knight within and took the crested pauldron and rested it upon her shoulders, a token of her return to this place of her birth, and the minor victory of letting Mayong's minions know that not only was she still alive, but prospering.<br>
<br>
Their luncheon was had upon a blanket of vah shir and kerran hides that Ayida had made from some of her<br>
conquests, a soft dappled fur of several colors and and patterns. <br>
<br>
Eldraed brought forth gourmet delights, one after the other. They finished with candied spider and winter falls wine, and she admired his skill at cooking and smiled at the delight he felt in such an activity. <br>
<br>
For a moment she fell into a reverie, seeing in her mind's eye the dread shadowknight's face reflected in the<br>
dark red glow of the fires as he chuckled over the scene before him as he prodded the implements in the fire<br>
with evil humor. She imagined him uttering a prayer to his god Innoruuk, finally nodding with satisfaction at his success and withdrawing from the coals the pan, now laden with brownies, the bubbling chocolate seething within, as he placed them to cool in the snow while contemplating the cheerful slaughter of those that he had slain that day to achieve this precious goal. <br>
<br>
Ayida laughed out loud, and seeing the query in her knight's eye described the scene to him. They both<br>
laughed in the soft breeze of the afternoon there in the graveyard as the sun crept towards the horizon.<br>
<br>
On their way back out that evening, Equestrielle, who had bothered Ayida more than once passing through<br>
the Faydark, crested a hill, heading straight for them. Eldraed turned and cast a spell at her, seeking combat, but the horse was smarter than Ayida had thought, and it turned and ran as though it had devils after it, which in a sense it did.<br>
<br>
**<br>
It was clear that their relationship was changing, but Ayida was surprisingly slow to catch on. One day<br>
someone asked her how long that Eldraed had been 'sweet on her', and the light dawned! He was. And she<br>
liked him too. Ayida wasn't used to dealing with males much, and the discovery was surprising, as was the joy she felt the next time she saw him.<br>
<br>
Their next picnic was on a remote island in the Ocean of Tears, with a small stop-over to slay most of the<br>
Sisters of Erollisi on Sister Isle. Once again the food was excellent, and this time the talk progressed to<br>
themselves and what relationship that might be developing. <br>
<br>
Ayida explained about her bonding with Dalninil, but wasn't sure that he understood it really. Those who are<br>
not familiar with the ancient blood-rituals often don't clearly see how they bind the souls together as well as<br>
the bodies. Ayida was of, and belonged to, Dalninil now. And in a similar sense, Dalninil was also her. Cutting<br>
the head from the body damages both, and Ayida tried to explain how though she was free to pursue such<br>
relationships as did meet her mistress's favor, that she would always belong to her.<br>
<br>
Eldraed talked about buying her, then finding some other method of freeing her, and finally Ayida simply asked him to seek Dalninil's permission to court her, and pointed out that checking in with her Ilharess, Genashai might also be a good idea.<br>
<br>
He did go and do this, and Ayida found herself granted permission to see this knight romantically. Of course<br>
she had also consulted with her Mistress and her Ilharess herself, but it was important to her that he go ask.  He was already a great lord in Neriak, and had recently become the Emissary of War as well.<br>
<br>
So it came to pass that Eldraed and Ayida found themselves smiling at one another in public, and having quiet times together to enjoy their hobbies, mostly food and killing. He was busy with his responsibilities, as she was with hers, and often they would not see one another for days, but when they did, it was always special. <br>
<br>
And then one day Eldraed came to her with another quest, which surprised her. He told her that this one<br>
would be hard, but that the rewards would be worth it, he hoped. After all the other quests she had<br>
performed, this one would be more difficult than any, and would take her a long time in all likelihood, but that he hoped that she would persevere through it. <br>
<br>
She smiled and accepted, feeling that this was yet another of his idiosyncrasies. They were romantically<br>
involved, but if it pleased him to continue their old game, she would. <br>
<br>
First he went and concealed himself within the Great Divide and told her to seek him out. The Great Divide is<br>
not the easiest place to find someone, she told him, and he smiled. &quot;use all available resources&quot; became the<br>
refrain that she would eventually groan to hear.<br>
<br>
Ayida knew few trackers, and cared to seek the aid of fewer, and none were currently available anyway. That truly would have made it an easy task. Instead, the sorceress Sindell (who would often show up and take her on shopping trips all over Norrath) came to her plea, and hearing about the task answered with amusement that she would be pleased to assist. <br>
<br>
Ayida finally found him in the cave of the shardwurms. He would not smile at her, not greet her with a hug as he normally would. His manner was nearly regal, and distant as the oracles of Norrath often are, those who give out adventures to the willing. She actually found herself saying &quot;What giants?&quot; &quot;What about the<br>
dwarves?&quot;, and laughed to herself.<br>
<br>
It devolved that this was a task to help the dwarves against the giants. Well enough. They wanted frost giant meat to feed the wurms, and frost giant toes, heads, and even perhaps some helms to give evidence of her active assistance.<br>
<br>
The task was not difficult particularly, but involved a bit of time, and several days passed while Ayida slew<br>
giants. Her return offer of a stack of frost giant steaks was refused, as the wurms needed uncooked meat,<br>
she was told. A sigh and some more killing resulted. During this time Ayida met several new friends, folks who were also hunting the Giants, also folk of her House helped her out, including her Ilharess, Genashai. Ayida always was honored by the times that her Ilharess would come and hunt with her, it was a mark of favor that she treasured.<br>
<br>
Upon the completion of this, she returned to the caves and was told to meet him at the foot of Dain IV, who would give her another task. This time, she was asked for materials for bow strings to aid the dwarves. They wanted 100' of some kind of magical velious kelp or something. Queries and research led nowhere until she finally discovered a reference to 100' of waterproof rope that was obtainable from a shipwreck in the Cobalt Scar. Again, Sindell was a great help to her, and shortly Ayida delivered the rope to Eldraed at the foot of Dain. A Bow of the Huntsman was an interim reward as thanks for assisting the war effort, a lovely gift indeed.<br>
<br>
The 3rd task now took her into another phase of the quest. Having assisted the dwarves sufficiently, she was told, the dragons were now willing to treat with her and see if she was worthy of their notice. It was the desire of the dragon Rolandal, she was told, to have evidence of her faithfulness. Bring to him the symbol of the loyalty of the goblin king of permafrost to the renegade Vox, and she would be rewarded with a gift and her next task.<br>
<br>
Ayida cringed at this one. Not only was it going to be difficult to journey once more into Permafrost to obtain this item, but she was rapidly approaching the point where the gods would deem a reward for the slaying of the goblin king unworthy of her. And then there was that afternoon's hunting in Skyshrine, wherein she had slain enough of the guardians of that place for any favor she might have had with the dragons to have fallen.<br>
<br>
Rescued again by the members of her House, the symbol of Loyalty to Vox was easily obtainable. Several<br>
offered her this gift that they had already obtained, but Braellar was the one who handed it to her one<br>
afternoon as they shared an ale.<br>
<br>
Being allowed back into the presence of the dragon Rolandal was another matter. Ayida hunted giants. And<br>
hunted giants. And hunted giants, in Great Divide, in the Eastern Wastes, and finally in Kael Drakkel itself for<br>
weeks. Time after time, she traveled at great risk to where she could gain a glimpse of a dragon to see if her presence would be tolerated, and time after time, she journeyed back to kill more giants, her heart heavy at the afternoon of slaughter that she was beginning to regret. <br>
<br>
Finally, one day, the guardian creatures of Cobalt Scar would tolerate her presence. She laughed in the sea<br>
breeze and the snow, as a cobalt drake glided directly above her, its wings buffeting the air around her.<br>
<br>
Taking the symbol, she met Eldraed standing between the feet of Rolandal, and she saluted, then gave the<br>
symbol to the dragon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well done&quot;, said Eldraed. &quot;Rolandal has these two pieces of armor for you as tokens of his cognizance of your work. Are you ready for your next task?&quot; <br>
<br>
This 4th stage was daunting. The dragons of Skyshrine were unhappy with a troll, a profiteer on the black<br>
market, who was a renegade from Grobb. His name was Rungupp, and among his other misdeeds, he was guilty of stealing dragon eggs and selling them on the black market. &quot;Bring me the head of Rungupp, and restore a  lost dragon egg to us. You must deliver it to the commanders of Skyshrine, specifically Lawyla, Ralgyn, and Jalicn.&quot;, translated Eldraed as the dragon rumbled in a tongue not known to Ayida.<br>
<br>
Rungupp. Ayida knew immediately who this miscreant was and where to find him. After that it was a matter of hiring successive groups of adventurers until she finally was able to hire a pair from Erudin Palace, an<br>
enchantress and a wizardess of the 4th ranks of that place. They slew him and took his head, and Ayida paid them and went on her way. A simple matter, but one that involved days of hanging around Paineel and the Warrens, looking for someone who was willing to cooperate with a Tier'dal. For fun, Ayida slew every kobold in the Warrens, 3 times, walking from one end to the other and back again. It was necessary to skip several and come back later, as some of the kobolds were being hunted by others, but eventually Ayida slew them all, as well as the overgrown tadpole and the funny bear that lurked in their respective lairs. <br>
<br>
Ayida searched the black market. Time and time again, there would be a lead to someone who may have had one of these things, but every lead petered out. Dragon eggs were a rare commodity to begin with, and few would admit to even having seen one of these things. Finally Ayida found a contact in Grobb who had one. In exchange for a stack of HEHE meat (a sausage made of High Elf, Erudite, and Human), he would exchange with her. Killing enough high elves, humans, and erudites was both fun and a pain, as so many things often are. She was thankful that her own studies of cooking allowed her to make this food, and even finally sampled some herself. An interesting flavor, but crude in actuality. And substituting halfling for human was an experiment that just didn't work out. Their livers were too pickled by alcohol or something.  Ayida decided to stick to high elven veal. <br>
<br>
When she got to Grobb, however, the contact had fled from the authorities. Ayida caught up with him in<br>
Cobalt Scar, and after relieving him of his burden, relieved him of his life as well, then taking her egg,<br>
proceeded to Skyshrine. <br>
<br>
Wherein she promply got lost in the maze that is the palace of the dragons. Maps were difficult to find at all, those few that did exist were partial, and the maze itself was deeply confusing. And maze it was. In fact, there was a multi-level maze in the middle of it, wherein she saw not another living soul. After a seeming eternity of wandering these vast and intricate halls, she finally made it to Lawyla. And then there was Eldraed again, smiling at her. &quot;Well done. You have only one more step to take, Ayida. Meet me at the foot of Commander Sontalak at the Gates of the Temple of Veeshan, and you shall have proved your mettle as a warrioress and a Tier'dal.&quot; &quot;And while you're here, if you're careful, I might be able to get you a sneak peak at Yelinak. Do not approach too closely, or your life will be forfeit, however.&quot;. <br>
<br>
And so Ayida got to see the legendary king of the dragons, who glowered within his vasty hall, and was glad<br>
that he did not see her peeking through the gate. The most fun however, was ice skating in the halls with<br>
Eldraed, doing spins and figure 8s and generally gliding around laughing like a silly person. &quot;What a wonderful<br>
place for an ice-skating party&quot;, she mused as she followed him back to the courtyard of the dragons.<br>
<br>
It was so fun that the difficulty of obtaining the final step was obscured until the next morning when she<br>
woke up. And then the weight of it hit her. Not only had she never been to the Western Wastes, but just<br>
getting through the Siren's Grotto was going to be a severe test for one of her experience. She would need<br>
significant help. And finally, help she got. Once more, her family in Sel'quar came to her aid and assistance.<br>
<br>
Armed with some extra potions for security, the wizard Zeff, and her Ilharn Braellar accompanied her to Cobalt Scar, and escorted her through Siren's Grotto. In her foolishness, she forgot that her Ilharess Genashai had offered to help, and woefully neglected the very great assistance that such a powerful mage could have granted, as well as the honor of her company on such an enterprise.<br>
<br>
After they made it to the Western Wastes, Braellar led her on the perilous run to the Temple of Veeshan, and she knew that his presence was not welcome by the dragons. So when they came to the point where they overlooked the great canyon, she prevailed upon him to stay and wait for her, which he did reluctantly. &quot;Your bravery is already great, my lord, please allow me this last step on my own&quot;, she said, and he acquiesced gracefully.<br>
<br>
Waiting for her yet again, at the feet of the ugliest dragon that Ayida had ever seen, was Eldraed. He smiled at her, and she suddenly was very excited. <br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome Ayida Winnower. Know that on this day, you have succeeded at the Test of Lamentation and<br>
Defiance. Your prowess as a warrior and a leader are confirmed, and as such you shall be rewarded. First,<br>
here is a scroll. By my authority as a representative of The Dead, you are hereby granted Neriak Citizenship<br>
with all the rights that entails. No longer shall you be a statusless person in Neriak. And take as well these<br>
two blades, whose names reflect the Test which you have conquered.&quot;<br>
<br>
The blades were lovely and efficient looking. She sheathed them at her side, resolving to take a look at them later. <br>
<br>
But the other thing revealed to her was why this quest at all, what was in the back of his mind the whole<br>
time. He was seeking for a way to let her earn herself something that he wished to give her - rights and<br>
status as a Neriak Citizen in her own regard, not just as a pet to her Mistress, Dalninil Venorsh. Though she<br>
still belonged to Dalninil, willingly bonded by the ancient blood rites that cannot be set aside, Eldraed had<br>
found a way to allow her to feel secure about her relationship with him as well. <br>
<br>
It was a noble gift, and as she made her way back to the Cobalt, she thought about how nervous he must<br>
have been, daring to set a Tier'dal female such a task, and still hoping that she would succeed, for both their sakes. Now she knew the answer to the question which her Ilharess had so foresightedly asked her - why was he daring to order a Tier'dal female around in such a manner, what were his motivations?<br>
<br>
Ayida smiled to herself as she headed back home, heading towards Genashai to let her know that she had the answer, and the nobility of the motivation behind it. The swords in their scabbards clicked as she walked, a pleasant accompaniment to her footsteps bouncing along the way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxreynnx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>x Reynn x</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Queen of Rods</span><br>  Posts: 521<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/11/02 11:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Picnics and a Quest</span><hr size=1> (( applaude )) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/12/02 9:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Genashai</span><hr size=1> She calls me Daughter when I please her.

<br>
Dalninil, looked upon her humble apartment in the tower of the Sel`Quar. Much had changed in such a sort<br>
time. She had been the Master of the temple and was ready to seize the house, again she had failed. Her<br>
large chambers where gone, leaving a small room suitable for that of a commoner. She still had wealth, her<br>
long running contacts with the Ebon Mask assured that. She layed curled on the bed, whincing inside she<br>
would learn her new role in the house, it wasn't going to be that different. <br>
<br>
A tear ran down her cheek as she though of the human, whos status execed hers, he'd made it clear that he wanted her pet, and she had acquiesed as she didn't have the status to refuse. She'd heard that she would be sold as well, such a step down, a slap in the face, a Yath'tallar would never be sold, a commoner with no favor would be.<br>
<br>
....She prepared the knives, it was the night to renew the bonds of blood. The spice and incense were added, the bowl were prepared. Inside she felt the surge of happiness in her bonded sister, she know that the latest quest was complete. She thought to hate the knight that was taking her sister but she couldn't the bond wouldn't allow that.<br>
<br>
Ayida in all her bloody carnage ridden gear, came into the room. She composed her self and again exerted<br>
control, allowing herself to dream the dreams of power as they celebrated the quest's end and the citizenship of Ayida. <br>
<br>
The blood ritual went as it always did, exept for one small difference, the blood usually seperate and distinct<br>
was mixed together, each of them taking more of the other in, shattering again the hold that Nysa's blood had on them, and bringing them closer together bound by the ritual that they shared.<br>
<br>

<br>
This ritual had been carefully planned, as it was delicate. But it worked, and at the end of it, their bond was<br>
closer than ever. A bond that was now more than mistress and slave, more than lovers, more than sisters,<br>
almost as one they would now walk, in spite of love or hate, friendship or estrangement, whether near or far. <br>
<br>
Now they belonged to one another. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/12/02 9:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The end of Heartbreak</span><hr size=1> Ayida finished cleaning the armory one more time, lingering over each task, reluctant to finish the job. Her<br>
memories of this place shown starkly in her mind's eye, strangely with the cold pale sunlight of winter, though of course the sun never shone here in Neriak, unlike the place of her childhood.<br>
<br>
She packed up her personal belongings, but left several things on a workbench, small labels attached to them.<br>
<br>
Dalninil was gone. Braellar was gone. As were so many of the others that she had grown to love. And some<br>
were missing. She had tried to wait, to see if Brutaful would return to offer her counsel, or perhaps Shinsyrth.  She had tried to remain, deeply disturbed at the feelings of betrayal, of failure that racked her when she thought of Genashai, of Utilu, and the others still in the House.<br>
<br>
But now her presence felt like that of a corpse at a wedding. The House of Sel'quar was changing, and she<br>
was sure it would survive, possibly be even better for the pain and changes in the long run. But the memories today were bittersweet, and the pain was best exised quickly, before it ran over to others too much. Already the words that Braellar had left ringing in her ears told of the trouble that she was causing by staying in the mood she was in. Perhaps if she'd just left sooner, he would still be here. &quot;No, that was selfish, each person has to make their own choices, Ayida&quot;, she mumbled to herself.<br>
<br>
Finally, everything was ready. She left her gear with the guards at the gate, then returned to the Great Hall, and placed a scroll upon the throne chair. It read:<br>
<br>
(some of the ink has run, as though it got wet.)<br>
<br>
Ilharess Genashai,<br>
<br>
My lady, I beg your permission and your blessing for me to withdraw from this, the House I have loved, at this time. I have things I need to learn, about myself, about the world. And I sincerely believe that I am not<br>
helping the current situation in the House by remaining.<br>
<br>
I ask for your permission and your blessing, because I honor and respect you, and I know that I will still need friends, possibly help, in the world. I am not so arrogant as to believe that I can take it all on myself. And because there remains a possibility that what I am doing now is wrong, and that I may grow to realize it in the future.<br>
<br>
I shall remain available to Sel'quar and all of its people at times, if you desire my company at all after this<br>
weakness and failure that I am exhibiting by placing myself before you today in this manner.<br>
<br>
I should like to think of Sel'quar as my second family, the one I reluctantly left, rather than like my first family that I fled gratefully.<br>
<br>
                            I remain, hopefully, <br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Please,&quot; said Gray, &quot;I don't know what horrible language that is, but switch to Tier'dal&quot;.<br>
<br>
'It's elvish,&quot; grinned Ayida, swapping mental gears to Tier'dal, &quot;ever notice that wood elves and high elves<br>
have the same language. Two races, one language. Now where is the sense in that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Elvish!&quot; gasped Gray in shock and horror, a reaction that Ayida smirked at, &quot;Oh no, don't tell me if you've<br>
been grouping with those, those.... what is wrong with you?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Relax Gray. Let me tell you a little story. I'd been seeking out pixie dust, cinnasticks, and brownie parts<br>
today, and the constant babble of the elves in the Greater Faydark is almost enough to drive one insane. In<br>
all the chatter, I kept hearing one repeat, over and over, &quot;I'm dancing in the bar, will strip for cash. Come see me&quot;. His name was Shokun. Finally I heard him advertise himself as a paladin. A paladin? I sent him a tell asking if he'd really do anything for money, in elvish. He replied to me. .mental bonding with a high elf<br>
(shivers), even on that level is like watching a spider crawl across your skin. . anyway he replied to me that<br>
he would do &quot;almost anything&quot;. <br>
<br>
So I laughed to myself, and told him that I wanted to kill him for money. That I got a &quot;kick&quot; out of killing<br>
paladins, it's a fetishlike activity of mine. After some penny-ante negotiation, I offered him 20 platinum for the attempt at killing him. He eagerly agreed at that point, the poor pathetic thing. What a sad excuse for a<br>
paladin. Still, he's technically one of them, and one I intend to mention to every paladin I meet, hopefully to<br>
their everlasting shame.<br>
<br>
I met him by the Druid ring, right up against Kelethin. His jaw dropped when he realized I was Tier'dal.<br>
I asked him his rank, and was informed that he had reached the 10th dais of his Order. He then challenged<br>
me.<br>
<br>
Then I switched weapons to my lance, and he literally moaned in terror. By that time however, he had already initiated the duel. I quickly poked the lance through his joints at his hips and at his shoulders to disable him from getting away, and the proceeded to kick him to death. He kept trying to heal and heal and heal, but I was slowly gaining on him with my kicks, and having him *help* to extend his own pain was vastly amusing.<br>
<br>
Others, mostly wood elves, were wandering by. Several screamed and ran, and one threatened to bring his<br>
guards. I laughed and continued kicking Shokun to death, crippling each limb, hearing the bones crack, ruining his face and features, watching his entire body arch as I did flying kicks into his groin, then even after he fell down I placed my plated boot upon his chest and slowly pressed down until his ribs began to crack, then I kicked him once more under the jaw, hearing his neck snap.<br>
<br>
I leaned down close to him, him barely alive, and slipped the 20 pp into his gasping mouth, then with one<br>
stomp I crushed his chest and watched him die.<br>
<br>
So yes, when I met you here on the borders of Mistmoore, I'd been speaking Elvish, my mind still grasping the tendrils of that encounter, lingering on it like the dregs of a fine wine, watching the rivulets in the glass slowly etch toward the rim to drop into my mouth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayida smiled at Gray warmly, and they proceeded into Mistmoore, as he shook his head at the slight elf. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uayida.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayida</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The sexy slave warrior~<br> Tank Girl~</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/12/02 9:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/frage81292frm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Afterward: </span><hr size=1> This volume of my history is complete.
