I went up to SoL with Ichi hitting many zones which were &lt;40 and ran smack dab into hard Lag.  I went back and turned everything i could in options off, dropped all my stuff like I would on a 60 person NToV raid and STILL had hard lag.... I realize my comp isnt God's gift to computer gaming but it does excede the requirements to play SoL.  <br>
<br>
Im just wondering if it is certain zones, if it is more people than just me, and whether or not anyone knows if they are trying to fix it.<br>
<br>
I put my butt-hair from lvl 60 warrior on my old server on and ran up to The Grey and fought for 3 hours without a lick of lag.  But in the Grim Forest Ichi moved and fought like her was in Warslick Woods.  <br>
<br>
I cant believe that they wanted an entire expansion of Zones that were lagged like Warslick Woods!<br>

Any input?<br>

I had the same problem just this weekend when I tried to introduce my friend to Everquest.  At my first glance, every thing on his computer were up to par with the latest requirements.  broad band connection, 512 mb of ram, a PIII 800 mhz, a decent video card....but lord and behold, he started as a troll warrior and his troll was moving like a 90 yr old granma on two walking sticks in Grobb.  The rest of the game is fairly acceptable, quick zone time, quick load time....so I conclude that it was his video card that was the problem.  I do get the feeling that it seems ever since SOL came out, GForce video card is the only way to ensure a tolorable environment.<br>

I was in Gfay off and on all weekend.  Monday I tried to pick a fight with the whole zone it seemed and I could find an elf, gnome or dorf who would come and &quot;hang out&quot; with me.  It was quite frustrating.  I roleplayed with some of the locals and mentioned a few insults hopeing that they knew some bigger friends who may be passing through the zone... but no luck.  I will be passing through there again soon and I would be happy to dance the Death Dance with ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think it's EQ reading texture off your hard drive vice putting it in memory.<br>

I've had this problem In Dalnir, Uguk, Sol A, and Cazic all post Luclin. <br>

Anyway exitting EQ then restarting it seems to fix the problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uevangelinanife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evangelina Nife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 404<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/26/01 12:30:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/allencraig1/Syll4.jpg width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lag in SoL</span><hr size=1>    I have the exact same Framerate problem.  It hits me in Upper Guk and Feerot.  The first time I enter the zone, it's fine, no framerate probs, etc.<br>
<br>
   But every time I rezone into them (like if I go from Uguk to Lguk, then back to Uguk) I start getting crazy framerate problems.  Every time I rezone it gets progressively worse until I have to reboot.<br>
<br>
   Currently I'm having this problem where things run smoothly for about 10 minutes, then for the next 5 minute, my computer starts seizing up.  It'll be smooth for like 2 seconds, then sieze up for half a second.  Rinse &amp; repeat.  It's hella annoying and wrecks havoc on my twisting.  It happens to me in both Warsilisk woods and Overthere.  I haven't been in any other zones in the last few days so I'm not sure if the problem is occurring elsewhere.<br>

The ping (green bar) seems fine and I'll be in a zone that isn't usually laggy for me, but my framerate will go down anyway. It's happened most often in Freeport and seems to happen regardless of quantity of players in zone or overall server population. Sometimes it seems I need to log all the way out and close down my system to get the problem to clear. Fortunately it doesn't happen very often.<br>
<br>
The problem almost seems as if something will go horribly wrong when it loads textures upon zone-in and it will cause a huge memory leak that snags all your ram.<br>
<br>
It's happening to some of my friends too. A friend and I were hunting in Rathe Mountains and decided to take a language-learning break. We began zone-dancing back and forth between Lake Rathe and Rathe Mountains and suddenly my buddy's framerate went all to hell in Rathe Mountains. Again, his ping was fine, my ping was fine, the zone seemed fine and had the same people in it...just all of a sudden as he zoned back into it again for the fifth time, his framerate went crappy.<br>
<br>
Maybe I've noticed this in Freeport because I always have a tendency to go through all the zones multiple times, to visit the different merchants. It almost seems like re-loading zones you've already been in, could be what sets this off.<br>

<br>
Win98, Win98se and WinME all have the same problems with &gt;512mb.<br>
<br>
(somone said it was 256 so i had to check)<br>
<br>
basically anything over 512 cant be addressed properly without manually setting VCache. Wich is not what you want to do for performance reasons. With graphics cards that have increaseing ram you start running into problems with 512mb+ so that could account for a small amount of problems here.<br>
<br>
On the 'frame rate bug' i always had it but now i can produce it every day pretty much, and its a pain. I am trying to figure out what is doing it but its not working so far.<br>
<br>
From what i understand the framerate but was memory leaks, as you zoned out... and worked fine, zone back and the zone is even worse than before. After testing this it gets progressivly worse until i cannot use the mouse and have to /sit /camp desktop and restart the main exe.<br>
<br>
Like dal said, its probably nailed it on the head, i am not the most fluent in how windows resouces its memory, dont get me wrong i work in this field and am rather good at it... but you are looking at more of a progaming role/microsoft software development... wich is not my field.<br>
I think it may be cached zones... as i get this every day now... and it happened once i turned the texture cache on, wich i havent though about until now.<br>
<br>
I didnt have SoL when it first came out, being in the uk i couldnt get it shipped because of the date, but i managed to get a copy from Amazon's uk site, wich came rather quick.<br>
(verants uk distrubuters are non-existent)<br>
I never had the framerate bug while upgraded with the patches... when i get sol i think i had it once and that was it... i enable texture cache... bam get it every time i re-zone.<br>
<br>
Logging out of eq.. does this clean the cache area? i presume it is in way, as once you log on it caches a zone... so next time you hit that place it uses the version on your hard disk, you /q out and you have to redownload that zone to hardisk when you next enter it... thats how i understand it.<br>
<br>
Places that i frequently get the problem:<br>
Upper guk (not lower)<br>
Solusek B<br>
Cazic Thule<br>
Innorhule Swamp<br>
Warlisk Woods<br>
<br>
These are the main zones i get if i run through a 2nd, time.. fine once i zone.. try to rezone and bam major lag bugs.<br>
<br>
I will disable texture cache over weekend and see if that helps me somewhat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=191.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=191.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=191.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=191.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=191.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
