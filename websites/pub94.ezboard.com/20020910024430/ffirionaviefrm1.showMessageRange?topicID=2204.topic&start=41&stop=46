I can even prove some fella follows my god when I need ta,real simple. Say ya wanted ta join a guild I was in,an' ya had ta worship Innoruuk ta get in.<br>

Here's an imbued Idol of Innoruuk. Ya say ya worship Him?<br>
 <br>
Equip this an' prove it. Or fer that matter,lemme get an imbued silver sapphire necklace made. Might be cheaper. Same result. Some folk got it even cheaper. Silver jade or amber is right cheap. :P<br>
An' in case yer wondering,t'application fee is five hundred platinum,paid _in advance_ in case ya decided ta scoot with m'idol...deposit returned when t'idol is. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
There are a lot of things my character does that I don't roleplay through or are done in an 'abbreviated' from do to game mechanics.<br>
<br>
If someone where to ask me IC if I had a weapon to sell and I happened to be carrying a dark weaver, I would show it to them in a trade window. The other player could then look at it, then deside if its something that his character would like. We could do this and stay completely IC.<br>
<br>
But if I go to the Bazaar and /auc or use the market channel, then that is OOC. What my character is doing is setting up a stall so passerby's can see my wares. Currently the game mechanics don't support PC venders, so this is used to accomplish that effect. If I /auc a dark weaver with its stats thats OOC. IC the buyer came to my stall, saw the weapon, tested it out (to see if its well balanced and if he felt he knew how to use it).<br>
<br>
It would be great if EQ supported IC shopping but it doesn't. The game engine is about killing things not shopping, There are a lot of things about your character that you never see,  do to limitations of the engine. There is a house in her hometown where she grew up and her parents live.When travelling to her hometown she would probably stop there and say hello, perhaps get a home cooked meal. Her guild would have a meeting hall were they all got together and discussed the stuff  you're hearing in /GUILD now. Etc... All this stuff would exist if you wrote a story about your character and wanted to flesh it out to give her character, but you'll never see it in game.<br>

Many of us are of a nuetral alignment and for the most part we perfer if the polar alignments keep it to a low rumble (unless its highly entertaining and amusing then have at it).<br>
<br>
So find yerself a nice nuetral character (rogues by their nature and abilities tend to veiw the world pragmaticaly) and arrange a transfer of the item. There are also some very good IC ways to view this and incorporate it (use your imagination). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 753<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/28/02 1:44:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2204.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is Evils trading with Goods hypocritical?</span><hr size=1> Cylria,<br>
<br>
I understand and agree with that point.  My point was really more directed to the POV that said &quot;You may be selling to me OOC but for me it is still IC&quot;  So if I'm like Count Evil, and they are like Granny Goodness, and I sell them a Happy Love Bracer, they'd be all like &quot;Count Evil isn't so evil after all, he's just a big sweetie.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's just dumb :-p<br>
<br>
I agree with your points about there being a difference between IC Knowledge and OOC Knowledge - BUT, as many others have pointed out, without a DM/GM to tell you which is which it is impossible to set a 'standard.'  Maybe everyone DOES know what an item is and who can use it by simple examination - There isn't anything in the game to suggest otherwise.<br>
<br>
I'm all for people playing as they see fit, but at least let's be honest with ourselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubraellarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braellarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/02 7:12:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2204.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bah</span><hr size=1> Most items in EQ have a limited graphic... and hence there name is actually there description.<br>
<br>
There are some wepons that are different this and armor.<br>
<br>
Take for a few examples:<br>
<br>
Langseax/seax - wasnt an seax a daggar and langseax was a refference obviously long-daggar.. it's a two handed sword just that they used a generic sword to represent it.<br>
<br>
Bloodmoon - a curved blade, a one handed sythe really... moon refering to a blade almost sickle like, sounds a nasty piece of work to me. And ended up with a sythe model like the ones in the warrens.<br>
<br>
For a start how would you know what certain items are and dont go about the who would use thing... take some shadowknight armor for instance.<br>
Dark forge, Umbral, Bloodember, Dark runed... all are dark shades and colors or have a reference to there makeing.<br>
Bloodember - dark red the color of blood, ember i presume is a reference to it's forging... i mean if you run upto a pair of greaves that looked like they mixed baked blood into the finish and metalwork... would you even pick them up let alone try to sell them... who the heck do you think would be buying them in the first place! yuk.<br>
<br>
And if you saw that armor you think you wouldnt tell anyone... down the bar with all your friends and it comes up in conversation.. or the bards have not heard of it.. if i play a shadowknight i make it an effort to know both the holy items of my deity as well as oposed deitys.<br>
<br>
And personally i cannot destroy items even if they were for a good race, there are people behind there characters and it will probably give them much more fun than i get out of destroying it and saying &quot;ahh another foul paladin blade smelted to make dairy spoons what a profitable day&quot;.<br>

I wanna know what your all drinkin...must be good stuff for all the stuffy heads around here..<br>
<br>
OOC:<br>
<br>
Well, simple question deserves a simple answer. It's up to you as the player to decide if it's bad RP or not. Not anyone else.<br>
<br>
Sorean doesn't care one way or another if he buys or sells to an evil, and I won't say that it's ooc of him or me to do so. The same thing goes for a good character as well. As long as they don't openly defile the forest, disgrace Tunare, or one of the other things I've set as his personal code, then he doesn't have a problem with them.<br>
<br>
It's all up to how you want to play it-just don't sit there and point a finger saying it's bad RP to do this or that. Just coz you see it as bad rp, doesn't mean that person does. Just coz your character feels strongly against it, doesn't mean you have to. And don't sit there and try to say that game mechanics are or aren't known to characters either. How do you know? I've never seen anything saying that our characters don't know the limits of their strength/mana/level/etc.<br>
<br>
Really, it's just like I said before, you decide if your character &quot;knows&quot; these things or not. There isn't a set rule about it, or a mediator to say &quot;Your character does not know this&quot;. Who's to say Sorean doesn't know that a dark elf walking around with a dark glowing sword in black armor is a shadow knight? Who is it to say he knows? Simple-me.<br>
