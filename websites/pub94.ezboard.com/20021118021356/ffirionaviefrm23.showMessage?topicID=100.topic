i have no god.  i'm not even sure what that means.  everyone around here seems to follow one, but i've never understood the point.  i've seen shadowknights of Innoruuk and paladins of Tunare slaughter the same undead minions side by side, and still have a battle with each other over who is more 'right' afterwards.  <br>
<br>
besides, people kill these so-called 'gods' all the time, then boast about the things that littered the bodies afterwards.  if a god is a supreme being, how do you kill one?<br>
<br>
i can do without gods just fine, thanks.  if you need one to survive, then please worship them in peace.  but do not preach to me over a fine bottle of stout, and ruin my enjoyment with your self-righteousness. <br>

The soft skins who &quot;worship&quot; our lord know nothing of him, so know that whatever they say is false. Now then...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The ways of Fear are cold, harsh, and extremely effective. Fear can be used for many things, from controlling ones enemies to keeping order in your own ranks. Through the properly applied use of fear, ones society can be greatly strengthened. By enforcing strict laws and orders, those who are corrupt are much more easily weeded out, and those who could be tainted with corruption are often too intimidated to do so. Those who are lazy and weak will often strive to become efficent and strong, knowing full well should they not they will be disposed of. Through spreading fear, one can greatly reduce the strength of ones enemies and defeat them much more easily. Through spreading fear, we appease and strengthen our lord, and help to establish order amongst a chaotic world. And do not all creatures use a form of fear? Is not law in itself a use of fear? All creatures use fear to enforce order and thier brand of justice, but few are willing to give up the few personal pleasures required to truly create a great society.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But fear is not the only tool of those of us who follow Cazic-Thule. Suffering and Pain are as well. Life is suffering, one cannot deny this. Throughout our lives we endure countless hardships, trials, aches and anguish. But we Iksar, instead of hiding from such pain, embrace it. We learn from our mistakes, and the pain we feel in our lives. By embracing the pain of our lives and the mistakes we make, we can strengthen ourselves and overcome our weaknesses, we can learn from our mistakes so that we may never make them again, and become both physically stronger, and wiser. Suffering is only somthing to be feared if one cannot learn from it. And just so you soft skins don't get confused, I am not saying we stab ourselves just to feel pain. That would be foolish. Pain is not pleasant. It is educational. Through spreading pain to the weaker races, we rid this world of those who breed weakness and chaos, and help strengthen Norrath as a whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We Iksar are the masters of Fear, not the victims to it. Through spreading fear and Cazic-Thule's will this entire world shall scream in anguish as the chaotic and horrid state Norrath is in dies, and a new world, one without war or hatred, one ruled through fear and strict order, is born. And that world, under the rulership of the Iksar and Cazic-Thule, shall be Norrath's greatest era.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;Chaos breeds hatred, weakness, selfishness, and distrust. If there is no order or regulations creatures freely pursue their own selfish desires with no concern of others, or lounge around lazily indulging pleasures, since there is nothing to enforce thier participation, and complain whenever they get swept up in things. One spreads selfishness, the other spreads weakness. Since creatures are free to selfishly do as they please, those who they disagree with, or those who do not desire to live amongst such selfish swine, will eventually come to hate them, and eachother. Since one can never truly trust another due to this openly accepted indulgence of selfishness, the &quot;society&quot; becomes distrustful of itself and turns upon itself, or sometimes spends many centuries merely wallowing in it's infighting. This...chaos, is often appealing to those who seek power merely for themselves. Thus the reason nearly all soft skins choose to live this way. Thier natures are selfish.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But for those who live for somthing greater then themselves and seek to strengthen not just themselves, but their entire race, such as my people, it is abhorable. Only the selfish or insane seek chaos.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Does that answer your question?&quot;<br>

But I think the main difference is that he sees the structure of the world as the mostest important of all, and I see the peoples instead.  He sees the inherent tendency toward selfishness and hurtiness in the individual, while I see the inherent tendency toward wisdom and joy.  He sees that you hafta FORCE the world to get where it needs to go, and I see that you CAN'T force it, it has ta be an individual choice for everyone.<br>
<br>
But I think the main difference comes to how we view the world itself.  He says life is suffering.  I say life is joy.  And from those very teeny little differences in how we see life, it makes our larger differences where they are.<br>
<br>
And that's what religion is.  Tiny differences in approach that make for the huge differences that make the whole world a hotbed of conflict between the fanatics, with the vast sea of those who just want to survive caught in between. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 817<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/22/02 12:28:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Malice</span><hr size=1> Simple enought, I enjoy hurting others.

In the end, regardless of what you do or where you go, you use violence to get there, and gain power as a result. Everything falls on one of two sides-either the strong or the weak.<br>
<br>
If you are strong, then you rule the weak. If you are weak, you try to undermine the strong or live in your proper station as prey. Only the strong are fit to rule, and if they are undermined then they are not really strong to begin with. Their strength is only an illusion.<br>
<br>
Tunare-a waste of time for worship. Yes yes, she created the elves. So? Just because she created the race I was born to, means I should bow down and kiss the ethereal ground she walks on? Just because the idiots in the Faydark champions think balance is the right path and nature is some peacefull serene place I should as well?<br>
<br>
I think not. Violence is the path to truth. Truth is power, and everything else is just a way to mask it or hide behind some philosophy that justifies your way of thinking. Without power the world is a stale, stagnant place where lemmings and sheep run free. You can try to say that because you are a certain race you are right. You can hide behind your dogma and insist you are right. You can hide and deny the truth all day and night. But in the end, it's power that everyone seeks.<br>
<br>
Power over nature. Power over death. Power over others. Power over life. No matter what you claim, you seek to have power over something. Claim whatever you wish. In the end, it's power you seek. Only the weak would lie to even themselves on that, no less everyone else. Gods can and have died before. Power is truly immortal. <p><BR>

Power like that is meant for one thing, Destruction. War. Use it to fight, to kill, to Destroy, then once you begin this circle.. once you see the Death..<br>

others will see it as well.. and they will Fear you. Yes they shall.<br>

Out of their Fear, they will hate you. Kill those that Hate your horrible power, and the Circle begins again. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A>

Without the power, none of your circle makes sense or is worth time. <br>
<br>
Power is used to cull the weak with your wars and death. <br>
<br>
Power brings out fear in others.<br>
<br>
People hate because they don't have the power you hold, and because you have more power than them. Or, you hate them because they have more power than you.<br>
<br>
Without power, your circle is meaningless. Without violence, none of your circle is possible. The only means to gaining power is through violence, your wars and death. Hate and fear are the natural by-products of power. <p><BR>

<br>
What will you use your power and Violence for? Its all in what you use it for that makes the Circle go round.<br>
<br>
Use that power to destroy what those hold dear, espically involding Love, and you shall find that the Circle will be yours. But use that power in the path way of light..<br>
<br>
And you will find your power, bringing Peace, bringing Light, and dispelling Fear.<br>
<br>
Power is the Tool of the fighter. <br>
<br>
My Power. I use it to kill those that do not Stand and play a Role within the Dark Circle. Those that do not play a role shall be a Victum of it. <br>
<br>
Kimaya however, she has no power. So she tries to lull the power of the fighter with worthless Charms, Stupid annoying Pixies, Cookies, and Skimpy Dressing. These lulls only lure in the weak.<br>
<br>
Gavin.. his power. He uses it to bring Light and Peace. His power, he wishes for it to bring happyness in the world. That is his power.<br>
<br>
So, thats how it goes. The Choice is yours how you use power. Its NOT only the tool of the circle, but it can be used (or not) for whatever cause. Its the mana in the spell. Burn it.<br>

<br>
What will I use my power and violence for? Simple.<br>
<br>
I will be the lioness in the jungle called Norrath. I will crush those weaker than myself. I will burn cities to the ground, and slay the gods themselves. What do I seek power for? To be strong. What will I use violence for? To show my strength, and make others tremble when my name is uttered. To have them scatter as a flock of birds when the lion roars.<br>
<br>
All this talk of &quot;light&quot; and this &quot;circle&quot; you speak of are meaningless. The only true purpose for power is to crush those weaker than you. You are stronger-you kill what is beneath you. Not in perceived levels of power, but in their soul.<br>
<br>
As you stated-it is the &quot;mana&quot; of the spell. Without power, everything is useless and weak. You rely on it, and crave it. This circle of yours is your way of expressing your desire for power and need to exert violence. That is fine-I don't care about other's philosophical need to justify themselves. Most can't handle the truth of themselves, or what they seek. <p><BR>
