<br>
&quot;How arrogant to think you are the only Teir'Dal to know the depths of love, Genashai.  How very arrogant you are, as you stand here proclaiming you are the sole Teir'Dal to know what it is.  You've naut fallen far from the Father's tree, even if you think you have.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arrogance is bred in Neriak, as surely as is Hate.  And you, my lady, have arrogance in spades.  A true child of Neriak.  So, you think this love of a Feir'Dal has changed you?  Perhaps so.  I do naut doubt your words when you say you feel love for him.  But to use that love in this fashion...you slander it.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It has become your banner, your war cry, your shield.  'Look at me!  I'm in love!  Love I tell you!  I'm special!'  Please...<br>
<br>
&quot;The only Teir'dal to admit to the depths of love...&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn laughs. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;You are unique, Genashai, I'll give you that.  Your overlarge ego makes that truth.  It's palpable, like a large hound that follows you everywhere.  Be careful it does naut turn to sink it's teeth into your leg, eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The priestess stands, moving out into the light of the tavern, the black chain encasing her gleaming in the firelight.  She crosses her arms and stares at the magess.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Love does make one weak, as Shintou claims.  When you use it as you do now, at least.  Perhaps you've more to learn about this depth of emotion you think you've mastered?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn snickers softly, and moves to the door.  She pauses in the opening, turning back to the room.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Arrogant fools often get their just desserts, my lady Genashai.  Ponder that when you're in the arms of your love.  I once thought as you do, and then my love was tested.  Sorely tested...&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kerridwynn looks at Sarhea, and smiles slightly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;In the end, my love is naut a banner to be waved, or a cry to be shouted to the heavens.  It is the warmth of a fire on a cold night, the quiet cry of passion shivering to silence on the breeze, the joy of coming home at last, and the eternal promise that I am naut alone.  I do naut need to proclaim to the world that I know love...it is enough that I have it.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is where we differ, child of Neriak.  Enjoy your days.&quot;<br>

I am saying I have no hatred mingled with what Teirdal call love for each other. I tell you Do i plan on consorting with other light bringers? Nau, I will not. For they are still enemies to others like me, and in holding fast their hands in friendship, I hold their enemies unto my own. But to one i vow to love, it is pure. It is of itself, and nothing more. I tell you this, Jalil, Nau, the love of a wood elf did not change me. I will tell you what changed me. It took my husband of a score or more years turning on me, and attacking me. It took the ripping of my heart from my chest and shreadding it to peices and then stomping on it. It took this same man's hateful words and attack on me very soul that made me recoil and examine what it was I had claimed as love and how it had become my mantra.  <br>
<br>
You stand there and accuse me of being arrogant and having an over large ego and as a youth and Matron I will confess, I did have such an ego.  I will also admit to using those around me to meet and cater to my needs. That was all I knew, it had been drilled into my head.  When I found myself without the house around me, I turned to my husband, i swallowed my pride, my upbringing and i went to him and joined his allegegance. I took up his cause. So now I have neither house, nor husband. I have only my pride, my resourcefulness, and knack for knowing how to make others happy. You dare judge me, you dare accuse me of extraordinary arrogance, I tell you, jalil, You do not know me. <br>
<br>
*glancing up to sarhea* You know my mind, sarhea, of disdain for you, caused by Shintou's action, I no longer have any. I realized long ago, you were no enemy to me, nor were you ever. Of morgrist..know that we remain friends, for the memory of the bond we shared, the loss we suffered, and the future we were denied. <br>
<br>
*she takes a drink of her mead, and turns to face the room once more* I did not mean to sound as if I were using what I have found as a banner, as some token to show around and elicit a response from you. Really, I only wanted to say, I have picked myself back up, while battered and bruised, and continue to walk my path. At my side, from now on will be a quiet wood elf who held my hand as I wept and wondered why the man I'd pledged myself to had treated me so cruely.  No longer will I care for the acceptance of my people, or make decisions based on what you feel is best for my welfare. <br>
<br>
I stand here a woman, a Teir'dal, a mage. of those three things I am certain. The rest I am sorting out as I come to it.  <p><br>

Once, i cared what you thought, what you said. I believed the drivel you spill. I'm no lightbringer, I&quot;m no evil dark elf. If the truth of it should be said, then I'm a neutral. I stand in that gray area between both worlds, and have for so long searched for a way to fit in. To find a place that i belonged.  There is no truth in his softening my heart, for by your own words, it was far too soft long ago.  <br>
<br>
*she takes a deep breath, trying to steady the anger you see burning in her eyes* I think perhaps i should change my earlier statement, that i no longer had any hate inside me. For now, as I look at you standing here condemning me, sentancing me to die and predicting my end, I say before all of you here, I do hate. I hate you Shintou Shinai. I hope every duel you enter, your spells fail, your weapon breaks. I hope your pet turns on you and gouges out your beady ugly little eyes. I lay on your head this curse, May you never know another day of contentment, comfort or pleasure. May you ever be the laughing stock you allready are.  Be proud of yourself, for you have proved I do have some hate left in me, enough to hate you! <p><br>

<br>
Both die the same. Why should I waste my time seperating you? You're nothing but cattle, anyhow. Cattle to be slaughtered by the blade of the Shepard.<br>
<br>
Those who protect the cattle will die like the cattle.<br>
<br>
Why do you bastards continuly expect to excape death by tossing up your hands and crying..<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a Neutral! I'm a Neutral!&quot; <br>
<br>
Look upon me. Is this a face that cares?  At least the Paladins and those that are truly 'Light' are willing to put up a battle, but you cowardly wreches sneak about and leech power off of others, all the while using the melting pot of race and religion to gain your worthless power, all the while bringing peace and harmony to the world, more then any Paladin ever could. Just look at your very own words. You claimed to lose your hate and fallen for this elven cattle.  Light, peace, and love has settled within you, and from that you have lost your darkness. No longer are you a child of Innoruuk, but you're just another of Tunares bastard children.<br>
<br>
Yet you try to play this neutralic card. It doesn't work here, woman. This is for anyone. Neutralic fools will die right alongside the lightbringers, for you bring more light in the world then most of the Paladins about here.<br>
<br>
The moment you realize this, the faster your collective deaths shall be. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> League Of Shadows</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Nay! Lady Genashai . The husband you say abused you so badly after so many years of your devotion to him, tells a different story. His tears wet my shoulder day after day in his grief and longing for you.Yet your heart was cold to him and upon your learning of his dependance on my support did you not decide to take that which was mine?  Namely the said Wood Elf so recently my lover. You can not deny you knew he was mine, for did you not ask me if I had taken your past Lord to my bed?  I did say  it was not so, for at the time this was true indeed. Did I not tell you that I loved the Wood Elf with a burning passion that you had seen for your own eyes many times. Yet you pursued him.<br>
Now knowing  where my love was when he was not at my side  I wonder.....  did you not feel any pangs of regret at the harm and the pain you were causing me...who had tried to be friend to you?<br>
You may wish my lover's heart for the moment, but know this  thing, Lady. He who is untrue to one woman will be untrue to another. He will try to return to me, of that I have no doubt.<br>
While your Lord's tears have dried on my cloak, his need  for me has grown and I admit I am warmed in my own grief with the love he now bears me, and although I did not seek to have this happen, when grief meets grief, comfort may turn to love.<br>
Know one thing more. The Wood Elf denies any love for you other then what is in your own head and states that he still loves me. Why only one day past,  he said we would would marry and I would wear his name. I know not what to believe. I wish to accept his word that there is nothing between the two of you but will not take him back to my bed if the words he whispers in both our ears are mere falsehoods.<br>
While I ponder these things, I shall continue to care and cherish that which you have lost, for this Knight's devotion to me is open and clear and full of promise and hope for the future. I will not lie to him or he to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=genashai>Genashai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/9/03 1:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Real Love</span><hr size=1> Deleted. my apologies to the population for making something private, public. <br>

&quot;And to you, Genashai, I DO understand your feelings for I am married to a Feir' Dal, but for the respect of your own self, don't allow yourself to fall victim to such a strong emotion and become blinded by it. Love, of course, but don't allow it to consume you. The one thing said here that struck a cord and is so very true is... you are who you are - a child of Innoruuk. You will always have hatred in your heart, that is a given. Best of luck, Genashai. It's a hard road to walk.&quot;<br>

Having heard so many tales of lost love and woe, he wonders how she carries on.

She smiles softly, lifts her head around to meet his eyes with a tender fondness and places her hand upon his.<br>
<br>
She breaks the silence , but speaks gently and with only a hint of sadness and none of anger.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was  foolish  Gio.  I did not listen to my head when it told me that the druid's passion for me had faded. Rather I heard his words that I was an unreasonably jealous woman, whose fears were unfounded that his sweet words were not for my ears alone.<br>
Yet how strange it is that now knowing the truth I am able to put him from my mind as unworthy of my tears&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There will now be a new Lord at our table, a sharp blade to assist my battles and a love to lift my soul, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with renewed passion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Perhaps now Gio, I shall find that contentment of mind and satisfaction of body, the belief in the obtainment of which, has been the reason I have been able to carry on, despite so many disappointments and mistakes.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turns her head from Gio's and looks towards the opened door where stands the figure of a strong Teir 'Dal Shadow Knight and her face blossoms with radience. His eyes burn into hers sending messages of desire and love stronger then she has known for many years.<br>
<br>
She rises from the stool and as he takes her hand in his and gently kisses her fingers, she beams a smile at him then turns to introduce him to Giovannii.<br>
<br>
&quot; It is time my Lord, for you to meet my adopted son, Giovannii Armourax, blood son of my first husband and only recently the discoverer of his Lineage&quot;<br>
