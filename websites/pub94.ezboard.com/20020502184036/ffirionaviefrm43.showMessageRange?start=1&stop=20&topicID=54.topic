Many ferget that, and ferget that is is often VERY hard to get agro off another without that skill.

Gotta wait fer the puppy ta beat on it fer a bit and then back down.  (Of course, most just cast ANOTHER major spell and get agro again.)

However, there are quite a few spells we get almost from the start that serve well in that regard. Flash of Light, Tainted Breath, and especially Drowsy generate a lot of hate. Chain-casting one of these (easily done due to the low mana cost) can work quite well in getting a mob off someone it shouldn't be on. I wouldn't recommend using this technique to play main tank in a group, though, because our weapon delay resets after casting as the other hybrids used to do. Chain-casting in that situation would mean a lot of swings lost, and may even cost the main tank the aggro he's been working so hard to keep.<br><br>Khiraz Spiritbinder<br>Patriarch of Cabilis<br>Skathris Ven'Sho <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhoraciofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HoracioFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/21/02 6:44:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> strange thing</span><hr size=1> I was wondering if the pet and the beastlord are on the same hate list.

For some reason Vothe (51 bst) seem's to gain agro and is almost imposible to taunt off of him. I don't have my damage turned on but I find it hard to belive he would be dealing SO much damage with just himself to generate the kind of hate he dose. The only thing I can figure is that his damage and his warders damage both transfer hate onto himself. Not to mention his warder was casting also.. but since the warder itself dose not agro if PC's are in meele dose that hate transfer to the BST?. Its not that he dosnt take a licking and keep on ticking.. but it dose tend to throw the healers into a frenzy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Mabey if I can find out how the agro is gained by said BST I can figure out a way to keep it from happening.

Alone, without their Warder, a Beastlord is more useless then OOM Wizard.  They would get clobbered toe to toe with most things they are going to try and tank after level 40.  Now if they are not getting hit and they are just adding their own damage to the mob then they are nice because even without a warder they do a little more damage then Bards Melee.  If you’re in a raid or large encounter and the Beastlord is tanking with no pet, someone better be hitting the evac button.<br><br>Now a Beastlord and its warder are a different story.  That little pet is one tough SOB.  Me a level 35 Monk at the time took out a level 37 Beastlord without his pet in the Bazaar arena in under a minute.  I then fought the warder and had to use mend to finish it.  I could not of defeated the warder if the Beastlord was healing it.<br><br>It’s these reasons that Beastlords are great in XP groups or solo and suck ass on raids.<br><br>So to answer the question about tanking in-groups, if the Beastlords pet is tanking then it’s good.  If the Beastlord is tanking without the pet after 40 then it’s bad.  You may as well let an Enchanter pet tank rather then a lone Beastlord.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvothe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vothe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/22/02 11:46:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bioware.com/_global/images/sidenav/tob_icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: beastlords.. tanks?</span><hr size=1> Here's the deal.

Draw very little aggro due to the spreading of damage between BL and warder. <br>Check out the spells Savagery and Spiritual Purity, you might want the first one cast on you since it stacks with I think everything, SP stacks with all clarity spells in the line and all cleric spells, but does not stack with druids PotC I believe. Yes, we do suck at taking damage at higher levels just as any other non tank class. <br>I do agree that if we are not allowed to use our warder we are a little low on the damage output, but we can have our pets in places where other classes get a NoNo since it is a BUFF and can be clicked off at any time. we have the spell Summon Companion and with firm control over the /pet back off button we can have pretty good control over what it does. Ok, it isn't fool proof, but a BL that hasn't learned to control his pet by that level should try something else.<br>BL as tank i would have to say Only if there is NO other melee availiable and we would need some healing to be kept alive. We should tank no more than you want the rogue to tank.<br><br>Oh and last.. i believe our pet has an unresistable stun procc to be used too, i'll have to see if it is when i get to that level. <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=77883" target="new"><img src="http://www.idevarlden.com/pr00/hsn/sheerz.jpg" border="0"></a><br>Sheerz, Iksar Beastlord of Prophetic Alliance<br>and Scary Puppy</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhatha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Khati Sha</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/7/02 6:11:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://darklance.freewebspace.com/images/rhatha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: beastlords.. tanks?</span><hr size=1> I can tank for short periods, but I wouldn't want to tank over almost any other melee.  But, if need be,I can.  Certainly not as good as other hybrids, but well enough.  Block is the biggest reason for this.  Even though BL wear only leather, they do have an ac bonus that's rather nice and makes up for a lot of the difference.  To me, the AC isn't as big an issue as the hp, which is where other classes are better.  Put me next to a same level warrior, similar quality gear, yes, the warrior will likely have better AC, but it should be fairly close.  But the hp difference is what sets them apart.<br><br>In typical groups, I see the bst as a wild card.. can play caster, slow, dot, then melee; can do pure melee using spells like sicken and flash of light to taunt off casters, can keep adds occupied with flash or pet, can be secondary melee.  It would be a rare group indeed that has bst as a main tank, and never as a (combat) healer. However, given the right group, it could be done.  It just won't be as efficient.<br><br>Anyhow, I'm rambling now.  Can we tank?  Yes.  Can we tank as well as warriors?  No.  I'd say, better than bard (this is definitely true, I play with bards all the time), worse than most others. <p>-----------------------------<BR><A HREF='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=112438'>Rhatha Swiftpaw</A> and Swiftclaw<BR>37th season Khati Sha and Warder<BR><A HREF='http://darklance.freewebspace.com/index.html'>Rhatha's Lair</A><BR><A HREF='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=161417'>Fhara Sha</A><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utirgaswiftpaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tirga swiftpaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/02 3:00:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://technuhemera.hypermart.net/newspro/Portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: beastlords.. tanks?</span><hr size=1> Hey!

We lack defensive skills though but can make up for it with some good ol fasion plate armor. Most Bards don't though, they concentrate on our other abilities such as Mezmerization and charming. I would put them (and I beleive it was stated officialy somewhere else) that bards and beastlords are about in the same area in terms of melee and damage takeing ability. Of course me and Rhatha could work on these figures a bit ourselves (after I get the 20+ points of defence I am trying to aquire from Needlites....

I hit for up to 60 proc for 50...pet quads for 53, kicks for 25 and procs for 60. those of you who think BST have no high end game or suck on raids...I only have 1 word for you. NEWB. I have VERY good pet control, and if someone says no pets...I say you have a small mind. I have worked with pet classes on raids MANY times, the ones that can't control pets are the ones who play warriors and run around , or clerics who tank instead of medding and go oom, or the caster who always overagros. If you watch what you pet is doing you do just fine. and can easily correct Any deviations. Btw My warder walked with me into chardok.......Almost to king, b4 we had to leave (because of time).
