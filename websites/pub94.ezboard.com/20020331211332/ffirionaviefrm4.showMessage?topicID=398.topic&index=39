<br>
Actually that's not what I said.  What I said was to also remember that people may have some RP ideals that mean a /slight/ sacrifice in efficiency.<br>
<br>
A Shadow Knight can be a fine puller.  If that fits the SKs role and he is reasonably good at it should he NOT do it just because it doesn't fit the 'model?'<br>
<br>
When I played a Cleric I didn't melee.  I don't melee with my Wizard either.  But if I did and someone told me to stop being stupid and med I'd probably be somewhat offended.  No one is talking about having people go willy-nilly with Warriors insisting on being Main Healer with Bind Wounds.  What this thread has been discussing are the minutiae of Efficiency - I can see the next logical step being whether Warriors should Dual Wield or use 2HS.  One might be a tad better than the other in certain situations and with certain weapons, but on this server more than others I'd be tolerant of Personal Preference moreso than on other servers.<br>
<br>
Steeltoe - I do agree with many of your assessments, all I wished to add was the caveat that Fun has a place next to efficiency :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 4:42:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Oh, you want general?</span><hr size=1> As a Druid who groups almost as often as he solos, I'd like to chime in here.<br>
<br>
First off, until yesterday, I didn't know about the stand-in-place thing, so you learn something new every day.<br>
<br>
In the groups I've been in, due to the relative paucity of clerics in our land, I tend to be the primary healer.  I understand my role is to sit back, meditate while everyone else does their thing, and heal people when they need it.  I'm pretty good at that, too.<br>
<br>
What I worry about, however, is how efficient my damage shields are and, even moreso, my damage over time spells are in group situations.  In the groups I've been in, unless things go very, very wrong (in which case I need all my mana for heals), monsters drop like flies.  If I put down a swarm spell, the monster's typically dead before it's gotten through even two or three tics.  I keep it memorized, and watch for opportunities to use it (as it seems to have a minimal aggro effect--much less than heals or direct damage blasts do), but I wonder if just tossing out a Careless Lightning when I want to do damage might be a better use of my mana.<br>
<br>
The same goes for the damage shield.  I use it habitually, and I know that it spreads the damage onto the monsters not being targetting, but the amount of damage, all things considered, is pretty minimal.<br>
<br>
Have faith that the members of your group know what they're doing.  Sometimes, appearances are deceptive.  I was in a group yesterday, getting pounded on by something, and I had myself targetted and was trying to put down a Shield of Barbs on myself.  One of my group members thought I was casting a root spell on a mesmerized monster, and some heated /tells ensued about my competency or lack thereof.   The casting visual effect of the Druidic Damage Shields is identical to the casting vidual effect of the root spells.<br>
<br>
Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, if you let your healer go down, you're in a world of hurt, especially if there's only one in the group.<br>

Right now things are dying very quickly for you so some of your spells you deem worthy while soloing are put to little or no use in a group situation... this is normal my friend.

<br>
I definitely keep track of the average length of fight and use that to gauge whether my mana would be better spent DoT or Blam.  I used to DoT everything almost right off, but it's turned out to be far more mana efficient to just pop off a lightning or two in some groups.  Also, I'm not afraid to use Stinging Swarm instead of Creeping Crud when appropriate -- more mana efficient when there are multiple fights that aren't hairy enough to require the tougher spell.  Of course, if the group is very efficient and I'm the healer, I tend to save most my mana for heals while Kenyon dishes out the blammo.<br>
<br>
If you have the time (and focus), run a quick tally of how many hits get off on the tank with your damage shield up to get a good gauge of how much damage it's doing vs. lightning or a DoT.  This is another time when the lower level spell could do the job, too, when mana's tight.  Of course, if there's multiples, I'd always recommend your best damage shield to increase the chances that the next time you heal, one of them doesn't decide to make you their new best friend...<br>

I'm in the same boat as Lasgalen, as a Druid, and he posted identical concerns that I've been having lately, though I am starting to find a comfortable niche.<br>
<br>
In full groups, I am always the healer, no exceptions. There just isn't anyone else to do it, and I don't mind it a bit, I really do enjoy it actually and think I'm quite good at it. However, when I'm at full mana, and we are only taking single pull after single pull, I feel like excess baggage because there really isn't much for me to do. I snare and throw a damage sheild on the tanks, but these take hardly any mana at all.  I always feel like there is something else I should be doing. I do keep everyone buffed with Skin like Steel as well and still have alot of time on my hands.<br>
<br>
What I've come to now is to not even bother with DoT's in a full group,  but if there are only a few of us and our tank is a Ranger, then I DoT them with Creeping Crud, it usually wears off before the fight is even over so it's worth it. In dungeon situations it's just a mana burner, however, I do always keep a DoT memmed just in case.  I do like to throw off Lightening if I'm full mana and it's a single pull but I always make sure it's ok with my group before the fight starts, noone has had a problem with it yet, again, as long as I'm full mana and not when it's a big pull, big pulls, all my mana goes toward snaring and healing. <br>
<br>
And I agree with Kimaya, I always keep a lower level spell memmed. If I'm the sole healer, I keep light healing memmed as well. If I don't have enough mana for Healing, I usually can go for a Light Healing and sometimes even that little bit can keep someone alive long enough to get to zone in a really bad situation. <br>
<br>
I've finally come to the realization that everything is situational for Druids since we're competent in alot of things but master of none of them, when it comes to groups. As much as it is frustrating to find the best use of my skills when in a new group, it has really been a huge learning experience on how to work with different classes.  <p>Narie<br>

Those who would best be served by it are those who have not played their current class before. The 'old hands' generally know when they can break the rules. I played a high end cleric on my old server and would often melee when mana was above 90% and we did not have any on ice waiting to be killed. I was mostly trying to raise my defense and offense for those truly awful situations when they might actually come in handy. Oh, and also to kill those stupid bixies quickly. I don't think anyone ever had lower Bixie faction than my old character. To my mind a responsible player learns her primary function first and experiments on 'down' or free time. And ask your group if its ok to melee, if your a caster or otherwise act crazy.<br>
<br>
Yes this is a roleplaying server. Learn to play your role. Then learn to improvise. As a cleric I had to substitue as an enchanter (with root), melee (may Tunare have mercy on us all), puller (complete nightmare) and nuker (fun esp. against undead). But these were not my usual role. On the other hand knowing that you can do them in a pinch and knowing how to do them as effectively as possible can be a literal life saver, as well as make for a fun group experience. In all things, good communication with your group is key. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 234<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/23/02 3:06:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Effective roleplaying</span><hr size=1> I find myself in a unique situation with regards to Snare lately.<br>
<br>
I've been fighting on Luclin an awful lot, and a lot of things (read: everything?) seems to resist it every time I cast it.  Not 90% of the time, but every time.  However, those that resist Snare don't seem to resist the new Ranger 1st level Tangling Weeds at all.  So I've been letting the Rangers do that.<br>
<br>
I haven't yet figured out why that is, but for the time being, while fighting where I am, I've dispensed with Snare.  I know how valuable it is, but if it doesn't land, it's no use burning time and mana trying.<br>
<br>
Kimaya:<br>
<br>
Yeah, I felt utterly useless sometimes.  Cast Protection of Rock (very mana-efficient) on the party, cast Strength of Earth on everyone, sit, meditate, heal once or twice during combat, meditate (or just stand there watching if mana full, which happened a lot).<br>
<br>
My guild, as I stated earlier, is wizard-top-heavy, and so if I fire off direct damage spells, I'm just gilding the lily.<br>

Oh, and an idea on the snare.  One of VI's famous tricks for making critters harder is to make them immune to magic when you're outside melee range.

If you're just standing there full mana, get in there and start swinging.

Actually, Strength of Earth improves one's Attack score moderately.  You're right, it doesn't impact damage too terribly much, but it does improve one's hit rate slightly.  Besides, I've found it's not too expensive to cast on everyone--not like doing a Protection of X spell is.<br>

P.S. ... I cast Augment on everyone in the group... don't care if they use it or not... it's just such a nifty spell. I also often cast my charisma buffs on folks ... a bit of an instant makeover. Tanks generally get Clarity, too, mostly because they hate it so much (especially rogues, for some reason). I'm sure once I get my Intelligence buffs I'll cast them to make a point.<br>
<br>
The spells you use and how you use them can be as much a part of your character as the way you speak, especially as an echanter. Illusions are one of the reasons I chose this class on this server. <br>

Not even a tiny bit.  Check out the shaman's crucible site for detailed parse logs from shaman using large str/dex/agi buffs to determine the actual effects of the bufs.  The ATK rating is actually a composite of to-hit and to-dam.  STR just shifts to-dam.  Most attribute buffs are a waste of mana.<br>
<br>
If you have enough mana to waste on attribute buffs, the puller isn't pulling fast enough.  You should barely have enough mana to maintain the AC/HP buffs in a nice xp group. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/23/02 6:14:59 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=398.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=398.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=51><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=398.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=398.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=398.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
