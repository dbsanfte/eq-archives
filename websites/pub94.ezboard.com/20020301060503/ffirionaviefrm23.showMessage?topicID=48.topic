As always seems to happen, her mind looses the ability to stay focused on merely the tallies and numbers within her books and her mind waunders over the events of the last month...<br><br>Batwing crunchies and mini honey muffins were up this month... ahh yes.  She remembered how the bar seemed mesmorized by Shintou's telling of the battle between Ryo Sanda and Fei Wo Long.  Her patrons seemed almost unaware of what they were eating or the fact that they WERE eating as he continued his tale with Samurai training tales.  She wondered how Shintou fared and if he was enjoying the protection the bronze helm afforded him that she'd given him last month....<br><br>She wondered at what was between Shintou and Genashai... then quickly reminded herself it was none of her business.<br><br>Drixa started to hum a little tune absentmindedly as she reminded herself that there were tallies to be added.<br><br>She strains her eyes to read the scribble on the bottom of the page... Milk?  Oh, yes.  The mighty paladin, Banegrivm came in to visit, yet all he would drink was milk.  But he brought many friends in with him and seemed to take the ribbing he received for his choice of drink well...  Bammar the bard even graced us with a tune that night...<br><br>Drixa resumes humming the same short piece over and over in her head... no that wasn't the tune Bammar played...<br><br>But, back to the books.  What  other tallies on food....  Oh yes, these are from Alhazar's meal.  He even paid me compliment on it!  I didn't think I'd hear compliments come from him... tho apparently his is getting quite fond of my little tavern.  It's so nice to see customers who have been with me from the beginning...<br><br>Drixa begins to hum again.  &quot;Darn it... what is that tune?&quot;<br><br>Drixa fleetingly thought of Shayce.  She does hope that the  rogue will return again.  It saddened her that they didn't stay longer, but she understands a restless spirit...<br><br>Broken shotglasses... oh yes... There was that tense night.  Fritz and Sarhea seemed so aggrivated.  It's such a shame to see such fine people at odds with each other...  Drixa had heard wispers of great battles in the arena and wished someone would tell her more.<br><br>And more broken glassware.  Drixa remembered the dismay as Kelisk felt the need to bring violence into her happy place.  Drixa tries to be welcoming to all, but it is so difficult when they don't really look to see what is offered and make snap judgments...<br><br>Drixa realizes she's still humming that happy tune and wonders at herself in the middle of such distressing memories...<br><br>Drixa  quickly turned to happier thoughts.  Jarven and Lesayne... she couldn't help but smile to think of two that were obviously such good friends and hoped that they would return soon.  She hated to think of such a promising tale unfinished...<br><br>Drixa straightened up in her chair as she finally realized the tune that had been plagueing her all evening.  &quot;Drunken Ode to a Corpse Run!&quot;  Of course!  Drixa laughed out loud as she remembered Fritz wobbling on his chair as he belted out the tune.... to be in such a predicament!  I'll have to see if I have anything in the back room to make his long anxious journey go swifter for him...<br><br>Drixa sighs and closes her books on another eventful month at the Hero Heart Tavern.<br><br><br><br><br> <p>Drixa<BR>Barmaid of the Hero Heart Tavern<BR>Serving Drinks at the Hero Heart Tavern.  www.firionavie.com <BR>"Ale will cost you.
