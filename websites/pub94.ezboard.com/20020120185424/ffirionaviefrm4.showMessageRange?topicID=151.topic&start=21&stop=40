<br>
A few comments based on my opinions.<br>
<br>
1.  Do I think FV will turn into an &quot;Uberguild dominated server&quot;, just like every other non pvp server?<br>
<br>
I don't think we'll get to the point where an &quot;uber&quot; guild will &quot;dominate&quot; the server.  The reason is that most of the players who stayed on this server and got up to that level are rather nice.  And thanks to our low population, if any high-level player ever became &quot;not nice&quot;, just about everyone would apply some sort of social sanction against them.<br>
<br>
Reputation usually counts for a lot in the high-level game ... especially when you can't twink/powerlevel a new character easily.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  Am I bothered by non roleplaying punks with their street lingo?<br>
<br>
No.  Although we are in a fantasy world setting and in a roleplay server, who has the right to dictate what is appropriate or not?  I certainly can't expect my imagination to match what you have in mind.  Maybe someone's fantasy world is full of people saying &quot;Yo, Homey, wanna go spank some orc boootey?&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;We feel it’s pretty much impossible to define what Role Playing is verbally, much less via a rule set.&quot;<br>

<br>
So kiss my glutteous maximus ya role playing nazis. I will RP when and how I want. If you dont like it, don't listen.  Once again for int. challenged people: You can not dictate how to role play to others, even on this server (FV).<br>

Its a matter of principle. RP is getting into character of your toon. Emotions, actions, reactions, politics etc. Do those exactly how you want to. To &quot;Yo, homey where be my biatches, yo pimp mofo&quot; is childishly uncreative and annoying, usually showing your age and some sort low mentality or anti social tendancies. You want to &quot;roleplay&quot; that, fine so be it, its yor choice just dont expect  to have many RP friends or allies that are tolerant to that. The gweedo crowd like that will usually mass together like they already have in the guilds fitting to that mentality, you know who you are. So glad you idiots are like pack animals flocking to the same guild tag, makes it so much easier to avoid you and your ilk as ppl pass by. /wave now where is that ignore key .... &quot;your IGNORE list is full.

Funny how you claim to be only concerned with the fact that people do roleplay, when all you've done is harass people for making choices that differ with yours.  &quot;You're not right, only my interpretation could *possibly* be correct,&quot; you say.  &quot;You damned moron, you can't read my mind, can you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Funny how you talk about how your own role playing skills are excellent when you can't type a complete sentence, use punctuation, or spell.<br>
<br>
Funny how you can't seem to make a point without insulting someone, and yet are defensive and smug about your own RPing prowess to the point of hilarity, at least from my view.<br>
<br>
If you're going to be critical, at least make some sense and try to come from a higher level than those you're criticizing, otherwise it just falls flat.<br>

To roleplay correctly, you must use elizabethan language, because of course, everquest mirrors earth of a certain time period where unicorns and dragons actually existed.<br>
<br>
Of course, the world is wholesome with no brothels, so there will be no more referring to pimps or their hoes.<br>
<br>
If people are interracting on a personal level you have every right to criticize not only their dialect but also their mannerisms.<br>
<br>
It is childish and uncreative to leave people be to play as they wish, rather it is the mature act of a prodigy to voice your facist opinion on a subject and refer to your contemporaries as 'complete ass'.<br>
<br>
You obviously have low mentality and anti-social tendancies if you are a human being.<br>
<br>
You can make great friends by referring to a guild's members as a greedo crowd with a certain mentality. You can make more friends by expressing your compassion with a full ignore list.<br>

<br>
1 - despite your many attempts to /define roleplay, /set roleplay rules and regulations,  /admonish l33t playaz for not roleplaying according to your rules, you cannot tell anyone how to act, how to play or how to utilize the $9.95US per month that they pay SOE to play EQ.  If they break the rules of the game, as set down by SOE, then you can petition...otherwise you are just flapping your wings and creating hot air.<br>
<br>
2 - I remember you vividly from Luclin...I was in the same guild with you in fact.  You did not epitomize the penultimate roleplayer then (ya, I know, it wasn't an RP server).  You were actually quite the powerleveller and I recall many inter-guild arguements (at the officer level) over/arising from your play style.  However we found a way to accept your play style as overall you were a good fella.<br>
<br>
3 - I also recall from Luclin your constant &quot;pot stirring&quot; over the Everyone vs. Legacy of Sorrow issue.  Everyday you were ranting about LoS in a manner that actually parrots your Roleplayers vs. Powa Gama's rants that are going on now.  I'm beginning to suspect that this Me vs. Them thing is an essential element in your sociological make-up.  Dude, you will never, and I mean NEVER, find a world (virtual or otherwise) where all of your ideals, morals and attitudes are prevalent in every other member of the population.  Taking the highroad by criticizing or belittling those that you don't agree with merely alienates you. <br>
<br>
For goodness sakes, the world of EQ has over 100 zones spread over what...900 or so players?  If that isn't big enough for you, what is?  Try Baldur's Gate or something...you can actually program the scripts of your party members to behave as you'd like...<br>
<br>
If someone wants to run around spouting...&quot;I ownz joo ho-bag!&quot;...that's their business.  I say just play the game and quit yer bitchin (and I don't just mean you Stormwind...you're a good guy as I remember, just proc your Relax discipline once in a while).<br>
<br>
Anyhew, my 2 cents, take it, leave it, or piss on it...I don't care.<br>

You, mistress, have an amazing similarity. In this last post you infer that people who use what you call 'street lingo' are ignorant. What's more and even disgusting is your prejudice. If you can't understand how you are prejudiced take a walk in the real world and tell people they only talk the way they do because of rap or because they are american. <br>
<br>
Man, lady. I'll tell you what. That statement of yours really got to me.<br>
<br>
Two more points...<br>
1. people interract this way whether its 2000 BC or 2000 AD. Friends call each other names to joke around. In any way the language is interpreted, it is not literal, it is people having a good time and for some reason you just can't stand it.<br>
<br>
2. 'phat lewt for your uber self' rings with a strong vibration of jealousy. You better work on that if anyone is going to take you seriously.<br>

I will tell you exactly what happened. Stormwind walked up on an AB conversation, and instead fo C'ing his way out, he decided to come here and degrade his peers. He is darN lucky very few people read these boards since he intends to show his face again on the FV server.<br>

You wanna be a facist, shrug, be a facist. But don't ever , EVER say my friends or I speak the way we do because we are undereducated. I'm just smart enough to react. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/01 3:43:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just if ...</span><hr size=1> Let me react to your statements.<br>
<br>
First point 2.  *laughs*  You think I am jealous of you getting high end gear?  Nah not really.  High end gear is fine but if you do not have the friends to go with it well it gets boring soloing or being with people only worried about what loot they can get.<br>
<br>
The point about street lingo being because of rap and American.  Well I hate to break it to you  but when the idea of Pimps hoes and bitches came about it was in America.  It was mainstream in rap and most of the people using it got it from that.  Since you mention it being for the educated also please let me refrain.  Maybe since I do not know ANYONE educated that speaks in that manner on a consistent basis I was ill-informed.  You know most people don't know educated people that run around talking about all their &quot;bitches and hoes&quot;.  What it offends you because you feel that you are educated?<br>
<br>
Which leads into your numerated point about people joking around with each other.   Yeah people joke around and call each other names.  I never said anything against joking around.  Ask all my friends who said I have Luclin the day I was supposed to get mine.  the got a /rude Your whore and I can assure you it was playing around.<br>
<br>
Actually your reacting to it shows your lack of intelligence.  I am not talking about a highschool diploma you can get sleeping through class or even a college degree you can study to get.  I am talking about real intelligence and that is the willingness to learn.  Most people in this category do not butcher a language for slang or ebonics.<br>
<br>
On a closing note damn I did not realize I was facist.  Must reexamine my ways and enforce the policy of my guild in a more facist manner since I am one.  None of that democratic style anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/01 4:15:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Just if ...</span><hr size=1> That was pretty limp damage control.<br>
