Then you have to sift through the posts on their site (some with constant annoying pop ups), fill out profiles and talk about yourself. I'd rather look at a short post here about requirements and get to know guild members by grouping with them. You can learn more in a tough fight than by reading about it. If their members run early from a fight and leave you to die (happened to me when I was checking a guild out: I'm very low, paladin has over half his hp, runs away beacuse he just leveled up and didn't want to die, other members didn't think it was too big a deal, knew that wasn't the guild for me). <br>

<br>
Heck, I have even gotten a few tells recently asking why someone of my level is still unguilded.  The answer is simple.  I am being careful who I associate with long-term (i.e., guild with).  This includes checking several times a day to see if the guild is even playing together with its current members.  :-)  That kind of stuff is important to me.  It is also important to me that people realize the game is simply a game (a focus which I lost for a while on my original server oh so long ago).  Uber is NOT the pixels you wear... it is the skill of the player, of the group you are with, and the team you are part of.<br>
<br>
It is also useful to check how involved the guild leader is.  I have fairly defined views on leadership, but I prob have a different background than most.<br>
<br>
Don't just &quot;join&quot; a guild to see if it is what you want.  Investigate it.  I have finally formally applied to one guild in particular.  Unfortunately, the investigative process DOES take time, but if you want a good guild experience, the time is well worth investing.<br>
<br>
But yes, it would be nice to have stuff in one place.  But some guilds with message boards have only a few online at a time, and have only 3 people posting to the boards a week.  Not what I want in a guild, but that may work for others.<br>

I've already been asked why I'm not guilded and I'm only in my 12th season! A guild should be more than a tag to wear and people to talk to in guild chat. Most of the groups I see around don't have more than one member from any given guild. Very rarely do I see a few members of the same guild fighting together unless it's an older member power-leveling a younger one. I don't want to join a guild to get powerleveled, I just want to find friends to fight beside. Levels will come. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ansurfv>AnsurFV</A> at: 11/15/02 1:04:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bormwarrior>Borm Warrior</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 396<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/15/02 12:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=354.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: looking around</span><hr size=1> Simple rules for finding a guild:<br>
<br>
1) Never join a guild that invites you out of the blue.<br>
2) Never join a guild who bribes you with equipment or PL<br>
3) Never join a guild because the need &quot;class_01&quot; and you fit the bill.<br>
4) Never join a guild whose goals differ from your own (rp, events, structure, loot distribution)<br>
5) Never join a guild out of boredom<br>
6) Never join a guild that has a bad reputation<br>
<br>
1) Join a guild that make it tough for you to get in -IF- during that process you discover that you like the people, admire the leaders, trust the officers and enjoy the guild focus.<br>
2) Join a guild that makes it a point to get to know you before you become a member.<br>
3) Join a guild that embraces you becuase of who you are not what you bring to the table.<br>
4) Join a guild that enhances your fun.<br>

I am disappointed in the number of players who have no concept of roelplaying and this can make it difficult to talk to someone who is making comments more appropriate to OOC.  I am a mature psychologist who is studying the need for myth in a culture and the addictive process that has become a mojor issue with online gaming.  Yet I also enjoy immersing in the game for its own sake and would like to find a Guild that shares my values.  As a &quot;good&quot; Druid Halfling I expect to be excluded from much of the activities and that is OK with me. Some of us are prepared to pay the price for walking a different road.<br>
<br>
My creed does not allow me to kill or join anyone who kills wolves, and after a traumatic experience in Runnyeye I have become claustrophobic. Character flaws are part of life and need to be part of our characters to be credible.  Adolescent immortality concepts are OK for the adolescent but some of us want more from the experience.<br>

<br>
I've been thinking of looking for a guild myself though I have decided that it is not at the uppermost top of my list of things to do.<br>
<br>
Excluding what the guild is about I look for these things:<br>
<br>
The seasons of players on at the times I play.  This is good for grouping and such.  No use in joining a guild with members to low or to high if your going to be soloing and not join in the fun of certain guild events. <br>
<br>
The website/message board (if they have one) and see what activity is there. Don't really see the point in having one if it's not used.  I'm a former member of Tinker's Pride.  We were required (at least at one point) to post something once a week.  This was good because we knew on a constant basis who was still around and could keep each other up to speed on what was going on event's wise and such.  It also brought us closer as friends as some (like me) played at odd hours.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to ya!<br>
