<br>
The business administration student society held a corporate fair where reps from various companies were invited to set up booths and inform students about their products, services and of course, prospective employment.<br>
<br>
As a member of the student body council, I had to do my turn at manning our booth, when an extremely attractive woman walks up.  Another fellow manning the booth greeted her very pleasantly and her response was:<br>
<br>
&quot;Who is responsible for this corporate monstrosity?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
The president of the business administration student society was in earshot so he steps up and begins chatting with this extremely agitated woman who goes on and on about a university campus not being an appropriate platform for corporate advertising.<br>
<br>
Then she went on about how offended she was about the Schneider's booth, what with them cooking hotdogs, smokies and other meat products that everyone was forced to smell - including die hard vegans such as herself.  At this point she was very loud, and being an anti-corporate, anti-establishment, vegan, she probably thought this was her moment to shine.<br>
<br>
Being a rather astute fellow, and a total ass, the business admin student body president then asked her in voice as loud as hers, something to the effect of:<br>
<br>
&quot;So you are against the exploitation of animals for corporate or consumer gain?&quot;<br>
<br>
She responded:  &quot;Yes.  All of you should.&quot;<br>
<br>
To which he responded:  &quot;So what type of plant did you get your suede jacket, leather boots and leather handbag from?&quot;<br>
<br>
/bonk.  That was ownage.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not slandering anti-corporate, anti-establishment and/or vegetarians/vegans...but this thread just reminded me of this funny and hypocritic story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukathatlafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KathatlaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/20/02 5:42:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Vegans can eat me!</span><hr size=1> Although in theory it *IS* healthier to be a veget. most people forget a few things.  Many of the &quot;fake meat&quot; products contain lots of artificial junk as well, which is what a lot of vegetarians are trying to get away from (hormones, antibiotics etc in beef are what some people try and get away from anyway)...  Too much soy can be bad for you as well.  As for myself, i'm not a big meat eater and generally wont order beef, etc, at a restraunt, but a little Venison or smoked salmon is delicious (I live in AK) <p>Woos-Troll Shaman-Firiona Vie-Ebon Storm

<br>
Wow...ignorance abounds...<br>
<br>
It makes me sick that those that try to live a compassionate way of life get sh*t on time and time again.<br>
<br>
So you people know, I did alot of research before I chose vegetarianism. Knowledge is power, my friends, and I suggest you get some before you start flapping your gums about something you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> obviously</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know nothing about. I don't have a bus, but if I did, I could drive it through the holes in some of the arguments in this thread today. <br>
<br>
First of all, I (and most veggies, I'm sure) am (are) sick of the &quot;Plants die too&quot; Arguement. <br>
<br>
So, just becuase we can't stop all of the suffering in the world doesn't mean we shouldn't stop what is in our power to? Psshh... weak, weak, weak. If you are going to insult vegetarianism, don't be a sheep, think of something we haven't heard a million times.<br>
<br>
PETA:<br>
<br>
 Umm...I'll tell you that all vegetarians aren't members of this organization and don't necessarily agree with the way they do things. As far as I am concerned, PETA is a bunch of fear mongers and they do more scaring people away with their tactics than educating on the subject of vegetarianism. The sure as Hell don't get <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> my</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> money or membership.<br>
<br>
Just plain and simple insults:<br>
<br>
Some of it made me pissed, some of it made me laugh (ignorance factor), and some of it hurt me, because it came from people that I thought were respectful people in general. I guess I know now. Thanks for the eye-opener. <br>
<br>
Oh, and in referrence to this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;So you are against the exploitation of animals for corporate or consumer gain?&quot;<br>

<br>
This person in this story is a Grade A moron and in no way represents the bulk of the vegetarian population. There are stupid people in all groups, why should vegetarianism be any different?<br>
<br>
There is alot more, but frankly, I don't have the energy, time or layers of skin on my fingers to combat it all.<br>
<br>
I did, however found some intelligent statements in the thread. A few of them, include:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> About 2/3rds of my staff were Vegetarians. A handful were vegans. They were all great folks, we just agreed not to preach at each other. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What? You mean you don't berate each other for your personal decisions? Wow...how very <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> mature</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. This is a good lesson for alot of you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm not a vegan, I really like to eat meat, but I do think animals whether they are pets or a food source should be treated as ethically and humanely as possible.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
*nods*<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Human beings are adaptable, we adapt to our surrondings fast and hence we can eat vegetables and meat and actually live rather well of either one. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Mmm Hmm...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The thing that bugs me about -most- vegans and vegetarians (even the modified ones) is that they assume you won't eat something vegetarian or vegan and/or that you will insist on having meat. It also bugs me that they refer to those who eat meat as carnivores. umm... No... I am an OMNIVORE thank you very much.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, you certainly are an omnivore, Calliou. And class, please take notes on Calliou's useage of the word <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> most</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
This indicates that this statement does not apply to the vegetarian population as a whole and shows <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> intelligence</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on the part of Calliou.<br>
<br>
Alright, I'm done b*tching about something I know you people deon't care about and go back to being the quiet, non-flaming Cielo that you all have come to expect me to be. Just do me one favor. Put this thread in another context. What if the title had been &quot;Christians can eat me&quot; or something similar?Insert your religious, ethnic or political group in there, then think of how you would feel about this thread. I am not trying to change people's minds about being vegetarian; eat what you will. *shrugs* I only ask that you not insult the group as a whole becasue they hold different opinions and values than you. I have aTON of non-veggie freinds. Do I insult them for eating meat? Of course not. I repsect the decsions they make and they respect mine. <br>
<br>
Blah... I'm done. <br>

<br>
Humans are meant to be omnivores, like bears.<br>
<br>
Pregnant women need to eat meat for fetus's to develop properly. Studies have been done, that show that a strict vegetarian diet is very bad for nursing babies, because they are not getting the protiens they need from the mother. The babies do not grow in weight or intelligence, in comparison to babies of the same age born to omnivourous mothers.<br>
<br>
If you believe in Darwinism, vegetarians will all go the way of the dinosaurs...eventually.<br>
<br>
Other than that, if you don't want to eat meat, don't. I'm not going to stop you, but don't try to stop me.<br>
<br>
And yes, wild game (moose, deer, grouse) is better for you than farm raised meat. It is leaner, and has more protein per ounce.<br>
<br>
And yes, moose is the best tasting meat I have ever had. A nice roast, slowly cooked over a fire for 4 hours...mmmm<br>
<br>

<br>
I do not look down on those who eat meat.  We all make our own decisions.<br>
<br>
I chose to go vegetarian because I can not bring about the suffering of another living thing.<br>
<br>
Do plants truely feel?  If they do, the current scientific literature does not say so.  And if they do, is it really on the scale of a cow, a sentient living being?<br>
<br>
Hunting your own meat is one thing.  The death camps that the meat industry run are another.  <br>
<br>
But still, I will never criticize anyone for eating meat.<br>
<br>
What I will criticize are those who argue for the right to life of every human being, whether just concieved or at 8 months , yet still continue to support the meat industry.<br>
<br>
<br>
A cow suffers much more than any fetus.  A cow has a fully developed nervous system.  To argue that a clump of cells has more rights against suffering that a fuly developed life form is to treat humans as a separate species, unconnected to all others in the animal kingdom, and to ignore the last 100 plus years of biological research.<br>
<br>
We are animals.  <br>
<br>
Looking back at that, I can feel the flames coming in.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the truth of the matter is that Meat IS still murder, and dairy IS still rape.<br>
<br>
If your concious can deal with the fact, then I am not going to argue your meat eating tendacies.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I feel that &quot;Life is too short to make others shorter.&quot;-Prophaghandi<br>

Think about it, a cow's sole pupose in life is to give the human race a chance to feed. What's more noble than to die, fulfilling your life's purpose? I can't think of one.<br>
<br>
Yes, even the carrot I'm munching on now has done that...<br>

NUTS. thing is most Vegans are so damn flightie, they don't eat nuts. I've heard a myriad of excuses for the fact, ranging from a simple, &quot;I don't like nuts&quot; to the rediculous &quot;they contain too much fat.&quot; I'll tell you pal, you need the fat too! You weigh about 105 pounds at six foot even, and can barely pick up your daughter. (my lord I pity that child)<br>
<br>
Rice and beans are another, less efficient way to get protein, separately they do you litlle good, together they are a complete protein. You're not gonna become Mr. Universe off that diet, but you can survive.<br>
<br>
All I want to know is, why don't Vegans eat nuts? They are the one good source of protein open to them, but of the 7 Vegans I've met, and taken the time to talk to, only one will eat any kind of nuts.<br>
<br>
I am an omnivore, I am the top of the food chain. I can and will eat almost anything.<br>

<br>
Only because WE have made that their lives purpose.  THis is actually a common arguement from those that believe that humans are put here on earth specially, to use all we find to our own whims.<br>
<br>
Makes me think of all of those ranchers who are so upset because the wolves in yellowstone and the area keep killing their calves.  But that is young cattles purpose, being eaten by wolves, isn't it?<br>
<br>
As for being a human parent, I agree that the life of you child should come above all else.  It is a pity that more parents don't feel that way.  I just saw a mother of a 7 month old, a women I have known since birth, get arrested for heroin.  I know a girl who is 8 months pregent, who looks about 4 months along due to her addiction.  Seeing anyone place their child above themselves is heartening.<br>
<br>
But it does not change the fact that, philosophically, cows feel suffering MUCH more than a fetus at ANY stage.  Yet millions go around protesting for the right to life while munching on their Big MAcs...(NOT that I am admitting that anything McDonalds serves actually has any beef in it) <br>
<br>
Without religion we have no reason to suppose that human life has any higher value than other animal life.  We are just another step on the evolutionary tree.  Yet daily groups of people march for the feelings of something that is nothing more than a clump of cells, something that can not feel or suffer.<br>
<br>
According to polls, these same people support the death penalty and eating meat.  Show me the logic?  Please?<br>
<br>
The day I find the group protesting that abbortion, the death penalty and eating meat are all wrong is the day I will find a group without hypocritities.<br>
<br>
<br>
Until then I will keep living my life, content in theknowledge that My existance brings no new suffering into this world<br>

You know why, correct?<br>
<br>
They're starving themselves, as opposed to the sunburnt overweight, well-rested meat eater, so that YOU DON'T EAT THEM.  Hansel and Gretel is more than a fairytale to some folk.<br>

Eating members of your own species does little to advance your own species, unless it's overcrowding and the species toxic wastes is killing it off. Kind of like a bacteria colony in a petrie dish. It expands until it's own wastes kills off the colony.<br>
<br>
now I forgot what I was saying...<br>
