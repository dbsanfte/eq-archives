March 8th (reserves accepted)</span><hr size=1>       Hello everyone, Shotta here with a proud announcement to make. The Concordance and friends will be attempting our first in what we hope to be many dragon raids. <br>
     This first attempt will be against Lord Nagafen. A prized beast to lay claim to and a difficult task. Lord Nagafen is a lvl 55 warrior based dragon, with a poweful area effect fear spell along with an area effect fire breath spell resulting in 500 dmg wich is used often.<br>
     Before I get into great detail I would like to stat that EVERYONE wishing to attend this event must sign up as a post to this thread. If you do not sighn up you will not be allowed to attend this raid, It takes alot of time to plan an event of this such proper time is needed for figuring groups ahead of time. This raid is planned mainly for members of the concordance and friends. RESERVES may post as wanting to attend but will only be taken if we are lacking the power or the certain class. Now when you post please list character name, lvl, class, race, and guild of wich you are in or guild in wich is inviting you to come along. To help determine who will be MA and SA i will need for warriors to place additional information. I will need to know base magic and fire resists along with HP and AC with youre resist gear on also base and finally i will need to know youre taunt skill lvl. Note to any interested reserves there are no restrictions on race or factions if you are needed you will be asked to attend. Only restrictions and they apply to everyone is a min lvl of 45 and everyone must have PoP expansion.<br>
<br>
     The following chat channels will be used.<br>
1) concraid  -  This will be kept free of basic chat and will be used only for significant raid text. such as assist calls and raid leading directions. You will know if you are supposed to place text in this channel or not but everyone must join it.<br>
<br>
2) concchat  -  This will be for everyones use to post as you wish. <br>
<br>
     I would suggest placing concraid text in bright coloring, so that no important messages are missed. This raid will have several steps all in wich serve a purpose.<br>
 <br>
      First task is preclear giant fort and lair. This Task will be lead by Gijan. He will have total control of the preclear tasks and group or groups envolved in this task.<br>
The preclear team will be composed of players lvl 51 plus. If you wish to take part in the preclear tasks post so on youre reply to this thread. The task of preclear is to eliminate all the giants at the fort and up to the prep room and then clear the lair of all mobs other then naggy. This team is also responsible for keeping the path to prep room cleared when the assult force arrives. Loot that is gained during the preclear will be added to loot distribution at the end of the raid.  PRECLEAR will start at 12 noon est  9 am pst 5 pm gmt  preclear will meet at druid rings in lavastorm. <br>
<br>
      BUFFING TEAM meeting in lavastorm druid rings at 2 pm est 11 am pst and 7 pm gmt <br>
     At this point the buffing team will be arriving the same time as the assult force and will make way to nagafens lair and be escorted to prep room. Hopefully we will have a KEI chanter along with us if not we will try and hire one to hang out at the druid rings in lavastorm to at least KEI the beffing tem anyone else wishing to get a KEI might have to donate depending on pricing the chanter wishes to charge for his/her services. Also a magician will be summoning mod rods for buffing team along with resist gear for assualt force. A list of buffs will be posted below if you sighn up as part of the buff team and you have a better buff then what is listed please post and state if any regents are needed. All regents will be provided by raid leader(s). Buff team even if to high of lvl for actual naggy assult will be eligable for loot if the stick around till the very end. Buff team will assist of 44 plus shaman  52 plus cleric 49 plus chanter 51 plus druid and bards singing mana song.<br>
<br>
         ASSULT FORCE meeting at lavastorm druid rings at 2 pm est 11 am pst and 7 pm gmt<br>
Assult team will be lead by shotta. Must be lvl 45 - 52 (higher lvls may try to attempt something before getting banned but would like to keep this to those upper lvls attending as part of buff team and or preclear team)<br>
I am asking that with resist gear and no buffs everyone try and have a base Mr of 50 and a base FR of 100 or as high as possible. I understand everyone is not able to aquire these amounts of resists but as much should be worn as possible and should be placed at a higher regard then AC Intel and other such stats. If you are having trouble finding resist gear here is a short list of the many items available<br>
<br>
    Earring of fire reflection ( ac1 fr 5  26pp at lavastorm gypsies) Gold daimond mask ( FR 10 Cr 10 MR 3) Gold hermatite necklace ( FR 7 ) Gold emerald bracelet ( ac 4 fr 6 ) Platinum emerald ring ( ac 4 FR 10 ) Hand woven leggings ( ac 8 fr 10 ) Runed bone fork ( FR 10 CR 10 MR 10 ) Crown of the froglock kinfgs ( ac 12 FR 20 CR 20 ) There are plenty others this is just a short list of common items.<br>
   Mage lvl 49 plus (needed) will be at the druid rings in lavastorm to summon elemental blankets ( FR CR MR plus 15 shoulder slot ) and other focus items.<br>
<br>
   When you arrive to druid rings in lavastorm drop roleplaying and anon tags and place youreself under an lfg listing. If you have not already done so at this point please join concraid  and concchat keeping concraid to be used by raid leaders only and concchat as a general chat for the raid. A following chat handle will be created for raid leaders only and will be given to you in tells if you are to be in the chat handle. Now obviously there will be alot of us attending this raid and raid leaders SHOULD NOT be sent direct tells if you have a question first ask in group if no answear then ask in concchat if still no answear ask youre group leader to ask in the designated leader chat handle. as soon as groups are formed buffing will take place.<br>
      Buffing the longest stage of the raid. groups will be buffed in reverse order of wich they assualt, everyone getting buffed must do the following.<br>
<br>
1- click off all current buffs<br>
2- stand in an organized line infront of buff team <br>
3- receive 4 dummy buffs these are placed to be dispelled by naggy <br>
4- sit down after 4 dummy buffs are placed so buff team knows you are ready for real buffs<br>
5- receive  positive buffs<br>
6- As soon as you have received all of the positive buffs you will back away from buffing area and camp outy to FV chat server you will log back in every 20 mins to replenish youre summoned items. Group leaders are responsible for keeping track of when there group is to log back in to replenish summoned items. As soon as all the buffing is done you will be called back in to the game.<br>

        As soon as buffing is done, everybody has logged back in and groups are reformed, we will assault the dragon. The assault will have several stages which are explained in detail below. Please be sure you know your role ! Only act when you are called upon ! Basically we will have a main tank who we will try to keep alive with LOH rotation and clerics and who will try to keep aggro on him. Each group will have a bard who will protect the group with resist song and who is to be kept alive by his healer. At certain points, measured in Naggy health percentage, different classes will be called in to perform their task.<br>
<br>
     Some basic rules : You have to be in melee range to land a spell on the dragon. Characters above lvl 52 can assault, try to land a spell or a blow and get banned. Make sure the dragon does not get pushed into lava or a wall. This is very important ! Move behind him to push him away from walls and lava, keep him centered in the cave ! If he dies in a wall, there will be no corpse ... no loot. If he falls into lava, we can't land spells anymore.<br>
Turn off run when you reach the dragon ! WALK ! When you get feared, the chance to run into lava and die is minimized that way. Necros should avoid spells that turn Nag into a skeleton. This makes it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.  Additional info may be given to specific roles or players but will be passed out in game via tells.  <br>
  <br>
      The different assault stages will be:<br>
<br>
Bards will start to play Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 71CR, and 71FR). Group 1 enters the lair. The main tank will activate fearless and attack Naggy, accompanied by his bard and the first pally in the LOH rotation lineup. The other groups follow closely, walking into the lair and waiting in front of the bridge for their call. Bards will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignficant melee damage and Nag ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard to fight will be directly below stomach near his hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is possible, twist Guardian Rythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs. The MT will pull Naggy from the bridge to the back wall. This creates more distance from the lava in case someone is feared, and allows clerics to heal from bridge without being in AE range. While building aggro, the MT will be healed first by pallies LOH, next by clerics. The LOH rotation lineup and cleric complete heal lineup will be assigned prior to the assault. LOH and Heals are to be announced on raidchannel. <br>
Shortly after the MT starts to build aggro, the 2nd group moves in and the  Secondary Tank starts to build his aggro, and Shamans start to debuff, lower resists and slow Naggy. Successfull spells are to be announced on raidchannel (&quot;Naggy slowed!&quot;). Any 53+ characters present can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. Bards may consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does cold resist, 1 does magic resist). Should the MT die or get feared, the ST has to take over, Pallies and Clerics have to retarget. The current MT will call for melee attack when he is sure to have build enough aggro on Naggy. By then all melees rush in and start beating the dragon. Healers should remain back at the bridge until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the bridge and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of breath range. If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is on the bridge outside breath range. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of AE fire damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the bridge for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.  Necros should pump mana to clerics. <br>
AT 60% HEALTH:<br>
Pets are called in to attack. 1 enchanter should Tash and should announce &quot;Tashed&quot; if successful. If Naggy agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transfered to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live.<br>
Enchanters will have hard time landing any damage spell on Nagafen. Best use may be to cast rune on Nagafen's current target. <br>
AT 50% HEALTH:<br>
Nukes and casters except wizards will be called in. Remember to get within melee range or your spell will not land. Nuke until the dragon is dead. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move away from Nagafen and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (dragon targeted) for 300+ damage. <br>
AT 20% HEALTH:<br>
Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.<br>
Loot rules<br>
      Depending on what classes we have abundance of certain steps might be placed somewhat ahead of the percentages listed above. All actions will be announced on concraid and may change slightly from what is llisted above. <br>
<br>
Basic rule is NBG, meaning you are to roll only if you can and will use the item in question. We will make up some point system for future raids, but on this first one all of us start at zero, so we will just roll against a number which is seeded by Shotta. Apart from dragon loot, there will be other stuff looted off Giants and other MOB. There will be the following restrictions on who is eligible to roll on which dragon loot item:<br>
<br>
Bladestopper  Classes listed <br>
Blight, Hammer of the Scourge  Shaman of listed races <br>
Cloak of Flames  Pure melee and hybrids (No int casters, no priest classes) <br>
Gauntlets of Fiery Might  Classes listed <br>
Gold Plated Koshigatana  Classes listed <br>
Heirophant s Crook  Druids <br>
Orb of Tishan  Classes listed <br>
Prayers of Life  All classes that don't have a heal spell <br>
Red Dragon Scales  Bards and Warriors (Epic piece) <br>
Red Dragon Tooth  All classes except Necros and SKs <br>
Selo s Drums of the March  Bards <br>
Torn Burnt Book  Pallies <br>
Treasure Hunter s Satchel Monks roll first IF they turn in a tink bag instead. Then everybody gets to roll on either the satchel or the tink bag. <br>
We hope YOU will be there ... and we all have fun and a wealth of dragon loot to distribute ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now, I've only ever been on one Naggy raid - and we killed him.  But the bards had a different role, and some other class did too - I know bards can play a song that burns up the mana of their target.  Because Naggy can complete heal himself - and tends to do so from 30% health I understand.  I'm not the best authority on this subject, but feel that this little fact might have been over-looked.  So please, tell me I'm wrong, and I missed the meaning of something you mentioned!<br>
<br>
I myself, probably won't be coming to the raid - but I will certainly try to encourage others of my guild to go if they can!<br>
<br>
Oh, one other buff that might be useful - if you get a Ranger who has Mark of the Predator group buff, this will help melee types.  Also, I find that Force of Nature often still stacks too - so, a Ranger or two might be useful for buffing the melee classes on this one.<br>
<br>
Good luck with it.<br>
