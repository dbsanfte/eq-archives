<br>
Kzan had some questions, I answer questions.<br>
<br>
Trying to find the accusations, here's what I found.<br>
<br>
3rd, apparently he has caused innumerable problems in our guild, and even intentionally messed with people's RL relationships.<br>
<br>
Long time ago I identified Restoria as someone unlikely to answer direct questions, I asked her to email me about anything, trying to get her talking, trying to find out what her problems were in game.  The reason I wanted to know was to try to deal with those problems if I could.  I ended up getting a picture of her, no real thoughts were ever emailed.<br>
<br>
In one of my first rants on FaF Members I pointed out that all Restoria cared about was how much faster the exp bar could be moving left to right if she was somewhere else after I dragged her to ME.  I told her no worries, I won't invite you again, you don't match my grouping playstyle and dragging you here is just making things less fun for you.<br>
<br>
She said I could group wherever I wanted because I was 60 and exp didn't matter, I told her AA negated that argument, 6 months later try to find her outside of FG and CT, the best exp zones in game and I tend to think my assessment was very accurate.<br>
<br>
From the time of that rant we never really spoke much again, I found out recently from people challenging me about what she had posted on the FaF members board that I tried to break up Kritical and Restoria.<br>
<br>
It's all news to me, I'm honestly confused on that one, if the emails I sent her could possibly disrupt her relationship it was a sh!tty relationship not worth saving and I'm not even sure what from the emails is at issue.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to post more info on that one please feel free.<br>
<br>
The email to Kurley that Kzan loves to bring up is really simple, turns out I even saved that one as I hadn't deleted it by the time Kurley's story morphed from she laughed it off, she laughed it off after I told her it was just a stupid email from some deviant in EQ to constantly harping on the email, well here it is.  Guess I should have been using Hihi then as a header and maybe Test for Text<br>
<br>
Subject : I'm in love with your fiancee<br>
<br>
Why do you read his e-mail?<br>
 <br>
You should trust him by now. :-/<br>
 <br>
Just adding you to my address book for now.<br>
 <br>
Will send you more info later.<br>
<br>
Again if this caused problems in the relationship there were problems long before I sent the email.  Feel free to judge it, I still don't see a problem looking back on it all this time later, but as mentioned, I'm an @sshole.<br>
<br>
In 9 months this is how I tore up real life relationships, and I only found out about 1 of the 2 just recently.  <br>
<br>
As for the innumerable problems in the guild, yes I pointed out what I didn't agree with, I explained my reasons, I felt Reynn deserved her epic more than Cassimus and took action, I felt Andlie deserved a Medallion more than Restoria and took action, I thought Kerg was downgrading his BP and took action, I got solo exp in Hate and looted an Iksar Warr BP and kept it for 2h or so because I wanted to find out a little bit about Bako.  Bring up anything else you want, ask for more insight on any of these incidents if you want.<br>
<br>
I told Syni she would be happier as a central figure in DS than as a periphery member of FaF, I told Xandria she would be better off levelling her munk, I told Leawen that DS was probably a better fit for him and I told Sindell to just level to 60 and decide what is best for you then be it FaF or otherwise.  Bring up anything else you want, ask for more insight on any of these people if you want.<br>
<br>
4th, He has done things that i will not say on a public forum because I don't know if I should. <br>
<br>
This is the kind of mudslinging crap I can't reply to, Bako pulls the same stunt later. /shrug<br>
<br>
<br>
There you go Kzan, enjoy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Commoner's Chevalier</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 4:03:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Seems to be one of the first crossbows ive seen that shoots from the hip...Gnome design? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usliver123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Political Piggies</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 5:28:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> &quot;he's posted crap that I shouldn't post here because its private and it's wrong to post private material blah blah blah&quot;<br>
Bako, way to appear to take the high moral ground and at the same time fling dung without basis. You're grasping at straws now. Despite what I like to believe, the average reader of this board is not stupid (exceptions aplenty of course) So, do you expect me to swallow that crap, seriously? Fuvi may have offended you by being direct and telling you some truths that you didn't like to hear, and that may have seemed criminal to you, but you aren't going to convince me, or the average person, that he's the monster you claim without providing proof. It's worse for you now that he's said he's willing to be open about it all, and explain anything you can come up with. Like he always has. <br>
Look man you are going to have to get up early in the morning to convince me, and the next guy that Fuvi's in the wrong here. And my friend, you are going to have to be on your very best day to go toe to toe with him and not come away looking like the complete ass of the situation. And dude, it's too late.<br>
That applies to you too Kzan, next time double dog dare him, maybe he'll post something incriminating.<br>

<br>
I've been away from EQ for quite a while, but I still peruse the boards to see what's happening on FV.  Obviously when things go awry in a guild like FnF involving &quot;senior&quot; or &quot;prominent&quot; members of the server population, it's going to get some notice from the rest of the population.<br>
<br>
For those who have not been in FnF and are not privy to the nitty gritty details of the drama that is spilling onto the FV boards, a little sound judgement should be used.  This is important, since a well edited and placed quotation can be taken out of context and used to convey a particular sentiment or evoke a desired reaction - which may or may not be legitimate and/or accurate.  This is called media manipulation and you can find plenty of examples in your evening news coverage or Barbara Walter's interviews.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the only reason I'm posting is because my EQ name and an incident involving myself was posted above in a white washed/&quot;from the hip&quot; manner.<br>
<br>
A little background for those who give 2cp.  I joined FnF and was lucky enough to be admitted into the officer circle within a short period of time.  As an advisor I was in the habit of chatting with a lot of my guildmates to get ideas and perspectives.  Fuvi had/has plenty of both, thus I'd chat with him in-game a fair amount.  As he states above I gave him my email so we could discuss things at length.  Then, as he admits above, he sent a questionable email aimed at my fiance to see if she reads my emails - in fact we share the email account that I gave to him.<br>
<br>
Here's an excerpt of an email exchange between us where I bring up the issue, in response to Fuvi querying why I questioned his motives:<br>
<br>
My words:<br>
&quot;As I've stated, I value you opinions and your ideas.  I don't value the venom that drips from them quite often.  It's pretty clear why you feel and act the way you do now, so I've received a partial answer.  All the same, using harsh tactics lowers EQ to a level of seriousness that not everyone appreciates and can leech the fun out of it.  Pretty fucking simple really.<br>
 <br>
Now you mentioned trust a few times.  Well, here's my honest and truthful opinion on you with respect to trust.<br>
 <br>
Trust you ideas - yes.<br>
Trust your skill - definitely.<br>
Trust your judgement - when it's not clouded by your disdain for certain people, yes.<br>
Trust your motives - no.<br>
 <br>
Why?  Very simple.  I gave you my email to faciliate easy communication with someone who I view as having good EQ knowledge and ideas.  I get leadership bashing, which is fine.  <br>
 <br>
Then you pull a stupid prank and send an email hoping my fiance will read it.  The motivation for the email?  What else can be assumed - to stir shit.  <br>
 <br>
Now assume your attempt did cause some form of trouble and I came back at you for it.  What would your likely response be?  Truth &gt; all...don't blame me for her reaction, if she doesn't trust you that's a problem with your relationship not with me.  I'm just the messenger.<br>
 <br>
Explain to me how anyone should perceive your gesture as anything else?  Explain to me why I shouldn't question what kind of person you really are, to try something like that on someone you hardly know.? Justify the kind of reaction you'd have if something negative came out of it.  Tell me why I shouldn't transpose that motive onto other things you say and do that follow a similar pattern?  Why would anyone who knows you do stuff like this for kicks trust you in any moral way?<br>
<br>
The impact of your email on my end was mildly amusing.  But the impact on your RL rep with me, not EQ, is pretty easy to figure out.  This isn't a flame, this is a simple fact in response to your query as to why I might not trust you and second guess your actions and motives.  I can forgive something like that, perhaps only because it didn't do the harm intended.  But don't expect me, or anyone else who's experienced this side of you, to take you at the face value you portray.<br>
 <br>
I just don't understand why someone would knowingly burn bridges and paint themselves into a corner, and then say they like it better that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fuvi's response to this was received on one of my home boxes [I'm posting this at work] however the jist of it was:  if any RL harm did result from an email like this a) it wasn't his fault and I should blame my own relationship (which is mirrored in his statement above about Rest/Krit), b) he's just the messenger, and c) he enjoys psychology, he's good at it, and he derives amusement from cause and effect.<br>
<br>
Cause and effect experimentation is great in the laboratory, or in university psych labs.  It certainly isn't warranted in the context of casual interaction in relation to a computer game - my opinion.  My subsequent negative opinion of Fuvi thus culminated from &quot;the email&quot; in conjunction with a number of other instances (involving other people/issues), his reaction and justification to which painted the portrait of the type of RL (not EQ toon) person whom I don't like to interact with.<br>
<br>
Now for Kzan.  I've known Kzan in RL for a long time and we're good friends - he's coming to my wedding in a month's time.  Kzan is a genuinely nice, kind and considerate person.  He leads with his heart and thus can get emotional over issues involving social negativity.  Do a search on Kzan's posts and you'll find him 99% of the time just generally trying to maintain a level of amiability in the community.<br>
<br>
However on issues like this he takes a harsh stance.  As stated we're RL friends, and when I disclosed to him this &quot;email&quot; incident, he was appalled...and apparently he still is appalled - moreso on the principle of the matter rather than any aftermath or effect.  Likewise, he's been privy to a lot of inter-FnF drama/dialogue that puts him (clearly) at odds with someone like Fuvi.<br>
<br>
Some may think people are making mountains out of molehills here.  But I would assume that most people play EQ for entertainment and fun and might reasonably have a negative reaction when all that time and effort spent on a game like EQ becomes tainted, for them, by the actions of one or more people.  EQ is a computer game, the rules and mechanics of which are governed by the 1's and 0's of computer programming.  However central to EQ is the social element the arises from a bunch of people interacting together on a day to day basis - and some folks don't take anti-social behaviors lightly when forced to deal with them on a frequent basis.<br>
<br>
Anyways, a lengthy post trying to put a specific portion of an EQ drama into context.  Make of it what you will.<br>

Maybe me wanting to talk to you about your prank, wich was disrespectful and childish. And asking you to stop.. was enuff for you to hate me. I have been nothing but nice and understanding to the point where I really liked you all up until you started bad mouthing me.<br>
<br>
Nothing bad came from what Fuvi said to kurley... but the motives were not to be a joke. Anyone with class would not send such a joke. Anyone who actually cared about the person he is sending the email to would not send that as a joke.<br>
<br>
Even if it was a joke and the way Kurley responded, the first responce of someone who cares would say they are sorry, it was only a joke. But Fuvi didnt. He just said, if your relationship was strong, it wouldnt hurt it.<br>
<br>
Fuvi even made a pop shot at the injury I got from a car wreck that kept me out of EQ for 30 days. I got mad(because he wasnt my friend and had no right to say such a thing), He never claimed it was a joke ,because it wasnt. It was just something for his amusement, to play mindgames with me.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want me to really post private stuff sliver. I should move his post from leaders section to general section of my board, stating how he wanted you out of the guild long before you actually left because you were bored. I hope you are not board anymore Sliver.. for what its worth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 2:10:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hihi</span><hr size=1> Isharra:<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with how good your relationship is, how comfortable you are in your relationship etc...it has everything to do with abberrant behavior, principals and motives - particularly when you take a number of actions together to form a cohesive picture.<br>
<br>
Sliver:<br>
<br>
Being guildies has nothing to do with it.  You need to read the information provided within this thread carefully.  Using the anonymity of the internet to create amusement from &quot;cause and effect&quot; is no different than a prank phone call.  I'm talking about an incident where someone used personal information offered to them by me, and just tried to stir shit for their entertainment.  I have every right to reject that sort of behavior, particularly when it has a consistent ring.  And it has nothing to do with a sense of humor - anyone who knows me in-game knows about my sense of humor.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the issue is old and the only reason I even bothered posting is because I was pulled into it (not by Fuvi I'll acquiesce) and just wanted to clarify what the shit was about.<br>
<br>
Really, it's just sh!tty that people can't even get along and behave in a healthy manner in a gawd damn video game.  I guess it's just a sad extention of the ugliness that exists in the world.<br>

P.S.  Fuvi, please note that I am trying not to throw sh!t your way - you still play this game on this server and I don't, I can respect that, but I have the right to spells things out when they relate to me.  Speaking earnestly, there were plenty of times I enjoyed chatting with someone who had an appreciation and grasp of EQ mechanics in a vein similar to mine.  However as I've said to you before, I just totally disagreed with some of your tactics and attitudes.

<br>
You weren't even around in the guild when I left, you certainly weren't in the officer circle when I left, and only a couple of people actually know all the circumstances that lead to me leaving the guild and EQ (they were simultaneous).<br>
<br>
I dunno what has you all wound up like a Tennesee cat on a hot tin roof Sliver, but you're a different fellow than the one I remember.<br>

Accusation I referred to was the one about Fuvi saying I should be de-guilded. I want to see it. If he doesn't post it then it's another baseless allegation, one aimed at getting me offside with Fuvi. I would seriously like to see it Bako, I don't think Fuvi would object to you posting it either, so go ahead, no one will call you on posting private material, if both concerned parties agree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhumleanddumle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HumleandDumle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 4:19:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: amen...</span><hr size=1> Hi kurley, if you got time some day, please log on so we can talk some.

They are free to react to it however they want.  They are free to react to me in the video game over that email to you.  I have no problem accepting consequences for my actions.<br>
<br>
You didn't need to make the long post because I'm honest and I always answer questions, what this thread is all about.  I don't regret sending the email, I personally find no harm in it.  I won't lie and apologize even if this makes me look like a better person, because lying is wrong.  <br>
<br>
I always knew I would be /guildremoved from FaF, that's a consequence of my actions.  But what's important to me is that I stood up for what I thought was right, go back and read those threads, Bako never refutes my arguments, he ignores the threads, attacks me personally and/or goes 5 people made this decision so it must be right.  Many of the things I ranted about Bako later makes policy, he just takes time to swallow some pride.<br>
<br>
Fuvi - Break a leg.<br>
<br>
Bako - Thanks I will. :-)<br>
<br>
Sliver was close.  They harped on personal attacks in the chat channel a month ago to me (Bako, Restoria, Rosiel, Cloude and HUmle) I kept asking for examples, this is the best they could come up with and still is.  I bow down to Kzan's skills at personal attacks he layed into Lyns and Gore in a deeper and more hateful way than I ever attacked anyone.<br>
<br>
Again I don't see anything wrong with it, I see no reason to apologize and feel free to react however you want to this.<br>
<br>
I asked for Sliver to be de-guilded when he returned to the game after his long break.  I don't remember asking him to be removed prior to that, but no worries Bako, cut and paste away, seeing a post I would immediately know if I or an editor made it, anything I posted I have no problem with anyone seeing.  The information is generally kept more private for the benefit of who I am discussing, but you apparently wanted me to drag you through the mud in front of the whole guild so removed my leader's access. /shurg, was your call.<br>
