Here is mine for starters...<br>
<br>
Ps  I know the last name is corny, but was looking at a Coke can when I was trying to think of one...<br>
<br>
Czakoriah, Rogue of the White Rose, 25th Season (EST) <br>
 <br>
As it has been recorded in the Archives of Halas...<br>
<br>
Tobias O'Cola was a Captain in Halas Guard, who had gained the favor of the Tribunal when he had slain an Orc Runner trying to sneak into Permafrost Keep. Tobias discovered a note and spell on the Orc Runner's corpse. The letter was written in a language unfamiliar to Tobias, and the other scroll seemed to be some sort of spell. Tobias took the spell and scroll to the Halas High Council. The High Council had a scholar in Qeynos translate the letter, which read:<br>
<br>
Lady Vox,<br>
<br>
I have provided the incantation to break the imprisonment spell to allow you to gate here. The Erudian Mage was a bit stubborn at first, but pain soon took control of his senses. <br>
<br>
Your plan to rule Norrath from Velious is in motion. Ambassador D'vinn has finally been able to get an Orc runner through Butcherblock Mountains, and advised we have the loyalty of Emperor Crush and the Orcs of Crushbone. D'vinn is going to cause a diversion. He will set Kelethin on fire! As the Wood Elves attempt to save their beloved city, D'vinn will order the Orc forces to destroy the spire and seal up the entrances to Felwithe, Ak Anon, and the passage to Butcherblock Mountains. <br>
<br>
My spies also tell me the Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls on Antonica have their forces ready to attack Freeport. Once Freeport falls, they will move to join up with the Gnolls of Splitpaw and Black Burrow, who are tasked to take control of the Spire in North Karana. Our juggernaut will then march on and destroy Qeynos. <br>
<br>
The Iksar Ambassador advised the Iksar nation would not assist us. Lousy Lizards! Once our plan is in motion, I will cut off his green blooded head and send it back to them on a pike. If they are smart they will destroy the spire on Kunark, for it may give them a few more months of peace before we destroy them for their defiance.<br>
<br>
Once you arrive on Velious, I will give the command to my forces to attack Thurgadin. With Antonica and Faydwer in chaos, and travel to Velious reduced to sea travel, Thurgadin will be destroyed in mere hours. The Dwarves of Kaladim can kiss their blue faced relatives 'Goodbye'! We will take no prisoners. The dwarves will pay dearly for the deaths of my ancestors.<br>
<br>
I await your arrival my Queen, and my revenge upon the Dwarves of Thurgadin.<br>
<br>
Kromrif the Mighty<br>
<br>
The Tribunal destroyed the spell, and Tobias lead a raid party into Velious to destroy Kromrif, so no further attempts to free Lady Vox would occur. Tobias hired a Human Rogue in Thurgadin, named Cain, to guide them to Kromrif. Cain's hate of Giant Kin seemed genuine, as he told a story of a merchant caravan being attacked by giants. His father was killed and his mother and sisters were taken into slavery. Cain was not in the caravan, for he had been left in Erudin because of his youth. Cain's deception and betrayal became apparent when the raid party was ambushed on their journey. Cain was calling out orders to Kromrif's forces even as he slit the throat of a wounded Barbarian warrior. Tobias knew this rogue devil must die! Although outnumbered 10 to 1, the Barbarian forces were causing heavy casualties to Kromrif's Elite Guard. Tobias knew the longer the battle raged the less likely he would be able to exact his revenge upon the deceiver, Cain. Tobias began to work himself into a battle frenzy as he hacked and slashed his way over to Cain. A second wave of Kromrif's guard joined the carnage and the Barbarian forces were losing ground quickly. Tobias' muscles ached from exhaustion, but the rush of adrenaline that came as he stood in front of Cain quickly extinguished that pain. Cain's guise quickly changed from confidence to fear as he saw this bloody and gore covered Barbarian warrior staring at him through his signature executioner’s hood. Cain himself had many seasons of training, but he was no match to Tobias' berserker onslaught. Tobias was slightly amused how easily he had manipulated Cain's defensive parries. Another Barbarian scream brought Tobias' attention back to the predicament at hand. He had toyed with this rogue long enough. Tobias forced Cain to dodge a slash by his sword only to be cleaved nearly in two from shoulder to groin by Tobias' axe. As Tobias attempted to pull his axe from Cain's body, Kromrif himself struck the fatal blow. Once the last Barbarian warrior fell, Kromrif order the bodies to be stripped of their armor and the bodies be fed to his dire wolves. Tobias may have been slain that day, but his spirit lives on in his son, Czakoriah. <br>
<br>
Czakoriah took up his father's cause of destroying Kromrif and his kin for their planned betrayal of the other &quot;good&quot; races of Norrath. He has also vowed to send the dragon, Lady Vox, to its death. Although the heart of a warrior beats within his chest, Czakoriah has taken up the mystical arts of a Shaman of Justice. Czakoriah spent only his first 5 seasons training in his homeland, before he struck out on his own to raise an elite force of adventurers capable of achieving his father's goal.<br>
<br>
Czakoriah's destiny led him to the Dwarven City of Kaladim where he attempted to rally the Dwarven Nation to his cause. Czakoriah soon gained the respect of the locals, and was bestowed the honor of being named an Officer in a new guild named 'Brotherhood of Brell'. Although not a follower of Brell, Czakoriah's words and actions showed his goodness of heart and cause. <br>
<br>
Czakoriah's main companion during these times was another Officer in the Brotherhood of Brell, named Joralyx Irongut. Joralyx was a cleric in the service of Brell, who liked to throw back an ale (in the quantity of kegs) after a day of high adventure. While on a quest of for enlightenment, Joralyx met a Barbarian warrior named Oakstone. Brother Oakstone was also youthful in season, but his training with the &quot;wolverine&quot; like claws seemed to senior his true season. Joralyx introduced Oakstone to Czakoriah, and the three adventurers became best of friends. <br>
<br>
Czakoriah knew his adventuring on Faydwer was growing short, and there seemed to be some dissension in Brotherhood of Brell. So not to directly influence any of Brells followers, Czakoriah resigned his commission of Officer within the Brotherhood. Wandering aimlessly for a few weeks, Czakoriah happened into Oakstone in Highhold Pass. Oakstone began sharing the great experiences he had in a guild named the House of Carnage. Looking for more adventurers to take on his cause, Czakoriah was anxious learn more about the House of Carnage. Oakstone set up a rendezvous with Raeynard, an Officer and member of the House of Carnage High Council, and they were off. On their journey to meet Raeynard, Oakstone and Czakoriah literally fell upon bad times travelling through Paineel. For as they enetered the Paineel zone from Toxx Forest, they hadn't allow enough time for their eyes to adjust to the daylight, and were temporarily blinded by the sunlight. Unknowingly, Czakoriah and Oakstone had crossed over the threshold of what is known as &quot;The Hole&quot;, and had sealed their fate, (or so they thought). Luckily enough, Czakoriah had cast a levitation spell just after entering the Paineel zone. This was their life saver, for as they slowly descended into what was to be their deaths, Czakoriah sent a plea to the gods to spare their lives, for their ignorance of the local terrain had betrayed them, and he prayed for them to allow him to fulfill his father's task. The Tribunal heard Czakoriah's plea, and he and Oakstone appeared at the point of where they entered into the pit, but without their provisions. The gods are forgiving but not without penance. Oakstone sent word out to the House of Carnage that he and Czakoriah needed assistance retrieving their equipment from the pit. At the same time, Czakoriah pleaded with the gods to bestow upon them mercy for he did not want the blood of another goodhearted adventurer on their hands for attempting to retrieve their equipment from a zone where only the most seasoned adventurers dare travel. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, Members of the House of Carnage came out in force to assist Oaktone and Czakoriah (who was not even a member of the House at the time). Oakstone's teachings of the House of Carnage were true and of merit. These were a band of adventurers true to each other and dedicated to the House of Carnage. Seeing this display of Honor and Brotherhood, Czakoriah graciously accepted Raeynard's invitation of membership to the House of Carnage. <br>
<br>
The gods were merciful and sent a pair of their minions (for one was not enough), to retrieve their equipment. Czakoriah and Oakstone gave thanks to the gods of the north for their forgiveness and mercy. And here starts a new chapter in the life and adventures of the Highlander. There is, and can only be one...<br>
<br>
From the diary of Czakoriah...<br>
<br>
The hate I feel for the Kromrif and giant-kind is beginning to consume me.... My orderly good moral code is being eaten away by my feeling of anguish and anger I feel over the loss of my father. These feelings were first stirred upon my solo trip to Velious.<br>
<br>
I was meditating when I heard the rumbling footsteps of none other than a giant from the outpost just outside of Thurgadim. I considered my foe and felt that although risky, I could begin to exact my revenge upon this race of dragon loving beings. I summoned my spirit companion and cast as many ability enhancement incantations upon it as I could. I slowed the giant and sent my spirit wolf into action. Regardless of my attempts to take this giant down I could not over come. He caused my spirit companion to despawn and began beating me unlike anything of what appeared an equal season to my train had ever done before. Disgraced, I fled back to Thurgadim where the local guard dispatched him. When the Guards came to me and asked whom they had saved from the giant of Kael, I gave no name. My disgrace is deep and I have felt a medicine man is not whom I am meant to be. <br>
<br>
I say these words now aloud as what I have been feeling for quite some time. I feel my father always hoped and intended me to be a member of one of the Melee Classes, and my choosing the way of a medicine man has only brought disgrace upon my...no his name. The abilities of a medicine man are many but I feel muscle and steel are what will lead me to the destruction of Kromrif and the annihilation of the giant race in whole. My race has few choices as to what training I should take up, but I for some reason the words my father would speak when referring to my mother come to mind...&quot;the White Rose&quot;...<br>
<br>
<br>
From the Diary of Czakoriah...<br>
<br>
Bristlebane has bestowed upon me the skills of the White Rose. He has wiped my mind clean of the knowledge and experience I gained in my 37 seasons as a Shaman of Justice. With the blessing of Bristlebane, I have equiped myself in gear that a Rogue many years my senior would only wish to wear. I will once bring honor upon the House O'Cola. Although, I will miss running with the Spirit of the Wolf, and my many Spirit Wolf companions, I feel my mind is finally at ease as I walk the shadowed path of a Rogue!<br>
<br>
I will avenge thee!<br>
<br>
<br>
From the Diary of Czakoriah...<br>
<br>
Today has been an excellent day! I have acquired my fathers Executioner's Hood. How it came to be, I will not know. Brother Ellu sent word that a merchant in the Bazaar was selling an executioner’s hood resembling the one my father, Tobias, wore. I ported from Faydwer to the Nexus and found that the trader did indeed have my father's hood. My mother, Coca, had embroidered a small note inside the hood...&quot;the love of a White Rose hides in the shadows&quot;. I asked the merchant where she got it, and she stated that she does not divulge the details of her &quot;acquisitions&quot;, but did say that she got it while in Kael. I paid her the platinum and finally my father’s hood was mine! I will give thanks to Bristlebane for allowing me to recover such a treasured item to me.<br>
