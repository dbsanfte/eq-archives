Just need to get it off my chest.<br>
<br>
I was in a 2 party group killing Shardwurms for bile in GR. The place is kind of busy, being Sunday afternoon, and when an auction &quot;paying very well for a good res at EW zone line&quot; comes across I tell my cleric to answer it and make a little cash with all that extra mana she has. She answers the guy and he agrees that her 90% res will meet his qualifications. So she starts running over to the zone. On the way there he asks her how much. She tells him it was his auction and what ever his definition of &quot;paying well&quot; is will be fine. He then claims to be getting money out of the bank. She zones in and sees no corpse. He tells her it is in GD at the giant fort. This makes some sense as he was in GD auctioning so she zones in and runs to the giant fort looking for him. <br>
<br>
After much searching she finds a group and asks if the person oin question is in their group. The answer she gets is &quot;XXXX is my brother he is in EW at the RyGorr fort.&quot; Now she is a little pissed, after all why did he auction that he was at the zone line? In the meantime he starts whining about being poor. Finally she tells him to drag his corpse to the zone line whenre she will res him. No running to RyGorr will be done. (He is a level 38 druid and more then capable, one would assume, of dragging his corpse. We know he is in the zone already so it is really only polite.) He agrees. A few minutes later she gets a &quot;nevermind get someone else&quot; message from him. Now she is a little more pissed and tells him that he should never ask, nor expect any assistance from her. He starts spamming her with rude messages and tells her she is on ignore.<br>
<br>
 I send him a tell indicating that his behavior was rude and that he was obviously a loser. I also told him to make sure to chech out the soapbox today. Next thing I know I am getting messages from his big brother telling me to lay off him because he was &quot;not allowed&quot; to drag his corpse. Excuse me?? If this little brother is so inept that he cannot be trusted to drag his own sorry corpse to a zone line what is doing in a group at RyGorr? I feel sorry for the poor groupmates subjected to this imbicle. Also, this upstanding big brother was one zone away. He  could not get a sow from the dr00000000d and pull his corpse for him? <br>

Like the OP said, feel sorry for the group he was in, or for EW in general.<br>
<br>
I heard something elsewhere in guildsay the other day that made my blood run cold, but what can you say when those involved are respected members, officers even. &quot;I have to log now, my 5-year old wants to play his Ogre&quot; <br>
<br>
On the general issue of rezzes why do you get so many shaggy dog stories that start with a simple rez and then the story starts to get more and more complicated with different zones, names, donations etc. Why don't people learn that if it is a tough one it is better to say so from the start than get a cleric half way across Norrath to learn that actually the corpse isn't at zone, but under a dragon/giant/orc pawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucaillougna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 623<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/02 10:30:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1550.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/Caillou-sm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rant - &quot;It was my brother's druid&quot;</span><hr size=1> I still haven't figured out why people have a -major- hang up about rez'es and being &quot;owed&quot; them somehow.<br>
<br>
I am now 39 and I -still- don't see that I should ever think I -need- a Rez if I don't have a cleric or paladin in group.  I have even been in groups that then start doing a call for a cleric when one or more person has died, when it would be much preferable, to me, to just get back into it instead of waiting waiting waiting around.<br>
<br>
Then... those people who not only expect a rez but demand the cleric jump through hoops to give them that rez.. wtf?  Have any of these people -ever- heard of manners?  And then those people who decry a cleric getting payment for a rez... the cleric is going -out of his/her way-.  If you were asked to go 2 or three zones (or even more) out of your way, spending time when you could be doing other things, wouldn't you want someone to compensate you for -your- time.  How about in the real world.... If you are asked to drive from, say LA to Vegas to pick up a small something for someone when you were doing something in LA, would you be jumping for joy and eager to do it, for free.. oh any driving your own car using your own gas.  How about if the trip was LA to New York and not only with your own car and your own gas but the person thinks you are taking too long when you can't be there in a 2 hours and starts sending you rude messages.<br>
<br>

When is it reasonable to go shopping for a rezz?<br>
<br>
I am at 48 now and it is still only a few hours work to make up for a XP death.<br>
<br>
I take a rezz on raids or if the cleric or paladin is right there. But to go out shopping or wait around for a rezz just doesn't make a lot of sense otherwise, especialy at lower levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucobra102.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cobra102</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/02 10:45:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1550.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rant - &quot;It was my brother's druid&quot;</span><hr size=1> And if you really, really, really want to upset the Cleric, make them do all that and then ask them what percentage it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 433<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/02 10:55:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1550.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rant - &quot;It was my brother's druid&quot;</span><hr size=1> I don't mind doing rezzes for people that have died as long as:<br>

Indeed, people of every class and race have little brothers, and those said brothers will, on occasion, do stupid things and may, in rare circumstances (or not so rare in some cases), behave immaturely.  <br>
<br>
Finally, the DADLoN, on behalf of this one particular druid who, regrettably, behaved so abominably, and his no-account brother, would like to apologize to the other residents of Norrath, particularly those wonderful clerics who generously give of their time and mana, unless they have that water sprinkler thingy which only requires a clicky, to resurrect hapless druids and other assorted type people. <p><b>Enedlithien<BR>

<br>
<br>
First off don't try these on any raids as you will get a natigram, deguilded, killed, and/or hazed by the entire server. <br>
<br>
1) Don't heal the group tank until he is at 20%. When he says 'Heal me sooner!' reply 'Shut up you fookin wuss!'. If by chance you get him killed by doing this... blame it on lag. If the wuss.... err I mean tank uses his discipline when there is only a single mob in the camp, evac to steamfront and tell the group that you refuse to group with wusses that can't tank. <br>
<br>
2) Pull... Pull lots! I mean 8 - 10 mobs. Watch everyone panic and piss themselves as they scream 'EVAC!!! EVAC!!!'. Then just ae root everything, announce that people need to pull back, and start chloroblasting everyone back to good health. Again if you get people killed doing this.. blame it on lag. <br>
<br>
3) Forget to snare! Snaring is for Rangers. The only time a druid should snare is when they are soloing. So you should purposefully forget to snare because then you will get to play out #2. If people die... blame it on lag. <br>
<br>
4) Heal the mob multiple times... make sure to announce it to the group too. This is best accomplished when the tank, or one of the pure casters is at 20% health. Once again, if someone dies.... blameshift to lag. <br>
<br>
5) Always use AE's. That's what they are there for. Only whimps use single target damage spells. It's more efficient to do 100 damage to then entire zone than it is to do 1000 damage to one mob. <br>
<br>
6) Never sit down. Stand up all the time. Don't med, don't summon a horse. Then when it's really critical, /shout OOM. Yes use shout because it's more fun that way. Then /shout Train to zone, and run the wrong way. When you get clear of your group gate out, or evac to zone. If the group asks what happened, tell them you were afk and your little sister was playing your character. <br>
<br>
7) Always port to the wrong destination first. It's pointless to take paying customers to there destination, what's the use of that, they paid... give them a little tour. Better yet, port them to the druid rings in the same zone you are at, just so they know where it is. If you really want them to get their moneys worth... succor them too. My favorite 'tour of norrath' port is Iceclad, and it works really well when you are porting people under level 50. Or wakening lands (wuoshi up) for those over 50. Again blame it on the little sister. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  When people beg for buffs, give them your shortest lasting buff. If someone asks for a 'regen', give them like chloro or something. If they ask for a 'skin' buff give them skin like rock. You get the picture. If they ask for a particular buff, stating the correct name. Politely tell them that you don't have that spell yet, but you saw it for sell in the bazaar for 2500pp, and ask for a loan. <br>
<br>
9) When you are solo'ing. Always announce trains just before you zone. Never announce it before, because that spoils the element of suprise, and there is just no fun in that at all. Make sure that when you announce your train that it is not in common language, use dragonese or lizard speak.. you get the idea. <br>
<br>
10) Last but not least. If you are ever in a zone that has animals in it... always charm an animal. I personally prefer to charm one animal and fear another just to emmit that kind of control. When your charm/fear breaks run like a freak to the nearest zone line, or group making sure to aggro as many mobs as possible. Refer to #2, and #9 on this matter.<br>

Otherwise I usually just eat it.<br>
<br>
I keep at least one foraged fishing grub in my ammo slot just in case.  I'll grab my gear and go on my way, leaving one maggot on me for the off chance that a kindly cleric will trip over the stiff before the rez timer runs out.  <br>

For all of you folks who got a &quot;no thank you&quot; when you tried to pay me, its cuz you were nice &amp; polite &amp; you realized I was taking time out of my life to do this for you....NOT that I owe it to you as a cleric...<br>
<br>
As for that &quot;brothers druid&quot; thing...I am sure every cleric has a story like that....one that I am sure we all would love to forget.  Tell us his name hun....that way we wont make the mistake of trying to find his corpse next time he dies...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 521<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/02 12:40:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1550.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rant - &quot;It was my brother's druid&quot;</span><hr size=1> This weekend did a res in Chardok, spent a invis potion to get there.<br>

saw that the person needed another res in a more friendly area.<br>

didn't res them.<br>

no real emotion, but if you want to waste my time i'll give you one chance then. that's enough for me.<br>

at least the person died at the zone line and i didn't have to get lost wandering around chardok looking for his corpse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthevolcanogod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thevolcanogod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/14/02 1:36:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1550.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rant - &quot;It was my brother's druid&quot;</span><hr size=1> I will look for a rez at Lvls 40, 45, 49 and 51+ because those are the most painful for me to die in.

<br>
I will always travel VIA port (or on foot - not too bad since Luclin came out) back to the zone I died in to request a Rez. I will always offer to drag my corpse to the feet of the Cleric rezzing. I will offer 100PP per 90%+ Rez. I usually get a &quot;Nah, keep it friend&quot; because I spare the Cleric as much work as possible, then I buff the cleric and his party fully after I get back on my feet mana-wise. <p><div align=center>

Many thanks to Amcoria for rezzing me in Rathe the other night, it was 6:00 AM here, I was bound in Felwithe, and he was the nicest guy possible.<br>
<br>
And as far as I can remember, that is the only time I have asked for a rez for myself.  (other than once in Najena, but that doesn't count, because I didn't know crap about the game then, and was asking for a Necro rez..oops.)  Really extreme circumstances.  I don't like to burden others when I can just suck it up and keep fighting to regain EXP. <p><center><img src="http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/extern/821180.jpg"  border="0"></center>

If you're really desperate for a resurrection, my advice is to /join the market channel and offer a specific price. Not just &quot;donating for a 90% rez&quot; but &quot;paying 100pp (or whatever) for a 90% rez in so-and-so zone&quot;. Mention whether or not you will provide transport, etc. <br>
<br>
I do a lot of drive-by resurrections, but if I'm not inside a dungeon I will also frequently monitor the market channel in case of the odd rez job or two. This also works well for ports. You can sit there asking in market all day &quot;Anyone porting for donations?&quot; and get no response, but if you're willing to say &quot;group paying 75pp for port to Feerott or CT&quot;, a lot of porters will come out of the woodwork. <br>
<br>
Also, if you're sending a tell to a random cleric who does not know you, don't bother with the &quot;Hey, are you busy?&quot; *grin* If we don't recognize your name, we know why you're sending us a tell. So just be straightforward: &quot;Pardon me, but would you have time to perform a resurrection in Maiden's Eye? I cannot donate but I would be eternally grateful. My body is at the DSP zone.&quot;<br>

Remember when they fixed hell levels? Well, they fixed em so good that the death penalty is about 1/2 what it is on a normal level. I died when I was 40th and lost 1 1/2 blue bubbles. That's it. *shrug*<br>

At least that is what I got out of the original patch message - I know they specifically mentioned post-50 levels, don't know if they included 40 and 45 in that. I will soon know, I guess. I plan on dinging 40 tonight. <p><div align=center>

They removed the pre-50 hell levels quite a while ago. 4-5 months, I think. <br>
