Anyways, we were fighting two with one being named and a wolf jumped in. The healers (druid and shaman) were low on mana so we had to zone.  When I zoned (second time, first by accident), I had about 52 hp left and to my pleasant surprise, I appear smack dab in the middle of the Maiden's Eye zone with about 15 mobs around me, all red to a 39 warrior.  Of course I moved about 2 feet before I got whacked and killed so here I am posting because its 1Am and im waiting for a corpse move and exp rez from a GM since the game couldn't just settle for zoning me at the entrance, it had to throw me out in the zone to my death. I cant even get my corpse back as I have no location and the mobs are wayyyy too hard and many for me to go... so bored bored bored. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umollycat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mollycat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/12/02 5:48:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1094.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: So I died in Maiden's Eye</span><hr size=1> Hey Fen<br>
<br>
That's known as getting moved to zone safe spot, it occasionally happens when you are killed AFTER you start to zone (as you know you stay in your original zone for about half a second before disappearing).<br>
<br>
It is a guide-rezzable death. Since you'll be at the zone safespot, or thereabouts, and theres no heavenly way you could be there on your own anyways, they can and should move you and rez you.<br>
<br>
Its not really a &quot;safe&quot; spot, its the spot EQ will default characters to if it doesn't know what else to do with them. In some zones (like apparently Maidens Eye) it is insanely dangerous.<br>
<br>
That group got a lot of bad luck last night. It seemed every time we started getting close to a groove someone would overaggro and die, someone would take a wrong turn and aggro more things, some conceited uber would train rockhoppers without knowing, etc....<br>

&quot;Hey, Heag, as you zoned a couple mobs followed 30 seconds behind and my friends didn't make it to the zone in time. Could you please drop what you're doing and come spend some mana on them?&quot;<br>

You didn't even know you killed people until I told you. Nice situational awareness there, how many party members do you let die per night?<br>
<br>
Anyways I didn't have a problem with the rockhopper. Things like that are bound to happen from time to time, and I appreciated you doing the rez after I informed you of what you did. I will get to what I DID have a problem with soon....<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;You have a big mouth. You weren't even in the group, you just decided to pick a beef with me in tell with some snide attitude.<br>
<br>
Of course I was in the group, *I* had the sense to drag aggro stuff away from the zoneline, I took most of them to Grieg, one stayed.<br>
<br>
You'll learn tricks like this with a bit more experience. :-)<br>

All I said was considering you just got people killed you should probably rez them. The people you killed were afk, they never would have known. Then you started getting high and mighty....<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Then to top it off you whine here about conceited ubers. Well welcome to FV, baby. cry me a river. You think I dinged 1 with the stuff I have on my person? no. I'm a talented player with alot of online time, who's seen people like you come and go, like the turnover rate in any McDonalds restaurant.<br>
<br>
Talented I have yet to see.<br>
<br>
Why did I call you conceited?<br>
<br>
I have logging on all the time. Do you REMEMBER what you said to me? I'll refresh you....<br>
<br>
&quot;You should talk to me with more respect considering I am the highest level cleric on the server&quot;<br>
<br>
I laughed for five minutes straight after you said that. You couldn't begin to wonder how little that means to me. That you would ACTUALLY DEMAND RESPECT because you have more levels than anyone else... ROFL<br>
<br>
I have to say it again. You demanded more respect from me because, in your own words, you are higher level than any other clerics.<br>
<br>
Do you have any comprehension of how bad that sounds?<br>
<br>
Now you, and everyone else, knows why I said &quot;conceited&quot;, though I thought enough of you to keep your name out of it. *shrug*<br>
<br>
I know for a fact your guild does NOT condone talking crap to everyone else on the server because of your level. I had people, your own guildmates, apologizing for you in tells after the fact. Grow up.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Your words, &quot;actions speak louder than words.&quot; Well, ya know, someday you're gonna want to take your little whatever character someplace neat and you know who's gonna be there lookin back at you? That's right, me. Remembering your trash talk in game and here.<br>
<br>
I think considering what was said you have a lot more to fear than I do. And, by the way, little man, if you REALLY want to flaunt your uberness for the whole server population here to see (itself worth a /boggle, do you really think they care?) theres nothing you'll ever see in EQ I haven't already seen, fought, died to, or beaten, if it can be beaten. You'd be looking up at me right now if I had stuck with my original FV character back when it went live, and your guild officers know it. :-) I certainly didn't come to FV to be uber, I can do that on my old servers. I came here because I know 99.9% of the people here are a lot nicer. So I found that 0.1% today... you won't bother me in the least. :-)<br>
<br>
You'll find, kiddo, that flaunting your uberness on THIS server won't get you very far. Most everyone else is too mature for that.<br>

Yeh that's right. I am. You should. Normally I'm a great guy. It isnt like I picked some random name in the roster and sent them a tell &quot;RESPECT ME&quot;, no, I was talking to a disrespectful ragamuffin.<br>
<br>
You were rude to send me a tell in the fashion you did. You don't even know me. You didn't even thank me until I chided you. Inconsiderate. I would stop and rez a person out of the blue just to make their day because I saw their corpse lying there. Pissing me off is screwing up a good thing. A couple hundred people will tell you that.<br>

I suggest next time your friends die in a train, petition and see what kind of response you get.  You could have done that last night, you had every reason, I suppose. You act like I did it on purpose.<br>

Unfortunately, the answer you're going to get (if you get one) is sorry, we can not rez for that. As someone said above, you end up at the safe point if you died while zoning or end up far above or below the world and the server doesn't know where to put you.

I ran across Heagan once and i rmeember him helping me out. he is a nice guy. Even some of the nicest people alive have bad tempers... even if they dont, often a rude comment about something they didnt even realize, would set them off... it sure would set me off. I wouldn't have ressed you after a comment like that. now had you begun with something nicer like &quot;excuse me sir, did you realize you trained my group? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &quot; then see how the person responds... if they are rude or uppity when you were nice, THEN you can blame them. but having done what you did, I can't believe he was so kind as to res you. <br>
<br>
and for Heagan... maybe he was a little uppity. As you should well know if you were telling the truth, It is kinda hard not to sound uppity sometimes when you are 60(or the highest level of your class). because he, like i did when my ranger turned 60, had a huge sense of pride that i had finally accomplished what i never thought i would. <br>
<br>
you were both right, you were both wrong <br>
its over, it's done<br>
you can cry, you can have some fun<br>
you can forget, or hold a grudge against someone<br>
and time will show the nature of each of us, every one.<br>

<br>
Heck, if you put your glasses on, you'll see I said I know it happens and isn't worth worrying over. But usually when I post I'm only really interested in talking to literate people.<br>
<br>
As for Heagan, heck I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he was being conceited *in* character, which is fine. I didn't bring Heagan's name into it, he decided to himself. He attacked me here, I told what really happened, end of story.<br>
<br>
I think in his uber mind anyone who doesn't kiss his ass for being &quot;the highest level cleric on the server&quot; is being rude. If ANYONE, from Furor to the lowest newbie, does something stupid like that I'm going to suggest to them they try to make amends. Your imagined level of uberness doesn't mean a thing to me, only your actions do.<br>

You know what's going to happen if you two keep this up?  You're BOTH going to get disrespected by alot of people.  If it's true that the train doesn't bother you, then just let it drop.  Heagan, if you're really a nice guy, then don't let her get to you, it'll only make you more bitter.  If you two can't con amiable to each other, at least try to hit dubious and just ignore each other.  Or learn each other's e-mails, so you don't air your dirty laundry.  It doesn't matter who is wrong and who is right, you'll both get burned in the end.<br>
