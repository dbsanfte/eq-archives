Let me ask you, where in the Media do you hear that this is still the Greastest Country in the world? You don't. Ever. The media is run by liberal hacks. The only station out there that is remotely close to have dual opinions is Fox News. Which, btw.. has the Number 1 and 2 Rated Nightly News Cable shows. <br>
<br>
Its funny.. when one is proud of his country, he's a &quot;clouded&quot; and &quot;high&quot;.<br>
<br>
When one is bashing and namecalling.. he's pointing out the truth about the country and the simplistic views of its citizens.<br>

I suspect the reason some of those Palestenians hate us is, and celebrated Sept. 11th, might have something to do with the American-made smart bomb that was just dropped on their apartment building from an American-made F-15, killing their little sister.  And I suspect that part of the reason those Iraqis and Iranians celebrated is because they identify with the Palestenians.<br>
<br>
People don't hate out freedoms, they hate our policies, and the culture we export (because our culture tends to open up and &quot;modernize&quot; conservative, reactionary societies).  Blaming their hatred on jealousy over our economic success, democratic process, etc... is a cop out.  <br>
<br>
I think the exporting of US culture has done some wonderful things in the world.  But I also think our foriegn policy continues to do more harm than good to the long term-interests of peace and prosperity for our nation.<br>
<br>
We are about to invade Iraq based on dubious evidence that they may still have an effective program to develop nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.  I say dubious because the CIA has said that they do not see Iraq as a serious or immediate threat.  Read:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20021009/ap_on_go_pr_wh/us_iraq_132">story.news.yahoo.com/news...s_iraq_132</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Now North Korea just admitted openly that they have a very advanced nuclear program, and &quot;even more powerful&quot; weapons.  Will the US take the same blunt, threatening tone with North Korea that we have with Iraq?  Will we threaten to invade?  What makes Iraq and North Korea different?  Isn't our current foriegn policy doctrine to remove threats before they can harm us? It would seem to me the loonies running North Korea, who have also invaded their neighbors and regulary fire shots at South Korean troops and vessels, and who in recent years have test fired a long range ballistic missles over Japan, are at least as serious a threat as Iraq.<br>
<br>
My cynical side says no, we won’t take a hard line with North Korea, because to be blunt, they don’t have oil, and are not in a part of the world where than can threaten our supply.<br>
<br>
I love America.  I love our freedoms.  I love our ideals.  But I’m not so blinded by my patriotism as to think that we somehow have a mandate where we can do no wrong.  Our foreign policy in the Middle East in the 80’s (which created Saddam Hussien’s military might to be a “check” in Iran), Latin American in the 70’s and 80’s, and Southeast Asia in the 60’s are all testament to that fact.  There is a huge difference between patriotism and jingoism, and unfortunately, after Sept. 11th some people have tried to blur those lines to avoid dealing with hard questions.<br>
<br>
My personal opinions on the politics of this mess aside, what scares me more than terrorism is how informed the American public is about the world today.  More than any thing else, what America needs desperately right now are informed citizens making rational judgements based on logic.  Unfortunately, what we have are an awful lot of hurt, angry, or apathetic people who get their news in 15 second sound bites, or from talk radio, that never open a newspaper.  America has survived 200 years of threats from the outside, I think we’ll survive the new threat of terrorism as well.  What concerns me more is what we will end up doing to ourselves in the process.<br>

They might truly want to disarm (idealistic I know but still).<br>
<br>
As for why people hate America.  I think both sides are missing things.  The common person in these countries hate us out of ignorance.  Not because of how great America is nor because of how shitty our overseas policies can be.  There is no freedom in the media in these countries.  Leaders control the media.  They do not have access to both sides of the coins and therefore it is ignorant.<br>
<br>
Yes Jarkell the American government has done some super shitty things in other countries.  Hussein has shown that he doesn't want to play ball.  He is simply buying his time to get a weapon to hurt America ... not because it will win a war but because he believes we don't have the balls to do anything about it and knows that the United Nations is full of shit.<br>
<br>
As for North Korea being able to hold a candle against us ... there is no nation or combined nations that have the technology that the U.S. has.  It is no longer a ground troop war (which is why the Korean war was a stalemate).  Yes ground troops will be used but after the USAF has thoroughly demolished everything behind the lines.<br>
<br>
I guess my biggest gripe is consistency.  I want America to either back off until something happens and then beat the living shit out of whoever or be global policeman 24/7.  There is no middle ground as the middle ground will always be played by politicians for votes.  That's what makes me sick. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Phantasmist of 60 Seductions</I><BR>

I'm no Dean Rusk or Richard Holbrooke, but here you are...<br>
<br>
1.  There is an important distinction between nationalism, patriotism, and jingoism.  Patriotism is a good thing... it implies that one will work to preserve what is good and fix what is bad about one's nation.  Nationalism is a mixed bag... for the oppressed and those that celebrate their culture, huzzah.  For those that use it as a matter of individualistic foreign policy, it shows a lack of global perspective.  Jingoism is what we have to defend against internally, as the previous two points can develop to the third if left unchecked.<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to be proud of your nation and your culture.  But don't be afraid to be challenged and don't be afraid to point out what is wrong either.<br>
<br>
2.  The U.S. is not a democracy, it is a democratic republic.  It seems like a small difference, but without the ability for the general populace to vote on every matter of policy, the voting public's only way to influence policy is through a) voting and b) public outcry during non-voting terms.  <br>
<br>
Those who defend leaders and policy without question, carrying the jingoism banner (NOT patriotism) do their own nation a disservice.  A republic NEEDS the whingers and the dissidents.  It cannot rest on mooers.  The mooers are a bigger problem than the whingers, because the mooers accept the bad with the good.<br>
<br>
3.  I would hazard a guess that the biggest reason the U.S. will be more diplomatic with North Korea ... China.  While not &quot;allies&quot; per se, the Chinese very likely would come to the defense of North Korea if the U.S. were to try to attack.<br>
<br>
That would be a Bad Thing.<br>
<br>
Also, don't think that a conflict in North Korea - even one that didn't include China - would be a simple matter of air strikes.  The rugged terrain of the Korean penninsula and dense ground cover makes anything but carpet bombing or close in helicopter rocket attacks really effective.<br>
<br>
Plus, there's the added complication of airspace.  I doubt even a neutral China would allow U.S. warplanes to cross into their space, and South Korea, Japan, the former USSR states, and the Phillippines would all be very susceptible to reprisals afterwards - suggesting a long-term holding force being station in the region, on top what is already there now.<br>
<br>
4.  Terrorism is a tool of those that are unable to face an enemy head on, and is usually only considered after other avenues are exhausted.  It is usually a direct action against the general populace to provoke a reaction from the head.<br>
<br>
Anybody who immediately dismisses the (at least) partial responsibility of U.S. foreign policy in the creation of terrorist states isn't paying attention...<br>
<br>
5. ... or getting his news from FOX.  <br>

Let me ask you, where in the Media do you hear that this is still the Greastest Country in the world? You don't. Ever. The media is run by liberal hacks. The only station out there that is remotely close to have dual opinions is Fox News. Which, btw.. has the Number 1 and 2 Rated Nightly News Cable shows.<br>

Actually, that's a bit pointed.   Rupert Murdoch's newspaper properties are outageously opinionated right-wing tripe, and have garnered a fair bit of popularity not necessarily for their content, but for the bullheaded bellicosity of the writing.  It's not news, it's entertainment.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Liberal&quot; media - comprised of massive mutlinational profit-driven conglomerates - aren't much better.  But don't fool yourself, media is a mirror of the public at large... they don't feed us a liberal agenda unless it sells more papers.  Why do you think the Food &amp; Wine section of your local paper is larger than the international news page?<br>
<br>
I would argue the value of having &quot;dual opinions.&quot;  I don't WANT my media to have opinions.  I want them to present facts.  I'll form my own opinion.<br>
<br>
6.  Coslin, not to harp, but the voting results of a leader who has absolute control over the voting process should be taken with a grain of salt (see - Slobadan Milosevic)<br>
<br>
Also, if you want to compare body counts - take a trip to Vietnam.  While I'm not detracting from the horrific acts of last year, the people who lived under the flight paths of USAF B-52s would likely hold a similar view.<br>
<br>
First rule of politics... nobody is innocent.<br>
<br>
7.  We are at a point in our polictical and military development where most conflicts will take place in urban, populated areas.  A scenario for which the U.S, military is woefully underprepared.<br>
<br>
I'm sure more will come up.  But I need to get back to work for an hour or so. <p><div align="center">

I hope everybody sees the farce in (i think it's FOX) FOX News' &quot;News you trust&quot; campaign.<br>
<br>
You should never trust news.  Question it.  Media Analysis is as fun as it is frightening.  Hell, even if it's just comparing the movie reviews in the New York Daily News and and the New York Post.  Find one movie where the two differ wildly on opinions, and then check to see if Time-Warner or Fox Films produced or distribute the movie.  It's pretty amazing.  If they'll do that for &quot;Bubble Boy,&quot; imagine what they'll do when the stakes are higher.<br>
<br>
The most even, responsible, and fair news program out there is the BBC World News.  Great stuff... makes a mockery out of anything I've seen here in the &quot;media capital of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sad, really, when the most honest news program out in the U.S. is the Daily Show.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoslinroguebarbarian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CoslinRogueBarbarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/02 2:14:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1582.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Confessions of a Curmudgeon</span><hr size=1> Hmm.. one tends to wonder if you contradict yourself..<br>

So, harping back to my point.. if Fox has the Number 1,2, and 4 top rated Nightly news television shows.. I suppose they are just &quot;entertainment&quot;?<br>

You're Damn Right. Except, I fully believe in the Constitution.  Which includes its right to free will, free speech, right to bear arms, freedom of the press (Entertainment, ie National Enquirer, or News Worthy) is the fundamental value of this country. And, before everyone gets all crazy.. It is NOT Outdated. Ask the Supreme Court.<br>

&quot;Friends&quot; is the #1 rated show in the U.S.  I don't ask Jennifer Aniston her views on renewing China's Most-favored Trade status.<br>
<br>
I'm not flaming either... don't get me wrong. I've just found that FOX news (mainly papers, mind you...) has routinely glossed over important facts, critical analysis, and balanced reporting for quick jabs at pols (hate that term - I think it's a NY thing), heated rhetoric, and openly sniping at any Time-Warner holding while advancing the Murdoch agenda.<br>
<br>
Which is fine, in its own way, so long as it is in the open.<br>
<br>
What's funny about the liberal-conservative argument is that they both rally around the Constitution while insisting the other doesn't.  *shrug* The Constitution is not outdated... like horoscopes, it is written in a vague enough manner so that the same precepts can be used to argue widely differing viewpoints - a Good Thing - and has a built in mechanism for self-correction should parts ever become outdated.  Never a question as to the document's worth.<br>
<br>
Now the &quot;well ordered militia&quot; that is supposed to have the right to bear arms?  That's up for discussion.  As is how &quot;well ordered milita&quot; became &quot;the general populace,&quot; how militia groups became criminalized, and how &quot;bear arms&quot; can be taken as &quot;carrying concealed handguns with Black Rhino bullets.&quot;  But, that's an argument for another thread.<br>
<br>
In the interest of full disclosure, I vote Socialist, and I have no qualms whatsoever about leaning to the left or to the right.   Politics is a balancing act.... gotta have weight on both sides to make it work.  I believe in diplomacy over the bomb, and in the power of an informed electorate.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I meant to say this in the original post.  Bush isn't a terrorist, and I'm not willing to say he's a crappy president YET.  I will say, however, that he is one of the worst statesmen I have ever seen in my life.<br>

His comparison of the stock market plunge to a &quot;24-hour drinking binge&quot; lifted the eyebrows right off of my face.

They reflect the political veiwpoint of the people who appointed them.  It has become painfully apparent that turning to them for an impartial judgment is just naive.<br>
<br>
I believe in the constitution to.  It is designed to protect us from ourselves.  In the US we elect our government, and as the saying goes, because of that fact we may not get the government we like, but we do get the government we deserve.  And that's what scares me.<br>
<br>
Our entire foriegn policy agenda right now is being driven by a public appetite for jingoism.  It has carried over into domestic issues like privacy laws and our right to due process.  I am not comfortable with a nation that creates one standard for citizens and another for folks the government labels as &quot;dangerous&quot;.  We had that experience 100 years ago with Native Americans, and the results will be a black mark on our nation's soul forever.<br>
<br>
I agree, attacking North Korea would be incredibly dumb.  But I don't think the fact that North Korea is a militarily &quot;hard&quot; target, while Iraq is a &quot;soft&quot; one, justifies a double standard.  I want a rational, coherent foriegn policy based on the best interests of the United States, not one based on the best interests of a particular economic sector, or one that seeks to divert attention from pressing domestic problems during an election year.<br>
<br>
The American media today is, in general, laughably biased.  They do in fact tell us what we want to hear.  That's why the evening news that showed Palestenians dancing in the street after Sept. 11th never mentioned the billion dollars a year in military aid the US donates to supress them.  <br>
<br>
You won't see any uncomfortable discussions of the &quot;why&quot; behind these conflicts on CBS evening news, and you certainly won't see it on the Fox channel.  To be blunt, Rupert Murdoch's news edeavors are about supporting a particular political viewpoint, not informing people.  You may get a little of it in some print media (the big 4 - Wash. Post, Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and LA Times being the best of the bunch), but still, not a lot.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I have my own politics and opinions.  But I will reiterate, the #1 threat to America today is ourselves, and our own lack of knowledge and understanding about what is going on around us.  It doesn't matter what your politics are.  Don't take things at face value.  Ask obnoxious questions.  Don't simply assume that since politician X is from the party you support, he can do no wrong.  Read a newspaper every day.  <br>
<br>
A poster above cited their support of the 2nd Ammendment.  If American loses it's freedoms it will not be because the US military stages a coup and we need to use our guns to defend ourselves.  It will be because a blind and apathetic public signed those freedoms away, because they just didn't care or know enough to say no. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoslinroguebarbarian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CoslinRogueBarbarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/02 2:41:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1582.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Confessions of a Curmudgeon</span><hr size=1> Eh. sorry.
