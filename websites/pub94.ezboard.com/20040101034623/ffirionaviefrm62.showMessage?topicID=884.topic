<br>
Amercians were angry after 9-11 and the majority supported his actions.<br>
<br>
Inaction would have been the absolute worse thing he could have done. Im a Republican and while I think Bush handled parts of Iraq and Afghanistan (sp) wrong I think he did what for the most part Americans demanded be done.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately its a new world and being the biggest kid on the block doesnt fix it all. After WW II it took us 7 years of occupation to rebuild Japan, now people want us out of Iraq in less than 2.<br>
<br>
It just doesnt add up but its the Fast Food Mentality applied to world polotics. <br>
<br>
Do I think Bush did it all right? No, not really. Do I think he did he best he could based on the information (not all correct) he was given? Yes I do.<br>
<br>
Gore is a good politican but honestly Im glad he wasnt president during this. I'd rather have a Texan in office, right or wrong the world knows we will hit back. The world will never be the same now, and I don't think either as president could change that.<br>

Since it didn't it is all a matter of opinion based on each individual's preceptions of those politicians.<br>
<br>
What I think SHOULD have happened was that the U.S. go into Afganistan, target number one should have been and should have remained Osama Bin Laden. We should not have carried the effort forward into Iraq when we still had business to do in Afganistan, we are spread to thin as it is. <br>
<br>
It is my personal belief that Bush took the opportunity to ride the wave of American empathy and blind anger to accomplish something his father could not or did not want to finish.  I think Bush was motivated by a personal agenda, and not the best intrests of America... certainly not the best intrests of the soldiers that serve under him.  <br>
<br>
I believe that Bush has utilized the military as he personal play thing, without any regard to his soldiers.  Yes, the members of the miltary swear an oath to serve the President and to protect the Constitution, but as President, he should protect his troops with equal loyalty.  I do not believe he has kept the faith with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/24/03 10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I pose a question</span><hr size=1> Zaith:<br>

I am a conservative, I never hated President Clinton. I didn’t like a lot of the things he did or what he brought to the Office of the President. But he was our President, elected as set out by the Constitution. You may not like the person but you have to respect the President.<br>
<br>
Some people would like to believe that he was impeached just because conservatives hated him. Not true. He was impeached for committing Perjury in a case of sexual harassment against a woman. I would want any Elected Official impeached for this, no matter what party they are in. (Now before you all scamper off to find allegations of impropriety, try and constrain yourselves to only those that have been tried in a court of law and found guilty. Just because you believe someone has committed a crime does not make it an impeachable offence.)<br>

 International terrorism is not strictly confined to 9-11. Before we can make a totally correct statement on whether or not Iraq was involved with Al Quada(sp) we would need to consider the numerous reports that indicate they were. So even though the 9-11 statement is irrelevant it is not a settled issue.<br>

After all this time and all the reports and evidence about motives you still think the only reason they didn’t support the Coalition was because of  “If you think someone is going to do something wrong”? They made their choice, the Coalition made its choice, for people to decide after the fact not to consider the choices made is ludicrous.<br>

<br>
First of all, Iraq was on the agenda since before he stole the election.  There was talk of &quot;bad bad Saddam trying to kill my daddy&quot; before 9-11.  His agenda got sidetracked.<br>
<br>
Saddam was a loose end and NOTHING more.  3 short of 500 co-alition troops to date have died tying it up for the Republican party.<br>
<br>
Bush is the puppet for his party.  His brain is so long fried from coke all he can do is read aloud and push horrible unconstitutional actions on our government.  He has done a bang up job of brainwashing the conservative right to thinking he is this upstanding religious man.  It is sickening to watch him propose and pass things that will never last a few years before they are tried in court.  His party knows this and everyone knows that they are all ploys to make the parties polarize before the elections.<br>
<br>
Bush is BLEEDING AMERICA DRY.  He has done nothing to solve the budget.  And correct me if I am wrong but going on frivolous wars does not help.  His economic plans involve none other than the proven failure of Reaganomics.  He cannot afford to lose the old-crotchity-conservative-senior vote so he will not lay a finger on Medicare or Social Security.  Best to just let them die rather than lose the election.<br>
<br>
With the war that we should not have gotten into starting to lower his approval he cant afford to do anything but ban abortion and land on aircraft carriers.  Nothing is going to get done over the next year because it is too politically dangerous.  That is sad.  And that is a sign of very poor character.<br>
<br>
The man is the biggest discrace to our country since Andrew Jackson.  I dont respect him because he doesnt respect himself.  He has so far let himself be a puppet for his party as was intended.  <br>
<br>
If you want to continue supporting him be my guest but know you do it only out of ignorance of whats really going on.  Why do you want us to &quot;shut the hell up&quot;?  If we are so out there and wrong then just ignore us.  Would I be flattering myself if I said that the reason you want us to go away is because you fear us being right about Bush all along?  Shattering one's reality is a very painful experience I know.  <br>
<br>
I can see that you are genuinely perplexed as to why we do it.  Well, I can tell you its not hard to understand.  Just look around and see whats going on.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fvellu>fvellu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><b>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy</b></span><br>  Posts: 457<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/24/03 1:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I pose a question</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That is an incorrect statement.

I apologize, I was referring to the groups who we considered &quot;allies&quot; that did not support the subsequent actions.  Your statement is more accurate, mine was made in context of the original posters post.<br>

The US is the sole and proximate cause of the war in Iraq that took place at the time it did.  Had the US not been interested in armed conflict at that time, there would have been no armed conflict and that is why I chose the word unilateral. <br>

I dont belive I said that I support Bush. I dont disagree that he has screwed up. I was curious what you folks think should have happend. <br>
<br>
Clinton helped this country as president. The economy was going well. Bush fubared since he got into office but I support him because he is the president. <br>
<br>
Ermok, you seem to like throwing around insults to people who try to defend Bush. If people dont stand up and shout that he is a idiot, a coke head and the worst president ever, you think they are stupid, or ignorant. Ignorance, ermok, is when people start spouting facts that are untrue. I dont support Bush because I think he is right, I support him, like I said, because he is President. If it was Gore or Liberman or anyone else, I would stand by thier choice because they were voted in. If you honestly think that Gore would have been a better president and would have handled this situation better, then I have to disagree. I dont think Gore has the balls to do what needed to be done. <br>
<br>
Iraq needed to be delt with. Bush should have taken care of Bin Laden first but Iraq was going to happen at some point. All these stupid bills he is passing seem like death throws of a dying party. I dont think Bush should be re-elected. I hope the next person in office takes a handle on this country and steers it back to where it should be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xethux>Xethux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tyrannical ruler of the Galaxy</span><br>  Posts: 910<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/24/03 1:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=884.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I pose a question</span><hr size=1> LMAO you folk seem to think that the president of the United States has a major affect on it's economy.<br>

<br>
As far as &quot;Reaganomics&quot; goes, Reagan proved that supply-side economics and tax rate cuts work.  He firmly believed that the individual American knew how to best spend his or her money, and his economic policies proved it.  A modicum of research will show that the economy grew at a record pace, millions of people move up the economic scale (in real, adjusted dollars), and although the deficit grew on his watch, it was still at a lower percentage of the GDP when he left office as when he entered.<br>

The KKK comment was with out a doubt one of the most egregious comments you have made in a while. So from your lead in I would guess you already know you don't really have anything but will try and cover the lack of substance with rhetoric, obfuscation and liberal doses of ad homonym comment to try and bolster what can't be bolstered.<br>

Reread the the thread, you might notice no one attacked you, but it wasn't hard to find overwhelming contradictions to your claims.<br>
