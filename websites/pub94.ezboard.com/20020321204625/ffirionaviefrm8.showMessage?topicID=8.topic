(ANY)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Bertoxxulous</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>The god of disease and decay. A seditious and unpleasant creeping comes to mind when thoughts turn to Bertoxxulous. It is often thought that without this god things might never fall into chaos and age. His followers are never good, nor are they orderly. (DE – NE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Brell Serilis</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>A complicated god to define. His most prominent worshippers are, of course, the dwarves of Kaladim. However, if the rumors are indeed true, he is the creator of many races, both good and evil, orderly and discordant. Regardless of the truth of the matter, many evil races do indeed worship Brell. However, the belief that he created such creatures is not held among most races of Norrath. In fact, the course of his worship among most societies has been that he is not evil, but a lover of creation in its purest form. He is worshiped as a non-evil deity, and is most often considered an orderly being. Modern worship of him follows that course. (N/ON - NG/OG - DN/DG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Cazic-Thule</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of Fear. Mindless terror. Order and discord are irrelevant to this god; he cares only for the paralyzation of fear. As long as the result is fear, the cause or method is of little consequence. How his followers choose to direct terror is up to them. His followers must be evil. (NE – DE/OE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of thieves. His followers accept only one tenet, that laws are something to be ridiculed. As his following among the dark elves might indicate, he is not necessarily only a god of fun and tricks. While each society will have a slightly different understanding of his nature, non of his followers can be orderly. (DN – DG/N/DE/NE/NG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Innoruuk</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of Hate. His primary places of worship lie deep within Neriak but his power is universal; it touches everyone at some in their lives. He has followers among many people of Norrath. His followers must be evil. (LE – NE/CE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Karana</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of Storms. His essence is the torrential rain and fury of the storm, the discord of the storm and the goodness of the nourishing rain. His followers can't be evil or orderly. (N/DN/NG – DG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Erollisi Marr</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Goddess of Love. Her designs are in direct opposition to those of the god of Hate. It might indeed be true that her influence is as far reaching as is Innoruuk's, and that even the darkest heart can be touched by Love. Her followers must be good. (NG/DG/OG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Mithaniel Marr</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of Righteousness and Truth. His is a more forceful goodness than that of his sister, Erollisi. Order and goodness are his realm, and his sword arm defends both. His followers must be good and can not be discordant. (OG – NG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Prexus</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of the oceans. Most often worshipped by those who sail the seas. For many, such worship is not just a desire to avoid his wrath while at sea. Prexus despises Bertoxxulous and calls Rodcet Nife ally. His followers can not be evil, but you will find as many who love the seas for their wild waves as for their calm on a clear night. (N/NG/OG/DG/DN/ON)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Quellious</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Goddess of peace and harmony. As seekers of inner peace, her followers can never be discordant or evil, and are most commonly both orderly and good. (OG – N/NG/ON)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Rallos Zek</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of war and battle lust. While there are indeed good and just reasons to do battle, those are not the only reasons. Rallos worshippers are those who love battle for any cause, and reason. They can never be good, though some are not as evil as others. (DE/NE/OE – N/DN/ON)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Rodcet Nife</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Prime Healer. Only those of good heart can follow the god of healing. Whether they choose the path of order or discord is not important, as long as they heal the hurts and destroy the disease of the world as they travel that path. (NG/OG/DG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Solusek Ro</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God of Fire. Fire is, of its very nature, a discordant element. Often his followers worship him as a destructive force, a power of chaos and ruin.. But not all of those who follow the Burning Prince see him that way, and some even see fire as a cleansing thing. His followers can't be orderly and tend not to be good. (DN/DE – N/NE - DG/NG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Tribunal</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>God(s) of Justice. Justice is by no means the same thing as the truth and valor of Mithaniel Marr. For followers of the Tribunal, order is the primary concern. Some followers of the Tribunal believe that justice can not exist without a measure of concern for those it affects, but it is argued (often and at great length) by most followers that this is a tainting of justice, not a tempering of it. Followers are almost always orderly, and some are good. (ON- OG - N)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Tunare</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Mother of All. It is said that she created the elves, who in time became the orderly high elves and the more discordant wood elves. Her power is that of growth and life, encompassing both order and discord as forces of nature. Her followers can be of any non-evil alignment. (N/NG/OG/DG/ON/DN)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Veeshan</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Virtually unknown in Norrath, only bards know much of her mythology and are still willing to worship her. She is believed to be the mother of all dragons and dragon kin. Otherwise, the lore about the nature of her worship is all but lost. Her followers interpreted what little they know about her and, perhaps as much through ignorance as from truth, have created a path of worship to her that eschews order, discord, good and evil in equal amounts.
