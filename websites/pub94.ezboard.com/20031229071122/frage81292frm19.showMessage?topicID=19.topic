The youth ran wild through the forest, playing and singing among the trees. The smell of Elven wine and fresh flowers filled the air. Rosetta sat on the porch of her small cabin near the edge of town awaiting her husband, Arik. They'd been married for nearly three and one-half years now and were both still as deeply in love with one another as the day they'd said I do.  Rosetta watched the children running around, playing tag, chasing bixies and laughing.<br>
<br>
  Her mind wandered to the secret place she dared not share with anyone else - her life-long dream that she'd given up in order to marry Arikonias. Her dream was to have children of her own. She was of Wood Elven decendancy, a 'commoner', and her husband, Arik, was of Elven Royalty. It was the kings decree that the blood of Elven Royalty shalt never mix with that of a common elf, or any other race on Norrath, for that matter. Rosetta prayed secretly every night to the goddess Tunare. She prayed for a miracle, a child of their own.  'Oh well' she thought to herself, as she wiped a tear from her eye and went back inside to start dinner. <br>
<br>
<br>
   Their cabin was small - a sitting room, a kitchen and  2 bedrooms. One was mostly used for storage of Arik's weapon supplies for his shop, the other was theirs. Their living room was quaint, a small cedar bench, with cushions, and a table with a lantern upon it. It also had a rocking chair near the fireplace where Arik would sit up on nights he couldnt sleep, reading the news from the far away land of Freeport.<br>
<br>
 Arik was due to return home at dusk, as that was the time his smithing shop closed business for the evening. He had once been the Captain of the Fewithe guard, but had given up his position to marry his love, Rosetta. Now, he sold fine steel weapons and forged armor for a living.<br>
  <br>
  As she was finishing up the wild rabbit stew, Arik came through the door. They spent the night like most others, having dinner together, talking of the days events, and sitting on their porch watching the youth play until their parents called them home. Then they turned out the lights, and went to bed. <br>
<br>
A brisk rustling noise awakend Rosetta, who'd always been a light sleeper. 'Arik' she whispered, 'Arik I heard something outside'<br>
<br>
'Its probably just a wolf, they cant get in the cabin. Don't worry, go back to sleep' he mumbled.<br>
<br>
'No, I heard something, and it wasn't a wolf! Please go check and see!' she pleaded<br>
<br>
 Arik stumbled out of bed and found the lantern and his sword, he carefully opend the front door, looking both left, then right out into the darkness. He saw nothing out of the ordinary, and was just about to close the door when something near his feet caught his attention. He was startled and nearly droped his sword as he tried to make out what it was he was seeing. He kneeled down to get a closer look, realizing that what he was seeing, was a small seemingly hand made basket, and something inside of it was moving. <br>
<br>
'Rose! Rose!' he called as she came into the main room of the cabin. 'You will never believe what Ive found on our porch!'<br>
<br>
   Rosetta walked very slowly to the table, where the basket lay, noticing the wrappings were alive with movement, she peeled back the cloth that covered the basket. What she saw brought immediate tears to her eyes. She noticed a letter, and began to read it carefully. <br>
<br>
'May Tunare bless you with a child of your own' was all it said.<br>
<br>
  Rosetta cried as she took the infant girl from the basket, and held her within her arms so close to her heart. She thanked Tunare countless times, as tears flooded her face. Arik and Rose had been blessed with a baby of their very own, a baby elven girl. 'We shall call her... Katrinity' she said with an emotional quiver in her voice.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
  The sun came up over the trees in the Faydark, the morning mist had set in the forest. Arik, who hesitantly parted with his wife and their new baby, headed off to run his shop for the day. Rosetta made her way to town with her infant daughter in her arms, walking briskly yet carefully as not to wake the sleeping baby. She couldn't take her eyes off of this precious creature that'd been bestowed to her. She was going to the market to get a few things as she had not been prepared for a child. As she boarded the elevating plank that would carry them up to the tree tops of Kelethin, where the city itself was located she thanked Tunare once more for such a blessing. She shopped through various merchants, bought bottled milk, cloth scraps and patterns for clothing, soft spirok down for a crib mattress, and plenty of sewing thread.<br>
<br>
    After her shopping was finished, and her purchases taken home, she fed, bathed and dressed the child and set out for her parents cottage on the west side of the forest. They'd been rightfully disappointed in her choice of a husband, but had accepted Arik into the family reguardless of the fact they'd always wanted grand children and Rosetta was their only child. She took a deep breath as she knocked on the cottage door, unsure of how her parents would react to her news. Her mother answered the door, holding a cup of qeynos tea. She stood there for a moment, observing Rose with the baby in her arms, looking puzzled and somehow surprisingly calm.  <br>
<br>
'Mother&quot;, Rose spoke with a shakey voice, &quot; I'd like you to meet you're new grand child, Katrinity'. <br>
<br>
Her mother, without a word, began to sob. This woman who had raised Rose to believe heavily in the power of prayer, didn't need much convincing. She took the child from Rose's arms and kissed her on the forehead while Rose told her the whole story. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
   Katrinity seemed to grow and learn at the pace of a wolven spirit. She was highly intelligent, learned to speak in complete sentences from the age of only a year. She walked with grace and stability. She had bright blonde hair and the deepest aqua blue eyes ever seen on any elf. When her second birthday came around, Katrinity was speaking 5 different languages and knew a good number of spells. <br>
<br>
   Rose and Arik never let her out of their sight. Arik had nicknamed her 'Katie' after his own deceased mother, Mistress Kathryn Starbane of the Felwithian Nobles. Arik's daughter was the pride and joy of his life, he knew he'd never want for more than he'd been blessed with thus far. He would take Katrinity to his shop with him on the days that Rosetta was teaching her Tailoring Classes to the young maidens of the Faydark. The patrons of his shop adored her as well. Rosetta would spend the days that she didn't teach tailoring taking Katrinity out into the forest and letting her play with the other children. Katrinity seemd to have a charming personality, drawing the other youth to her in abundance. She always seemed to be the center of attention. <br>
<br>
  On Saturday mornings, Arik, Rose and little Katie would go to market in the tree city. Katrinity was such a well behaved child and many of the residents would comment on her behavior and how well advanced she seemed to be for her age. When Katrinity's fifth birthday came, they knew that it was time to enroll her in school. Her gifts seemed to be centered towards enchantment, so they took her to the Southern Felwithe Academy of Arcane Science to have her tested by the guild master. Sure enough, their intuitions about their daughter were correct. She was definately advanced in the ways of the Enchanter. She began schooling immediately. <br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Life was great for the Starbane family, Arik's business was doing quite well, Rosetta had recieved Grandmaster cerification for tailoring allowing her to now run her own small home-based sewing business and Katrinity was doing exceptionally well in school. They lead a busy but very happy life. <br>
<br>
One day, Rose had just  finished up her daily orders when Arik came home with a teary-eyed Katrinity in his arms.<br>
<br>
'Whats got you down sweety?' Rose asked her daughter.<br>
With a trembling lip the child replied ' the other kids at school'<br>
'Why are you so sad? what did they say?' her mother interrigated<br>
'Its not what they say, its.. well they all have brothers and sisters to play with, and I dont'  Katrinity said as she burst into tears<br>
<br>
 Rose and Arik knew that this day would come, and they'd have to explain to her how she came to be their daughter and why she would never have siblings. The three of them took a long walk in the forest and the whole story was explained with a few tears and smiles along the way. <br>
<br>
 Time passed and Katrinity made friends her own age, which helped calm her desires for siblings considerably. One particular  friend, Nenuvin, played over at their home every day - after school. Katrinity and Nenuvin seemed to be quite inseperable. Some children seemed intimidated by her high level of intellect, but not Nenuvin, he saw her as his equal. <br>
<br>
 Rose hadnt been feeling well for a week or two. At first she thought perhaps she'd eaten some bad elderberries, but as time passed she realized it must be a bug of some sorts. When after the third week passed, and she wasn't feeling better, Arik insisted she be seen by a cleric. Rose never was one to like clerics, and she was quite insistant upon a house call rather than going into the guild in felwithe to be seen. Sulonia, an old friend of theirs, came out to the house to look her over. After a standard examination and inspection Sulonia asked to speak with Arik alone. Arik was clearly concerned by the need for a private talk, but agreed just the same. <br>
<br>
'Arik,' said his old friend, 'I have some mixed news for you'. <br>
<br>
Arik's mind began to race. He feared the worst, thinking his wife had caught a plague or perhaps an outlanders disease. <br>
<br>
'You're wife, she's going to have a baby'. <br>
<br>
  Arik sat in silence, stunned. He realized that this was against the laws of the Faydark. He realized that should this child be born here, he or she would be taken by the king and that He and Rose would both be held for treason. Arik took Katie to Rose's mother for a few days visit so that he and Rose could have time to talk and sort things out. Sulo had agreed to keep what she knew to herself, as she was a loyal friend. Arik told Rose the news. She was quite shocked and held many emotions at once. After much praying and soul searching they knew what they must do. <br>
