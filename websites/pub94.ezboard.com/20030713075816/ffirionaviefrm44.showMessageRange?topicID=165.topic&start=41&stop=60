Please privde a link.<br>
<br>
I have found NO reports of magicians soloing planar mobs with the new fire pet. It only exists on Test and the number of high-level magicians on Test is rather low, so it is not too surprising that first-hand reports may be rare. I'd like to read one, so please prive a reference to back up your claim.<br>
<br>
It may not matter too much. *I* can solo planar mobs with my air pet today! (And possibly earth pet, hehe, have to give that a try.)<br>
<br>
I may have to post a rant about the concept of &quot;signature spells&quot; because it seems kind of short-sighted to me. Classes are not defined by spells, but by abilities. That is amply demonstrated by so-called &quot;signature spells&quot; being found on items equipable by other classes, and the fact that many classes share the same spells, but in slightly different ways. For instance, beastlords get many of the same spells shaman do, but at a later level. Shaman and enchanters both get slow and haste, but each one is slightly better at one than the other. Wizards and magicians both get DD spells, but wizards consistently get better, more efficient DD spells than magicians. (For the record, mages do not consider CotH to be a &quot;signature spell.&quot; Some consider it a nuisance, heh.)<br>
<br>
Even if we allow that Ice Comet is a wizard spell, giving it to the wizard pet makes sense, just as giving it to NPC wizards makes sense. I love fighting wizard frogs in Seb. They spend all their time casting. Sure, when they cast Ice Comet and it lands on me, it hurts! But it rarely lands because my pet keeps interrupting its casting, hehe. The point is that NPCs cast Ice Comet, not that wizards are fun to fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nueelien>nueelien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thermonuclear Warlord</span><br>  Posts: 573<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/03 10:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A serious concern</span><hr size=1> Taken from the mage boards<br>

<br>
Currently the level 49 fire pet is more useful that either of the standard fire pets we receive between 50-60 (don't know about the 60+ one... but from what I've been told it's more of the same). I can count the number of times I've ever casted the fire pet spells in question on no hands... since I've casted it absolutely zero times (other than testing it to see what it does/doesn't do in a safe environment). As having pets is one of the main reasons we mages exist and can out DPS most classes it only makes sense to look at ways to fix a problem which renders a pet useless. <br>
<br>
Are the current changes on the test server for fire pets going to wreck the game and make wizards superfluous (big word of the day... heh)? I doubt it. The spells that these fire pets cast are limited by the pet's low mana level (as I've heard it, much lower than an PC of the same level... even though reclaiming and recasting a new fire pet may mitigate this somewhat), spell selection (we don't get to pick which spells are being cast... hopefully the right ones at the right time, but how many NPC's still cast the wrong spell at the wrong time?) and general usefulness. The mobs I'm hitting at the level I would obtain these pets often resists these spells (even if Malaised), and generally not add to my DPS as a fire shielded air/water/earth pet could... or even a spell such as Dyzil's Deafening Decoy. In a solo situation the new fire pets are still useless... an earth pet which roots most mobs for my level or an air pet which stuns mobs are much more useful. <br>
<br>
The way I've interpreted your comments Faramir is that you're more upset that mages get to cast a pet which infringes upon trademark spells which wizards have. So should rogues be upset that our water pet can backstab? Monks and Barbs/Trolls/Ogres because our air pets can stun? The powers that be in SoE have decreed that our mage pets above the 50th level take on the characteristics of specific classes. They also decided that fire pets are the equivalent of wizards. If you don't like the fire pets casting wizard spells... how about you petition them to make fire pets into enchanters... I'd love a pet who could provide some crowd control (/rofl). <br>
<br>
Bottom line is that SoE is trying to make fire pets more useful to mages who currently find zero use for them. Whether all the changes implemented on the test server make it to the live servers remains to be seen... that is why it is called the test server. But I say good on SoE for at least trying to find a way to make our fire pets more useful to us. <br>
<br>
And don't worry Faramir... I will throw over my new and improved fire pet for a proper wizard to hunt with any day... and I can't think of any one who would think that this pet could ever take over the role of a wizard (unless my pet could  evac me.... hmmm... time for me to go send in some feedback to SoE... hehe).<br>

Why?  Because a 62 mage water pet outdamages a 62 rogue with Ragebringer mainhand and the LSoEE offhand, which is a pretty standard weapon set at that level for rogues.  Add in mage nuke damage output and rogues get left in the dust.  Admittedly, the tank must position proporly to let the pet backstab, but it's still rediculus.  So yeah, rogues are complaining... mages have decent utility, while rogues have far less, and now that mages can outdamage us in Melee what the hell are we supposed to do?  With a raid guild we can hoist ourselves back into the competition, but yeah, those water pets are an embarassment to rogues right now.  They can even assassinate.<br>
<br>
As to the mage pet casting... they AI still doesn't match a well played wizard, and the mana pool is indeed low (WTB KEI for Jabober!).  So not all that impressive.  But Atol's shouldn't make it into the game.<br>

I am not asking for much high lvl wizard has a dps of around 350-400.  So give my animation say 325 so the wizard dosnt feel threatened.  MT has 9k or so raid buff so I will settle for 8.5k and all the defense AA that should be cool...O yeah make my pet a pally so it has one Lay of Hand ready and some stuns.  Hell while were at it make the weapons Willsapper and one of those snare weapons.  Choatic backstab would be cool also, if he had that I think I would use him a bit more.<br>
<br>
Gees how can a lvl 52 wizard complane about somehting that he isnt going to be group with anyway.  I am confused at what lvl the mage is that is using the pet if it Reynn and it her lvl 62 pet then chance are I can give a fly F that she can kill all the no/little exp mob in FG I dont see her going there to lay waste to FG any time soon.  The place they do hunt have mobs that hit for 500-700 I am guessing fire pet would last what 4 5 secs? solo.  <br>
<br>
I havnt recalled one time where weve been group and someone said O look a mage we can not bother to ask the rouge to come because the mage can bring a pocket rogue.  Lets lose the wizard also because they have a fire pet woo hoo.  Get over it I am not sure they need snare/root as sony has basically decided mage will not get that power...look at teh ring of immobilization from VT.

In that case, let's give wizards the clarity spell at 57 or so.  After all, any enchanter who is still casting Clarity would be light blue or green to you.<br>
<br>
Ice Comet IS a wizard-defining spell.  When you're a young wizard, Ice Comet is THE spell you look forward to casting.  I'm 57 and I still use it at times.  Not as efficient as draughts, but it's still a good spell.<br>
<br>
Fire pets should not cast ice spells.  Mage pets are elementals.  Elementals are strong in and against their element.  Ice is the opposite of fire.  For me, that's the end of the debate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faramir42>Faramir42</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/25/03 8:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A serious concern</span><hr size=1> Lets be clear about something, pets are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>modeled</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> after other classes. There is nothing wrong with the fire pet being modeled after a wizard. <br>
<br>
The water pet only has the rogues backstab. The Earth bashes like a warrior, air fights like a monk. But they each only get a small percentage of those classes abilites. Water doesn't get instill doubt, or any of the other rogue abilites. Same with air. It doesn't have FD incase it's losing. <br>
<br>
But the test fire pet has almost every non porting spell the wizard gets between levels 49-52. Every stun, root, nuke, area effect, snare and shield and damage shield. That's alot. That's is what a wizard is when it comes to fighting. <br>
<br>
So not only does it get our absorb damage shield spell, it gets whatever the mage casts on it, it gets our nukes, our roots and snares <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it's melee abilities and it's own elemental burst attack, which I believe doesn't require mana. It's a level 52 wizard with 2500 hit points. <br>
<br>
If it's is casting Tishan's discord Atol's shackles, well, those are quest or npc dropped spells. Atol's drops through out Kunark, and Tishan's you get for handing over 1 of four different spells. <br>
<br>
That seems more like making it a wizard then modeling it after wizards. <br>
<br>
For the person that said they didn't read anywhere someone taking down planar mobs on the mages site, your right, I was wrong, they came and posted on the wizard site about doing that. <br>
<br>
To Nueelien, sure, you can quote a wizard saying they didn't care. I can go and quote mages that didn't like this. Like the one that thought it should be modeled after a mage not a wizard. Even the first person posting said it was over powered. <br>

Again, what's sad is how many mages keep missing what wizards are saying. <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:medium;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We are all for stronger fire pets.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> We just don't like how they went and gave a pet many of the spells that are unique to wizards. But over and over, mages keep saying the same thing. The pet needs to be upgraded, it sucks in it's current form.<br>
<br>
We also know that there are many spells that are unique to mages, and that if they ever gave them to wizards, you would be just as upset. It's easy to sit there and say, Oh, no we wouldn't. But if it really happened, I'm sure the mages would be emailing Sony all about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thexool>The Xool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://lucy.fnord.net/gfx/gem_26d.png" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Quote Nazi<br>

The water pet casts an ice spell. Always has done. Whats so sacred about ice spells?? Not like a mage can pick the spells the pet casts. Rangers and druids get cold based nukes, are you complaining about them too? Its a sad day if a wizard can only get a group because they can cast ice comet.<br>

<br>
Ice Comet is special to us, in the way that Lay on Hands is special to paladins, or Harm Touch is to shadow knights. It may not be the most useful thing ever, but to us, it symbolizes our class. Seeing another player have access to it stings a bit.<br>

<br>
Ice is frozen water.  Water is anathema to fire.  Therefore, a fire ELEMENTAL pet should not cast ice spells.<br>
<br>
A water pet can cast ice spells all it wants.  Ice is frozen water, after all.  That makes sense.  But they shouldn't be very strong, as the water pet is modeled after the rogue.<br>
<br>
Let's get this perfectly straight right here and now.<br>
<br>
Wizards ARE NOT against having a fire pet that is worth using.<br>
<br>
We ARE against our class-defining spells being used by pets, which, in the grand scheme of things, are backup party members.<br>
<br>
Ice Comet, though only leverl 49, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a wizard class-defining spell.  In pre-Kunark EQ, it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> spell to get.  It was the epitome of wizard spells.  And until 60, there is no other spell that matches its damage.<br>
<br>
Give fire pets spells that make sense, up their melee output and leave the ice spells for someone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showMessageRange?topicID=165.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showMessageRange?topicID=165.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showMessageRange?topicID=165.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showMessageRange?topicID=165.topic&start=81&stop=82>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showPrevMessage?topicID=165.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showNextMessage?topicID=165.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.threadControl?topicID=165.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=165.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=165.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm63">Ayrielle's Story Contest!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm44>Tower of Magick</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
