A plaything used for the young scout's enjoyment or something she would wear to frighten the children of Halas as she dashed about shouting that the residents were to bring her the children because she was hungry.  The more she wore the mask, the more she had need of it.  She could see through the mask better than she could see without it.  She could move through tight places with ease and grace, unlike the other Roses whose curses could be heard far behind her as they failed in the task.<br>
<br>
Andora's fingers traced the mask as she resisted the urge to bring it to her face.  Cappi had warned her that there would be consequences to her actions, even wearing the mask.  He watched her, noticing the changes over time.  Andora snarled, throwing the mask across her bedchambers.  She began to pace, chewing her lip as she thought.  &quot;What is wrong with me?&quot;  Her eyes went back to the mask that lay across the room on the bare stone floor, mocking her.  Perhaps it was her lost faith that made her feel as if it were hopeless.  She hadn't believed in anything other than her own abilities in so long...<br>
<br>
Andora shook her head.  &quot;No.  To believe in something other than my abilities would be certain death.&quot;  Andora stopped pacing, staring at the mask.  &quot;You have done this to me, haven't you?  You have shined a light into the darkest corners of my soul, awakening something that was always there, slumbering, waiting...&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora thought of the bloodlust in her that screamed for deaths.  Could she speak to Cappi about these things or would he send a Rose to assassinate her?  Who could she confide in?  No one would understand the emotions that welled inside of her, the need for blood and death.<br>
<br>
Andora walked across the room, kneeling beside the mask.  She picked it up with both hands, licking her lips as the need grew inside of her.  &quot;I think I know where to find someone that would understand the need.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora climbed to her feet, gathering her things quickly.  She had made a decision.  The Clan needed maps in that part of the world so there would be no questions as to why she would venture so far.  She would get her answers, one way or another.  She smiled, &quot;A decent rogue can make a good bit of coin in Freeport, as well.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/bj.dailey/andora.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andoraofhalas>Andora of Halas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/03 11:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1264.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Magical Attributes (cont.) - The werewolf...</span><hr size=1> Andora put Agaar's concerns for her well-being out of her mind as she waved to him, wishing him luck in his fasting.  She turned away from Halas, throwing her pack over her shoulder, the snow crunching beneath her feet with every step.<br>
<br>
Andora turned to look over her shoulder at her home, a feeling of loss and dread washing over her.  Her long red hair whipped around her, lashing at her face in the gust of cold, hard wind.  She sighed, pushing the feelings aside as she looked forward.  Forward, always forward.  That is where the future lay, the future that was so... bleak.  Bleak like the dreary skies in the Qeynos Hills when their beloved Rainkeeper decided to throw a fit to make his followers tremble in fear and awe.<br>
<br>
Andora shook her head again, her jaw setting with determination.  She was a Rose, she would prevail.  She ignored the cubs and whelps that passed her.  They were of no concern to her.  She had more important things to worry with.<br>
<br>
She walked through the peaks, oblivious to everything around her.  She knew the pass all too well with the amount of times she had traveled it since she was a child of ten or eleven years.<br>
<br>
McLish shouted as he tore at some gnoll pup nearby, bringing Andora out of her musings.  She walked over to the fire, settling down for the night.  She would rest here and move on in the morning.  Lying near the fire, snuggled down in her warm furs, Andora closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah am tellin' ye, lad.  Da wereywolves be sumtin' ye not wantin' tae fool wit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora frowned, rubbing her eyes as she sat up.  &quot;Who is it that cannot keep his damn mouth shut so that others may sleep?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Watch yer tone, lass.  Da old man be tellin' his tale.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tale, indeed.  Do I look like some little girl to be bounced on your knee while you spoon-feed me your fairy tales and horror stories?&quot;  Andora sat up, glaring at the men around the fire.  &quot;Some of us need rest.  Some of us have important things to-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ain't no tale, lass.  Be deh truth it be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora raised an eyebrow at the old man.  &quot;What is the truth?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wereywolves, lass.  Day be real.  Day wander da plains, terrorizin' our kin, Clan McMannus.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora climbed to her feet, gathering her belongings.  &quot;I'll find out if what you say is truth, old man.  I was planning on stopping to... visit... Clan McMannus anyway.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora rolled her furs up, stuffing them in her pack and nodding to the men gathered at the fire.  She darted off into the darkness, slipping through the shadows as she entered Blackburrow.<br>
<br>
The stench of wet dog, dung and rotting flesh and bone caused her stomach turn.  &quot;I hate this filthy place.&quot;  She held her breath, trying to avoid taking deep breaths as she ran through as quickly as possible.  Taking short gasps of air without breathing through her nose was not enough.  She had barely made it through when she began to feel nauseous.  Clamping a hand over her mouth, she made a mad dash through the tunnel and into the hills of Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Qeynos Hills was just as uneventful then as it always was for Andora.  The only thing she ever saw were bears and wolves.  She thought of the humans that always shouted for protection of the wild beasts and then of the McMannus clan.  She wondered how much they would pay for the pelts and thought she would ask their current prices.  If it were enough, she might be persuaded to kill a few of the beasts and work their hides.<br>
<br>
Andora reached West Karana at dusk.  She immediately searched about for stories of werewolves and heard that there was one werewolf that occasionally attacked travelers.  It was weak, she was told.  Hardly anything for her to be concerned with, she was told.  Andora set out to find the beast, wondering how much someone would pay for its pelt.<br>
<br>
Ready to give up in her search, Andora laughed as she thought about shouting for it and calling it to her like a dog.  &quot;Wouldn't that be a hoot for the residents?  They'd think I had lost my mind.&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora stood on the road, shaking her head and grinning.  &quot;Never fear!  Andora's here!  Werewolves are no match for me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence surrounded the barbarian woman, making the hair stand up on the back of her neck.  She chuckled at her own fear, continuing in her playful taunt, &quot;Here wolfie, wolfie.  Here's a nice plump barbarian woman just ready for the snackin'!&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora pulled out a lightstone, looking over the map and estimating how long it would take her to get back to the McMannus village when she heard the howl in distance.  Her head jerked in the direction of the howl, her eyes growing wide with fear.  &quot;Don't be silly, girl.  Its just a wol-&quot;<br>
<br>
Andora felt the fangs as they ripped at her flesh.  She let loose with a blood-curdling scream as the biggest wolf she had ever seen pounced on her.  Dropping her map and her lightstone, she ran for her life, screaming.<br>
<br>
The werewolf continued to maul her as she ran blindly into the night.  Andora wondered if perhaps this wasn't a fitting end to her life.  Wouldn't she be deserving for such an end after what she had pulled in Qeynos or after the way she taunted the beast that now ripped at her flesh?<br>
<br>
Andora fell to her knees, gasping for air as the world began to spin around her.  She saw the werewolf... an iksar... a human... she heard music mixed with the snarls... a lute... then nothingness.<br>
<br>
(Thanks to the bard that interacted with me, I enjoyed it though I will be honest when I say I wasn't really looking to be mauled by a werewolf... I was really hoping for a ranger in the hills while I was slaughtering woodland creatures.  I think this was a bit more interesting and out of the norm, though! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/bj.dailey/andora.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andoraofhalas>Andora of Halas</A> at: 12/10/03 11:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andoraofhalas>Andora of Halas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/11/03 8:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1264.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Magical Attributes (cont.) - The werewolf...</span><hr size=1> The room was dark, barely lit by the wavering flame of the candle sitting on the table.  A human male sat in a crude and uncomfortable wooden chair near a bed; dozing, his eyes closed and his chin to his chest.  His snores would cease when the whimpering began, his head jerking suddenly as he jumped to his feet and into action.  Attempting to comfort, attempting to ease the pain and sickness.<br>
<br>
A bucket lay nearby, nearly filled with vomit.  Flies buzzed around the bucket, often landing to feast as flies often do.  The man would often open the door, speaking quickly, and another would enter to take the bucket away.<br>
<br>
There were times when their patient's screams kept the residents of the small village awake.  Some cursed, saying it was not their concern and to send her to the McMannus village as it was their kin while others said it was their concern because the woman put herself in danger to assist them.  Lack of sleep brings irritation, and irritation brings discontentment; a thing often avoided in small communities and very avoidable, at times.<br>
<br>
For days, the two men did what they could to help the barbarian woman.  They would drop driblets of water into her mouth, attempting to keep her hydrated.  They repeated this long, drawn-out process with broths from vegetable soups and stews, spooning only the stock into the bowl.<br>
<br>
Some members of the community banned together, demanding the woman be sent to the McMannus village.  The two men argued that she could not be moved, she was too ill still and that patience was a virtue that was needed at that time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be damn to patience, Brother!  I know that woman and it is best to send her off before she awakens!&quot;  Eyes turned to the woman, voices demanding a name.  &quot;That is that McCulloch tart!  If you had any idea the trouble she caused for The Lion's Mane Inn-&quot;<br>
<br>
Misty Storyswapper stepped forward, holding out her hand.  &quot;Wait.  Xelita McCulloch is a member of the League, let us dispatch a letter to her to find out more about this woman before gossiping about her childhood aggressions.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two brothers agreed with the half elven bardess, and returned to their patient.  The letter was sent.<br>
<br>
Days turned to weeks and still no response, but it mattered little.  The two brothers stood over their patient, disheartened to see the distrust in her dark brown eyes. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/bj.dailey/andora.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=1264.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=1264.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1264.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=1264.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1264.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1264.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
