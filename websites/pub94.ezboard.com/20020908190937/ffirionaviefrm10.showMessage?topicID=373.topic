<br>
Forgive a long tale, for apparently I am not one of those who are easily led, but instead require many life-lessons to comprehend Tunare's will. <br>
<br>
I grew up with the name, ‘Snowfallon’, believing that I was the first born of Fallon Twohomes, an orphan-turned-rogue who was barely beyond childhood herself on the streets of Qeynos. My mother was born to a farming family on the Plains of Karana, and her parents were killed by the plague from Bertoxxoulous that swept those plains. She grew up as a rogue of the streets in Qeynos, and was known by the name, “Midge”, though her Wood Elf mother had originally named her “Fallon”. My mother moved to Kelethin after a “big score” allowed her to retire, and from a very early age I was raised as a Half-Elf in the tree city of the Wood Elves. <br>
<br>
My mother married a guard in Kelethin and had a number of children, and her family seemed very content and to fit in well, with one exception. I just did not fit in at all, though the man my mother married was kind to me, even taking me with him on duty at times and teaching me various tricks of tactics and strategy. My mother never spoke of my real father, and when I asked, she said that she knew only that he was a barbarian, a worshipper of the Tribunal, and big and blond. My boyhood ambition was to someday find my father and meet him, and I devoted myself to becoming a man and a warrior that my ‘real’ father would be proud of. It was at this time that I committed to the Tribunal. <br>
<br>
As soon as I possibly could, I left Kelethin and my mother, and began to journey through Norrath in search of my father. Determined to be ready to fight by his side when I found him, I first went to Freeport and trained as a warrior with the Steel Warriors’ guild. Unbeknownst to me, my mother pleaded with one of her old adventuring friends to keep an eye on my, an Erudite enchantress named Komaru. By the time she found me, I had attained the 7th season as a warrior, and was enjoying the life of a wandering mercenary, fighting anyone or anything that would provide a challenge and good loot. Even then, though, I was drawn to the cause of good, and upon joining the guild, the Celestial Dragons of Tunare, I dedicated myself to serving Order and Good. <br>
<br>
I wandered through the Commons, the Deserts of Ro, Crushbone, and High Pass, the Warrens, Blackburrow, Qeynos, and Halas and Everfrost, attaining the 17th season as a warrior when I received a message from my mother to return home. <br>
<br>
My mother had been very concerned that in my quest to find word of my father in the lands that she had ‘retired’ from, I might stir up old enemies of hers and bring danger upon myself, her and her family in Kelethin. So she decided to call me back home to tell me the truth. She was not my natural mother, but had found me as an infant in the snows of Everfrost and then decided to raise me as her own son. <br>
<br>
She had even told me that she was my own natural born mother because she had grown up as an orphaned rogue on the streets of Qeynos, and did not want me to grow up without a 'real' parent as she had. <br>
<br>
Unable to cope with this news, I wandered aimlessly, pursuing the profession of a warrior because I knew no other. My only stability was in the friends I had made 'on the road', and a close friend of my mother's, who had become my good friend, the Lady Komaru. During this time I attained the 19th season as a warrior, and spent much time with Aarwenn, the leader of the Celestial Dragons of Tunare. <br>
<br>
After much time fighting any foe I could find, and exploring far off lands (particularly the moon of Luclin), I came to a point where I wanted to seek out the truth about myself. I had only two tools: a clue, and a compulsion. <br>
<br>
From the earliest time that I could remember, I had always had a strange marking on my back, like a tattoo, but of some mystic origin rather then of ink. And I found myself drawn to the High Elf city, Felwithe. I went to the city, and was led by visions in my sleep to the Temple of Tunare. There I found, if not an answer, a purpose. <br>
<br>
The mark was similar to that of the royal family of the High Elves. Each member has a unique symbol assigned at birth that identifies him or her. My mark was like one that would have been assigned at birth, yet no members of the royal family were unaccounted for, and my symbol had never been assigned. Nonetheless, it was discovered that I was certainly enchanted with a curse and illusion. When this was lifted, I was found to indeed be a High Elf! <br>
<br>
This was a new beginning for me. From the time since my mother had revealed what she knew of my true story, I had become discontented with my name and choice of service to the Tribunal. Now, I felt free to receive a new name and mission in life. That first night, Tunare sent me a dream. <br>
<br>
In my dream, I was able to perceive the whole world of Norrath, and even, to a lesser degree the moon of Luclin. I perceived many circumstances different from what I was familiar with: my adopted home of Freeport, for example, was not the battleground between light and darkness that I had known, but a brooding nest of complete evil instead. I perceived that the Holy Paladins were much fewer in number, and that I was one of the last, though in waking truth I had never considered being a paladin at all! <br>
<br>
But in this dream, these matters were of no import. I perceived a greater battle between forces more universal then nationalities or race. I perceived a war between Life, and Unlife. And it was at this time a foregone conclusion. Life had lost in this world, and was merely fighting a holding action, doomed to inevitable defeat. I felt the Mother telling me that it was a mistake Life had made which had brought this about: fighting amongst itself while Unlife had steadily grown in power in darkness, nurtured by those misguided living who thought it was their faithful servant. <br>
<br>
In my dream, I was plucked from the living stream of life, and cast through darkness and air to another place. My last impression was of assurance and instruction, “When the time comes, you will know what to do, but seek allies and council among the others who have had visions.” <br>
<br>
I awoke much confused yet with a sense of great urgency. After much prayer in the Temple of Tunare, I dedicated myself to Life and to the service of Tunare. I felt led to specifically dedicate myself to the destruction of unlife and its practitioners throughout Norrath. To this end, I claimed a new name, 'Wraithbane', and renounced my former life as a warrior of opportunity, in order to learn the ways of a warrior priest, a paladin. <br>
<br>
From that point on, I would strive to learn to listen to all Life with understanding (though I would only speak in my true mother tongue, Elvish), and I would seek to fight only against the forces of Unlife, undistracted by the petty quarrels and faction among the living. <br>
<br>
With the aid and guidance of Tunare (and Komaru), I have since attained the rank of 18th as a paladin of Tunare, the great weapon of Life, the sword 'Ghoulbane', and the Shield of Cracked Darkwood to help ward off the attacks of Unlife. I have felt the pull of Tunare’s calling against my membership in my present guild, as while they are stalwart companions all, I must obey Tunare’s instruction to seek out the others that she has shared glimpses with.<br>
<br>
I had written this down as a requirement of introduction for applying to the guild, &quot;Band of Dreamers&quot;, which is sadly now disbanded, I believe.  I have tried to keep it somewhat updated as a personal history, but I confess I am not much for scribing.  I publish it here and provide some access to the updating of it only because it seems the nature of some paladins has been called into question, and I wish to make it clear where I as a paladin stand.<br>
