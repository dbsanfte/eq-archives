That's just disgusting.  Seriously, those feign death issues should not go live, considering it's a lifesaver and all.<br>
<br>
Hhmn, if they are going to implement thse things, maybe change names as well.  Complete Heal becomes &quot;So-so Heal&quot;, and Archery Mastery becomes &quot;Archery Mediocrity&quot;<br>
<br>
And honestly, what is the point of the Necro changes??  Just foolishness, frickin Essence Emerald to cast Emissary of Thule, a Peridot was quite alright I say.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for the warning Jarkell, I dont spend much time on the Test Server, I do beleive I will log in for a few minutes to give feedback. <p><center><img src="http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/extern/821180.jpg"  border="0"></center>

<br>
30 minute timer on FD is going to make hunting in a lot of places change a lot, and monks just lost their purpose. Verant has been threatening to change FD for some time, so now they can claim it is needed for past 60 content?<br>
<br>
Bard singing and moving wont work?  Hope they mean ONLY the skill sing and not all skills, pretty much makes bard songs useless if they cant move while doing them.<br>
<br>
It is interesting that in order to provide new content they are chossing to take away power already granted to players. It wont just effect PoP it will effect every encounter in the game.<br>
<br>
I think this trend stinks. It also reaks of laziness...... no need to find new ways to make mobs better, we will just make it so old tactics dont work anymore. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shabbashadowsong>Shabba Shadowsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/13/02 11:23:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2897.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Latest News from the Test Server</span><hr size=1> HaHaHa, had me going for a minute.  <br>
