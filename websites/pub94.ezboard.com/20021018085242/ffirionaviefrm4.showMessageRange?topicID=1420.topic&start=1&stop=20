I don't mind some IC stuff comming thru the channel - when people get in RP mode it sometimes takes over - I understand this, but lately I've seen people bashing other people for not designating their messages as either IC or OOC. WTF? I'd like to see a plausible RP justification of the market channel within the bounds of the EQ realm (and I stress plausible here). From what I can tell, the market channel was an OOC creation that was meant to further trading and selling of items before the bazaar was implemented and has hung on as kind of a &quot;catch all&quot; channel that is used for /auc, advice, game issues and whatnot. Like I said, I don't mind some IC stuff in the market, but don't bash others for not specifying OOC or putting their text in brackets. If you want to be purely RP and enforce that on others then stay out of the market - it is not RP.<br><br>Also, if you are auctioning WTB for something so high-end that only 2-4 guilds on this server are able to even obtain it (with the exception of SH) you don't need to spam us every 20 secs with a WTB auction. In fact, you would be better served by posting a message in the marketplace here or limiting your messages to once every 10 minutes.

Yeah yeah, i'm nitpicking.<br><br>Seriously... why do you care? Just roleplay.. it's the roleplay preferred server.  Trust me, you catch more flies (buyers) with a nicely worded auction, rather than the &quot;WTS itemX, 30k&quot; .. just say &quot;Selling item X for 30kpp&quot;  (some abbreviations are needed for clarity.. I'm not writing out Thirtythousand platinum pieces, either).  And certainly if someone pops into market for advice, by all means, please take it to tells asap.  They should really be asking a friend or their guild, unless they are total newbies *doubts that a newbie would find the market channel to ask a question).  Any sort of discussion in the market channel just alienates about 80 out of the 90 folks currently in the channel... I do NOT want to hear about last night's football game or how President Bush screwed up again.<br><br>If you are popping into the channel to get a teleport, just say &quot;paying 20pp for teleport from nexus to lavastorm&quot; rather than &quot;plz port me!&quot;<br><br>The couple of extra letters wont hurt, and I do NOT agree that designating the market channel as ooc is acceptable.  The market channel is as much a feature of our server as anything else, if folks get used to ooc there, why should they worry about (ab)using shout?  /shout wtb port plz <br><br>Maybe if you described the example.. but for me, anything in market/auction/bazaar is quite inherently a native feature of roleplay.  Take yourself back a few centuries to any type of small town with a market square.  It wasn't that different there, with vendors hawking their wares, and buyers trying to get the best deal.   Certainly if a stranger walks into that square and asks odd questions &quot;what's up with president bush now?&quot;, he'd get strange looks and be ignored... at least openly. Maybe someone would take him aside and whisper to him quietly to explain to him the conventions of the market...  aka /tell<br><br>So why do you want the channel to be out of character?

I think there is a post somewhere else on the Soapbox as to what response that will get. Sure, they can post questions here - and hope that people will respond instantly, but it's easier and faster to talk to others directly - that's why ICQ and IM are popular. What about news on GM events (when there actually were those)? I would like to see what's going on when they don't GM broadcast them and you can't shout cross-zones.

If you advocate immersing yourself in RP 100% and yet subject yourself by choice to an inherently non-RP arena then you are, by your free actions, a hypocrite.<br><br>Counterpoints:<br>There is already an OOC channel called 'market'. It is used by players OOC to sell and also for general chat which is legitimized by the silent assent of the masses using the channel (100 players isn't exactly a mass but it's what we got). Despite what the channel name is, it isn't used purely for /auc anymore. The fact is that most people congregate there because it is one of the only active OOC channels regularly used on the server and there is a need for an OOC channel. While idle chatter isn't encouraged, it isn't really discouraged either except by a vocal minority who happen to base many of their arguments on a RP basis which IMHO doesn't apply to an inherently non-RP channel.<br><br>Cross zone shouting in this case means across 2 or more zones. I play a lot in FM and most of the time, I am the only one there. It wouldn't be feasible for me to wander zone-to-zone shouting for help, especially if (if we are still following my example) I am nearly blind because of my graphics problem (this is just an example of an OOC use which is necessary - there are many others).<br><br>I am not saying RP sucks in any way, shape or form. I am and have always advocated a distinction between RP and non-RP. I recognize the value of each, I feel they should be kept seperate and distinct and I feel that there are places and times where each should or shouldn't be used. You can't avoid the facts that market was created to be and still is an OOC arena. I still haven't heard a RP justification for its existence which is necessary if you are going to argue this point. RP should be based on the world of Everquest, and in this world, there is no GOOD way to explain Market, so that by definition negates its validity as an RP arena.<br>I don't want to make RPers unwelcome, but on the other side I don't feel RPers comming into a non-RP forum and flaming people for being OOC is right. That's like joining a running club and announcing at your weekly meeting &quot;Running sucks, I don't do it and neither should you and if you do I will yell at you. We should all rollerblade instead and since *I* am a member of this club, we should do what *I* want because otherwise you are excluding me and making *me* feel uncomfortable.&quot; Yea, but you are still a member of a *running* club.<br><br>You must be able to separate RP from non-RP and accept the use of both. If you get completely immersed in RP you can get in trouble like those people down it the steam tunnels under Princeton or whatever college during the 70's.<br>Vulrath<br><br>Edit: Fixed grammar, added final paragraph <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthevolcanogod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thevolcanogod</A> at: 9/19/02 10:54:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 11:40:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Why not just restart the rpmarket channel? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwyrdup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wyrd Up</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 591<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 11:44:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> If I started telling ya you couldn't use ooc in these boards, then I'd be out of line.<br><br>But as soon as a person logs into the game, and become their character, everything should be treated as roleplay by default...

But it should be considered a priviledge, not a right, to speak ooc'ly... aka preface with &quot;ooc:&quot;  <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You must be able to separate RP from non-RP and accept the use of both.

My character would never speak to you about these things. I make a distinction between what my character says, and what I do.. I'm not her, by any means. I wash regularly, unlike her, and my own archery skill sucks.  However... you apparently simply play yourself and not your character. Roleplay is pretending that you are your character. Sometimes your character can be very similar to you, sometimes very different. Heck, Shintou isn't a murdering callous dark elf in real life.. <br><br>The world of Norrath is a fantasy world. It exists so we can pretend the outside world doesn't exist, if only for a little while.  I dont endorse crawling in tunnels late a night in the real world, trust me. Or anything foolish otherwise.  Those players would've gotten into trouble with one thing or another, no real reason to blame roleplaying per se. That's like that dad that neglected his son because his Norrath raids were more important. It's not the fault of Everquest, it's the fault of the player if they cannot distinguish reality from a game.<br><br>As a game, I reserve the right to roleplay and immerse myself entirely.

The arguments you made in your last post summed this principle up quite well. When I hear you RPing in market, I will leave you alone (as I always said I would, although I still don't know how you can reason it's existence in RP especially since it circumvents the language restrictions which are in place to forster RP - kinda like wanting to have your cake and eat it too). When I speak OOC in market, I expect the same, not the RP police asking me to use speach conventions.<br><br>Whether we agree on the use of market or not, we both agree on the principle of &quot;respect others and the way they play&quot; (within PnP and the EULA of course), which others did not follow (and I am not naming a specific event because it is irrelevent here).<br><br>As to why and when the channel was created, I cannot say since I wasn't on this server at the time. But I can tell you how it is used now and only very few people attempt to RP over it. Whether it's right or wrong, people use the channel as both /auc and /ooc now despite the name. If you spend time on the channel you already know this. It is beyond the scope of these message boards to explain the sociological issues as to why this all happened, but I can tell you this: I am annoyed when the market channel is cruising along, everyone there seems to be content with the discussions taking place and someone decides to join and police the way everyone is using the channel.<br><br>Go back to my running club analogy and think about how you would feel if you were a member of that group who enjoyed running. Why do you think we were all mostly pissed at Nexen? It wasn't so much the SH exploits it was the attitude and lack of respect for the way others play the game.<br>Vulrath <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uthevolcanogod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>thevolcanogod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 12:23:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Movie</span><hr size=1> Hmm, never seen the movie, but if there is one, it might be based on a true story.

Someone once upon a time started talking about how Micheal Jordon rocked, and after trying to get him to shut up, the roleplayers had no choice but to leave the channel or listen to him spout his nonsense. Of course that means that others now think it's ok too.<br><br>Now you come along and tell me that's the way it has always been and because of that it is right?  Blegh. That's the same type of argument kids use when trying to convince their parents &quot;But Mom, all the other kids do it!&quot;<br><br>You are right. I'll avoid market channel. I already have. If I use it, I jump in, put in my message, and leave it again.  If someone spouts in VERY ooc and irrelevant fashion (I get more peeved at the folks that have a big huge discussion about non-eq related stuff than the folks that discuss how to change their gamma settings etc.)  ... I have no choice but to go away. <br><br>So on the one hand you say 'go ahead and roleplay' .. on the other hand, you have no wish to at least compromise by having the *gasp* inconvenience of typing ooc before your question about Britney Spears... I have no choice but to listen to the drivel, just do others the favor and add those three letters to anything in a public channel that's not labelled &quot;ooc&quot; (which duh, has ooc as default.)<br><br>I'm no angel by any means. I'm not an extreme roleplayer. But I have little patience with certain discussions in real life, why the heck would I want to listen to them in a fantasy game?  The market channel certainly is a feature of Norrath, not a feature of CNN or MTV and as such should be treated as a priviledge.<br><br>It doesn't take much to please roleplayers like me. Trust me. Just preface your sentence.. but then again, that was your original complaint. *sarcasm* ... typing 3 extra letters is just too much I guess.  Nevermind the fact I CAN&quot;T get away from to another global channel that easily. Otherwise there'd be an ooc channel, a rpchannel, a tradeskill channel, a &quot;good&quot; &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; channel, a &quot;port&quot; channel etc etc.<br><br>Just because it's the only global channel that's actively used does not give anyone the right to make fun of others. It does give everyone the right to be treated nicely... and considering this is the roleplaying server, that means deference to the *gasp* roleplayers.. so preface your ooc statements with ooc...<br><br>-- The player of Kyrial <p><center><img src="http://www.sa.il24.net/~saran/kyrial/kyrialsig.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 956<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 1:13:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1420.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well</span><hr size=1> I personally can't believe some people are so selfish as to want others to type OOC before they post something.<br><br>I'd like to see an RP justification for the market channel.
