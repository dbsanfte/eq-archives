<br>
After much conflict over supremacy, Iraq was conquered by the Turks in the 17th century and became part of the Ottoman Empire. During the First World War, Turkey became a German ally and its empire collapsed when British forces invaded Mesopotamia in 1917 and occupied Baghdad.<br>
<br>
The country became a British Mandate - due, in no small part, to the British interest in Iraqi oil fields, and because they wanted to build a transcontinental railroad from Europe, across Turkey, and down through Iraq to Kuwait on the Persian Gulf. This railroad would allow a direct trade route with India without having to skirt Africa. - and an armistice was signed with Turkey in 1918. Local unrest (Thawrah), however, resulted in an Iraqi uprising in 1920, and after costly attempts to quell this, the British government decided to draw up a new plan for the state of Iraq. <br>
<br>
The British government had laid out the institutional framework for Iraqi government and politics; the Iraqi political system suffered from a severe legitimacy crisis; Britain imposed a Hashimite (also seen as Hashemite) monarchy, defined the territorial limits of Iraq with little correspondence to natural frontiers or traditional tribal and ethnic settlements, and influenced the writing of a constitution and the structure of parliament. The British also supported narrowly based groups--such as the tribal shaykhs--over the growing, urban-based nationalist movement, and resorted to military force when British interests were threatened, as in the 1941 Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani coup.<br>
<br>
Iraq was to be a kingdom, under the rule of Emir Faisal ibn Hussain, brother of the new ruler of neighbouring Jordan, Abdallah, a member of the Hashemite family, and although the monarch was elected and proclaimed King by plebiscite in 1921, full independence was not achieved until 1932, when the British Mandate was officially terminated.<br>
<br>
Inspired by the example of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, the Hashimite monarchy was overthrown on July 14, 1958, in a swift, predawn coup executed by officers of the Nineteenth Brigade known as &quot;Free Officers&quot;, under the leadership of Brigadier Abdul-Karim Qassim. In 1959, another assassination attempt against Qassim, this time organized by the Ba'ath Party, failed. Amongst the unsuccessful assassination squad was the young Saddam Hussein. <br>
<br>
In 1961, Kuwait gained its independence from Britain. Abdul-Karim Qassim immediately claimed sovereignty over it, claim to the Amirate as originally part of the Ottoman province of Basrah. Britain reacted strongly to this threat to its ex-protectorate, dispatching a brigade to the country to deter Iraq. Qassim backed down, and in October 1963, Iraq recognised the sovereignty and borders of Kuwait.  <br>
<br>
Following the Six Day War of 1967, the Ba'ath Party felt strong enough. The Ba'athists overthrow Arif and regained power on 17th of July 1968 coup. Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr became president and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) following the Ba'athists return to power. <br>
<br>
Relations with Iran were fast deteriorating in the early 70s. Iranian arms supplies to the Kurd leader, Mustafa al-Barzani, now fueled the ongoing Kurdish situation, which had first emerged in a 1961 Kurdish rebellion. Problems were compounded by border disputes with Iran, but these were partially settled in 1975, In Algiers on March 6, 1975, Saddam Hussein signed an agreement with the Shah (Algiers Agreement), that recognized the thalweg as the boundary in the Shatt al Arab, legalized the Shah's abrogation of the 1937 treaty in 1969, and dropped all Iraqi claims to Khuzestan and to the islands at the foot of the Gulf. In return, the Shah agreed to prevent subversive elements from crossing the border, whereupon Iran withdrew aid from the Kurdish revolt and effectively halted it. <br>
<br>
By the end of 1977, the Kurdish people had been granted greater autonomy and Kurdish was recognized as an official language. Politically, Iraq seemed to be stabilizing, and the oil boom of the late 70s contributed dramatically to an upsurge in the economy. <br>
<br>
In July 1979 the president, Ahmed Hasan Al-Bakr, was replaced by Saddam Hussein, his vice president, chosen successor, and the true ruler of Iraq. Saddam then assumed both of the vacated offices and purged political rivals in order to assure his position. Once more the political situation flared into hostilities with Iran. The Iran-Iraq War, which began in 1980, lasted for eight years and had a crippling effect on the economy of both countries; in which after eight years of war no territory had been gained by either side but an estimated one million lives had been lost. In July, 1988, Iran accepted the terms of UN Resolution 598, and the cease-fire came into force on 20th August, 1988. Before Iraq had a chance to recover economically, it was once more plunged into war, this time with its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.<br>
<br>
The invasion was the result of a long-standing territorial dispute. Iraq accused Kuwait of violating the Iraqi border to secure oil resources, (on July 17, 1990 Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of flooding the world oil market. In addition, he singled out Kuwait for the production of oil from a disputed supply, the Rumaila oil field), and demanded that its debt repayments should be waived. Direct negotiations were begun in July 1990, but they were destined soon to fail; along with reassurance from the United States making a claim that they would not get involved (the famous meeting of Saddam Hussein with April Glaspie, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, on the 25th of July, 1990). This was the go ahead that Hussein needed. Iraqi troops overran the country on 2nd August 1990. The U.S. fell short on its claim to not get involved and instantly declared interest in keeping Saudi Arabia safe. In November 1990, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 678, permitting member states to use all necessary means, authorizing military action against the Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait, and demanded a complete withdrawal by 15th of January 1991. <br>
<br>
When Saddam Hussein failed to comply with this demand, the Gulf War (Operation &quot;Desert Storm&quot;) ensued on the 17th of January 1991, with allied troops of 28 countries, led by the US launching an aerial bombardment on Baghdad. The war, which proved disastrous for Iraq, lasted only six weeks, one hundred and forty thousand tons of firearms had showered down on the country, the equivalent of 7 Hiroshima bombs. Probably as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and tens of thousands of civilians. Allied air raids destroyed roads, bridges, factories, and oil industry facilities (shutting down the national refining and distribution system)' and disrupted electric, telephone, and water service. Conference centers and shopping and residential areas were hit. Diseases spread through contaminated drinking water because water purification and sewage treatment facilities could not operate without electricity. A cease-fire was announced by the US on 28th February 1991. UN terms for a permanent cease-fire were agreed by Iraq in April of that year, and strict conditions were imposed, demanding the disclosure and destruction of all stockpiles of weapons. <br>
<br>
A few days after the war had ended, popular insurrections broke out in southern Iraq and in Kurdistan in the north, where rebels took control of most of the region's towns. The United States (President George Bush) again fell short of its commitments in protecting the uprising, let the people exposed. Units of the Republican Guard that had survived the conflict acted with extreme brutality and gained the upper hand in the Basrah, Najaf and Karbala regions. In the southern cities, rebels killed Baathist officials, members of the security service and other supporters of the regime. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in Kurdistan, Iraqi helicopters and troops regained control of the cities taken by the rebels and there was a mass exodus of Kurds, fearing a repeat of the 1988 chemical attacks, to the Turkish and Iranian borders. By the end of April there were 2.5 million refugees. In late April 1991, it was announced that there had been an agreement to implement the Kurdish peace plan of 1970; however, again, negotiations were stalled on the delineation of the borders of the Kurdish autonomous region with the Kurds insisting on the inclusion of Karkuk.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raveman>Raveman</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/30/03 5:36:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=218.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> HIDDEN WARS OF DESERT STORM </span><hr size=1> The above post of mine was a rather accurate run down of Iraq history.

<br>
In the 1920s, European and American oil companies discover and begin to exploit the first oil-fields in the Middle-East. The potential of these fields would become particularly critical to oil-poor western Europe. The profit-margins are huge while the cut to local regimes is minimal and the price of oil at the well is almost the same as mineral water. &quot; &quot;WW2 changes this equation. Despite their victory over Nazi Germany, both France and England are gravely debilitated and begin losing their grip over their former colonies. In the Middle-East, new leaders come to power, removing monarchies no longer protected by the former colonial forces and swept away by popular revolutions. &quot;<br>
<br>
However, the British and French role in the Middle-East is now being taken over by the big winner of the War, the United States of America. Despite its own oil resources, the US comes to realize the strategic importance of the Middle-East oil, to contain the Soviet Union, to rebuild Western Europe and to confirm the American industrial boom. But Washington hopes to maintain the inexpensive Middle-East oil bonanza of before WW2. The new Middle-East regimes think otherwise and when they seek to retake control of their own national wealth, it strikes a cord of panic in Washington, London and Paris.<br>
<br>
In 1953 the democratically elected Mohammed Mossadegh nationalizes oilfields and kicks the British oil companies out. He is subsequently ousted by a CIA-orchestrated coup that puts the Shah of Iran, whose secret police, SAVAK, is as brutal as the Gestapo.<br>
<br>
In Iraq, as General Abdel Karim Qassem takes over and nationalizes the oilfields, the West cries &quot;communism. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Ahmed Al Bayati, London Rep. of Supreme Council for Islamic Revolt</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Saddam came to power in 1968. This coup came as a result of an oil deal between Iraq and a French company, IRAB. This contract upset the West and the Americans in particular. So they encouraged a coup in Iraq at that time. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bill Hartung, International Arms Market specialist</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The United States has had sort of a love-hate relationship with Saddam Hussein, which is not something many people in this country are aware of, going back to the late 50s and early 60s when the CIA supported Saddam Hussein and his Ba'ath Party in the coup that brought him to power. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fadel Chalabi, Former Iraqi Oil Minister</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The vice Prime Minister, a Ba'athist who died, called Al Saadi said in a book which he published in Beirut that &quot;we, the Ba'athists, came to power in an American train, he said that&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Despite his already well-known ruthlessness, Saddam Hussein remains the &quot;Good Guy&quot; of the West until 1972. This year, the OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, agrees to raise the price of the barrel from $ 3.00 to $ 22.00. Iraq follows suit and nationalizes its oilfields. Saddam is then deemed unreliable by Washington and as a result branded a terrorist leader. The US then shifts all of its support to its long-standing ally in the region, the Shah of Iran. &quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Former Attorney-General Ramsey C</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->[/b]<br>
For 25 years, from 1953, the Shah of Iran was the US surrogate in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle-East region. The US sold him about $ 22 billion in arms from 1972 to 1976. The Shah was our man. &quot;The hope of control by the West of the Middle-East Jades in 1979 when the Shah is overthrown by anti-Western, fundamentalist leader Ayatollah Khomeini. By then, Saddam Hussein becomes again a viable card in Washington's hand. He becomes the actual President of Iraq after 11 years of being its acting Vice-President, and then perpetrates a sweeping purge of his opponents and attacks Iran -without provocation or apparent reason. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Arms expert Bill Hartung</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Stockholm Peace Research Institute has found that 52 different countries supplied weapons to Iran or Iraq during the war and 29 countries supplied both sides. The very same countries that were saying how horrible the war was were using that war to stimulate their arms industries, to test some of their new weapon designs. ().<br>
<br>
The United States was perhaps the most hypocritical of the countries that supplied arms to the war because its public position was &quot;we're not gonna arm Iran, we're not gonna arm Iraq&quot; when quietly, secretly they were actually arming both sides of the conflict.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bill Hartung</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Saddam Hussein's ambition however is to develop Iraq's own non-conventional, mass-destruction weapons. An inquiry conducted by US Congress in 1992 reveals that the American contribution to this effort is quite significant as well and is fully monitored by the CIA and the US State Department whose reports as early as the late 70s have been detailing the extent of Iraq's mass-destruction weapon-programs and its repetitive use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops and Kurdish opponents.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>State Rep. David Welch:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
In 1988, we had no idea that Saddam Hussein would be using chemical weapons on his own people. If we had known all this in advance, well, we would have made our policy quite a bit different in 1988, I'm sure.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Voices start being heard within the US Government asking about the wisdom of giving Iraq huge credits intended for purchasing US agricultural goods but used instead to buy helicopters, armored trucks, unreasonable amounts of pesticides, germs and advanced arms-making technologies. The US State Department and the White House under Presidents Reagan and then Bush systematically quell all the inquiry attempts from Congress and the Treasury Department.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;From massive arms-purchases to the development of costly military research programs, Saddam Hussein has ruined formerly rich Iraq. By the end of his war against Iran in 1988, the country is in the red for $ 40 billion. It is precisely at this time, starting in 1988, when Iraq is most desperate to maximize its oil income that yet another crisis begins unfolding.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Oil market expert Siu Hin Lee:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
OPEC keeps the price of oil stable by limiting how much oil each OPEC member-country can produce. In 1989, after the end of the Iraq/Iran war, Kuwait suddenly exceeded its quotas by 20 %, driving the price of oil down on the world market. As a result of Kuwait's production hike, Iraq lost almost a third of its oil income. And this was at a time when Iraq was desperate for money. So the Iraqis felt that Kuwait was stabbing them in the back.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Welcomed by the West, this move by Kuwait hurts both the Iraqis' economy and pride as they remember that Kuwait used to be part of their territory before it was carved off by the British in 1928. Over the following months, tension escalates to the point of Saddam Hussein publicly threatening Kuwait. Given that Kuwait remains one of the primary oil-suppliers to the west, the official response of the US State Department to Saddam's saber-rattling is rather surprising:&quot; US State Rep, briefing (6 days prior to Kuwait invasion):<br>
There is no special security commitment with Kuwait.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>AFP Randa Habib:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The Americans had given indirectly an encouragement to Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;If the Middle-East stability is indeed a desirable goal for all, why did the West fuel such a brutal dictator as Saddam Hussein with credits, weapons and advanced technologies ? And why would the US State Department repeatedly tell Saddam it has no defense agreement with Kuwait ? &quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>State Rep. David Welch:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You know, it should come as no surprise that at the end of one war and to reduce the threat that we saw in this region from the consequences of that conflict, we would seek to direct either party in a more productive way, including Iraq.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al-Kasem:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I do not say that what Iraq committed in invading Kuwait is acceptable to any of the Arab countries, no, it is not, but the way and the attitude that preceded the crisis made everyone aware that there must have been other plans to entrap Iraq into this situation. It is a trap, unfortunately Iraq fell in it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;On August2, 1990, convinced the US Government would not interfere, Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait. While US officials publicly express shock and surprise, the Pentagon is ready for action, having rehearsed this very situation for several months prior to Iraq's attack on Kuwait&quot;.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>General Norman Schwarzkopf:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We went ahead and did an exercise, what is called a command post exercise, which is what Internal Look was, to test our ability to deal with this particular scenario, and also to uncover any commanding control problem that might exist, any doctrine problem that might exist between the air force, the Navy and the Armed Forces. And it just so happened that we were in the middle of conducting the Internal Look command post exercise at the same time when the crisis developed in the Gulf.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Former US Marine &amp; Gulf War Veteran Morocco Omari:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Prior to that, when I was doing my training, all the officers were telling us about the built-up..., the thing with Iraq possibly going to Kuwait and attacking Kuwait, and they told us to be prepared for it because it was very serious and they said that they had been knowing this for about two years prior to this, you know. So a lot of this stuff was already going on, they knew that they would probably be going to..., and they were preparing us to go over to Desert Storm.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Hardly a few hours after Saddam's invasion, all Iraqi assets in the US are frozen and the US Navy starts enforcing a blockade of the Iraqi coast even before the UN gets a chance to convene. A couple of days later, delegations from the US Departments of State and Defense fly to Ryad to try to convince the Saudi Government that the Iraqi troops are indeed threatening their borders. The official press release mentions showing the Saudis satellite picture evidence of the Iraqi build-up at the Saudi border. &quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Jean Heller:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The airport in the Kuwaiti capital appeared to have been abandoned which it wouldn't be. If you think about it for a minute, if you're trying to supply a quarter of a million troops, it takes a lot of food, a lot of camping equipment, a lot of fuel for the tanks. They didn't see tanks tracks in the sand in the desert and they would not have worn away because satellites pictures are still pickling up images of sand tracks in the desert of Northern Africa that were left during WW2. I happened to know the Press Secretary of Defense personally, and I asked him : &quot;look, you know me, we've known each-other for a long time, let me look at some of the US intelligence satellite photos, prove to me that I'm wrong.

Ever since OPEC raised the price of oil in the early 70s, this concern has become even more acute, epitomized by State Secretary Henry Kissinger 's famous statement: &quot;Oil is too important to be left to the Arabs &quot;.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Well, you have to understand that there were principal focuses over the world amounting to military commands.

In 1990, the Bush administration was trying to convince the Saudis that the threat from the Iraqis was real because we couldn't go in there, the Allies, the British, the French, the Americans and the others could not go in there without an invitation from the Saudis. The Saudis had to feel threatened in order to invite the allies to come in for protection.<br>

After persuading the Saudis, the US Government now has to convince the American public and the world that the threat is real and that it justifies a gigantic US military build-up in Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, at the United Nations headquarters in New York, the pressure is on to find a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the crisis. However, war is already in the minds of others. UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar himself flies to Baghdad and meets with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

Typically, the US military claimed that its bombing of Iraq was highly accurate. Nothing can be further from the truth. 110,000 aerial sorties and 85,000 tons of bombs, the equivalent of seven and a half Hiroshimas in 42 days, you could see the indiscriminate nature of the bombing. It probably killed 150,000, maybe 200,000 people, thousands and thousands of civilians indirectly. There is no question from the evidence of the bombing that the United States deliberately planned the destruction of the economic support system for the Iraqi population. If you just take water, they knocked out reservoir dams in the North, they knocked out pumping stations for water pipelines bringing the water down, they knocked out filtration plants to purify the water so you can drink it without getting sick. On food, they systematically attacked the food chain from one end of the country to the other. They knocked out all electrical power within hours, they knocked out transportation, they showed you can destroy a country and deprive it of essential life-support systems without ever setting foot on it, through cruise-missiles and aerial bombardments.<br>

The Americans would cease-fire, which was a very unexpected early cease-fire in order to give a chance to the Iraqis, to allow the Iraqis to be able to eliminate the rebellion in the South.

And there were no American attack although there were so many reasons, and President Bush threatened so many times to go back to war because Iraq is not supervising their promise in the 687 UN resolution.

Back in 1990, economic sanctions were seen I believe as a good alternative to military activity and forces. Since then however, they have been sustained over nine years. They have had an impact on the people of Iraq which in the view of many of us is genocidal in the sense that economic sanctions on top of the damages done by the Americans and others in the Gulf War has led to the death of one or possibly one and a half million Iraqi people and particularly children. So the maintenance of these economic sanctions breach the Geneva Convention on warfare because as we all know, civilians are not to be targeted in war nor in economic sanction programs.<br>

When the things started, there were some incidents that were like black comedy.

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Former UNSCOM team leader Scott Ritter:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We uncovered the bulk of what the Iraqi were able to produce in terms of chemical weapons, biological weapons, ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The infrastructures in which Iraq used to produce these weapons have largely been dismantled, destroyed or under monitoring by the arms inspectors. So we have a good idea of what's left, it's not very much.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Phyllis Bennis:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Despite that, the US has constantly moved the goalpost. It's not enough if they comply by the requirements regarding weapons of mass destruction. Instead of saying: &quot;if you abide by the requirements of the UN resolutions, sanctions will be lifted&quot;, the US message is : &quot;it doesn't matter whether you comply or not, we are not going to lift the sanctions anyway&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Former UN Iraq Program director Dennis Halliday:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
When UNSCOM began, I believe it was a legitimate effort to track down and destroy dangerous weaponry. And in fact, the Atomic Energy Agency and others were just about ready to clear UNSCOM, their work and agreed that Iraq was clean. Then Richard Butler was appointed and he re-opened many of the issues that in fact had been closed and seemed to bring a new element in the investigation, perhaps very much supported by Washington.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>UNSCOM Scott Ritter:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The action of its executive chairman Richard Butler and in concert with the United States government allowed UNSCOM to be manipulated in a way that was outside the guideline set forth by its true boss, the Security Council. The United States and the United Kingdom used UNSCOM as a trigger for the initiation of military actions, the United States and Great Britain used information gathered by weapon-inspectors to provide targets for their bombings. This is an accepted fact. So UNSCOM, as an organization, has been discredited.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dennis Halliday:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It is true that an inspection entity of that sort can be manipulated politically and give an excuse to the more aggressive member-states for further military action. And in a sense, we have that every day, almost every day of the week when United Kingdom and American planes are bombing Iraq.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Baghdad Gulf War Remembrance Museum Dir. Nassira Sadoun:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

The air-attacks that you refer to are defensive in nature. Since 1991, there has been a no-fly zone in the North of Iraq. This no-fly zone was imposed, I will recall for your audience, after the Iraqi regime forced the exodus of over half-a-million Kurdish inhabitants of Northern Iraq. The UN passed resolution 688 that say that this should not happen and then a no-fly zone was imposed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Phyllis Beonisi:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There is no reference in any UN resolution to the establishment of a no-fly zone in Northern and Southern Iraq. The US has imposed and with the British kept them in place, and the results is that civilians in the North and in the South whose lives are ostensibly to be protected by the establishment of those no-fly zones are being killed not by Iraqi soldiers or by Iraqi planes but by American bombings that go off-course. That is who is killing the Iraqi civilians in the southern and Northern no-fly zones. One of the very bitter lessons of these years of war, both military war and economic war against Iraq is that for the United States and for most governments in the Security Council, humanitarian considerations are simply not enough to influence policy. We have of course the famous statement by Madeleine Albright in 1996 when she was asked about the death at that time of half-a-million Iraqi children that had died as a result of sanctions and of course she did not dispute the figure, she simply thought about it for a moment and then said : &quot;on balance, we think it's worth it&quot;.<br>

Because he is part of the security system, and therefore he should be fed well, he should be given good accommodations.

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bill Hartung:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
After the Gulf War, the build-up in places tike King Khaled Military City, which was supposed to be temporary, has become sort of a bridge for possible long-term US military base in Saudi Arabia and the Middle-East. There are now thousands of US troops regularly in Saudi Arabia. So at least, on a de-facto basis, Saudi Arabia has become a military base for US forces in the Middle-East. Unless there is a change of regime, the base could well end up being permanent in Saudi Arabia.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Proclaimed as a sweeping victory by almost all Western media, the Gulf War and the subsequent crisis with Iraq have indeed amounted to a super victory for Washington : paramount arms-sales at a level never seen before, at last huge, permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia resulting in a better control of the oil-flow and a better leverage on its pricing. The great losers on the other hand are the Iraqi population still under a Stalin-like dictatorship and slowly dying from starvation.

The remaining 60%-70% of Iraq's oil is first purchased by companies from many countries, including Cyprus, Sudan, Pakistan, China, Vietnam, Egypt, Italy, Ukraine, and others. Iraqi oil is normally then resold to a variety of oil companies and middlemen before being purchased by end users. During 2001, for instance, nearly 80% of Basra Light liftings, and over 30% of Kirkuk oil, went to the United States, with large importers including ExxonMobil, Chevron, Citgo, BP, Marathon, Coastal, Valero, Koch, and Premcor. During the first eleven months of 2002, the United States imported an average of 449,000 bbl/d from Iraq. In January 2003, approximately 1.2 million bbl/d of Iraqi oil went to the Americas (up from 910,000 bbl/d in December 2002 and 515,000 bbl/d in November), while 430,000 bbl/d went to Europe and 140,000 bbl/d to Asia. To some extent, increased Iraqi oil exports to the Americas have helped fill the loss created by a major oil strike and general unrest in Venezuela beginning in December 2002.<br>
<br>
In April 2000, the U.S. Navy stopped a Russian tanker, the Akademik Pustovoit, which it suspected might be smuggling Iraqi oil. The United Nations later determined that around 20% of the vessel's gasoil cargo (which Shell said it owned) was of Iraqi origin. In April 2001, an Iraqi-owned vessel -- the Zainab -- sunk off the Dubai coast, leaking over 1,000 tons of smuggled diesel oil and polluting Gulf waters and UAE beaches. At least two other ships smuggling Iraqi oil sunk during 2001 -- one off the Kuwaiti coast in October, and one in November. During 2001, Iraqi oil smuggling through Iranian waters reportedly was reduced significantly (possibly 50%), as Iran increased its efforts at stopping suspect vessels. In October 2001, the United Nations discovered that two oil shipments on the &quot;Essex&quot; had been &quot;topped off&quot; after U.N. inspectors had signed off, adding some 500,000 barrels of crude oil to the ship. The Essex was chartered by trader Trafigura, run by former employees of Marc Rich.<br>
<br>
In January 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said that Iraq's oil reserves would not be &quot;exploited for the United States' own purpose,&quot; but would &quot;be held in trust for the Iraqi people, to benefit the Iraqi people.&quot; Also, in late January/early February 2003, the U.S. State Department held meetings with Iraqi opposition figures on the future of Iraq's oil and gas fields in a possible post-Saddam Hussein context. Currently, the United States maintains unilateral economic sanctions against Iraq, including Executive Order #12722 (August 2, 1990) imposing a complete trade embargo, and Executive Order #12724 (August 9, 1990) imposing additional restrictions. Under U.S. sanctions, goods or services cannot be imported from or exported to Iraq, with the exception of the U.N. &quot;oil-for-food&quot;program.<br>
<br>
Around 85%-90% of Iraq's national power grid (and 20 power stations) was damaged or destroyed in the Gulf War. Existing generating capacity of 9,000 megawatts (MW) in December 1990 was reduced to only 340 MW by March 1991. In early 1991, transmission and distribution infrastructure also was destroyed, including the 10 substations serving Baghdad and about 30% of the country's 400-kilovolt (kV) transmission network. In early 1992, Iraq stated that it had restarted 75% of the national grid, including the 1,320-MW Baiji and Mosul thermal plants as well as the Saddam Dam. In 1998, Iraq's maximum available electric generation capacity was estimated (by Iraq) at around 4,000 MW, while the U.N. Iraq Program estimated in November 2002 that generating capacity was 4,300-4,400 MW. The U.N. Iraq Program further stated that, by the summer of 2004, Iraq's generating capacity could reach 5,900 MW, with several power stations (Al-Quds, Beji, Himreen,Yousfiya, Rumaila -- all gas-fired) under construction and several others (Dibs, Hart, Najaf, Nassriya -- gas and thermal) awaiting approval and/or funds.<br>
<br>
According to a report by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Iraq's power deficit stood at 1,800 MW as of August 2000, with blackouts a common occurrence. Iraq reportedly has signed contracts for renovating two generation units at the Harithah power plant, and another to rebuild the Yusufiyah plant, which stopped operating in 1990. Iraq's Electricity Authority reportedly also has signed several other contracts with Chinese, Swiss, French, and Russian companies, to build 3,000 MW of additional power generating capacity. These contracts require U.N. approval, and Iraq has claimed that the United States and Britain are blocking $1.5 billion worth of electrical equipment it has requested<br>

Raw facts provided by your own goverment. You can blame Saddam all you want but we killed 150.000 to 200.000 people during Guld war and 1 million to 1.5 million by the deliberate destruction of the economic support system for the Iraqi population and the most drastic economical sanctions ever known. <br>

If Iraq never invaded Kuwait then what would Saddam be up to now? The Saudis asked the US to not remove Saddam because he was a known quantity and in return allowed the US to continue to maintain a militart base in Saudi Arabia. We got the side benefit of liberating Kuwait and gained a larger military presence in the M.E. I also think the US terribly underestimated the capabilities of Saddam bouncing back from the beating he took as well as the failure of the UN weapons inspectors to do their job properly regardless if it was their (the UN inspectors) fault or not.

Oil for Saddams Palaces program. And the weapons the military has are not US made. Russian Surface to air missles, Jordanian Munitions, Russian Made AK47. Chineses made AK47 SKS old Russian bolt action WWII surplus rifles RPG's are Soviet Made or old Chek Turk stuff. There Tanks are Russian.

The international monetary fund should have been in charge of the oil for food millions and a team of accountants from the security council nations should monitor all movements of cash from the fund.

<br>
Nice of you to link that US government site that included all of the official information on oil.  However, you have appeared to have only listed the facts that support your argument.  Here is another link that contains some useful info:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/usa.html">www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/usa.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is the page for all the info on the US.  Here is an excerpt:<br>
<br>
Imports/Exports <br>
The United States averaged total gross oil (crude and products) imports of an estimated 11.2 MMBD during the first nine months of 2002, representing around 57% of total U.S. oil demand. Around two-fifths of this oil came from OPEC nations, with Persian Gulf sources accounting for about one-fifth of total U.S. oil imports. Overall, the top suppliers of oil to the United States during the first nine months of 2002 were Canada (1.9 MMBD), Saudi Arabia (1.5 MMBD), Mexico (1.5 MMBD), and Venezuela (1.4 MMBD).<br>
<br>
So you can see that 3 of the top 4 sources of our oil imports come from western hemisphere countries.  Only 1/5 come from Persian guild countries.  The amount we import from Iraq is insiginificant compared to what we get from other countries.  We don't need Iraqi oil to remain economically stable.   <br>
<br>
Here are some more interesting links from that website:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/france.html">www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/france.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
This is the page for France.  An excerpt:  <br>
<br>
In early 1999, French oil company Total merged with Belgian oil company Petrofina to create TotalFina, the world's sixth-largest oil company and the third-largest oil company in Europe. Only months later, TotalFinaElf was formed by TotalFina's acquisition of Elf Aquitaine. After the deal was completed in 2000, TotalFinaElf became the fourth-largest publicly listed oil company in the world, after ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, and BP.<br>
<br>
Iraq has letters of intent with TotalFinaElf that would take effect when sanctions are lifted. <br>
<br>
Wow.  Big surprise here.  Look who stands to profit the most if UN sanctions against Iraq are lifted?  Is there any question now why the French opposed the 2d UN resolution authorizing force?  They stand to lose the most money if Saddam is removed from power.  Those letters of intent already on place are null and void if someone other than Saddam is in power.<br>
<br>
This war isn't about the oil as most anti-war protesters and Arab countries would like for you to believe.  They make that claim for propaganda reasons since its a lot easier to believe the US is greedy and is going after Iraqi oil versus invading Iraq for humanitarian and national security reasons.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the link Raveman.  Learned some useful facts today.<br>

And US main involvement for weapon sales are choppers and chemical and biological materials to make WMD. Germany build the chemical and biological plants and US sold Antrax and other biological virusses to make biological weapons.<br>
<br>
Kebkin: As you can probably see on the link I have given Iraq is only responsable for less then 3% of the total crude oil production in the world. The 2 wars and the embargo had a huge impact on oil production so Iraq isn't a major factor in the oil export in the world at this point.<br>
<br>
The American economie needs vast amounts of oil and gas even if all the current oil pumped up at this point in Iraq would go to US the percentage would be very small.<br>
<br>
The Oil issue around Iraq is about the possabilities it has. Iraq has the 2nd largest know oil reserves in the world but at the production rate Sauodi Arabia (sp?) is having now Iraq's reserve will outlast those in Sauodi Arabia. Specialist predict that Iraq has also a ver large of undiscovered oil and gas fields wich makes the potential bigger.<br>
<br>
You don't need Iraq at this point it remain economical stable but this is about the future. I will not deny the claims the French has on Iraqi oil production, they are there and well know. France and Russia have always tried to make the embargo less tight or to drop it alltogheter. Mainly because the contracts and also because that embargo is a humanitarian disaster for the population of Iraq.<br>
<br>
I would like to see on the other hand or have some more detailed information on what claims are made in those letters of intent cause as shown in the link the capacity of Iraq is huge and I suspect the claims made in the letter will be very small compared to the whole capacity of Iraq and doubt that French and Russians will only be the only onces to benefit from it.<br>
<br>
The INC (future goverment of Iraq) has already made the same deals with US that Saddam has with France. With Saddam the Europian Union with France in particular, Russia and probably China would economically benefit most from the oil in Iraq wich could undermine of challenge US supremacy and domination of the world economy and that is the last thing the US wants. That is one of the main motivations for this war on Iraq but surely not the only one.<br>
<br>
This is war is actually not about Oil but about securing a continued economical, political and military supremacy and domination. WMD and terrorist have little to do with it. For me that are the obvious reasons why this goverment is doing what it does and not only in Iraq.<br>
<br>
The opposition the US gets vary mostly. For some countries the underluying intentions are quite clear.<br>
<br>
France the big factor is offcourse the lost opportunities in Iraq but France is on the other hand a major supporter of multipolarism or multilaterism and the actions the US are taking go directly against that. Public opinion also plays a factor but that is something you can partially manipulate. I don't think the current gov in France gives a rats ass about the population of Iraq, just uses it fuel the public opinion.<br>
<br>
Russia is still dreaming from it's glorious old days. In the past decades they been turned into a midget politically and economically and they want to turn the tide. I don't think they can rival the US but they will probably try about anything to regain it's power.<br>
<br>
China, yeah well, it's the world next superpower. Still a long way from there but they are comming. And they know that to achieve that they can't do it under the umbrella of the US since the US will do it's best to contain China.<br>
<br>
The Arab nations have probably different intentions. Where Europe was the battlefield of the world for most parth of the 20th century the Middle East is not the battlefield of the world and I just think they are already tired of beeing the football in the political soccer game that is going on now. They just want to play own game and not beeing kicked around by the rest of the world.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that the intentions of the countries opposing the US at this moment are noble but it's picking between the least evil. And the unilateral stance of the US gov at the moment will cause more suvering in the world then it would do good. And if I had to choose I would pick France above US/China/Russia since France has choosen the direction of multipolarism wich in my opinion will lead to a safer and more prospereus world instead of the continuing boxing match of superpowers and wannabe superpowers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kebkin>Kebkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/1/03 4:07:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=218.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HIDDEN WARS OF DESERT STORM </span><hr size=1> Raveman stated:<br>

Wouldn't it be in our best interests to continue buying the majority of our oil from Canada and Mexico so we don't tank their economy?  Sure we will buy oil from Iraq.  But so will Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and just about every other country out there that has to import oil.  Freeing up the Iraqi oil for export benefits Europe and Japan a LOT more than it will benefit us.  Oil prices across the board will drop as the supply is increased.  This is good for everyone who has to import oil, not just the US.<br>
<br>
In regards to the INC, the beauty of democracy is that if they sell oil to the US, and the Iraqi people disapprove of it, then they will now have the option to elect a government that won't sell oil to the US.  There won't be a damn thing we can do about it either.  <br>

And the unilateral stance of the US gov at the moment will cause more suvering in the world then it would do good. And if I had to choose I would pick France above US/China/Russia since France has choosen the direction of multipolarism wich in my opinion will lead to a safer and more prospereus world instead of the continuing boxing match of superpowers and wannabe superpowers. <br>

Last report I saw, there were over 40 countries supporting the US and Great Britain.  That total may be over 60 by now.  I don't think the term unilateral applies in this situation.  <br>

I have to dismiss this as absurdity. If China wants oil it can pay for it just like the US does on the open market. Russia is an oil exporter as it is and only has deals with Iraq to make some extra bucks.<br>

The Arabs are tired of being pushed around, but their biggest problem with the West is the support Israel gets from the US. The resent Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, but do little to improve the Palestinian situation. They call them Arab brothers, but few offer them any significant aid. You see the Palestinians are pawns of the other Arab states and do their bidding by keeping Israel off balance and in check. The UN resolutions against Israel have to deal with land that Israel annexed after the 1967 war when several Arab nations attacked Israel.The land is where many of the Palestinian settlements are. Palestinians are the whipping boys of the Middle East and they are Arab brothers depending on the needs of the other Arab countries. <br>
