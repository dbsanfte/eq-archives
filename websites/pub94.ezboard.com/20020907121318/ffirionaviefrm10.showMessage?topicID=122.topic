A great Heyokah, it did not suprise me to see him, though he has passed on from this world.  He stood in a great hall and behind him weresix great men carved of stone bearing great hammers.  He spoke not, but smiled, and waved his arms to bring forth a green mist, into this mist he stepped and became a great wolf.  I know it was my father for never before has a grey wolf's eye twinkled in such a knowing way.  I followed the wolf and it seems as we flew on the wings of night for never have I been out of Halas but I saw much of the world and a conviction came to me on this journey, for we paused at many battlefields, some wars were fought for Good, others for Evil, but none for justice, for order.  Chaos reigns in Norrath and the greatest goals seemed to be those of personal gain.  Even those who professed order were often blinded by their own narrow views and sowed not order but discord in their endeavours. <br>
<br>
As I awoke I felt that my time in Halas was coming to an end.  Though it was the dead of night I pulled on my furs and sought interpretation of my dream by an elder shaman.  <br>
<br>
The lamps were on at the shaman guild and as I approached I was suprised to see none but the highest of the Shaman were present, thinking I was interrupting important council I turned to leave, but a voice spoke in my head..<br>
<br>
&quot;approach&quot;<br>
<br>
I felt my muscles go slack and I turned and walked into the hall of justice.  <br>
<br>
&quot;speak&quot;<br>
<br>
I told them then the tale of my dream, silence followed, then Margyn the leader of the order nodded at Jinkus Felligan.  I was suprised to see him here as I knew nought of him as a shaman.  Jinkus said &quot; Lorec, there is an increase in disorder in the world.  We seek to send a few of us into the world to take notes and to fight this imbalance as they can.  Will you follow the vision sent by your father?&quot;<br>
<br>
I could barely speak, and my voice when it did come out seemed pitched overly high, but I responded that I had already decided to leave Halas, that I could not peacefully pursue my life knowing what I now knew of the world.<br>
<br>
Jinkus then said &quot;Then go to your house, don your fathers armor and go out into everfrost.  Build your strength, for in a  few seasons you will go forth, but not without our training and blessing to fortify you, and not unprepared&quot;<br>
<br>
That night I was initiated into the Tribunal and in the morning it seemed all to be a dream, but at the foot of my bed was the ancient case with my fathers armor in it and I felt a new energy stirring within me, and realized that for the first time I could tap the ancient powers.  Energy crackled from my fingers and a green mist surrounded me, I felt my spririt uplifted and a great font of inner strength bloomed in me like a fire. Feeling invincible I left then, to hunt the goblins and gnolls that so plague Halas. <br>
<br>
 I grew much in the following weeks, learned to master the magical skills of the shaman, I trained also with the warriors, as at times magic alone will not shield, nor defeat a foe.  In due course I was called again before Jinkus Felligan and he told me it was time to take my manhood test.<br>
<br>
The next morning I left Halas, wearing nought, carrying no supplies.  Instructed to live from the land and to travel to the far city of Qeynos, there to bring a list of criminals back to Halas.   The journey was not easy.  With some trial and error I was able to find the entrance to the Gnoll Lair at Blackburrow, only to find guards awaiting me.  I struck out with my fists and spells and barely managed to defeat  them, fortunately one had wielded a staff and I was thus able to pick up a weapon.  Lighting a small candle found amongst the pile of bones littering the entrance I entered blackburrow.  I fought several more times, ran when I had to.  Once a lithe creature speaking a language I believe to be that of the elves rained blue magic on me and I became invisible to the gnolls.  In this way I found myself in the hills near qeynos.  The journey was uneventful from there, though, I saw many marvels, and the lack of snow was disconcerting.  Qeynos is much larger than Halas and the mix of elves and humans and travelers from far lands created such a noise, but I did find the list I needed and returnded to Halas. where I was awarded an initiate symbol of the Tribunal.<br>
<br>
** Excerpt's from the Journal of Jinkus Felligan**<br>
<br>
...The rogues of the White Rose become ever more daring and the blind eye the Shaman of Justice turn on them emboldens them.  More of our youth is being led away from the path of Justice, even those who do study at our hearths often lose the desire to foster order in their travels about Norrath...   <br>
<br>
...Margyn has agreed to allow me to train several of our promising younger shamen to act as field agents, to seek out the secrets behind the late success of disorder in Norrath, and to represent the beliefs of the Six Hammers in the land.  These agents will take notes and work to maintain the balance that is tilting dangerously toward disorder....<br>
<br>
...I have selected a young Shaman, Lorec son of Tilor to be our first field judge.  He has succeeded the initiate tests at a very early stage of his career and knowing his father I believe him to be steadfast and impartial.  I am sending him now to Qeynos to speak with guildmaster Phin of the Silent Fist's.  They seek to learn the origins of the plague which recently created so much chaos in the Karanas.... Lorec will bear messages and asist in what ways he can...<br>
<br>
** End Excerpts**<br>
<br>
After a few more seasons of training I was told to deliver another message to qeynos, but this time I was told to stay and put myself temporarily in the service of one Phin Esrinap.  The journey through Blackburrow was not nearly so trying with the additional experience I had obtained, and fully equipped for a long journey.  In due course I arrived again in Qeynos.<br>
<br>
I presented myslef to Phin Esrinap. A curous individual, he seemd barely dressed though it was late in the year.  He peered at me, and laughed a little. &quot; I ask for soldiers and they send me striplings!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;This I waill have you do for me Lorec,  go forth with an initiate of our guild and try and intercept messages between the gnolls of blackburrow and certain disorderly elements of this city&quot;.  He then snapped his fingers and said &quot;Saera&quot;. A young woman stepped forward from the assembled students. &quot;Go with Lorec.  Do as I have instructed and you will advance yourself in the eyes of the guild&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Saera simply nodded, and we left. <br>
<br>
I confess at first look that this young robed human woman did not appear to be a doughty fighter.  I anticipated that in battlle I would be doing most of the close work, and that much energy would be expended to keep her from an early grave.  She was pleasant to look at however, and though not of the stature of Barbarian women, she held herself with great confidance, though I suspected that she was even less experienced than I in the world.  <br>
<br>
Barely out from the gates of Qeynos we were beset upon by Gnolls.  To my suprise, Saera made quick work of those who attacked her, and was virtually unscratched at the end of the battle... My judgement had perhaps been to quick, and I determined to never be so hasty again.  Blushing slightly I apologized for my condescending manner and we made camp.<br>
