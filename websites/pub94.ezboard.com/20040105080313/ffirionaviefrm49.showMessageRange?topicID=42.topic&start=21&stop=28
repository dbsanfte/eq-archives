<br>
     Please re-read where I state that &quot;I&quot; have never encountered such behavior ingame. I never said that it did not exist. If I was trying to illustrate any example it was that, a few times (I can probably count them on one hand) I have stumbled across someone's lovemaking in some remote corner of a zone/town/hotel/dungeon where people were using emotes snd /say,  and thought that no one else would ever wander by and hear them. The few times I have encountered this, it was of hetero nature. Never anywhere did I put down homosexual sex. It is that &quot;I&quot; personally have not run across such a thing in my travels. I'm am not so &quot;naive&quot; as to think it does not exist.<br>
<br>
As far as arrogance and assumptions, I think I can safely assume that neither of you are running around in public channels and acting out what was depicted in Gio's sig. I think that is probably a very safe assumption. Like I said, most of that kind of rp, stays in tells or groupsay.<br>
<br>
Lastly,  I haven't seen very many (if any at all on this particular board) sig pictures of vaginal/penile sex. Perhaps those sigs had been dealt with during a period of time I was not reading the boards here or even had a character on the server. If there were sigs of the type (which there probably were at one time or another) I can believe that, but presently, as of this moment, there are none. I commented on what I saw. <br>
<br>
I used an example of /analsex emote purely because that was what was depicted in the sig pic. I am also well aware that it is performed by both hetero and homosexual couples. But, like I pointed out, no one is acting that out in public, in game (to my knowledge), but, if they were I am sure we can agree it would not be acceptable and would be /reported.<br>
<br>
I was trying to see what sort of commentary/input I could get on why it was unacceptable in game, in a public manner, to do such a thing yet illustrating on the board here is acceptable? It's just a simple conversation. Nothing to get heated over. Currently the argument for it being acceptable (at least in the past) is &quot;because the mods said it was ok&quot;. <br>
<br>
I apologize for not knowing every single individual ruling as to why some things are ok and some are not. It appeared to be a bit of a double standard to me. Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;kitten comment&quot;, it was just the first &quot;irrelevant to the game&quot; kind of sig that came to mind. Like I said, I didn't know why it was a sig picture. Now I know. I didn't know you no longer played, I never knew you to begin with, and I really didn't know the story behind the kitten. It's no big deal. It wasn't flame. It just struck me as odd that this is a server based on role play here was this kitten sig. I just wondered why.<br>
<br>
I honestly wasn't looking to start some sort of new flamefest. I simply want to understand why something that isn't publicly done in-game is/was acceptable here in a public forum. The &quot;because the mods said so&quot; was a bit too weak of an explanation for me is all.<br>
<br>
Robin and Gio, you may very well do that in public, in game for all I know. I have not run across it.  If that's the case, then I can understand what is depicted in the sig. It would fit what my personal reason for a sig is all about. My idea is probably different that some other people. I can accept that. I just wondered about it is all. I apologize if there was any confusion.<br>

We're expected to respect a gay persons rights, a womens rights, a black persons rights, a disabled persons rights to the point that our own rights are eroded. At the same time the protected minority's have free licence to disrespect our own basic rights.<br>
<br>
This is a case in point.  We have a right not to be subjected to a pornographic image, when we try to exercise that right, we're labeled homophobic.<br>
<br>
A black tv show, song etc can be liberally sprinkled with &quot;white boy&quot; insults however were that reversed we would be sued, beaten up and ostracized.<br>
