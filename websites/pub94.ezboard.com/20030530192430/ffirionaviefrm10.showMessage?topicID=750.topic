<br>
Of course being an observer to this event i shall of course maintain my level of unbiasedness and impartiality which shown through out the event itself. There were a couple of lighties i was forced to share the booth with Meledi and Raires- but fortunately for our readers i managed to drive them both from the booth in order to keep my unbiased perspective available for those listening in.<br>
<br>
 An epic day of battle both mass struggles and more personal battles took place recent in the rathe arena as well as new innovation to sports activities which will surely sweep Norrath in the near future. Halfling rugby.<br>
<br>
   Yes this new fashion involved a halfling corpse- alas the Shadow's trolls and ogres ate the ones we were bringing along with us but we managed to substitute a very runt like image of one thanks to Shaveil who no doubt charmed one to come along with him.  <br>
<br>
   Each side fielded 6 players to try and drag the corpse between the firepot-rights for a goal. Of course that was the only rule involved so much carnage also took place. The Shadows took a quick 1-0 lead but then alas it seems we...um they, miscalculated somewhat. We forgot the undoubted inferior skills of our foes would indeed make them experts in the art of corpse dragging- after all you can't count on a lighty to do anything right. While of course we..um the shadows, were far less used to failure and the art of dragging bodies around.  <br>
<br>
    We soon learned this to our dismay as the lighties- led by the human known as Compact- began scoring at will after viciously attacking our players and burying them up to their ankles in sand so they could not pursue. In fact so dominating was Compact that i bravely stepped forth onto the field of play for a live interview- and hopefully uncover what sort of foul trickery was aiding him. Alas as i ran to him, he spun around and started beating me repeatedly until i was forced to flee back to the announcer's booth. My cries for fines went on deaf ears as the Shadows were narrowly edged in a close , hard fought match by the score of...um..50-7. I later learned that the monk was bound by some sort of oath of silence or something and doesn't do interviews....<br>
<br>
While on the field i DID note that the wind was blowing in the shadows' faces for the entire match- no doubt aided by some hidded druids somewhere- whcih was blowing sand into the Shadow players eyes. Naturally that and the extra practice must have led to the lightites win.<br>
<br>
Of course, it was also part of our..er the Shadows' plan to LET the lighties win an early event to raise their false hopes and dreams before we..er they, crushed their spirits and bodies later on, to make our..er their victory all the sweeter.<br>
<br>
  Next the Shadows were up for revenge and so a mass battle was planned. While the Shadows had a paper edge of 19-17 at the time it must be noted that 4 shadows and 1 lighty were declared noncombatants due to announcing and prize holding duties (though Shintou failed to get that memo..poor Raires) so the numbers were actually more even. Of course in battle the Shadows showed their true power as one by one the lighties fell (interestingly both Gray and the anti-Gray known as Blayze were among the first to fall on either side..coincidence?). When the dust settled the lighties were defeated and a half dozen or more shadows still stood triumphant. Tying the score at 1 victory apiece<br>
<br>
  Though other events such as archery/throwing contests and a horse race were planned the next event- one on one battles began to take place. In the meantime refreshments - mostly alcoholic based werre being passed from the Shadows to the lighties- in the spirit of competitiveness and respect or something i am sure &lt;nods&gt; Oddly during this time there seemed to be much discussion between the Shadows- Laelu, Tallonar and Soulthief where all were accusing each other of trying to kill them for some reason.<br>
<br>
   The first one on one battle was between the pale elf treehugger Willayen and the troll Mudwart who as always was accompanied by Fifi- both of whom looked hungry. The battle started out well for the pale elf- who tried to keep his foes at a distance- a surprisingly intelligent move for a pale elf. However trying to keep away from two hungry folk proved to be too much for the pale elf and in the end Mudwart prevailed.<br>
Shadows 1-0<br>
<br>
  Next came the battle of the braid- which our sources claim- came about when Sumida saw that her LoH counterpart Esuna dared to copy her profession and hairstyle and so had to settle it..on the sands! This was a messy fight with blood splattering everywhere and Esuna proved to be quicker of the the punch in the early going. Sumida rallied but then Esuna cowered behind her mending ability to regain the edge. That proved to be the difference as Sumida must have slipped on some loose sand on the platform to allow Esuna to land the final blow and claim the victory.<br>
Tie 1-1 Hateborns (0-1)<br>
<br>
   Next Kullgen was offended by Raires biased commentary and called her out to the battle zone. A knight of the shadows against her palascum counterpart. Like all palascum Raires started complaining about not having a LoH ready- like there were not over a dozen LoH people standing around the area as she spoke. Both agreed to limit themselves to enhancements they only they could produce themselves then the battle began. Soon it seemed Kullgen's quicker strikes were countered by Raires more punshing blows. Kullgen's skeletal minion was a distraction to Raires before it was obliterated but by that time kullgen had gained an advanatage and soon the palascum was fallen at her feet.<br>
Shadows 2-1<br>
<br>
  Next the other announcer Meledi fled before my superior announcing skills and found herself on the battlefield with Shintou himself. Apparently these two battled before and managed to kill each other and so both were eager for a rematch. Meledi began to try to use the lighty fighting technique called &quot;run around a lot&quot; that Willayen tried earlier. As with him this tactic proved to be ineffective as Shintou and his companion hunted down and finished the bard off while keeping most of his own health. Remembers bards- Shintou is a VERY serious music critic so be careful if you wish to sing around him.<br>
Shadows 3-1<br>
<br>
  Then the most eagerly anticipated battle of the day took place- Gray vs. the Anti-Gray known as Blayze. Though for some reason they seem insistant on carrying the wrong shields- Gray with his bright shiny silver shield and Blayze with his dark skull embazloned shield. The battle began and the two..um...just...stood there staring at each other, for a while before they remembered they were supposed to be fighting. They first prefered to throw hammers at each other for a while before either one of them bothered to move. <br>
<br>
While an occasional root was used these twins seemed intent on bashing each other's brains out. So needless to say this match went on..and on...and on... many times Gray was nearly down but managed to heal himself while he kept throwing his hammer at Blayze. Alas for Gray his throwing skill was not that good as the lighty version of him was only suffering from minor damage. Sensing victory was near Blayze initiated one of the most devestating moves in all of dueling to completely demoralize his foe...he medded. Shortly thereafter Gray fell and the anti-Gray stood triumphant.<br>
Shadows 3-2  Hateborns (0-2)<br>
<br>
   Raires shortly left the announcing booth for good after this- routed by my superior announcing skills no doubt.<br>
<br>
  After things settled down again Trevlin took on Gerda in a shadowknight trying to show a warrior what they are missing by not having spells. This was another case where the pet helped to be the difference as by the time the warrior managed to finish it off she was left weakened for trvelin to finish off.<br>
Shadows 4-2 Hateborns (0-2)<br>
<br>
  Then the Didi- who had been issuing challenges since the beginning of the event stepped into the battle zone and awaited some lighty to take her on. While not as trained in her new profession as she was in her old one- at 20th rank she bravely stared into the line of the lighties and awaited a foe. Raires was supposed to do battle with her but she fled the scene before the battle could take place. Silence reigned from the LoH sideline as none wished to face the Didi. Meanwhile other battles were taking place on the side which could only occasionally be picked up here from the booth. <br>
<br>
  Finally in an attempt to draw out the courtage of LoH at the thought of facing the Didi- the shadows took 6 of their youngest (Didi, Gruum,Ephantasy, Chasik, Kullgen and Kevlan) together and challeneged any light group to face them. As the lighties cringed in fear it seems Mudwart and Fifi were dining on bard flesh as meledi went down to them (Shadows 5-2) but when she came too began to organize a team to face them. Finally Meledi, Krusk, Gwena and Vilis timidly stepped into the field of battle and the battle began.<br>
<br>
However Meledi was still reeling from her defeat at Mudwart's hands and asked for a break and so the action was stopped (meanwhile Faentriel defeated her foe elsewhere- though the victim was unknown and Esuna the killing machine took out Xaenria- and Quoopi avaneged this loss by beating Quinnaros Shadows 6-3). Seeing their destruction inevitable at this point the lighties quickly called Esuna the invincible into their group to save them as now the lighties had nearly a 50 rank edge over their foes despite being outnumbered by 1. <br>
<br>
  The battle began and though the youth of the Shadows did manage to strike down Gwena and nearly fell Vilis the lighties proved to be too much. The survivors chased down Gruum and stepped on the shrunked ogre to clain the win.<br>
Shadows 6-4 Hateborns (0-2)<br>
<br>
  While the lighties celebrated in the spirit of not knowing when to quit- Willayen again stepped forth and challenged Shintou to battle- of course seeing another wood elf to slay before him Shintou needed no other encouragement. Shintou took an early edge as the &quot;running around&quot; tactic was tried again.This time a bit more successfully as the pale elf's arrows took a toll on the shadowknight once he managed to root him in place. Of course Shintou's pet was being an annoyance and occasionally threw off Willayen's aim. Both combatants seemed to exchange the lead with each swing of their blades. Both were not bleeding profusely from many wound and it looked like this would be settled with the last blow. Then Shintou's eyes blazed withfury at the thought of being beaten by a pale elf and he unleashed the full power of his hate at Willayen who found it too much to bear and fell defeated.<br>
Shadows 7-4 (Hateborns 0-2)<br>
<br>
 Next the Shadows put on an exhibition for the demoralized lighties as Quoopi and Trevlin took part in a battle as no lighty was willing to challenge them at that time. The battle went back and forth briefly until Quoopi took the advantage by landing a snare on her opponent who could not return the favor. Then showing the lighties the proper use of the &quot;running around&quot; technique she wore down the knight from afar and he soon went down to defeat to his fellow Shadow.<br>
<br>
  The main event came next as the anti-Gray Blayze took on our..er the Shadows' most seasoned knight- Tallonar in the battle of the heavyweights as Meledi was routed from the announcers booth. At first Blayze was in serious trouble as Tallonar pounded him mercilessly. He managed to heal himself several times as most there thought this was merely delaying the inevitable as had happened to Gray earlier. As we watched Tallonar pound Blayze again and again we waited for Blayze's armor to shatter into a million pieces.<br>
<br>
  But, to our..er the Shadow's surprise- Tallonar was now showing signs of injury from Blayze's throwing hammer barrage and a few spells no doubt. In fact sveral times Blayze managed to heal himself to the point where HE not Tallonar held the edge. The Neriak killing machine continued to pound on his foe as his own life force began to slip away. Enough damage to kill Blayze three times over seemed to have been unleashed and yet the priest still stood. Now Tallonar slipped a bit to the defensive trying to stay behind the priest while he tried casting. In a clever ruse Blayze tried the med taunt on Tallonar tricking us into thinking his mana reserves were spent. <br>
<br>
  However, Blayze sprang to his feet and pulled yet another heal out of his pink helmet. Once more the priest took the lead and some Shadows began to grow nervous- how many more times could Blayze do this? Could Tallonar keep enough of his own health to find out? We had our answer as finally Tallonar landed a huge overhead two handed slash to strike down the anti-Gray and stood briefly over the body as if expecting Blayze to somehow get up once again.<br>
Shadows 8-4 Hateborns (0-2)<br>
<br>
  Both sides took a breathe after that one then the observer from the Northern Elite- Vilis having his tasted whetted by the group fight- answered Kevlan's challenge- also from that same group fight. Kevlan jumped to an early lead using speed and nimbleness to avoid Vilis' blades and took an early lead over the barbarian. Then Vilis entered the warrior madness and Kevlan's edge soon followed- near death from the shadowknight's blades Vilis began taking huge chunks out of his now worried opponent as both life forces drew closer. <br>
<br>
Kevlan tried to suck the life out of Vilis to survive but Vilis' blades were faster and in the biggest come from behind win of the day struck Kevlan down just as Kevlan's own blade soared down for the death blow. (unbiased observers later noticed some more sand at Kevlan's feet where the knight fell- did the treachorous footing bring down another Shadow? Investigations are underway)<br>
Shadows (8-5) Hateborns (0-2)<br>
<br>
  Continuing with the glutton for punishment theme- Sumida again challenged the undefeated Esuna - this time she decided rather than exchange punches she would use her battlestaff this time. Well she should have stuck with the fists. Again the battle started out even but after Esuna pulled off another mend Sumida was beaten down in short order.<br>
Shadows (8-6) Hateborns (0-3) to take the one on one event<br>
<br>
   And on this note the event drew to a close as the horse racing and accuracy events were postponed to a later time as the Shadows had a wedding to go to after our..er their 9-7 victory (or 2-1 depending on how you count). Another victory for the forces of darkness over the minions of lightyness. <br>
<br>
Naturally the Shadows would be more than happy to beat the lighties of Honour once more in the future (and not giving the Hateborns directions to the battlefield). Of course as always- i will be happy to recount the events leading to yet another lighty defeat- in my own honest, unbiased way of course.And before I wrap this up i shall leave you with the thoughts of a wise shadowknight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Evil shall always triumph over good...because good is dumb!&quot;<br>

((OOC- towards the end there were a lot of side duels taking place- i only heard of them from wiehter seeing a duel msg or got a tell from someone involved so i may have missed a duel or two here and there. Thanks to the Didi for keeping her log on-unlike certain folk who sort of forgot until it was halfway over, so i had the info to go back and do this...and find out all the side commentary i missed while doing the play by play &lt;G&gt;))<br>
