People die every day. People die in war. <br>
<br>
3000 innocent people isnt something that happens every day. The united states isnt attacked like that, every day. <br>
<br>
9/11 isnt just another accident, its not a bus fliping on the high way. Its not a incident. Its a act of terrorism and those bastards need to burn. All terrorists need to burn. Those in England, the Middle east..all over the world. They are nothing but scum and should be slaughtered by the dozens.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krogothbitterstar>KrogothBitterstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/11/03 6:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4012.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: God Dammit.. the pain returns</span><hr size=1> Zaith first off.<br>

Calm down.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to shrug off the tragedy. I'm putting it into perspective. I'm not putting the blinkers on. This day I tried to remember every innocent life taken....not just those taken on 9/11.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to tell you that you shouldn't remember the victims of 9/11. You should. I'm here to tell you that this is not the first or last time innocent people have died.<br>
<br>
Remember them all.<br>

I'm going to try and word this the best way I possibly can and I do not mean any offence to anyone by my words..... <br>
<br>
First off.... *hugs Kuladen* ... you write beautifully and it pains me that good people like yourself, and your co-workers have to live with what happened on September 11th, 2001 every day... this said, in a way I think we all do.  <br>
<br>
My ex-husband, (we were just recently separated at the time of the attack) worked in the John Hancock Tower in Boston and the day of the WTC attack he was evacuated because they didn't know then what other targets there might be.   <br>
<br>
He worked for Marsh USA who had offices on the 95th to 103rd (or thereabouts) in Tower 1 in the WTC.  They were the people at the point of impact of the first plane and they were the people trapped above it, along with the employee's of Cantor Fitzgerald and all those in the Windows of the World restaurant, to name but a few.   Twelve months to the day prior to the attacks, my husband at the time was in a conference on the 101st floor.   His company lost around 245 people that day of which around 60 were personally known to my husband as he worked with them daily and more than a few were good friends.  <br>
<br>
The attack on the World Trade Center wasn't just an attack on the United States of America.  It happened on American soil but the victim wasn't just the United States, it was the whole of the civilised world.   Almost every nation around the globe lost a citizen on September 11th, 2001.<br>
<br>
I am not an American, but I choose to make America my home.  My husband is American and my son is American, but I think the impact of what happened on September 11th 2001 impacted on me as much as it did on any American Citizen.  I don't think any decent human being could not be utterly heartbroken and distraught at what happened that day.  <br>
<br>
Bah, I guess what I am trying to say is that the whole civilised world was a victim that day... and we all feel the pain and loss of those innocent people who died needlessly that day.  The mothers and fathers, the brothers and sisters, the grandparents, the sons and the daughters..... too many to comprehend still, even two years on.   Many, many non-citizens lived in the US then and chose to stay even after, inspite of the increased terrorist threat.  You don't need to be an American to feel the pain.  I wept for weeks, literally, after Sept 11th and I wept again this morning when after the first groggy cup of coffee was consumed I remembered.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, on a final note.  You can remember, but you must let go and move on.   If you let what happened effect the way you live your life on a day to day basis you have let them win.    You can't let them do that.  There is no point to anything if you let them win.  The people dying every day in Afghanistan and Iraq are dying needlessly too if you continue to let yourself be terrorized by what happened.  (My personal beliefs on the need for the war in Iraq are largely irrelevant here as there's evidence to prove that Al Quaida and other terrorist organisations, if not then, are now operating in Iraq and targetting the International Troops there.  Remember, it's not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>just</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Americans over there.... ).... <br>
<br>
Just my 2cp.  <br>
<br>
My dream.  One day all this will be over and the innocents will then truly be able to rest in peace.....  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/pet0512/marbles.txt" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
I didn't go to work. I arranged it so I had a dental appointment right in the middle of the day. The nurse had called back and asked if I wanted a late afternoon one. &quot;Nope. 11am is fine&quot;.<br>
<br>
So this morning on CNN the children read names. Colin Powell gave a speech, as the bronx choir sang God Bless America. It was beautiful, and something CNN really didn't mean to do. To watch a man give an inspirational speech, being backed by the voices of the children.. it was nice.<br>
<br>
I cried a little as the children read their names. For some sadistic, or other purpose, the children read about 20 names each.. but one of them in there was their relative. Their father, or mother, or uncle or cousin. Someone they lost themselves. <br>
<br>
I sat on my green comfy couch and watched a girl break into tears for her father.<br>
<br>
I putzed around today. Finally turned off the tv. Jebbar was shouting to me.. 'Turn off the news!' I finally listened.<br>
<br>
Found some stuff I would share.. if possible. <br>

Poem by Karen Alkalay-Gut<br>
<br>
SEPTEMBER 11 STATISTICS<br>
<br>
Don’t think of a number – think<br>
<br>
of each person <br>
<br>
stopped in mid-life<br>
<br>
almost like Pompeii<br>
<br>
frozen forever by the heat<br>
<br>
an investment banker stepping<br>
<br>
from the shattered window<br>
<br>
into the agitated sky<br>
<br>
knowing he will die<br>
<br>
and preferring this <br>
<br>
final<br>
<br>
choice<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
a lawyer calling her husband<br>
<br>
from her cellular <br>
<br>
in the plane’s toilet,<br>
<br>
risking the chance <br>
<br>
of worse terrorist ire<br>
<br>
to spread the news for others<br>
<br>
to be the messenger of Job<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
an expecting father<br>
<br>
calling his wife <br>
<br>
from <br>
<br>
within the inferno<br>
<br>
to comfort her<br>
<br>
in his last moments<br>
<br>
and the beginnings <br>
<br>
of a new life<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
each person<br>
<br>
touched by this day,<br>
<br>
September 11, 2001,<br>
<br>
has touched the lives <br>
<br>
of millions of others<br>
<br>
for generations. <br>
<br>
<br>
