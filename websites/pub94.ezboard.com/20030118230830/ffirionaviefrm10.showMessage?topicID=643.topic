<br>
        Night had fallen upon the Faydark and the chittering of strange beasts welcomed the traveler.  The ever-present mists swirled and churned about the base of the trees as spectral dancers to unheard music.  The chain links of the traveler's armor rattled noisily against the metal plates that he wore upon his arms and feet.  It seemed odd to him to be back here after such a long absence.  It was his ancestral home, but it no longer felt as such.  He walked down the path, spying nobody save a few woodland creatures that scampered out of his way at the sound of his approach.  Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a small bush that lay at the base of one of the mammoth trees.  Upon it were some red berries.  He knew from training received long ago that this was a rare and tasty treat.  He removed his skinning knife and cut off a small clump of the berries.  He stowed them in his belt pouch and continued on down the path.<br>
<br>
        As he rounded a bend, he saw a torch flickering in the distance.  It's harsh yellow light illuminating a flat, ugly wooden structure.  At its base stood a Fier'Dal warrior.  His head was entirely cased in metal.  The rest of his body was adorned in the same fashion.  The traveler approached him wearily, and as he did, the Guard spun quickly showing lightning quick reflexes.  His sword was bared and he had assumed an offensive posture.  The traveler paused for a moment and waited.  The guard eased his stance and took off his helmet as he spoke, &quot;well I'll be.  Morkith?&quot;<br>
<br>
        The traveler chuckled humorlessly, &quot;Aye, 'tis I.  What are they doing still employing and old dog like you Brookrock?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Old dog, eh?  I still have some strength left in these old bones.  What brings you back to Kelethin after such a long absence, Morkith?  I thought that surely you had found some other place and settled down.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;It's a long tale, Brookrock, one that I'm not sure I have the heart to tell currently.&quot;  Morkith began to take off bits and pieces of his armor.  He wrapped and stowed it carefully into his satchel.  The weight of the armor had caused him to sweat, but now, struck by the cool night breeze, Morkith felt a shiver form and crawl its way down his spine.<br>
<br>
        Having now rid himself of his armor, Morkith stretched.  It felt good to be free of its cumbersome weight, if only for a little while.  Brookrock took a step forward and embraced Morkith in a quick hug, &quot;it is good to see you back here boy.  You were missed.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Thank you for your kind words, Brookrock,&quot; replied Morkith, &quot;it's been quite some time since I've heard any such thing.    <br>
<br>
        &quot;Well come have a seat boy,&quot; Brookrock offered, trying to sound cheerful, &quot;take a load off.&quot;  Morkith walked slowly to the base of the platform and set his now full satchel at his feet.  He then sat down upon the wooden planks of the platform.  The weariness of the long journey now beginning to catch up with him.  As Morkith was now well within the light of the torch, Brookrock took a moment to look him over.  This was not the boy that he remembered.  Gone was the young Fier'Dal lad who had scampered and played about the great trees under Brookrock's watchful eye.  Here sat a man, scars crossing his face and hands.  His eyes seemed to tell of much deeper scars that could not be seen by sight alone.  &quot;You look as if you've seen much and done much since last you were here, Morkith.  Come now, tell me some of your tales.  It will be good to get it off your chest.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Morkith inhaled slowly, preparing himself to speak, yet not knowing how to start.  At that moment, a scream came from the darkened woods, beyond the torch's glare.  Morkith could hear the grunting and squealing of an orc and the cries for help of some hapless woman.  Morkith instinctively rose to his feet and unsheathed his weapon, which still rested on his hip.  Guard Brookrock raised his hand and said, &quot;Relax Morkith, you seem to have been through a lot.  I'll take care of this.  Seems like some youngin' has crossed paths with one of Crush's vile children.  I'll be back.&quot;  With that, Brookrock donned his helm and trundled off into the night, his armor raising quite a din.<br>
<br>
        Morkith stretched again.  He was still battle weary and travel sore.  From high above him, Morkith heard a creak and a rumble.  The sound of wood rubbing wood echoed through the night.  Morkith tensed slightly until he realized it was simply the lift that carried travelers to and from the lofty platforms of Kelethin.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I have been away too long</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thought Morkith.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I don't even recognize the sounds of home anymore</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
        The lift finished its descent and there was a young Fier'Dal standing there.  He wore a simple shirt woven of forest leaves and brandished a short blade that appeared to be flecked with rust.  The young elf strode confidently up to Morkith and spoke, &quot;Hey mister.  I'm a newly anointed Champion of the Faydark.  I wonder if you could give me something.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Morkith sighed, &quot;Well, what do you want?&quot; he inquired.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Oh anything is fine.  Maybe some armor or some plat.  I just need something to get going.  It's too hard to start with nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Morkith's eyes flashed with anger for a moment, &quot;I advise you youngling to do your begging elsewhere.  I am not in the mood for it.  In fact, why don't you just do what we all have done and earn it yourself?&quot;<br>
<br>
        The young elf sighed impatiently and said, &quot;Aw, c'mon.  You look big and strong.  I'm sure you have lots of stuff that you don't need.  Can't you just give me something?&quot;  Morkith could restrain himself no longer.  He caught the newly anointed Champion completely off guard.  He reared back and let fly his fist.  It landed squarely in the middle of the other elf's face with a satisfying crunch.  &quot;Oh my Gods!  I think you broke my nose,&quot; he exclaimed as blood began to freely flow forth.  Screw this, I'm leaving.  I heard that people were nice here, but I guess that's wrong.  You can just...you can just eat a bag of hell dude!&quot;  With that, the elf slammed his hand down upon the wooden pedestal that rested atop the platform and hopped upon the lift as it began to rise.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Morkith watched after him for a moment.  He pondered briefly what the heck a bag of hell in fact was.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And what did he call me?  A Druid?  Fat chance.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
        Morkith stood musing a short while longer when Brookrock appeared out of the darkness.  &quot;Piece of Batwing Pie.  Was just a orcy pawn that wandered too close and jumped an unsuspecting Druid lass.  Everything's fine now,&quot; Brookrock stated as he tossed a small, severed blue head into the dirt.  Morkith grinned a harsh grin.  &quot;So, what have you been doing Morkith? he asked as he removed his helmet once again.  Let's here a tale.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Morkith readied himself again, but unfortunately no interruption came this time.  &quot;Well,&quot; he began, &quot;to tell the truth, most of this time that I've been gone, I haven't been adventuring or even resting.  A few years ago, some companions and I were hunting in the foothills near Freeport.  I had heard tell of a set of ruins nearby.  I suggested that we investigate them.  I don't know if you've ever heard of the place...Befallen?&quot;  Brookrock's eyes narrowed for a second, &quot;I see by your reaction that you have heard of it.  Ever been?<br>
<br>
        &quot;Well no, but...&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Good, don't go,&quot; Morkith interrupted him.  &quot;It's the most vile and evil place I have ever...and I mean everbeen to.  So there we were, a casual human acquaintance, some human priestess, I believe her name was Quinny and my dear friend Airawen.  We arrived at the entrance, hidden well within the sand of what is known as the Common Lands.  I would have missed it entirely had it not been for the eerie glow that emanated from it.  As we approached, I noticed that no animals were near the place.  The silence was almost deafening.  No bird sang, no coyote barked, nothing.  We cautiously entered the darkened tunnel and turned a corner.  There before us was an animate set of bones.  Much like the vile creatures that befoul our very forest.  It was felled relatively easily and we cautiously ventured forth.  Once in the main room of that ancient temple (for that is what it was) our nostrils were assailed by the most horrific odor.  Decaying flesh and feces of diseased rats pounded at our senses.  I personally began to reel for a moment.  We waited, gathered our composure and pressed on.<br>
<br>
        &quot;There was no lack of excitement.  I can assure you of that my friend. We fought many a skeleton and rat on our exploratory journey.  We found several of the doors of the place to be locked.  Their solid oak construction was quite stout.  Blades and kicks seemed to yield nothing but noise.  We did continue on where our path was not barred by locks and doors however.  We happened upon one room off to one side.  In it was a musty old bed.  I was shocked to find that the bed was not empty but housed a resting Tier'Dal of all things!  Our cacophonous approach roused him and he leapt up screaming words that I did not understand.  I ran to engage him.  He spoke something softly and I felt the most hideous pain.  My body writhed in sheer agony.  I tried to fight against it, and was finally able to swing my sword once again.  With the help of Quinny and Airawen we managed to best our foe.  Lo and behold, upon a cursory search of his person we found a key.  We tried it in several of the doors until we found one that opened.  Continuing down our chosen path, we engaged several more creatures of darkness.  Ghouls, zombies, and skeletons abound.  We even encountered some of their creators.  Nothing could stop us however.  Our egos grew with every slain opponent.  We traveled further into the dank depths of that curse'ed place.  Then we found our match.&quot;  Morkith took a skin of liquid from his satchel.  He drank deeply for a moment, then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.  Having quenched his momentary thirst, he continued, &quot;We entered a large roundish room.  There's something to be said for keen elvish eyesight.  In the darkness I could see the outline of many shapes.  I strained my ears and could hear the foul whisperings of some of the necromancers inhabiting this hall.  I made motion for my companions to be silent.  Either Quinny did not see me or she did not care.  She strode confidently into the middle of the room.  One of the necromancers noticed her immediately.  I remember him saying something like, 'I'll teach you to mess with me!' and he immediately attacked.  His unholy pet at his side.  His compatriots then leapt into the fray as well.  The three of us hacked and slashed as fast as we could.  We did in fact kill a few of them.  Then, Quinny cried above the din, 'there are too many!'  She began to speak some arcane words.  A grey mist began to swirl about her body.  A small door of mystical light opened up in the thin air.  Quinny stepped through and was gone.  The magical gate immediately began to grow smaller, and then disappeared with an audible 'snap'.  With our priestess companion gone, I knew all was lost.  I screamed for Airawen to leave as well.  She said she would not leave me.  As we continued to fight for our lives, I told her there was no choice.  I told her I would find her later.  But she must leave now.  Even amidst the battle, she nodded gravely and began to speak her own arcane words.  Like before, a door opened up and she stepped through.  With that, I was alone with my enemies.&quot;  Morkith paused once again.  Brookrock could see tears beginning to stream unbidden down the elf's hardened features.  Morkith wiped them away harshly, angered by their presence.  &quot;I fought as hard as I could, yet it was not enough,&quot; he said, his voice cracking under the strain of holding back tears.  &quot;I did not possess the skill to ensure my own freedom.  Before it was all said and done, I lay there.  I was unable to move.  Skeletons were cackling all around me.  My captor stood above me grinning.<br>
<br>
        &quot;There I have been for the last few years.  A prisoner of those tortured souls.   Such experiments they performed on me, I can't even begin to relate.  All I know is the pain would grow to such proportions that I would pass out.  Each necromancer took their turn.  A sample of flesh here, a vial of blood there.  It was hell on Norrath.  They even practiced some of their newly found incantations on me.  Every time they did it, I would feel weaker.  I could feel my strength and health being leached from my body.  They stole memories as well.  I know not how they did it, but somehow it was done.  Not so much the memories of my friends, or my past, but my memories on how to swing a sword properly.  Or on how to effectively use my off hand.  Things like that.  I feel no more skilled now than I did when I first walked out of the Emerald Warriors' Guild Hall.  In fact, that is why I have returned.  To begin my training once again.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;How did you manage to escape?&quot; asked Guard Brookrock quietly.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Escape?  I don't think you could really call it escape.  A group of adventurers had entered those unhallowed halls much as I had done many years prior.  They were successful where I had failed.  They found me in one of the dark chambers well below the surface.  I vaguely remember their arrival.  They killed my guard and rushed to my side.  I lay there as helpless as a newborn babe upon a patch of soiled straw.  I can't rightly remember what they said.  All I know is one of them carried me out of that wretched place.  The leader of their band was a halfling whose name I can't even recall.  He had another one of his friends take up my emaciated form and carry it to the light of day.  There, I lost consciousness completely.  The next thing I remember is waking up in a clean warm bed near Karana's temple in Rivervale.  All my inquiries as to how I got there were met with soft smiles and kind words meant to distract my questions.  I convalesced there for many months.  Slowly, my strength began to return to me.  At least to the point so that I could function on my own.  Several months after having awakened, I informed the kind clerics there that I was ready to leave.  They bade me farewell, but said that before I go they had some belongings of mine.  They led me to where an old but stout wooden chest sat and opened it for me.  Within it lay many of my old pieces of armor, and other belongings.  In addition to those, were some new weapons and a purse filled with platinum coins.  Again I asked where all this had come from and they would only say 'a friend.'  So, on I marched from there to Freeport.  I took the boat (captained by some drunken, half-crazed gnome) to Faydwer.  And now I am here.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;That is a wondrous tale indeed, Morkith,&quot; said Brookrock in astonishment.  &quot;Perhaps Mother Tunare has something in store for you yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Mother Tunare?!  I care not what that cold hearted bitch has in store for anyone.  May she feed the children of Innoruuk for all I care!&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Morkith!  That's blasphemy,&quot; cried Brookrock in utter horror.  &quot;You cannot speak that way of the Mother of All!&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;I prayed to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mother Tunare</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> every day I was in that hellish dungeon.  She did nothing to help me.  Nothing.  I hate her with every shred of my remaining soul.  I live for the day that someone finds her and puts an end to her wretched existence.  I curse her and all that she stands for.  May she rot as one of Bertoxxulous' boils for all eternity.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Brookrock looked deeply saddened.  &quot;I can't say that I agree with you Morkith, but I can understand your anguish.  I just hope that you find peace one day.  You are still my friend and if there is anything I may do for you, please let me know.&quot;<br>
<br>
        Morkith looked down and heaved a heavy sigh.  &quot;I was wondering if you knew the whereabouts of Airawen.  I miss her terribly and would do anything to know where she may be.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Now, that I don't rightly know, Morkith.  I have heard bits and pieces, but nothing is certain.  All I really know is that she ran into some human servitor of Marr.  Garvin or something was his name.  He runs some rag-tag council based out of Freeport.  They call themselves the Slippery Griffons or some such.  She was set to wed him, but then she disappeared.  Some say she displeased her husband-to-be and he slew her in her sleep.  I don't know if I would go so far as to believe that, but still, it is an odd thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Married?  To a human?  That is odd indeed.  Perhaps after I have done some training, I shall go seek out this man and see if I can locate her.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;I would be careful were I you, Morkith,&quot; replied Brookrock carefully.  &quot;'Tis said that he trucks with necromancers.&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Necromancers!&quot; Morkith spat, &quot;how I hate them now more than ever.  If this is indeed true, I must seek him out and see what has been done with my friend!&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;I wish you much luck in your quest, boy.&quot;  Brookrock paused then spoke again, &quot;so, now that you've forsworn allegiance to Tunare, do you consider yourself a friend of the Tier'Dal?&quot;  Brookrock sat on tenterhooks awaiting a response.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Tier'Dal?&quot;  Morkith spat again.  &quot;Nay, those foul creatures can rot as well.  I have no more fondness of them than I ever did.  They are still an enemy of my people, and therefore of mine.  I tried to make nice with their kind once.  But that is another...long...story.  I am tired, Brookrock.  So very tired.  I will leave you now, but perhaps we may speak again someday soon.&quot;  With that, Morkith gathered his gear and pressed firmly upon the pedestal.  The lift came creaking down.  He stepped upon it and pressed the pedestal once more.  As it began to rise, Morkith raised his right hand in silent farewell to his old friend.  He rode the lift to the top and quietly crossed the rope bridge that was swinging in the night breeze.  He opened the door that marked the entrance to Faydark's Champions and stepped inside.  We walked to his old bunk and collapsed in exhaustion.  There he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.<br>
