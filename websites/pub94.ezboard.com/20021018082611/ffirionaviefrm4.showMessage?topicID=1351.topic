Now this is like airing dirty laundry out but I dont give a shit because im sick of this~<br><br>I was in AS for a long time and had many friends there and still do but I ended up leaving.  The reason I left was quite a few reasons because I had been there for so long I really hated to leave but heres the list.  They used to have rules they followed for example: You cannot raid with us unless you are deguilded.  You cannot win loot from a raid that you werent on.  Well as this progression to *uberness* kept on those rules didnt matter.  When Cinny wanted to raid with us she had to be deguilded as well as everyone else and they did, but later on when AS *wanted* certain people that rule was void.  They made it so they can break it so then we had all sorts of people raiding while guilded (cant remember the names) I asked why and it was *because we need these people* soooo forget the people who had to follow the rules.  Then the cant get loot on a raid that you werent there for.  Well there was an incident where we took our whole force out to kill a mob for his main drop which went to a guy who wasnt even on the raid which broke another rule.   Its not just rules that bother me its the fact you feel like youve been slapped in the face or in Cinny's case I feel like shes been slapped in the face.<br><br>Also in raid chat the day I left because of a lot of things really gettin shitty someone said they were helping Uliamarath with her epic.  And an officer in guild chat (no names) said why are you helping her? shes in fire and fury.  and she said because she is a friend.   This officer said you shouldnt help someone in Fire and Fury or Resolution because it puts them farther ahead of us and thats more work we have to do.  This enraged me because that is some shit.  Its not my style to put myself ahead of anyone else especially when it hurts someone else.<br><br>The guild used to be really good before it got so competition oriented and the fuck reso and fnf and anyone else who could put us behind and it turned into rules can be broken no guidelines have to be followed moral or any other kind as long as we get to be the best guild.  People would even laugh when they heard FnF wipe in ToV the same time we were there and everyone knows a wipe can happen from 1 simple mistake or even a bug or glitch and its not any fun so laughing at them is just being a jerk.<br><br>I ended up leaving trying to be nice about it saying my goals arent the same as you alls anymore its been fun and I offered to give back anything they wanted that I had received and all they asked for was my resist gear which I gave back immediately.  I explained why I was leaving in guild chat.<br><br>THEN Xarpolis is telling the guild .. and some others went along with it that I just left for loot.  Now I offered to give back what I had and I was second tank in AS behind Groggle who was in near full warlords so I was next because at that time loot was being distributed in a somewhat linear fashion so I was next yet I left and gave that up and then after a little bit applied to reso which during that period i got no loot for the app process and for 3 weeks while in reso I got Hand me downs (which were pretty good) but still not as good as what I would have got with AS so HI buy some logic how the fuck could I have left because I wanted loot.  <br><br>After leaving I then get backstabbed some people such as Lildaine who I was always nice to in guild chat saying *she will probably join fire and fury because shes a little bitch*  wtf? And this shit has kept up.  Its like a flame me for leaving the guild but its went on for over a month and people I dont even know are mentioning how the guild is still talking bad about me.  Holy fuckn shit I left the guild I tried to be nice about it but yall wont let the shit go.  Are you so fuckn bored I'm like the hot topic? I left because the guild changed and I didnt want to be a part of that.  The guild was the most fun I had ever had and was really great meeting all of the people there who I still thought I got along with but I guess people can be real assholes.<br><br>I am getting sick of this shit constantly flaming me from people in AS.  Leawen you call me a bitch in guild chat and then try to be nice to my face.  I still have some frineds in AS and I hear what you say.  All i can say is grow up youre 16 years old IRL and you cry over erollia breaking up with you in game.  Youre a nit shut the fuck up and quit talkin shit.<br><br>I had hard feelings about leaving AS because I was friends with so many and I had been there for so long but I tried to talk to Xarp first before I posted this shit and he just ignores me so ok.<br><br>All I ask is you quit startin shit with me.  I left the guild.  Get the fuck over it.<br><br>Shayde <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uchinesevboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chinese V boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>random_cleric_01</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/02 3:03:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> Shayde, you fogot the most important reason - you only look out for number one.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucpete2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>c pete2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 449<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/02 3:05:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you only look out for number one.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br><br>and that's wrong because???<br> <p><br><center><br><a href="http://pub131.ezboard.com/famagickaljourneyfrm55"><b>The Clean cut throat,</b></a><br><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/pete3great/"><b>The head case boy next door.</b></a><br><a href="http://www.posterchildren.com"><b>I don't care anymore</b></a><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/02 3:38:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> &quot;And an officer in guild chat (no names) said why are you helping her? shes in fire and fury. and she said because she is a friend.

If all it takes to sway your opinion one way or the other is just the lastest unsubstantiated posting of an incurable board troll then you might want to reevaluate that standard.  Go find someone in Awakened Souls to actually interact with personally, then judge them on that.<br><br>Personally, I have to see this stupid shite get more attnetion than it deserves.  There is a post in the Kudos section right now about Vena, Ogarth, and others who dropped what they were doing (with others) and chraged right into Fear to bail out a massive raid whipe-out when literally *Most* of the pos-50 crowd currently on-line had their corpses stuck in Fear, after the initial raid whiped out, and even their first rescue forcee whiped out.  But the Soapbox gets all the attention, and few people go to the Kudos page.  There's a nice slice of human nature for you.<br><br>It's not my place to judge Awakened Souls, because I haven't grouped with enough of them.  But those I do know are great.  Then again, there are others I absolutely want nothing to do with.  At absolute best, Awakened Souls is a great guild handicapped by a few idiots and the server's need to have an uberguild foil.  At absolute worst, Awakened Souls is a mixed grab bag of people hanging together as a guild for reasons I barely understand, and almost can't be judged the way I'd judge any other guild.  Which is a shame.<br><br>But either way, it isn't as simple as &quot;Four legs good, two legs bad&quot; and trying to approach it on those terms is just a doomed effort.  Go get some experience with AS as individuals and make up your own mind.  Stop believing everything you read, especially here.  It's not a good habit.<br><br>Valquiss <p><img src=http://www.traveling.freehosting.net/valquisssig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 831<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/02 4:19:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> Four legs good, two legs <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> better</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ushaydefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShaydeFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/02 5:42:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> Yes there is plenty of good individuals in AS but this was directed towards the ones who keep startin shit and they know who they are.

Ive noticed that 65% of the AS members ive ran into are very cool people, but the other 35% seem to be pissed off at everyone, or just plain think they are better.  Looks to me like the AS credo (from an officer standpoint) is &quot;Fuck everyone else, we are the only guild that matters&quot;, when in fact, you guys run around like a second rate F&amp;F.  I mean, i can think of a few that like to screw people out of exp in the arena, and then laugh about it...Yeah, those are the people that I want to be associated with.  Shayde, I thank you for your help in Fear, and I apologize for snapping at you, but I really don't like you too much either.  Anyway, before I get UBER flamed, Just let me say this, from my experiences, AS is a good guild with some VERY bad apples. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=316668">Inspect Me</a><br><img src="http://www.screamparks.net/tules.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucrashieg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CrashieG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/7/02 10:09:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> hell out of my arena<br> <p><center><a href="http://www.graphicfreedom.com/eq/Movie1.html" window="new"><img src="http://www.graphicfreedom.com/eq/hobbessml.gif" border="0"></a><BR><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153879"><B>Calvin</b></a>GrandMaster FV - Resolution<BR><B>Hobbes</b><BR>Oracle FV - Resolution<font color=blue size=6></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/8/02 3:42:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> /smack Valquiss<br><br>You can borrow my dictionary so you can look up the word &quot;if&quot;.<br><br>It's too bad AS has become th guild that currently needs to defend itself (though Sisters of Myth may be glad to hear it) but if they don't want this kind of stuff to go unchallenged they are going to have to interact with the community.

Not a knock on AS but i have heard some members of AS be pretty hard on her. My only advice is get to know a person before ya choose whether or not you like them. Its also a bad idea to try and put yourself in shaydes shoes and just make assumptions as to why she left AS, so many people in EQ love to assume that peoples motivation is always greed. Id like think I know shayde pretty well and I would bet just about anything that greed was not her motivation so give her a chance ya new AS people =P<br><br><br>Shazzy <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubriiannalee1000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Briiannalee1000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/8/02 6:32:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1351.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shit I need to get off my chest.</span><hr size=1> I don't blame Shayde for wanted to get it off her chest and if anyone knows her they would know that she has confronted these people bashing her.
