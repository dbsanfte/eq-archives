I have encountered many first time EQ players in the last few weeks and I have tried to give them a good start. Not by twinking (though I have handed out a few gold here and there), but by taking the time to help them get pointed in the right direction. I kind of toss RP'ing aside when I find someone who has no idea what to do next (after just entering the lands). One thing I do is give them this site's address as well as eqatlas and allakhazam's. So, for those brand new players to EQ, how about some tips.<br><br>First, read the manual (and eqmanualsupplement in your eq directory) then visit <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Starting.htm">everquest.allakhazam.com/Starting.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br><br>1. You start out with the &quot;a&quot; key being your auto attack key. Bad bad bad doggie Verant, no biscuit for you! Use the keyboard remap option and change the auto attack to some other key. I use the 0 (INS) key on the number pad myself. The reason is you will die if (when) you forget to hit &quot;enter&quot; before you type your message. If you have, as an example, your guild master targetted when you do that and hit the &quot;a&quot; key, you will attack him and that is a bad thing.<br><br>2. You have 30 minutes to find your corpse after you die if you are level 5 and below or it disappears. Make a hotkey for the location command, /loc (or /l). Instructions on how to do that is on page 83 of the trilogy handbook. Whenever you are about to die, hit that hotkey so you know where your corpse is.<br><br>3. Do not hesitate to ask for help, especially on this server. Lot's of friendly people here. Having said that, do not beg for handouts. It is bad manners and really does not help you to learn the game mechanics. Death is free for the first 5 levels, take advantage of that fact.<br> <br>4. NPC's are stupid. Unless you tell them exactly what they want to hear, they won't reply. Try to phrase your questions to npc's in different ways if they are not talking to you. Hint: NPC's do not like contractions like &quot;I'm&quot; (use &quot;I am&quot;). Also, try to use complete sentences.<br><br>5. Though some may disagree, go to www.eqatlas.com and download (and print out) the map for your particular newbie hunting area. If you are brave and not timid about falling down and pulling yourself back up, you can wing it without the map. It is probably more fun without the map, but it can be pretty frustrating too. Your call. I started on the Karana Server as an enchanter when EQ was a few  weeks old. We had no maps. A mapless enchanter in the Toxxulia forest. What a way to get to know EQ!   :/<br><br>6. I know there are lot's of other hints but that is all I can think of off hand. Any others? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhueth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hueth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/13/02 11:43:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Comment</span><hr size=1>      I would say make sure and train your skills!  When you first get to your guild leader, make a note of what skills you get and when you get them.   Be sure to put at least one training point into a Skill to activate it.<br><br>     When I was about 12th level, I had been grouping with this ranger for a while, and I noticed he never kicked. It  turns out he never trained it (nor forage).   When he was heading back to Kelethin one night, I told him to get to his guild quick and train!   He went 7 levels without kicking.  )  <br><br>     Also - one of my very first characters was a rogue who I deleted at 9th level.  I didn't ever train Hide, sneak, pickpocket, and I didn't know about backstab at 10th.  I was just about to complete my cloth armor set.  I remember thinking &quot;this class sucks.&quot; <br><br>     On the other hand - I thing it's up to the more experienced players to be patient and courteous in game.  I was grouped with a different &quot;newbie&quot; ranger in Highpass recently, and he kept breaking my mezzes with that lag-inducing fire spell all you rangers get at around 15th season.   I adapted, and wouldn't cast Mez until he was done (he did it once per fight, at the beginning).   But some of the other members of the group were getting frustrated and got a litte rude and berated him a bit, hinting at threatening to kick him out.   NO ONE will become a better player when others treat them like that.   <br><br>     So advice for the veterans too - be patient!<br><br>Hal<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxharian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xharian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 1:34:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Comment</span><hr size=1> As a newcomer, thanks a lot for this thread...would be great if other oldtimers add more tips/strategies as well. Well this was my fifth (or sixth?) day on EQ, but here's something incredible I've learned through another player--for any newbies who might be broke:<br><br>Speak to Myrsilla in Northern Karana gypsy camp (just follow the road) She is involved with the Concordance of Research quests and wants Greater Lightspheres---which the wisps drop occasionaly. Wisps can be found in Qeynos Hills, Western and Northern Karanas as well as the Erud's Crossing Island (take the boat from Qeynos to Erudin and it's the first stop) Give the GLS's (if you're lucky enough to get one) to Myrsilla, and sell the item you receive. They're worth more than 7 pp each =) Doing this I already saved enough cash to buy three 12th season spells. Sorry too excited about my new-found wealth, thought I share with the others. <br><br><br>Anrathal Hval'qum of Erudin --- Gatecaller and Student of the Four Elements <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 161<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 1:56:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Best tip ..</span><hr size=1> .. for me was &quot;don't be afraid to restart&quot;.  The early levels (on up to 20 or so) go by much much faster the second time around.  Also, it really does take a while to absorb all the details of play for all the classes.  The description of each class as given by Verant is quite far from what the classes really do in the game.<br><br>Try what you think would be fun and watch and learn how others play their classes.  If one looks like more fun, don't feel you'd be tossing something away starting a new class.  I think I started over at least 8 or 9 times way back at EQ release: couple bards, a rogue, a ranger, lots of druids, monk, war, then finally settled in with a wizard.  Later did war and monk.  Wizard was in self-defence -- that was back in the days when KS'ing was OK by Verant and the only way to keep from being KS'd was to play a class no one could KS from.<br><br>Some classes might be needed more or less than others, but good players are always needed and valuable regardless of class.  Play what's fun for you and it will be fun for those with you, too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxharian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xharian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 2:03:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best tip ..</span><hr size=1> Great tip Bjond!

What you might do now with your class you may not like doing latter.  All depends on your preferance, so I'd recomend researching it a little.<br><br>Also don't be affraid to take critisism no matter how badly worded somene makes it.  Sometimes someone who's been playing awile may ask you to stop doing somthing or start doing something different, and they may word there request to sound offencive.  <br><br>However take the initiative and be polite back and ask the veteran <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WHY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  There are many little tricks those who have played a class may know, things about agro controll and pulling and casting and pretty much everything.  If someone asks you to stop doing something or start doing something either (A) they don't know what they are talking about, or (B) they do know what they are talking about and you have an oportunity to learn something new about grouping your class and other classes that will help you.  Don't be afraid to ask why, if you don't know the why then it can come accross as an order.  So find out the why behind someones request if they make one.<br><br>Also all you vetrans, if you need to corect or guide a newbee to do something different send them a tell so as not to bring it out in the open in front of everyone that they were doing something wrong becase that method can end up being demoralizing.  Instead keep it private and it will be better for bolth of you.  <br><br>One other thing to those that are new.  Many on this server have played MANY classes up to high levels, so even though you may be playing a wizard and some cleric is starting to act like they know everything about your class don't be supprised if they actualy do.  They may have a 60 level wizard on anouther server, or a 60th level bard, or cleric or anything or even a combination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufritzdarkweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fritz Darkweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator<br>Wedgie Avenger</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 4:36:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bestest tip ..</span><hr size=1> absolutely positively without question, reservation or anything else I can say, the number one tip that I would give the struggling newbie is:<br><br>DON'T BEG ME FOR PLAT!

The second worst newbie zone (IMHO) is freeport. Its seems nice, but this an illusion. Even for newbie creatures, the MoBs are poor. If you weren't born in Freeport, don't go there in your early levels. If you were, head to North Ro or East commons as soon as you're strong enough to do so (NRo at about lvl 2 or 3, the east commons about level 3 or 4).

Read the EQ manual for the most basic commands. You don't have to know or read it entirely. Just enough for you to move about and be able to target and kill things effectively and be able to survive your inital encounters. The advanced commands you can learn later. <br><br>2. Read the fantastic EQ web sites. <br><br>You want directions? Then go bookmark the EQAtlas web site. It has detailed maps of every region in Norrath. <br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">www.eqatlas.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>You need info on spells?

Keep mashing that key when in combat or running around, sooner or later (later as you start but it will become faster) your sense heading improves. Very useful for not getting lost and also, if like me, you do not like locs.<br><br>About starting in Shar Val: Hail every NPC you see and talk to them. There are many tasks they give to you, several of those tasks they give you a free container for to fill. Also, for most things from the pit you do not get much money if you sell them to vendors. The reward is much better if you bring them to the NPC who is looking for them.<br><br>Talk to Vah Shir from other houses, find out what they need to fulfill the tasks their Elders set them. Exchange things they need for things you need with them. That way, you will make friends as well as be able to leave the soon boring pit earlier.<br><br>Talk to more experienced Vah Shir that seem to have time and ask them about the surroundings. My suggestion would be to go to the Thicket (south gate) as soon as you hunted all you need for the task from  your professional guild in the pit. As in the city, talk to every NPC. There are many quests for armor out there, know what you need for them (I suggest taking notes, as soon you will have too many tasks to remember). You often need four of a certain piece for the quests, as in the pit try making friends and fairly exchanging things so both of you get four of a thing you need as soon as possible.<br><br>For Kati Sha, you will probably want to learn tailoring. Tailoring is a pain to learn. If you are not adverse to using the web, I would suggest looking up recepies at eqtraders.com. Me personally, I do not consider this cheating, as in a &quot;real&quot; world you could ask vendors and NPC tradespeople how things are made, in EQ they are very limited in their conversation. If you do not wish to use the web, ask more experienced PC Vah Shir about the recepies and what difficulty they are. Train as high as your Elder will train you, then make the easiest things first till you cannot learn from them anymore, then the next harder ones. Easiest after learning all you can are silk cords (3 threads) and tattered rockhopper armor (damaged hopper hide from the thicket and a pattern), which you can wear as well.<br><br>Well, this is what I did and others may differ<br><br>Shakatta - Vah Shir Kati Sha of the 13th rank, somewhat proficient at tailoring (Shadowed Hopperhide I cannot learn from anymore)<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwiegraffolles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wiegraf Folles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/15/02 10:01:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1107.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbie tips (seem to be quite a few new players lately)</span><hr size=1> An easier way to raise abilites like Sense Heading, Hide, and Forage is to map that ability to your directional keys.
