I created Leansi on F-Vie, to continue the roleplay we used to have.<br>
<br>
My newly appointed officer, Morgrist, suggested I post the log of my bard's swearing in of the guild, League of Shadows, for it was the longest rp aspect of my time of F-Vie thus far and to enligten those of the server, Peil's, hrm...Shortcomings. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *chuckles*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I've removed /ooc banter, /whos, most of /gu, etc, as it wasn't appropriate for the post. I do hope you remember Peil's nickname should you ever run into him.<br>
<br>
I give many Kudos to Morgrist for the wonderful roleplaying and jeers to Peil who's idea of rping is feeling someone up and passing threats to females. All in all, my first night on F-Vie was quite a welcome one and I really enjoyed my time here!))<br>

I've had more than one encounter with Peil.  In fact, enough encounters of the kind in the log above, as well as reports from friends of various and sundry not-so-nice acts, that he's one of the few on my permanent /ignore list, never to be removed, both for roleplay reasons (caught him killing wood elven slaves in Crushbone) and non-roleplay reasons.<br>

Why is vermin like this allowed to run the lands of Norrath? Thank you for posting that for all of us to see. This is the nice thing about the /log function. Works much the same as a video camera in real life. There is just no way for the person in question to be able to try and wiggle out of it. You can't get much more black and white than that. I have absolutely no tolerance for sexual harrassment like that, though you more than managed to hold your own. So sorry this was your introduction to our community and your initiation ceremony so rudely interrupted.

Oh, a side note. A member of my guild is named Pail, and he is a wood-elf as well, an extremely honorable one at that. Please make sure you all see the the name Peil and not Pail before calling him Stumpy, hehe. I hate for him to be falsely accused just because he is a wood elf whose name is almost identical to this one's.  <p>Narie<br>
