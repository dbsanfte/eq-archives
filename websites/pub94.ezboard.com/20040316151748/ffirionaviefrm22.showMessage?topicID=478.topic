<br>
I've been brewing for a while now, but I've only recently begun to try and sell my brew in the Bazaar (rather than have Gerbo drink it all!).  So far all I've sold has been Jumjum Spiced Beer, and Heady Kiolas.  The Jumjum isn't much of an issue -- I charge 1gp per bottle (which is actual even a bit high, I'd think, because about 1.2gp yields 10 per combine).  The Kiolas are what baffle me.<br>
<br>
While brewing them up, I decided I was going to charge 5gp.  It cost me about 2.6g per combine, so I figured 5gp was a fair price -- makes up for the cost of combining, and also returns enough to make another.  Profit and re-supply; simple enough.  However, when I got to the bazaar, the majority of the other traders were charging 3pp! per Kiola.  That's a good 9-12 times the cost of making them.  Figuring it must be overpricing, I set up shop for the night, leaving the heady kiolas at 5gp.<br>
<br>
Returning in the morning, I was excited to see that I sold *all* my drinks (jumjum and heady alike).  But when I looked at it, I noticed they were all purchased by the same person.  Further more, this same person was *also* selling heady kiolas, but at 3pp each.  I don't know whether it was my fault for underselling, or if I should write the person off as just some bear of a competitor who wants to selfishly buy out anyone that tries to sell for less than their price.<br>
<br>
Am I seriously undercutting the market rate for heady kiolas (somehow)?  Or is it just a general rule to gouge money out of the tailors?  I want to sell these at a fair, modest price.  I *thought* I was doing that. <p> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/sigv2-5.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
On the surface your idea of charging enough to cover your cost plus the cost to resupply seems fair. But to be honest you are selling yourself short. How much money did you spend getting your skill up to the level you could brew those little delights? <br>
<br>
Then there is the question of how much time you spend on your tradeskills? You could be out with group gaining experiance and loot. You shoud charge more to compensate.<br>
<br>
How much more, well that gets complicated. Mostly follow what people are willing to pay. If you find you sell out overnigh charge more. If you find yourself with stacks of the stuff you can't move, charge less.<br>
<br>
You more than likely invested lots of time and money in building up your skill to brew, now it's time to pay it off. If someone thinks you charge too much, they don't have to buy from you.  <p>Buvin<br>

You are leaving a HUGE sum of money on the table by charging 5gp for Heady Kiolas. Ask yourself the following:<br>
<br>
Why is their a demand for Heady Kiolas?<br>
Are they used in any other recipes?<br>
How much of a hassle are they to make?<br>
<br>
People buy Heady Kiolas because they're trying to skill up in tailoring and are working their way through Wu's Armor. ANYONE who has gotten to the point that Wu's is trivial will probably tell you that never having to make, see or drink another Heady Kiola is too soon for them. They are one of the timesinks for this patch of skillups in tailoring and the most annoying. I found them far more annoying than the mana vials.<br>
<br>
From personal experience, I would buy your entire stock of Heady Kiolas immediately at 5gp without a second thought if I was having to work through Wu's armor again. Even at 3pp I think it's a good deal. Your fellow traders who are savy enough will probably be more than willing to simply buy up yours at 5gp and resell them at 3pp. Why leave all that profit in their hands and not yours?<br>
<br>
A fair price needs to take into account the opportunity cost of not having to make the item yourself. That is worth more than 5gp imho and this helps to explain why you see them for sale at 3pp each.<br>

Kiolas trivial around 50 or so Brewing.  By selling most of my successful combines in the lower-end of brewing, I got to 50 skill for about 5-10pp, and in about an hour of work -- maybe two.  And while it is a bit tedious to make them (each combine only yields one), I can brew up a few stacks, run them back to the bazaar, and have them up for sale in less than 15 or 20 minutes -- thanks to PoK, anyway.<br>
<br>
My biggest problem with it is 3pp seems too steep.  When tailors start skilling up on Wu's armor, they're using what?  4 kiolas?  That's 12pp per combine, PLUS 1-3 silk swatches (swatches are 5-7pp in the bazaar, of if you make your own, 2 silks at 2-4pp each), plus a vial of viscous mana (can't say how much those cost, but if they aren't an enchanter...).  You're looking at 15-20pp, or more, per combine for tailors.  While it's always nice to make a bit of a profit on these, I don't want it to be at the expense of those tailors that I'm trying to help by making them. <p> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/sigv2-5.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Thus, any tailor not willing to pay for them can brew them up easily enough.  If they think the effort of brewing them is more hassle than 3pp each, they'll pay 3pp.  So you might as well charge them that much; it's not like they have no option.  There's no hunting bottleneck, no class or race restriction, no trivial loot code.  This is one thing where I feel a little price gouging is not particularly problematic.<br>
<br>
That said, as a tailor going to start the Wu's run any time now (I keep putting it off...), I wouldn't pay 3pp each.  Unless I got a sudden order for a piece of armour, and couldn't be bothered doing a HK brewing run.  But as a fairly high-skilled brewer, I'll generally make my own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dalninil@firionavie>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/18/02 3:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How does one come up with a fair price?</span><hr size=1> or just make more heady koila<br>
<br>
the real question is how long does it take you to make them, and how much time are you losing to hunting makeing you drink.<br>
<br>
as for someone buying and reselling<br>
<br>
<br>
fill you bags full of them ie 40 stacks of heady koila at 5gp or whatever and have another couple of sets ready to go he'll end up buying and buying and buying *shrug* you're making money.<br>
<br>
I had the same thing happen when i was hunting LDC's I started to sell the silks at 1pp each, got bought out by  folks selling at 3 or 5 pp each so after a while i upped my price.<br>
