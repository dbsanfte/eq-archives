<br>
let's face it, they are classes that are almost designed to be solitary creatures.  there still isn't anything 'unique' about rangers that makes them a must-have class, and druids?  most people just want a quick port or sow, and don't stick around to group with druids because they have a reputation for soloing.  <br>
<br>
our server is based on community.  it has a small-town atmosphere.  lone wolves are looked at rather oddly, or just not in the picture much at all in a small town.  <br>
<br>
of course, i'm fully aware that it's all in the way you play it--you very well could play either class and spend your whole life grouping, and doing a damn fine job.  <br>
<br>
just read the ranger boards at interealms sometimes.  many many from that class suffer burnout, not because they don't like the class, but because others don't see any unique value in the class that demands that they have one along to party.<br>

Worse is that it is my character's class.<br>
<br>
-I- offer something unique.  My character is not just a list of stats.  That alone is why I don't think I could contemplate rerolling her unless something really truly awful happned that caused her to feel she could not go on.<br>
<br>
I started a second account to overcome my own desires to play something different from time to time &amp; then have hardly played the alt, finding it difficult to leave the confines of Caillou's head.  <br>
<br>
Ranger, I can solo &amp; not die, I can group &amp; keep the group from dying (timing pulls, if I am the puller, and other such things), and I can jsut spend time -being-.<br>
<br>
As an side, knowing that there are those here who have been around a lot longer than me who are only in their late 20s makes me not so self-conscious that I ahve been here since about the middle of April (counting from when I stayed &amp; didn't go back again) &amp; am only 22.  I can take a week or more to gain a level, but I see a lot of stuff &amp; do a lot of things in that week of heavy play *grin*.<br>
<br>
As for reroll-itis, I might have to fight the urge to do it with my alt.  She's a bard, though I keep going back to thoughts of playing a pure caster or even someone from the &quot;dark&quot; side.<br>

<br>
rangers are very versatile.  it's just that many players don't see that a whole lot, and they tend to be underappreciated.  i have no idea how it is on this server, as i rerolled my ranger after level 5?  6?  <br>
<br>
also take into account that rangers are one of the most-played characters.  i think it's harder to be unique when half the populace has the same skills you do.  guess it comes down to fine details about character, and how good you are at it. <br>
<br>
i actually met caillou when i was a wee ranger.  it was brief, but pleasant.  i hope she's doing well, and would never deny her a space in my hunting party.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uteiraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teiraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Innoruuk also needs love</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/5/02 4:07:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2228.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/38/38498/pages/89050/teiraa3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cadien!</span><hr size=1> Add necromancers to the list of classes most prone to re-rollitis.

Never by my own choice really. 1st time because I fell into the pond in So. Qeynos, and didn't know how to swim, so I drowned and didn't know how to get my corpse back. No way was I jumping back into that pond to loot it. So, delete and start over.<br>
<br>
2nd time, a friend of mine, who played a ranger, told me how she made a couple plat by turning in poachers heads in Surefall glade. Wiestrum's up to level 6 by now, so off I go to kill poachers. Keep in mind that Wiestrum is a rogue. Find the entrance to the caves behind the waterfall, look at the pretty bear and her cub. Whack!! Off she runs and jumps into the stream hoping to get away (I know how to swim now) Grizzly bear mauls you for 20 damage. Pirahana bites you for 10 damage. Die again, go back to loot my corpse (learned how to do that too) Same bear and fish, still there, die again. A third time, same result. Easier just to start all over, than keep stacking bodies up at the bottom of that stream.<br>
