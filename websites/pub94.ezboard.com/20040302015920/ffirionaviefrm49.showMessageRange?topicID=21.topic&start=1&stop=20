True words, but very very bad words. I've probably regressed like 5 stages in tolerating other people and stuff, but right now its going too far, so something has to be said, the literal truth.<br>
Turn your back, close the window do something, because right now I'm not a happy camper.<br>
<br>
Also, I understand that Not all in the Sisters of Myth are Twink Whores. Most of them are however. If you are not a Twink Whore and in the Sisters of Myth, you get a Cookie or something.<br>
<br>
Okay, now, on with the rant..<br>
<br>
First off, what the FUCK IS YOUR GOD DAMN PROBLEM.<br>
<br>
Do you not understand what Ignore is? Ever since the Incident I've tried damn hard to Disenclude You and your God Damn Twink Whore Guild out of every RP that Shintou does. Sure, if you are truly offended you got your right to be. So I basically did something I rarely do, I just tossed everything out the window and moved on to bigger and better things.<br>
<br>
I've already told one of your members who tried to RP with me that I no longer do storylines with the Sisters of Myth. She seemed kinda new and I don't think she knew much, but she respected my wishes and me and did such, which is ok. Sometimes people dont know the Situation (Which they SHOULD anyhow because you should of TOLD them), I have no problems with giving that friendly reminder, which is all good.<br>
<br>
But Roose and your RP daughter trying to RP with a member of the guild that I am in? No, can't give you the Benefit of the Doubt. I would say I'm sorry, but I'm not.<br>
<br>
Ever since then, I've advoided zones you are in. I've left places where I saw you at. Even Told my friends NOT to talk about your god damn Twink whore guild around me.<br>
Even told Jarhanna that she shouldn't RP with me, cause shes too close to you.<br>
I'm holding up my side of this. What the Fuck is you and your Twink Whore Guild doing?<br>
You're screwing with the League again. THATS what you are doing.<br>
<br>
When I see that Sisters of Myth Guild Banner, know what I do? I advoid it. I advoid it as if it were A Woodelf and she had the Hots for Shintou. I get out of its zone, I leave it alone, and I just leave.<br>
I don't have you all on /ignore, but I effectvily just don't bother with your bullshit anymore.<br>
Is this so fucking hard to do? Can you understand this.<br>
You RP with the League, I'm going to know about it.<br>
And you know what? I don't want to even know that your guild exists, quite frankly. I don't. You bother the guild that I am in, you bother me, so could you please stop bothering me?<br>
<br>
Hell, I even STOPPED one of my stories because I relized that &quot;Hey, I gotta put THEM in the next chapter&quot;. Oh, you can bet your ass that its going up now that you've decided to just go ahead and continue pissing me off, because I'm starting not to care if you get offended or not if I do put it up.<br>
<br>
But you won't listen. You'll cry your little pity song..<br>
&quot;I'm offended! I'm offended!&quot; <br>
Cut the fucking shit, ok? You're not offended, Vivienne is 10 times more offensive then Shintou could ever be.<br>
Offended at the word Whore are we? Aren't we forgetting your little Orgy you RPed out when your Slave girl or whatever the fuck it was &quot;Fisted&quot; your toon. I remember you calling her a Fucking Bitch.<br>
Believe the exact words were..<br>
&quot;You fucking bitch, you're whole hand&quot;<br>
Ohh, but Now all of a Sudden Whore offends you.<br>
<br>
Getting off topic, sorry.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, as I was saying.<br>
<br>
Tell your god damned Guild, Espically that damn Roose and Whoever the hell your other RP daughter is to leave the Guild that I am in alone. We aren't fucking with you, Why are you fucking with us.<br>
<br>
And if you RP with them, you basically RP with me. They are Shintou's family. His people. His Niggaz. Whatever you wanna call it.<br>
<br>
Break the &quot;Restraining Order&quot; if you will that YOU YOURSELF made again however, and *I*, Me Myself and *I* will bring the GMs into this, since thats the game you seem to want to play, and get an OFFICAL one.<br>
<br>
<br>
Know how you can advoid this? Just LEAVE us be. Do a Guildmotd. Tell them not to RP with Shintou and his friends. Hell, say its because he's a 13 y/o who can't RP nothin if it don't involve some kinda sick killing and only gets off on killing things, I don't care! Just LEAVE us be. I'm done dealing with you, and I really don't want to hear your name ever again. <br>
Its offensive to me now. And I don't have to tolerate being offended.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>
(I acually toned this one down, it was much much more cursewordly. Be lucky I acually grew up a lil) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roninsenshi>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 1203<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/26/02 3:30 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright I've had enought of this Bullshit, Vivienne.</span><hr size=1> Oh, and if you are wondering what happened if it wasn't clear from the first post, One of the members of the guild that I am in said that Roose and Viv's RP daughter (Name still escapes me, similar to Vivienne's, wouldn't be shocked if its an alt of some kind) was bothering him. Saying they were going to Kill him (I'm sure they meant in Character, but thats not the point) for something that he didn't even do. (Believe it was 'Spying' on the SoM, but he didn't even know their guildname. He was like &quot;It was some guild .. Sisters or something.) <br>
<br>
If you will remember, it was a similar incident, Vivienne threating to kill Didi that got Shintou hunting her Down and which she ended up becomming &quot;Offended&quot; (And now I will use the Term Lightly in the case of Vivienne), and now they are trying to start this trash back up again, and I'm not going to get suckered into Rping with them again just so they can become &quot;Offended&quot; and make me look like a dumbass again. <br>

This is the cause of your grief. Why?<br>
<br>
Firstly, you are not the same as your guild. You guys might be close, but a guild where I can't interact with anyone another member has a problem with is a guild I'd like to leave. Secondly, if you are trying as hard as you claim to be in your effort to completely and totally disacknowledge SoM, why is it such a stretch for you to pretend there isn't any RP interaction between them and other members of LoS? I mean, unless you're RPing with some of your friends and then some SoM chick walks up and tries to butt in, then it's not like it's being rubbed in your face. How would you even know unless you asked? Thirdly, why is it that you think that you should be allowed to control who other LoS members get to RP with? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzarothfv>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sweet and Innocent</span><br>  Posts: 785<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/26/02 3:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright I've had enought of this Bullshit, Vivienne.</span><hr size=1> Didn't read your second post before I made mine, but we're IMing now so n/m. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kundow@firionavie>Kundow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/26/02 5:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright I've had enought of this Bullshit, Vivienne.</span><hr size=1> Hhmn...I really love all you people who are more involved in the RP and guild interaction.

<br>
Your guildie's mistaken.  That RP daughter with a name similar to Vivienne's would be Viennique, and that would be my alt.  Here's the situation:<br>
<br>
Guild meeting in FQ.  Nothing secret or anything.  We notice a Leaguer in the zone.  She (Jazmynne or something similar...definitely not a &quot;he&quot; name) is doing pottery at the wheel by the soulbinder.  Some of the younger Sisters start to wonder if she's spying on our meeting, so they go down to &quot;question her.&quot;<br>
<br>
I followed them down shortly thereafter to find them staring down the Leaguer and the Leaguer says something like &quot;I don't know what you're talking about.  Go about your business.&quot;  And I tell the three Sisters to leave the Leaguer alone and go do something constructive.<br>
<br>
Then I APOLOGIZED to the person at the wheel for what happened.  I did not do it, but I apologized anyway.<br>
<br>
Another thing...Roose wasn't even involved with the situation.  She was up talking to Vivienne the whole time.<br>
<br>
I realize this is going to come to &quot;her word against my guildie's,&quot; but these are the facts.  Believe them if you will.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I believe the Sisters in question are new, and came in after the last big confrontation.  Mistake has been made, hopefully mistake will be forgiven.  I'll make sure Vivienne keeps the new Sisters informed on what's happened in the past. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fyanna@firionavie>Fyanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Handmaiden of Pain</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/26/02 8:02 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/fyanna/blade22sm.jpg height=200 width=143.gif></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright I've had enought of this Bullshit, Vivienne.</span><hr size=1> Heh, I knew this would end up here.<br>
<br>
I was awake during this incident. We had a guildmember (a recent addition, if I am not mistaken), using the pottery wheel or some such in a city. Near to him was apparently a gathering of the Sisters of Myth. Our guildmate asks us on guildchat why this group of sisters of something or other are accusing him of spying on their meeting while he is innocently crafting. We ask him who the guild is that is bothering him, and when we find out it is the Sisters I just tell him to forget it, not to bother dealing with them. I briefly try to explain that we have a policy to not interfere with them, and they should in return leave him alone.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later he is telling the guild that they are threating to kill him. Now, obviously this is taken as an in-character statement, so no one is trying to say that the Sisters were threatening anyone OOC. However, my problem is that from a roleplay standpoint, if another character challenges myself or my guildmates to duels/deaththreats, then I feel obligated to accept and draw blades. Trouble is, we have a policy of non-interaction with the Sisters. So...why is it that we are provoked and challenged, yet are forbidden to respond?<br>
<br>
We've kept our end of the deal. Every time Shintou has gone off on the Sisters, it has been in reaction to their provocations. If you play with fire, you get burned. Quit trying to see how far you can reach into the lion's mouth before you get your hand bit off, and then come crying about how you are offended. You know what the League is and what we stand for. We are the Dark Path, and as such we respond to roleplayed conflicts in a bloody and vicious manner (well, I do, at least). You have made it clear that you do not enjoy engaging in that type of evil roleplay....so why do you persist? <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/anime4/fyanna/snk_kojirou3.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fyanna</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Fell Knight of Thule<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Hitokiri to the League of Shadows<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> There can be no salvation without destruction,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> no hope this side of death..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fyanna@firionavie>Fyanna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Handmaiden of Pain</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/26/02 8:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alright I've had enought of this Bullshit, Vivienne.</span><hr size=1> Made my post before seeing Jaranna's. If what she says is true (and I've no reason to believe otherwise), then it does indeed sound as though the situation was simply caused by new members on both sides not fully understanding the situation. Glad to see that it was handled in that way, unfortunately I was not aware of the resolution at the time (might have missed some guildchat messages due to battlespam, ect).<br>
<br>
I was simply confused because we had assumed that the Sisters were trying to stir the pot again. I cut a great deal of slack for new members who will occasionally put their foot wrong (I do all the time, its hard to try and catch up with a year's worth of roleplayed history when you weren't present for most of it). <br>

See this is where I'd use Edit and remove it cause if what you are saying is true then well their is no more reason to have this rant there. But it did its job, I found out what happened and it was just a simple mistake, but I mean come on. Guy was doing pottery, and they're trying to jump down his neck. Couldn't you have your meeting elsewhere, I mean I wouldn't gather a bunch of people around a SoM member. We would just go to a more suitable location. <br>

Oh well, if its as you say then its just a mistake I assume, but I don't totally 100% believe you, cause you wear the same tag as her, and she likes to lie. Got a Log? Screenshots?<br>

The facts are these...Vivienne, on more than one occasion, has requested that Shin stop roleplaying with her. And he did...only to have her, basically, control his RP....meaning, he can either play Shintou the way he has for the last year, and risk PoViv freaking out all over the place again, or he can NOT RP his character...HIS.,,ok, to continue...<br>

the first was....Shintou's an offensive character, I'll give you that. PoShin...well, you obviously cannot know, now can you?<br>
<br>
He had a problem, discussed it with Viv....REPEATEDLY...only to have this HORESHIT drug through the mud, with that WHOLE GUILD slinging half truths and outright lies, all because one character (IN CHARACTER, mind you) doesn't like...women of loose virtue.<br>
<br>
Now, to further continue this, I back PoShin(not as a moderator, this thread is now up to one of the other mods to watch, as I've waded too far into it*blush*) in any of his rantings about PoVivienne and SoM...I've dealt, in much smaller proportions, as I play a female character, with the same sort of BS &quot;come here, go away&quot; horseshit that this guild is famous for.<br>

Why?  Because of events and history, an agreement was made between our guilds not to speak IC or OOC to each other.  All members.  That explains to you outsiders why Shintou is upset about it even though it happened to another. <br>

Sarhea... you are so full of f***ing bullshit... I believe Braellar some you up best as a lieing cow. Shintou has NEVER spoken to me about anything at all. He has NEVER made ANY request to me.<br>
<br>
And he was nothing short of polite? Gods, are you really that ignorant?? Read his first bullshit post, Lady!! And he asked for abuse when he comes into this place crying like a f***ing child, because he knows that all of his good little friends in his little clique will support him, so shut the fuck up, please.<br>
<br>
This crap Shintou decided to involve himself in YET again was a misunderstanding on the part of a couple of my members. I did not wish them to bother Jazmynne but there was so much chatter going on, they must have missed my request ( as we just concluded a guild meeting and people were getting organized for hunts ). Jazmynne is a friend of a guild member so I tried to put a stop to it.<br>
<br>
In any case, the matter was dealt with quickly and apologies made, PoShintou did NOT have any business coming here and publicly slamming and humiliating my guild, me, and my guild members YET AGAIN. But, oh no, this is just another excuse for him to pull the same bullshit he always does and try to come off innocent, playing the hurt little boy. He always looks for any little excuse he can to attack us.<br>
<br>
And to set the matter straight, NONE of my guild members are whores, NONE of my members have traded sex for items, money or anything. How did we get this reputation, Sarhea? From YOU, you and your little cohorts like Didi and Shintou. You call us a boil on this server? That is the kettle calling the pot black. You and your little clique are nothing but bullies and your arrogance is disgusting. YOU spread lies and bullshit about us, so kindly cut your crap and stop acting like an innocent little princess...<br>
<br>
To all others reading this, I apologize for the anger and swearing, I always try to deal with things politely and with courtesy. But I f***ing sick of these people prancing around here, acting all smug and superior, while slamming others. Members of my guild have actually been hurt by Shintou's and other's remarks, and I am tired of it, I am tired of their bullshit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tzarothfv>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sweet and Innocent</span><br>  Posts: 799<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/27/02 4:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sighs at Shintou</span><hr size=1> Sarhea has shown that she can take care of herself in times like these, but I want to interject.<br>

NO! not rude.. poshin??? NEVER! <br>
<br>
He cannot make a point without using at least fifteen swearwords.. He didn't even attempt to get the facts straight before launching into his petty little rant.. HELLO?! Did you even read what actually happened? Do you people not understand that mistakes can be made?? <br>
<br>
Obviously, it was a couple of new gamers who had no idea of the history, interacting with a possibly vaguely familiar face as it was a buddy of one of the SOM players. When what was going on was discovered, the innocently offending members were dealt with, and the offended party was APOLOGIZED TO! <br>
<br>
As I understand it, the problem is being further dealt with internally by the posting of a guild MOTD and/or message informing EVERYBODY briefly of the history of all this crap and that certain parties are to be left alone.. How do you know they are not dealing with it? Do you stop to ask? No. You have a freaky little tantrum and all your buddies gang bang the guild and anyone who supports them.<br>
<br>
Read Sumida's post. Learn from it. He states his opinion without making rude accusations. What he says is very true. The young ones need to know. If that is being dealt with then what is the need for all this public hate?? <br>
<br>
All I am trying to say is that there was no need to drag this into a public board. Yes, a member of Shin's guild was RPed with. Yes, the people involved were told of their wrongs. Yes, the offended member was apologized to. And, yes, provisions are being made so that this won't be an issue in the future. <br>
<br>
All of this was accomplished without Shin needing to go on his little tirade. It's not like a SOM'er just RPed killing one of his best buds.. Did he even know this char, or did he just jump on the chance to cause shit for the SOM? <br>
<br>
Some new chars made a mistake. It was dealt with. <br>
<br>
So, in turn, you DEAL WITH IT and leave it be.<br>
