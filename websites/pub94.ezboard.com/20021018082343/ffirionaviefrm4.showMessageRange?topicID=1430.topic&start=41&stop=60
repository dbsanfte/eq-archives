<br>
I personally follow the view of Peter Singer.  Some of these ideas are very unpopular.  Where do I draw the line?  I draw the line at suffering.  I think out of all feelings, that suffering is the worst that any animal can go through.  A two month old fetu does not suffer.  A person with a life ending disease does not suffer when they choose assisted suicide.  A carrot does not suffer.  What does suffer?  A cow at the slaughter house.  A abused human child.  A pet tied outside and ignored.<br>

That is where I draw the line.<br>

So a cow that meets an equaly quick and arguably painless death suffers more? <br>
<br>
Trying to push being a Vegitarian because you think its &quot;healthy&quot; is one thing. Trying to push it because of the &quot;poor animals&quot; is another. <br>
<br>
Ive shot moose, did I feel pity for them? No I did not nor should I. Its not like the moose's poker buddys are gonna miss him next friday night. His wife isn't going to wonder when he is going to come home. And his kids being beasts driven by instinct alone don't even know they have a father in the true sense of the word.<br>
<br>
Did he feel pain? im sure he did, right up to the point I put a 30 ot six round through his eye. When you can prove to me that a unthinking beast has other unthinking beasts that will truly mourn his passing then ill rethink hunting meat. The same moose runs the risk of being slowly eaten alive by a bear every day of its life. Or breaking a leg and being draged down by a pack of wolfs and eaten to death. Or better yet starving to death during the long winter. I can think of many other things in nature that would have given it a much more horrible end than I did. A cow stuck in the same environment as the moose wouldn't last a week. So what do you prepose? We let loose all the cows and give them their god given right to freedom?<br>
<br>
People always make the comment &quot;we are animals to&quot;. Thats right we are animals to, and like other animals we feed ourselfs from other living things. Some with meat and vegetables others with just Vegatables. Its a matter of prefreance, and if you wan't to feel sorry for the animals. More power to you, its your right. But feeding us nonsensical philosiphy about the feelings of instinct drivin animal's isn't going to sway my opinion thats for sure. Call me ingrorant if you like, its not gonna hurt my feelings anymore than puting a slug through a moose hurt his <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 985<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 4:00:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ~(8^0)-I----&lt;</span><hr size=1> Many animals show mourning of their dead, from prairie dogs to elephants.<br>

I once watched a beautiful show where the alpha female of the pack worked her way back to the omega female, and being the oldest, she died while all the other wolves were hale and hearty.  Despite how it appeared they treated her cruelly, making her eat last and show complete subservience to any other wolf, they all stayed around her body for a day, howling and nudging it.<br>

I can't believe there are people that believe animals aren't capable of thought.

&lt;ahem&gt;<br>
<br>
Pardon the outburst. I eat meat. I would prefer meat cost twice as much but be devoid of steroids, pesticides, hebicides, growth hormone, and/or injected water to increase weight and therefore revenue per animal. It would be nice if cows and chickens were not commonly fed ground up cows and chickens. (Illegal for cows now due to mad-cow....like it takes a friggin' epidemic to figure out this is a bumb-ass idea.)<br>
<br>
Despite all that I eat meat. Pork is good, wild game is great, and there are some ranchers producing meant with more desirable methods. Sadly it is hard to get and costly, so often as not I cannot get hold of the stuff.<br>
<br>
Cielo, Calliou, and others shared good thoughts on this. Sorry for those that are offended by some of the more raw, (pun intended), commentary. Most of it I think is meant in humor, but folks get touchy on this kind of subject because they take a lot of crap. (Either side too, I've been harassed by Vegan/PETA commandoes, and they are real annoying.) Should bunnies get cosmetics injected in their eyes to test for chemical reactions before human ladies weak the makup? Heck no, we have death row inmates for that, save the bunnies! &lt;again pauses to collect himself&gt; Like any group, there are lots of nice Vegans, and then there are the other ones.....<br>
<br>
I will leave you with a parting shot at some of the PETA level fanatics. I hate the &quot;moral majority&quot; as much as the next guy and, have zero interest in making abortion illegal for practical reasons.....but you gotta admit arguing against the slaughter of animals for food, while at the same time arguing that abortion is a perfectly reasonable birth control choice.....is a real head scratcher. Sadly these extremists make life hard for the &quot;live and let live&quot; Vegan who gets lumped in with the whole.<br>

Maybe we should reeducate them.<br>
<br>
Whether you like it or not, Humans are Omnivores..... we eat meat as well as plants. Having free will we can choice to do things not just based on natural instincts, so if ya want to be a vegetarian, be one. But dont tell me I cant eat meat.<br>
<br>
It still remains a fact that in order to recieve the right amount of vitamins and stuff you have to be very careful in a vegatarian diet. We get a lot of important stuff from meat that isnt easily replaced by vegetarian only diets.<br>
<br>
I wont tell you what to eat, but do me a favor and dont tell me what to eat either, or tell me how the poor animal is mistreated.  Anyone see the idiot drink Beer adds?<br>
<br>
We have a responsibility to not mistreat what we have control over.  But excuse me if I am not going to starve because a pig lives in a cement house and a cow mourns for a calf.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil<br>Look out! ...Rar!<br>New lizard Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 578<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 11:23:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1430.topic&index=50>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/CyrusVI/fullsize/keliskpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: No, Vegans CAN'T eat you!  Can they?</span><hr size=1> What the freakin' hell.  Here's a little story for ya.  This is how they kill a cow in the typical meat factory.<br>
<br>
1: Cow is herded into small cell.<br>
<br>
2: Man takes uber-tazer-stungun thingy and gives cow a bolt in the face, instantly numbing its entire body.<br>
<br>
3: Man takes bigass hammer<br>
<br>
4: Man whacks cow in skull.<br>
<br>
There. Done. Painlessly, efficiently, over in less than a minute.  There's no suffering, no mourning by the other cows ((Because they are stupid freaking cows)), and about fifty more Cheeseburgers are on their way to the local Jonny Rocket's.  Now, of course, these are cattle that have been bred through sometimes hundreds of years and domesticated, and are made perfectly to produce the best meat possible.  They are not born in the wild, roaming free, and one day captured by evil moo-nappers to be slaughtered.<br>
<br>
Really, it's the difference between hacking down a public rosebush and pulling up your potato crops.  In essence, there isn't any.  But one would get people saying &quot;OMG! U R TEH PLANT SLAUWTURER!&quot; and one would get them saying &quot;Hey!  Spuds tonight!&quot;.<br>
<br>
Let's look at it another way:  the argument I've seen most here is that of &quot;Well, the ANIMAL can FEEL stuff and the PLANT, um, well it can too but it doesn't make any fuss about it so I'm gonna say it doesn't!&quot;.  Well, what about Human vegetables?  That's right, the folks who punched themselves in the head with a brick too many times and are only alive through a technicality.  They have no mental activity, their nervous system is dysfunctional; in essence they feel nothing.<br>
So!  Here's an idea: how about you gather up ALL the world's &quot;living&quot; vegetable-people and lay them out in a field somewhere, and we'll have a great bug bar-bee-kew!  After all, they're called &quot;vegetables&quot; because they don't feel anything!  So it's no different than reaping these &quot;vegetables&quot; of yours that don't feel anything!  Yes, and let's also toss in all the two-month-old fetuses that don't feel anything, and we can make some cocktail weenies!<br>
<br>

Can they?</span><hr size=1> One small correction in this. Humans do NOT taste good. It is one of our survival traits. Most creatures spit human out after they take a bite. The term &quot;maneater&quot; for sharks is a misnomer. They are &quot;man attackers&quot;. Usually they attack, thinking that humans are seals or such. A shark gets a mouthful of human, and it's spit, GACK!! what the hell was that?<br>
<br>
Also, one of the reasons to most people, that meat, dairy products and other such things &quot;taste&quot; good is that they have nutrients that are difficult to get in nature. It is one of the reasons that first wolders are getting bigger, AND fatter and unhealthier. They eat too much of these items. That which was needed but rare, is now easily obtainable, but still tastes GOOD. (ummm, ice cream)<br>
<br>
My only complaint about Vegans (not vegetarians, in my exp it has only been with Vegans), is the idea that their pets should be vegans too. The LA Times ran a couple reports in the last few years about malnourished and very ill dogs and cats whose owners fed them only vegetables. Get a clue. They ARE carnivores. Yes they might be able to eat some non-meat products, but they are not built in ANY WAY for a meatless diet. I have heard that in the last year a non-meat pet food has been created, but have never seen evidence of it. If so, more power to the creator. Hopefully it works great and people who won't eat meat, can now let their pets live the same lifestyle in a healthy similar fashion. <br>

&quot;Oh yes folks you will eat the meat.. You WILL eat the meat because one day you will wake up and realize the simple fact that stares you in the face every day that you're eating vegetables.... Eggplant tastes like eggplant, but meat tastes like murder and murder tastes pretty GD good doesnt it?&quot;<br>

<br>
Sorry, the cow is dumb. They are trust me, we have over 50 head in our family. Left on there own they die. If they are not milked, they die. Mastitis kills them. They cannot wander free range for long before they...die.<br>
<br>
Before you talk about cows, go work on a dairy farm some time. You might be suprised at how well they are treated. And you would undoubtedly see that cows are bascially, well cows. Without human care or interaction they die. It has been that way since the beginning of time my man. <br>
<br>
People are different. If you like veggies great. If you like meat, great. Who gives a shit. Pretty shallow people if you have to pick each others food choices apart. Good lord theres alot more going on in the world that certainly deserves more attention.<br>
<br>
And humans are above animals dammit. I would like to see a cow paint the sistine chapel, I would like to see a mule develope a polio vaccine. Show me a hamster that can make a message board where we can flame each other over dumb crap like this.
