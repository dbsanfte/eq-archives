<br>
As I said in my original post, I was in a deep depression and I had several social problems, I felt alone, even felt like I had no reason to live, and I met someone that would shift the direction of my life from that point.<br>
<br>
She was gorgeous, and I felt grotesque, and I don't mean it only in a phisical way. She was charismatic, amaible and really beatiful, but at that time I was so close-minded that I felt she was completely out of my league, as a friend, as a person, as a woman.<br>
<br>
Then I remembered I met her a year ago, we used to have a class together in the last year of high school, we really didn't talk much, but I really had good thoughts about her.<br>
<br>
For my surprise she was really interested in me, as a person.<br>
I really thought that I would finally overcome this depression in where I was living, she actually had a boyfriend, but I ignored that fact, and decided it was safe to get to know her as deep as I could. <br>
<br>
We develop a wonderful friendship, something that although sounds good, it was not, because when I was starting to develop feelings for her, she felt honest to tell me everything about her, including how wonderful her boyfriend was with her, and I started to realized that I got myself into the worst nightmare. <br>
<br>
But I kept dreaming that everything could work out as I wanted, ( and I still do ), we were best friends, we would talk for hours, but each time she would talk about her boyfriend I would felt so bad I wanted to literally die, from time to time I felt worse about it, I couln't live without her, and she started noticing that I was acting a little bit weird, so in a sane way she confronted me, and I told her what I felt.<br>
<br>
She has been like an angel to me, she helps me out whenever I need help, and viceversa, so she understood my situation, but she couldn't deny how much she loved her boyfriend, so she told me that it was best to split up, since she didn't wanted to be responsible to hurt my feelings, I felt liberated, for a bit, but as the days passed, I couldn't concentrate in anything, I thought about her all the time, and I wrote her an e-mail, about what I was feeling. <br>
<br>
I told her how I missed her, as a friend, and I said that I will do my best to ignore those feelings because our friendship was so important. I failed to do that. Two months later I am loving her more and more, I think she forgot all about that week, and in the present we still talk as much, we are still best friends, and I still dream that somehow things will work out in the future, she really loves me as a friend, and I want to believe that she can feel someday that I can be more than that.<br>
<br>
But I really wonder if I am doing things right, my love is not selfish, I want the best for her, and I want it for me too, and I know I would be the happiest man in the world if I was with her, of course, I wouldn't feel happy if she was with me without real love.<br>
<br>
I really wonder what should I do, I have thought many times about trying to forget her, I have tried to meet other people, tried to ignore her a little bit and stop getting together, but I just can't, I love her too much as a person, as a friend, as a woman. <br>
<br>
What should I do? split up? something that would prolly break my heart, or be patient and wait?, If you can, please let me know what you think, I know she loves me very much as a friend, as much as I do, just that my loves goes beyond that point.<br>
<br>
Thanks and my apologies for the length of the post, like I said in the last one, it really takes long for me to express my feelings. <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
We can't help feeling how we do, despite our best interests. But we can try to nudge ourselves away from things that will cause us pain. I think the worst thing you could do is just quit this girl cold turkey. For all practical purposes, you sound lie the best of friends, and nothing's worth losing that over. However, that said, you need to confront yourself with the reality of how things are, and most likely, how they will be. If you truely love someone, deep down, then you will want what's best for them, what makes them happy, no matter what. Sure, I know it's hard letting her go in &quot;that way&quot;, but that doesn't mean you have to lose the friendship.<br>
<br>
I know moving on doesn't seem to be working, but I think perhaps you need an epiphany before it can. And I think you need to, before you dig yourself too deep into something that is at heart just a fantasy. If you don't know him well, meet her boyfriend. If you already have, and he's a great guy, then try to make him a friend as well. After all, if they are both your friends, the only thing you'd be losing is the intimate parts...and while I'm sure it's tempting to think about those, true love is a lot more than that. If he's not a great guy, let her know, but don't try to break her heart. After all, I'm sure you don't want her to end up with someone that you know will hurt her in the end, but hurting her now to prevent hurt later isn't exactly the way to do things.<br>
<br>
You need to get to a point where you can smile becaause she smiles, frown when she frowns, laugh when she laughs...and not care about the what's and why's. If she's happy about being with her boyfriend, you should be happy that she's found such ahppiness. If she gets married to him someday, you should try to be the one crying tears of sappy joy at the ceremony, because you know she's so happy as well. Can you find happiness on your own, aside from her? Sure you can. Will it take time? Yes, and certainly work as well. You have to remember that it's not only what's best for her, but also best for you, and dwellnig on her like this isn't the best thing you can do for yourself. Cherishing the friendship you have, seeking someone she can be happy you are with...these are goals you should work for, mno matter how difficult they might seem to be.<br>
<br>
Hm, I hope that ramble helped. Just remember: you love her, and that means accepting that she might love someone else as well, and that it's not a stronger love nessisarily, just a diferent kind. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/2342310.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kanoganv>KanoganV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/29/03 12:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1488.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.battle.net/war3/images/human/units/animations/paladin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Was wondering. #2</span><hr size=1> .I read everything you said, I admit the true might hurt sometimes, and some thoughts I had really did, and I will try to ignore my feelings, maybe I am being a little selfish.<br>
<br>
But besides that, you think there is any posibility of us happening, she is just 19, I am not sure if he will be the man of her life, and I may be exagerating, but I want to be that man, I fear that feeling, I don't want to get obsessive, but it keeps coming back to me.<br>
<br>
I just hope at the end we both can be happy, in the way life decided it to happen, if we end together, great, if we end with someone else, also great as long as we are both happy. But I just don't want to suffer what I am suffering anymore, I am so confused. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=635758" target="top"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:navy;font-size:medium;">Kanogan Val'Kad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The future can take a lot of sharp turns, and usually in ways we never even thought of possible. You're both young, and you have plenty of time to work out what you think, what you feel. I don't want you to ignore your feelings. On the contrary, that's the worst thnig yuo can do. Do you love her? Good, then don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ever</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tell yourself you don't. What you should do is try to work out those feelings, try to reanalyze them. <br>
<br>
That thought about being together in matrimony? Try to think of it as being happy friends, and you visiting their house once a week or something. Should you stop thinking of the possibility that things might go differently, that you might end up together? Well, not in the strictest sense: everyone should dream. But you can't focus your life solely on one dream, and think that that's the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> way things should turn out.<br>
<br>
She talked to you before about stuff like this: maybe you should talk to her again. Try to ask how happy she would be with a friend like you, even if things could never go beyond that. You'll have to ask yourself that as well. Obviously, if things go different, you can ask her how shou'd feel about being more tha nfriends. But in the meantime, you just have to accept what you've got, and that's a precious and dear friends that you could lose if you try to worry about it like you are.<br>
<br>
Life is rather confusing, and at times it can hurt no matter what we do. But you decide to aim yourself towards a path that will leve you both happy, even if it's not perfect, if you try.<br>

That is probably the worst thing you can do. You need to accept how you feel while at the same time accepting the situation. Try to accept that now you two are good friends and that is all that you are, for now. You never know what the future holds but it seems that all she wants from you is friendship at this time. This is something she appears to treasure, so accept that she may only want this and try to be open to having feelings for others. <br>
<br>
From what I have gathered by your two posts I think I see something of an underlying problem. You are depressed, lonely, and lack self confidence. Now you have this person in your life that brings you happiness, companionship, and someone that you can talk to. The possible problem I see is that you are somewhat using this person to fill in this lack of self confidence and depression, like a crutch. Much like with your escape into the world of EQ, you are missing the problem by concentrating on her. I strongly advise you to back off from her, not physically distance yourself or the friendship, but your feelings for her. This does not mean ignore them. You need to move your attention from her to yourself and deal with yourself. It is dangerous to draw your happiness and confidence from another person instead of yourself. Once you have dealt with your problems and have found your inner peace, happiness, and self confidence then you be much more stable and ready for any such relationship. Happiness does not come from without, but from within. Yes others can make us happy, but you will never be truly happy until you are happy with yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kanoganv>KanoganV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 340<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/29/03 12:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1488.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.battle.net/war3/images/human/units/animations/paladin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Was wondering. #2</span><hr size=1> I guess you guys are right, I must face what I fell with everything I have, I cannot ignore my feelings and much less ignore her, but I guess I need to dedicate time to myself, sadly I have been too focused in finding a solution and been lacking in various obligations I have with myself, my friends and my family.
