Belika was removed because of rude, sexist comments directed toward a female guildmate over guild chat. Akane quit faf as a result. <br>
<br>
Around the time of this server's first hate raid, Akane was not allowed to rejoin the guild straight off and belika was virtually forever banned, so they started a smear campaign against Bako, insinuating that he was selling eq stuff for cash... a point which I strongly contended. Akane and Belika had personal information about Bako and had 'framed' him. The plot was apparent and some harsh language from me and a few others made the debaucle not worth continuing.<br>
<br>
Akane and Belika joined reso at that time.<br>
<br>
then...<br>
<br>
Akane sold Nabiki to someone from another server and Belika was purchased by Tiesto, another spurned ex-member of faf who had just recently joined reso. Shortly thereafter Nabiki was recruited to reso with the knowledge she was ebayed, on the premise that reso really needed that element to 'get ahead'.<br>
<br>
It wasn't because of the 'characters reputation', that Nabiki wasn't allowed to group with or join faf after we knew the account had changed hands. It was for the simple reason that we knew what was up.<br>
<br>
So did reso. <br>

<br>
I had no clue that Nabiki was ebayed when she was recruited by Reso the first time. Not everybody keeps up with the ins and outs of every toon on this server and the person playing Nabiki aka Zokof was a nice enough guy. Sorry, but toons don't come with a big sign over their head that says &quot;EBAY&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
In regards to the Ogah/Shoug situation I have a few things to say.<br>
<br>
Zokof aka Nabiki II aka Jason sent me a tell with all this information lat night while I was leading a raid. Ogah was not online at the time. Zokof continued to send me tells while I raided and to be honost I don't need the added problems while raiding. I have enough things to worry about as it is. When Ogah finally did show up I talked to him about this situation for a brief time and he didn't want to talk about it. I did not push my point with him mostly because I was still raiding. I play the game for enjoyment and not to hear people bitch regardless if they have a valid point or not. Zokof should have my email address and he could have emailed this information to me if he wanted more of my time. Having this pile of crap on FV.com is not good for Reso I would say and we will deal with it, BUT I would have liked a little more time or warning before being pushed into action. We are the quiet power guild. We do not boast our successes often and really do not want the attention that others may desire.<br>
<br>
Zokof aka Jason has nothing to loose by having his account banned since he has all but given up the game and therefore has nothing to loose with this thread unlike those of us who still play here.<br>
<br>
Changing accounts amongst friends is one thing, but buying or selling an account is just asking for trouble. It is better to earn your levels and items.<br>

Speaking as a mod, I would much prefer to see this thread head in a constructive direction (ie: a glaring example of all the problems that can happen when you E-bay items &amp; accounts) -vs- a negative direction (ie: guilting Reso by association for having these two characters in their guild).<br>
<br>
If it continues to head in the latter it's most likely not long for this world.<br>

<br>
I hold many people within Reso in high regard and wish them well in attaining their goals.<br>
<br>
If the mods wish this thread to center on the folly of EBaying accounts so be it.  My only intent was to reveal Ogah and Shoug.  <br>
<br>
I personally do not lay the root of this evil upon the doorstep of EBay, but with the actions of people who steal.  The problem I have faced (and someone else would have faced) was due to the malicious actions of two people, and not the act of buying an account in and of itself.<br>
<br>
As stated earlier by someone else, the act of selling\buying goes against the EULA, and whoever does this, does so at their own risk.    <br>

Those who buy and sell things that they know belong to someone else entirely are just asking for trouble. I am well aware that there is this bizarre mentality that people &quot;own&quot; their characters, because they &quot;made&quot; them. But they don't. Period. Verant does.<br>
<br>
Please don't even bother with the justifications as to why it shouldn't be that way, or how other folks do it... it is all irrelevant, really. The law is really blunt. Those are Verant's cyberbits you were selling, and they have all the discretion in how to license them. In their case, they don't allow license transfers - and that is their perogative.<br>

It wasnt about that.  The reason both guilds know so much about the situation is because of the unfortunate fact that both guilds had the 'pleasure' of sharing a guild tag with these folks and were directly involved with them.  <br>
<br>
The post was slinging mud at someone who deserves it.  Lets keep it that way.   Even if it was bad for Zokof to buy the account in the first place, nobody deserves to be ripped off.  It can be said, you get what you pay for, but come on.. even if it wasn't against the EULA to sell the accounts I could see a similar outcome, because of the caliber of people we are talking about.<br>

That is to expose Joe and all his dishonesty.  Ebaying, good or bad, doesn't give anyone the right to steal.  <br>
<br>
And personally I feel that this does involve Reso., directly (questionable knowledge of whether or not GL/officers knew of Joe's history) or indirectly (guilty by association).  Speaking for myself, I choose not to hang around people with questionable reputations because rumors fly...then the shadow of doubt of your character can build and so on.  (Weird how this applies to life is'nt it?)<br>
<br>
Just saying &quot;I / We are not getting involved&quot; does not remove you or your group from the publics eye on the issue.  What one does to handle people of questionable character can determine how people view you / your group as a person / whole.<br>
<br>
Also, I have known Zokof here and on Vazaelle and know what he has described is the truth.  We have spoken quite a bit about this issue and the facts he described in detail are correct and accurate.<br>

Not to make light of the situation, this can be a serious problem.  If what is said is true, then this person is very bad for this server.  No matter if you like ebay or not, this person (if the story is true) is ripping people off in REAL LIFE.  Of course, it will all boil down to a he said/she said thing, and will most likely fall on character reputation, which does not look so favorable at this point.<br>
<br>
I agree with Lorii that a guild is held accountable for it's members.  We also need to realize that they will be doing their own internal investigation of the situation, and not just throw said person out because the masses say so.  I wish them all the luck.  Not a postion I would like to be in. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uridalestarwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ridale Starwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/25/02 9:58:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ogah (akane) stole Nabiki account on FV server</span><hr size=1> Zokof/Jason,<br>
<br>
If what your saying is true and you seem to have proof, then I think its bad that you got ripped off.  Ogah\Nabiki is thief and should be exposed as such.   The fact that is is not responding to your post,  leads me to believe that his is afraid that you will post your proof.<br>
<br>
As for the whole argument about EBAYing items/characters, I'm would not do it.  However,  If someone invested several days of there life doing something and wished to get paid for there time,  I don't see how that could be prevented.  I think VI could have some legal issues if they tried to prevent someone from getting compensated for there time.  They can post what they like about it being against their policy,  but to deprive someone else of compensation for there time seems questionable.   <br>
<br>
Personally, I'm glad that VI has the policy against EBAYing because I would hate for someone with more money than brains to buy a level 60 character then kill everyone on a raid because they don't have a clue what how to play.<br>

<br>
He ripped himself off by paying for something he had no right to buy.  Everything after that is just gravy.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is that when you sign on to EverQuest you EXPLICITLY agree to the EULA by choosing to hit Accept.  If you do so disingenuously you are a liar.  And I am glad to see you get ripped off.  Just like I would be glad to see someone buying drugs get busted or better yet, sold placebos.<br>
<br>
The thing is, people post these messages as 'warnings.'  Well the only people that can be warned are the people who deal in Ebayed accounts anyway.<br>
<br>
I have no sympathy, especially for people who break the rules and then are aghast that the people they break the rules with turn out to be dishonorable!  Will wonders never cease?
