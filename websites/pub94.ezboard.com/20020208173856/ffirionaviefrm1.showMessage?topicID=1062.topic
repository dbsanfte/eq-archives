When a guild forms, its first members quite often all know eachother before hand and form to make communication easier, especially on this server. <br><br>My first guild on this server was House Tunzek and was formed exactly that way and Xellisen, my High-Elf Cleric at the time, was made an officer in it. It failed due to many of the members, including the leader, finding out that they did not enjoy the ruleset here. These members disappeared without even saying goodbye. <br><br>Experiencing this, I came up with my own guild concept and went about trying to find people who liked it. And as time progressed, i found it VERY DIFFICULT to form a new guild.<br>Reasons for this is, IMHO, many citizens of Norrath experienced the same as i did so joining an established guild is easier because the friends you made in them look like they are going to stay.<br><br>There are other reasons why guilds fail also of course...poor leadership, poor guild structure, ect.<br><br>What i did learn from my own experiences, and observing the rise and fall of various guilds, is that reputation is very important. Word travels fast on this server of the actions of one. If one of your guildmates does something dishonorable, the whole guild can be judged for it. Sometimes the scope of the judgement is small sometimes not....but as the number of offenses add up, the guild definetely gets a bad name.<br><br>When a guild has a bad name...they have a harder time recruiting those members that they desire, planning multi guild events that include them becomes harder, and can possibly get to the point that members of a group will not allow a player to join simply because of their guild tag. (Dhugal personally associates his guild tag to be synonymous his own name and so goes out of his way to correct wrongs because he wants others to respect it, whether they are in another guild or not.)<br><br>This makes it important to the leaders, if they care about the longevity of their guild, to try to make right what one of their numbers wronged. Personally, I find nothing wrong with this and i highly doubt there is a guild out there that hasnt done some damage control if they accept any members who they hadn't known for a decent amount of time before allowing them into their guild. And even more so, if a player steps up to correct a wrong that is done to you due to another player, i think that is commendable and speak loudly of the goodness of that guild. Not one of us is perfect, nor any guild for that matter. <br><br>So what i am trying to say is, appreciate the fact that guilded people honor their guild name when they do this, and even more because when they do, they are also helping you with the problem that you are having at the moment and they DID NOT HAVE to. If you have a beef with someone who is in a guild, i highly recommend that you take it up with their leaders...you may come out possibly more ahead than you would be if the problem had never occurred.<br><br>Dhugal Forgefyre<br>Society of Valor Councilman <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A> at: 1/8/02 9:58:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaelofthevoid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhael of the Void</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Servant of the Void</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/02 10:11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1062.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guild Name Damage Control</span><hr size=1> We may not see eye to eye on F Vie, but here we are in agreement.

It is my opinion that even if one of us were given Kudos for something that we find no big deal, we pass it up. This person did not, but gave reason why Kudos werent necessary for my actions. I personally appreciated the fact the the Kudos Bearer would post his appreciation as he did because it was way out of my way. Did i expect Kudos?...No, but being i recieved them felt good and i enjoyed it. And the other poster lessened it by his post...so i thought id make a post here to explain that. My post main reason seems to be lost in the text...which is simply the guild leaders are not required to fix their guildmembers screwups. and if one goes out of his way to correct a wrong...it would be wise to give him respect.

It's worth more than any possession, any accomplishment, any amount of &quot;experience&quot;.  As first officer of the Traders Union (which is the highest position I've ever held in a guild before) I found this even more true.  As a member of Starspun, I am proud to be in a guild which is respected and successful.  If I ever damaged that reputation, I'd feel guilt beyond measure.<br><br>I try not to judge an entire guild based on the actions of one member, but I do have some kind of sliding scale in my mind that tracks my experiences with guilds.  It's like guild faction.  And I always base my actions on the assumption that everyone I meet /is/ judging my whole guild based on my behavior.  Even if that isn't true, it might be, and it helps keep me on my toes.<br><br>That all being said, the idea that it's hard to form guilds on FV now isn't so surprising.  There are about 115 or so guilds on our server, or have been.  Some of those are no doubt dead.  But even if half of them are alive 60 or so guilds is probably more than enough for our relatively small population.  Yes, many people are still not in guilds, but perhaps many of them do not wish to be.  I certainly support anyone who is in the process of forming a guild (it is never easy) but I'm not surprised to hear it's getting harder.<br><br>And regarding the difficulty of getting to know or joining established guilds, Starspun's website is at www.geocities.com/starspunguild .  Anyone who wants to get to know us is encouraged to contact anyone with our guild tag and set about making time to group with us.  If you make the effort to seek us out, we'll be happy to make the effort to get to know you.  The same goes for almost any guild I can think of.  Some guilds will throw their tag on almost anyone who walks up to them and asks.  But not the good ones.  If it takes a week or two of making time to get to know a guild, so much the better.

I know we shouldn't make generalizations like that, but we still do.<br><br>So now that I'm wondering if the right guild for me is already out there, I'm making a personal assessment of all the folks I've interacted with, as well as the tags above their heads.  Will I avoid those tags that have been over all the heads I didn't like?  Perhaps I shouldn't, but I probably will.  I just hope I don't pass up &quot;the right guild for me&quot; because of it.<br> <p>---<BR>Kimaya Silverbark<BR><BR>"I bark at that!"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/9/02 4:50:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1062.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilds</span><hr size=1> I do understand that you may not have meant for me to take your post the way i did Dalninil, but observing how others may react, they may assume that it is Dhugal's JOB to correct a wrong that a member of his guild has commited. I wanted to assert that he have no responsibility to another's actions. Nor do i feel that any member of any guild does. One should be held accountable for One's own actions. <br><br>Now as stated well by good friend Valquiss and Ms. Silverbark, Guild Name is Valuable. Dhugal values his guild name only marginally less than his birthright. The player Behind Dhugal believes in guilds and supports the members in his to the extreme. I am this man.This is how i find enjoyment in the game, accomplishment is EVERYTHING.<br>Before i created Dhugal, i had a character by the name of Xelissen. Xelissen went out and did the Symbol of Tunare quest 3 times.(If you know this quest, then you might agree with me that this may be the most painful quest below the level of 30 in the whole game) He lost 7 levels while working on it with other members in his guild. Unluckily, that guild is now dead. I am working hard to keep the same from happening to my present guild now(/IC Bah!...Equestrielle the Corrupted has killed me again!) <br><br>I personally find satisfaction when not only i am succeeding but my group and/or guild is also and so work very hard at just that and pray that my guild will continue to thrive as it has done in the past 3 weeks through my commitment to their success and (hopefully) their commitment to mine. Hmm...due to my tendancy to get off track, im not sure if i truly hit my mark....<br><br>the man behind Dhugal Forgefyre<br>Society of Valor Councilman<br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="HTTP://geocities.com/xsatyrx/index.html">geocities.com/xsatyrx/index.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/11/02 4:33:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1062.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilds</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;well i was slightly disturbed about a post one made after i was given Kudos by another.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Hmm, yes, sorry about that.
