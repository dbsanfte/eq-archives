class=title>   Re: Dark Age</span><hr size=1> I have just returned to EQ from two months in DAOC.<br>
<br>
Gameplay: Gameplay is an evolution from EQ. All melee classes have special moves like the EQ monk. But for the most part, it's level based and you spend most of your time camping critters. Camping for dropped gear is not that important because player made equipment is frequently of higher quality giving bonuses greater than the magic of the item. There are more chat options. Parties are larger which really opens it up to meeting new people and trying new combinations of characters. Originally parties could have a much wider range of levels than EQ, but a patch made it so the range is narrower unless you're willing to take a major experience hit. The world is small and there is not much variety.<br>
<br>
Balance: Balance is way off and IMHO most of the changes they have made since release have either not helped or made things worse. The need to balance PVE and PVP at the same time has created huge balance issues. When I left archer's were easily the most powerful class by two or three times in PVP, but were next to useless in a group hunting monsters. Similar problems plague the game and Mythic doesn't seem to understand the basic issues causing them.<br>
<br>
Roleplaying: The beginning of my disenchantment with DAOC came when I realized I knew more roleplayers on Morell-Thule and more roleplaying guilds on Morell-Thule than I did on the hardcore roleplaying enforced server Guinevere in DAOC. To my knowledge, there is ONE RP guild on that server: Shadowclan and they are very very specific in their interests and carry a lot of baggage from other games. About the only time I ever really saw roleplaying invoked was as an excuse for griefing. I'm &quot;roleplaying a barbarian&quot; became DAOC's version of pre-Trammel UO's &quot;I'm roleplaying a psychokiller.&quot; There is policing of names and OOC talk in public, but most of this is degraded day after day in the forums as the work of &quot;RP nazis&quot; by which people basically mean anyone who came there expecting the rules to be enforced.<br>
<br>
Griefing: This was what put an end to it for me. When my first character went up through the levels, it worked the way the game was supposed to. You hit a certain level, bit below 20, and you started to go into the frontier. You began to see members of opposite realms raiding and you had battles. And this was great. Now that people have levelled up a bit, the same zone where I had a load of fun the first time is now dominated by a few 40th+ levels who one shot kill anyone lower than them that dares to hunt in the zone--a zone designed for 15-25 to hunt in. One of the features of RvR/PvP combat was that it was designed to not cost you experience, so snipers have taken to waiting until one is engaged with a mob. They then drop you 1/2 your health, the monster finishes you off and you lose XP. See above: they are &quot;roleplaying&quot; and this is a war and there are no rules in war. The latest argument on the servers message board regarded &quot;/em urinates on soandso's dead corpse.&quot; Upon objecting to this, I received private mails calling me &quot;puzzy&quot; etc. This is the mentality I found was slowly taking over DAOC and was really why I left. <p>Numtini Lightheart

<br>
I agree with a lot with Jantis's impressions of daoc.  But some of the reasons I enjoy the game a lot are: <br>
<br>
--you can play for 30 minutes and actually be hunting/doing something productive for 20 minutes of them - doesn't matter what class, I have a healer, runemaster and my hubby has a shadowblade, thane<br>
<br>
--people actually *want* to buy the armor I've made.  Yes there are dropped armor, but the pc made armor is still the way to go most of the time (quest stuff still better than pc made stuff)<br>
<br>
As far as griefing...I personally haven't seen anyone be unpleasant within my realm.  In-realm reputation means a lot here.  In the frontier I consider everything is fair game.  We play honorably (most of the time, some of the kiddies in my group are really bloodthirsty) but we don't *expect* the other side to play that way.  Just because we wait until the enemy is done killing a mob and indeed has almost recovered from attacking said mob, doesn't mean they will for us.  <br>
<br>
For the rude /em's ... you *can't* understand a word or emote the enemy is making.  It'll say so and so says something unintelligable.  The best they can do are the canned animated emotes (such as /dance).  Not very honorable in my mind, but heck, they're hibernians!  What'd you expect from wussy elves? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And Jantis, I expect to see you on the battle field someday!  Hopefully face down in the dirt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Even with the Seeking party or whatever option flagged I got zero messages to join anyone. My number one annoyance was they took the enchanter class from EQ and made it into two, i suppose just for the sake of having more classes to choose from, but in essece giving either one less to do.....and I do like to keep busy =)<br>
