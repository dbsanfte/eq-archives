<br>
IC:<br>
<br>
There would be no lasting victory against the forces of darkness, those who attacked the innocent time and again, those who despoiled wilderness and city alike, until the power of the dark gods was taken, to be used by the righteous.<br>
<br>
The evil ones, all the corrupt filth of Norrath, could never truly be harmed. Not permanently at least. Not by blade. Their gods would take them from the lands of the dead and raise them up again, in a perverse parody of the Great Mother's gifts.<br>
<br>
The real battle is not fought against the fleeting corporeal forms of the minions of evil; it is a battle of the mind, a battle of the soul - victories in that war are hard won indeed.<br>
<br>
Asdyr had seen Felwithe attacked by the creature known as Gore Bloodlust, and fallen twice in battle. Not even a day later she had fallen in battle trying to defend Ak'Anon. Aside from showing support to the gnomes, it was of no avail.<br>
<br>
Bodies die, the soul endures. Those slain in battle rise again and again, until they run out of luck or the will to go on. There are converts on either side of the destruction, but no headway is made.<br>
<br>
In order to strike a permanent blow to the power of evil, those born into the darkness need to renounce their taint, to willingly and lastingly make a sacrifice to turn this bloody tide.<br>
<br>
There are rituals of course, there are ways of seeing that a soul is not taken from the realm of the dead and placed in the same evil form. There are ways that those who have been truly redeemed can show their dedication to their cause. The ability to make the ultimate sacrifice has always been with us, but the will to make that sacrifice is sorely lacking.<br>
<br>
OOC:<br>
<br>
I don't know if this is in the proper place or not. It's part brainstorm, part event, part topic for discussion.<br>
<br>
As the nick implies, I play Asdyr, paladin of Tunare. She's seeking a few things in her career, but along the way these thoughts go through her head. Questions of faith, questions about how to turn the tide of the war.<br>
<br>
I've thought about instigating a Redemption for the &quot;evil&quot; races, as a way of making progress. Of course, we can all just get up and walk around once we've been killed, with only some XP loss and a minor annoyance. There's no permanence to it.<br>
<br>
Which got me to thinking that maybe there's some way we could have a permanent (well, semi-permanent) Redemption for those traditionally evil characters that have seen the light as it were.<br>
<br>
My proposal would be to have the enlightened characters do a little quest, symbolic of what they wanted to achieve (to strike a blow to the evil gods), followed by their own willing ritual death. This act of sacrifice and willpower would pave the way for some in the &quot;good&quot;-aligned races to reclaim the power from the evil gods. While the enlightened character would be utterly destroyed, a new character, one of the chosen, would be free to rise in the ranks as a champion of good.<br>
<br>
In a way, this would just be a reroll. But I have in mind that the new character, the Chosen, would have no memory of a former life. It's not a reroll in that it's not a character simply taking up a new career. Instead, it represents a member of one of the good races receiving the power taken from the evil gods. The soul or whatever you wish to call it of the one who made the sacrifice would be gone to whatever heaven or hell awaits such beings. But their act of sacrifice would open the doors for another, a good character's rise as champion.<br>
<br>
There are certainly some metagaming aspects of this idea, though that is nearly unavoidable. I would seek to downplay that. But the main point here is that (aside from people with multiple accounts) FV only allows you one character. That means that if a person gives up their evil character and starts playing a good one, the balance of power shifts. It's a lot more permanent than people being killed and rezzed interminably.<br>
<br>
In game terms, here is what I would propose:<br>
1) An evil character that has roleplayed into redemption/conversion, seeks to make the ultimate sacrifice for the war between good and evil.<br>
<br>
2) Such a character completes a small ritual, which would prove their dedication to not being resurrected. A lasting death.<br>
<br>
3) I would give the character (before death! lol) a password or somesuch, so that when they were reborn, they could be marked as one of the chosen. That way I'd know who to talk to for the next step:<br>
<br>
4) Some reward would be given to the new character to mark the sacrifice made for them.<br>
<br>
5) The character continues, as a champion for good.<br>
<br>
The Ritual:<br>
This would involve roleplaying prayers and such, a real event. The quest part is not clear in my mind yet, but would probably involve collecting a few items of importance (not necessarily valuable ones) that would form the &quot;ingredients&quot; of the ritual to prevent the power of their soul being used to birth a new evil character.<br>
<br>
The last step of the ritual would be the death of the character. I'm thinking a baptismal of sorts would be good, it's pseudo-religious and water has always had the purifying connotation. So has fire, but...<br>
<br>
Anyway, the baptismal would probably be their suicide by drowning in one of the bodies of water. Maybe the pool by Halas as some of the faction problems would be insurmountable for younger characters to get to the waters in Felwithe.<br>
<br>
The Reward:<br>
This would be a powerful item, preferably suited only to good characters, such as an Imbued item. Also, it'd preferably be a crafted item from the &quot;good&quot; community, something which has a story and is roleplayed out, not just a bunch of plat plunked down for something kEwL, and not a quest item which the champions should gain on their own (making the new cultural quest armours out).<br>
<br>
Ongoing Roleplaying:<br>
This would be a heavy roleplay situation. It would hopefully involve the community of the &quot;good&quot; race, and would open up a new character to centre a background on being one of the chosen ones.<br>
<br>
Potential Problems:<br>
LARGE problem with trust. Saying you'll give out a password and offer up items to a newly-created character is all well and good, but actually doing it is another matter. I wouldn't trust such a thing what with some of the problems going around in FV these days, especially name spoofing.<br>
<br>
I know I wouldn't screw over another character in such a fashion, but I understand the lack of trust that might arise unless someone knew me.<br>
<br>
The other thing that I can see is that people might create a new dark character, kill it off, then create a new good character just to get a powerful item. This is unlikely on a single-character server, but it could happen. There's also the possibility of people just giving the items to others, so Imbued ones would potentially be a requirement.<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous:<br>
This has the opportunity for a lot of roleplaying, but I don't know if anyone would give up their evil characters to start up a good one. Like I said, it's mostly just a brainstorm at this moment. People tend to take the characters they wish to play, so I don't know if they'd desire to do such an odd roleplaying event. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showPrevMessage?topicID=303.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showNextMessage?topicID=303.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.threadControl?topicID=303.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=303.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=303.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm53">Plane of Sky Trinkets<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39>Renaissance Festival</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
