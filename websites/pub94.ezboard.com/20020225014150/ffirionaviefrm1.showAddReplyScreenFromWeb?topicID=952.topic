<br>
I wasn't planning on announcing this on the boards here, but my last thread requesting input on sales practices attracted so many unsolicited comments in support of the Traders Union as a guild that I felt I should inform everyone of where all your master tradesmen are going, and what's happening to the guild.  I'll also admit right off this is a guild-related post in the general forum.  But it reports the demise of a fairly major guild so I think it might be justified.  I don't want to abuse my power as a moderator though, so if anyone objects to seeing this here just post a reply stating that and I'll move it asap.<br>
<br>
The Traders Union was and is a great idea, and succeeded well at it's main objective, (namely trade skills) but as the guild progressed into higher levels we all hit a wall.  Somewhere around the early 20s we all ran short of people to group with, which the guild couldn't supply, and even when the few of us in that range at the same time got together we always lacked balance in an extreme way.  Not surprisingly, our guild was always stacked with int casters (often more enchanters than I could even keep track of) and we were extremely lacking in tanks, and almost everything else too.  On some worlds that might not matter much, but everyone has seen the issues regarding finding groups to work with, and the importance of a guild in making that happen has been noted time and again.  And with us, it just wasn't happening.<br>
<br>
Just like everyone else, we do like to move up in levels occassionally, and for that we need effective groups.  Also, a number of our master tradesmen are moving into the range of skill which require specific materials that will require raiding.  We are committed to our skills at the highest levels and we fully intend to provide cultural armor etc., one day, but in order to do that we aren't going to be functioning independently as the Traders Union any longer.<br>
<br>
After long thought, and consideration of all the issues involved, we decided that if the guild was going to fold we would all like to go to the same place together.  That place ended up being Starspun.  I can't swear you will find all former Trade Union members with Starspun, since they are free to make their own decisions, but at last count all former officers of the Traders Union (including our leader Flech, although with a new character named Vello) are joining Starspun, with a number of other members in the application process.  We've had an excellent working relationship with Starspun up until now, and we cover off the weaknesses of each other remarkably well.  I expect it will be a good merger all around, once everyone settles into it.<br>
<br>
I, for one, will be encouraging the same policies and practices of trade within Starspun that we had in the Union.  I don't believe many current members of Starspun are active traders, but the ones coming in aren't about to close up shop or change their sales practises.  So if you are looking for a trademan (or woman) in any particular skill, feel free to send random tells to members of Starspun, as you once did to the Traders Union and they'll let you know who to talk to.  We are here to serve.<br>
<br>
Regarding Starspun and their recruitment policies, this is a rather special case situation.  If you are intested in how they handle applications, their (our) site is at www.geocities.com/Starspunguild . Thanks to them, once more, for giving our guild this opportunity.<br>
<br>
And thank you everyone for your incredible support of our guild to this point, and hopefully from this point forward as well.  I'm sorry if this ending disappoints anyone, but our guild just didn't have the depth to hold together over the long run.  I'm considering maintaining the Traders Union as a non-guild institution, with a volentary code of conduct including a fair pricing policy and a website with a list of contacts etc.  Don't get too worked up about the idea just yet, because it's still just an idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again.  I can't say it enough.  Just one more word: Thanks.<br>

No. Trader's Union is not merging with Starspun. <br>
Starspun has recruited a few new members, that just happened to be former Trader's Union people. Starspun is still going to continue to be picky about who we invite, and our officers, and objectives will all stay the same.<br>
(sorry, old server had a merger and it was a nightmare, and we have so far only added 3 TU members, so that doesn't sound like a merger to me.)<br>
anyway as i said if this didn't need to be said i apologize for upsetting anyone, i just wanted to make clear any misunderstandings (for both Starspun members, and TU members)<br>

<br>
I'd like to appologize to anyone that was offended or concerned by my use of the term &quot;merger.&quot;  I've spilled so many thousands of words on this topic so far I can't even count them anymore and perhaps I'm not thinking as carefully as I used to about each individual one.<br>
<br>
The Traders Union has ended as a guild.  Most of the founding members and officers have either joined, are in the process of joining, or are intending to apply to join Starspun.  This process has been slowed by negotiations, explanations, the holiday season, and quite a few hardware problems owing to the new release.  Overall, however, I doubt that even if we were all to join we would end up making up more than 20% of Starspun ever, and that's an extreme estimate.<br>
<br>
The former members of the Traders Union joining with Starspun are joining as regular members, up to and including our former guild leader and first officer (myself) and we have no immediate ambitions to seek higher position.  We are and will continue to be guided by the principles of Starspun as it was before, and as it continues to evolve.  If anything I've ever suggested sounded otherwise, I appoligize again.<br>
<br>
That much being said, there will be far more master tradesmen in Starspun now, as well as a few that were already there, so if you need to look for a tradesmen feel free to ask us.<br>
<br>
I have maintained my jewelry website at www.tradersjewelry.freeservers.com and I believe I will maintain the Traders Union as a non-guild trade organization, spanning guild lines and including independents.  At least for jewelry thus far, and perhaps for other trades if I find people to spearhead that.  Provided the officers of Starspun find no conflict in this.<br>
<br>
In service to all.<br>
