<br>
I came to Firiona Vie server as a chance to roleplay.  I had been on a server in a roleplay guild that was not as roleplaying as I wanted it to be, albeit they did do better than most.  I came here with a background for my character and I have learned much.  I, one of the biggest bashers of F&amp;F next to Bane of course, now actually speak to quite a few of them ooc.  I have changed much and even came here often.  I remember being idealistic and I have finally reached a happy medium.  I try to roleplay as much as I can but do recognize that TRAIN TO ZONE is a viable option whenever I have 20 frogs chasing me in lguk.  With that background I will now begin and see if this turns to a rant.<br>
<br>
I met Shintou when I was simply a level 9 enchantress in WC.  Firiona Vie came down and I was trying to roleplay the position of being a spy and Shintou and I had plenty of fun roleplaying.  Now I have roleplayed and talked to him the rest of the server from him being in House Sel'Quar to League of Shadows to Fist of Hate so on.  He was a marvelous roleplayer.  He spoke his mind freely and that is what got him into so many messes with people who hide behind roleplaying as an excuse to powergame.  I admire him for the will to keep coming to this board with so much that was going on. I chose simply to ignore it as there was no point in me coming here ... if there was anyone I wanted to speak to I could do so in game either IC or OOC.  I didn't need someone like Ankles moderating it.  Ankles I don't know you outside of the board but really from what I have seen here you aren't that bad of a PERSON.  But I will say you are horrible at being a moderator.  <br>
<br>
/cry Shintou<br>
If you read this and restart as an unknown let me know who you are.  Maybe I can tutor your new character like I tried to tutor the old one.  You were one of the few on this server that care about roleplaying and You WILL be missed by those of us that cared for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 321<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 7:33:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=297.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I'd like to rebut the horrible moderator part</span><hr size=1> A horrible moderator deletes opinions that don't agree or even bans people that don't agree with him.

If a moderator says their opinion, it's abuse. Well, I suppose if a white person hits a person of another race, it's immediatly an act of hate. <br>

And it seems agreeing with people is kissing their asses. Oh no, I guess I'm a &quot;Moderator's Pet&quot; :P.Grow up already, really. There's not too much to be earned by &quot;kissing up&quot; to people who control threads on a specific message board. <br>

I'm not afraid to oppose Jaxy, Ankles, Valquiss, or Fritz. They respect people's opinions. Tiesto, on the other hand, I am.

<br>
All she said was one single short sentence telling Shintou that he was helping to ruin the very forum that he loved. <br>
<br>
She never told him to shut up. <br>
<br>
She did not demand an ultimatum from him. <br>
<br>
She did not modify his posts. <br>
<br>
She did not delete his post. <br>
<br>
She spoke her opinion on a sub-form (Soapbox) that is reserved for strong opinions. <br>
<br>
The only reason that some people are blaming this on Ankles is because Shintou is a well-loved and highly-respected role player that.....ahem.... lost his composure, his feelings got hurt, and he had a hissy fit. <br>
<br>

<br>
Well, as Sar said, it was the straw that broke the camel's back. Why did Shintou react that way to Ankles post and not to the hundred other far worse messages he's received? Hard to say.... Ankles is well-liked and well-respected by many people--perhaps even by Shintou. Maybe that's why he took her opinion so personally.... /shrug<br>

I backed the moderators until I saw the wanton deleting of posts and the ass kissing that was going on.  Yes it was at the time ass kissing.  <br>
<br>
As for moderators giving their opinion ... that's not moderation and if you are going to do so you need to state before hand this is not moderation or anything having to do with my post at all IF you even do it at all.  It's just one of those times when you are supposed to set the example.  I was here from nearly the beginning of the server and I stayed as long as it was small.  When it got a bit larger, as one of my friends told me, it might have just gotten to the mods heads a bit.  They were virtual celebrities.  I'm not saying people are horrible just saying their moderation isn't the best.  When moderating you must stick to your own rules when you break them you are no longer setting an example and people won't give a rats ass about the board ... I believe a good number of people had left the board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujaldnor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaldnor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/29/02 4:34:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=297.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> Hmm..<br>
<br>
This can indeed go on forever friends. Why is it that ye keep speaking of things that cannot be undone? Does it help? I think not. Does it get worse? It might and I belive it will.<br>
<br>
I personally did not know this Shintou character but from what I have read about him he seems like a very good roleplayer that tends to whine a bit to much. I should not say to much since I do perhaps not know as much of this as I should.<br>
<br>
Whining, my friends, does not help. That goes for both sides.<br>

That's fine, as long as their opinions don't get in the way of fair and equitable Moderation of the board.<br>
<br>
I do agree, though, that Moderators should behave in ways that set an example.  They, above all others, should be above reproach.  Their authority depends, in part, on the acceptance of that authority by the posters.  While it's not unusual for any board to have its crank, when a substantial number of posters, even if they're in the minority over all, believe the Moderation to be skewed or unfair, there may be a problem worth looking at more closely and addressed appropriately.<br>
