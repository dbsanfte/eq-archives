The Cordonic Way...<br>
<br>
This is a story about a dynasty of dwarven warriors and tribes exiled to the caverns, caves, and dark pits. Exiled from the surface lands...<br>
<br>
This is long ago before freeport was built... When humans were a mere tribe holding camp in East commonlands at the coast connecting to NRO. The dwarves came from the mountains to the east on a seperate continent. Alot of the dwarves set sail and joined wild and bloodthirsty buccaneers (Gnomes, Halflings on adventure and Dwarves)<br>
<br>
A powerful arcane user came to the land of dwarves and began using his magic to conjure a giant chess board. Dwarven rogues and adventuring priests and warriors brought tales to the soon to be Kaladim. Cordon. Ah strong dwarven warrior seeked out the one swirling the powerful and strange magic user. Cordon came out to the chess board and found the wizard moving the giant pawns and knights and other peices. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail wizard&quot; Cordon shouts to the robed figure. The tall man turned with a slow twist. Facing Cordon. &quot;I am Cordon the Black these are my lands. I ask you state your business.&quot; Cordon then picked up a flag and waved it. Noises could be heard from all around. The wizard looks around and sees he is surrounded on the rocks and paths and all around by several Dwarven Archers. They draw their bows and aim at the wizard. &quot;Hmm hah hah hah&quot; the dark figure cackles. The figure moves towards Cordon swaying in the air... As if it were floating. &quot;I am Zenn... powerful arcane wizard from across the sea...&quot; Zenn is a human with dark black and grey robes on and has a strange black but greying hair that is thinning coming down his back in a ponytale. He wears a circlet type crown on his head that has several gems in it. His sleeves are long and almost touch the ground. His eyes almost glow and he radiates with powerful but corrupt magic. Magic that has a evil hue to it. Cordon holds his hand in the air. And then thrusts it down in one motion and a volley of arrows flys over his head and toward the wizard. They all crash into a invisable type barrier that seems to shine with a lavander color when the arrows bounce off. Cordon raises his blade and charges the wizard. &quot;Die you evil sorcerer! This breath is your last!&quot; Cordon rushes and slashes the wizard several times but the wizards lavander colored protection kept the Zenn's blood from spilling....<br>
<br>
Cordon fought with the wizard for some time. Then the wizard began to cast a spell... Zenn makes a strange call and raises his hands roots grew from the ground and clutch onto Cordons feet. He begins hacking desperately at them. The wizard drifts abit higher into the air and readys another spell. Blades begin falling from the sky. Cordon sees the blades stabbing into the ground all around him so he raises his shield but the blades continue to fall like rain. Stabbing into one of his legs and grazing his arm holding his sword.<br>
<br>
He begins reaching and grabbing the roots ripping them from the ground. He picks up his sword and swings vicisouly at Zenn. Suddenly the lavander sheild shatters like glass and fades into nothingness and Zenn produces a bead of sweat on his brow. <br>
<br>
&quot;You Cordon the Black will PAY!&quot; Zenn yells as he casts a spell and a large fireball grows in the palm of his hand. Zenn holds his hands to the sky and a large ball of fire and molten lava grows in size above his head. It gets as large as a dinner table and Zenn swings his arm heaving the large ball of flame at Cordon. Cordon goes to hold up his sheild and take the blow is blasted a good 20 feet back and slides onto the ground in a pile of smoking metal. He stands up looking abit worked. Wipes his chin throws down his scorched sheild and stabs his sword into the ground. He pulls a 1 handed battle axe black in color and a large sword with red runes on it. Wielding the 2 blades he rushes in at Zenn and begins hacking and slashing bloodying the wizard up...<br>
<br>
While Cordon slashes left and right with his mighty blades the wizard sets his hand on Cordon's breast plate and releases a powerful lightning bolt that cackles. *BOOM* Cordon lays on the ground getting up slowly... His followers chanting. Wizard yells 'SILENCE!!&quot; And Conjures a whirling wing similiar to a tornadoe.  Swirling Cordon in the air and slaming him against a mountain far away. His followers come to his aid but the Wizard arrives there first with some magical boots. Cordon lays in a heap of rubble very bloody but alive. The Wizard says for the trouble you have caused I shall teach you a lesson Cordon the Black and the followers of the Cordonic way. <br>
<br>
The wizard reaches into the sky and the clouds gather... Wind begins swirling off of his body and a immense power can be felt in your bones. Cordon looks on as a shining light is seen in the sky... The clouds break into a large circle and a huge ball of ice being hurled down to Norrath can be seen... It crashes near Cordon and creates a LARGE hole in the ground. Zenn shouts &quot;All followers of the Cordonic way... March!&quot; He herds all of the followers of Cordon the Black into the hole. The wizard drifts down and stands on the ground near Cordon. Cordon seeing the wizard and what he has done in banishing his people becomes enraged. He enters a beserker frenzy and pulls a huge 2 handed axe from his back and heaves it at the evil wizard. The wizard seeing the huge axe being hurled at him uses the last bit of his power to conjure a mountain over Cordon and the crater. The axe cut deep into the wizard. He removes it and staggers to the chessboard from what was his greatest creation. He breathes his last and collapses in the center of the board. Cordon died his corpse was not found. But his followers and his kin lived on in their new home. They began mining. Deeper and deeper into the earth. They came across many creatures and treasures and artifacts in they mining. They spent the rest of their days mining. Since the begining of time up till now they have been mining beneath the feet of Norrath and its surface walkers. The chess board still remains although it is haunted as well as the mountain not far from the chess board from which The Cordonic way was exilied. The dark magic used to exile the men and women who followed Cordon and Cordon himself became corrupt. Digging endlessly in the darkness and fighting off enemies they could not see. Until they adapted... They became strong and very tough and resistant warriors. Fearless and strong but tainted with the darkness and evil powers which banished them now runs through their veins like poisonous lead.<br>
<br>
Brell Serillis and his followers later on did some mining of their own. Me and a buddy named Sniffer been mining for the last 40 years. Our grandfathers told us that he once heard noises from above a cavern he has been mining for the last 250 years. We mined it and made it to the surface and seen a whole town and society of dwarves who look alot like me and Sniffer.<br>
<br>
Our Grandfathers died awhile ago and the entrance to the caverns of Cordon are a secret only me and Sniffer know. We came upon seeing the sun for the first time in our lives. It hurt at first but we got used to it. We can see in the dark very well from our years in dark tunnels with no light.<br>
<br>
Me and Sniffer took on the life of thieves and fed off the local population for awhile. We made enough to buy a estate in Kaladim where we hold a brewery and a mushroom farm.  We tell the word of our world and ancient civilization but no one believes... But we are here. And we spread the word of Cordon the Black....<br>
