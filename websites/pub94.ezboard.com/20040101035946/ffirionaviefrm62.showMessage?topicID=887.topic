It's also pretty easy to see the leanings of other news organizations, if you bother to take the time to do so.  For instance, CNN has a fairly liberal bias, but it's more subtle.<br>
<br>
So here's the question:  Is it better to be overtly leaning in one direction and then try to pass yourself off as fair and balanced or to have more subtle leanings but rely on a more pervasive insinuation of fairness (I know it doesn't make sense right now... it might not later either... but read on).<br>
<br>
What I mean by the pervasive insinuation is this:  In general, people will asceed that Fox News isn't fair nor balanced, but you'd have a much tougher time getting people to make a similar conclusion about news institutions like NBC, ABC, or CBS, even though a similar prejudice is evident on those networks.  Most people don't think to question those organizations to the extent that they would question Fox News.  <br>
<br>
All media will have a bias.  People write the stories, people read the stories to the audiance and add their inflections and emphasis, and editors decide what goes on the air and when. It's impossible not to have bias.  And bias isn't always a bad thing.  However, journalism bias has changed (some say progressed) in the last few decades, to become more subtle.  I think that's one of the reasons why Fox News is such a target for people, aside from their bias and their accuracy, is that it's a throwback to the days of Yellow Journalism to a certain extent.  And it's easy to see. With NBC, CBS, and ABC it's much more difficult to see it, yet it's still there.<br>
<br>
Personally, and we've discussed things on here before, I check at least three or four sources before I begin to find a controversial news story credible.  If they all have different spins on the topic, I'll always doubt the assertion at the center of the story, and rarely feel that it's truly credible.  And 3/4 of my sources will be print, as even though I worked in radio news I don't find electronic media to be too credible to begin with.  They don't have enough time to go into the depths of the story that you do in a newspaper.<br>
<br>
A quick question to end it.  Do you just gravitate towards newspapers or electronic media that furthers and reinforces their own agenda and dismiss the media that provides a counterpoint or do you examine all points of view and come to a conclusion on your own.<br>

As a new entry in the network news competition, they were at an initial disadvantage in the ratings war.  So they had to do something to draw viewers from the established networks.  Seeing that conservatives are in the majority right now, they specifically targetted that segment of the market.  What better way to get viewers to switch than to slant coverage towards their political ideology?  As many have pointed out, network news is all about ratings now, not journalistic integrity.  The same can be said for news magazines, newspapers, etc as well, just not to the extreme that you see with the network news.<br>
<br>
Fox was also smart by making sure all the female broadcasters are &quot;hot&quot;.  Thats nothing new when it comes to talking heads.  Even local stations tend to hire good looking female broadcasters.  Fox took it to a new level though.  Greta leaves CNN, gets plastic surgery, then starts working for Fox.  Main reason to watch Fox's coverage of the Iraq war was Jennifer Eccleston.  Hell if Playboy ever did a &quot;Woman of Fox News&quot; issue it would be one of their all-time best selling issues.  <br>
<br>
IMO, the criticism Fox News gets from the liberals is just another example of the ideological riftwar that has recently come to light.  Prior to Clinton, the Democrats and Republicans, while they disagreed with each other, at least showed respect to one another and tried to reach a compromise.  IMO this changed when Clinton became president.  That initiated the ideological war between liberals and conservatives.  Instead of respect, now we have constant negativity.  Each side tries to force their agenda down the others throat, compromise be damned.  This grew in magnitude when Bush Jr was elected.  Liberals feel the same towards Bush the way that conservatives felt towards Clinton.  Until a moderate gets elected, the ideological riftwar will just go back forth depending on what party controls the presidency.  <br>
<br>
Fox News took a side in this ideological riftwar.  As a result, the are reaping the financial rewards.  Criticize them all you want but I doubt they really care.  They will just laugh at you while their ratings continue to beat the competition. <p>Kebkin <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

But at the same time I get a lot of information from Fox News and World Net Daily (about as far right as you can go).<br>
<br>
All of the 4 networks have commentary shows.  But Fox News goes farther to the right than the others go to the left.  Fox harps on morality, religious, and more conservative views as if they were crimes against humanity whereas other networks treat them as what they are; just a controversy.<br>
<br>
Fox News makes it a point to bring one liberal commentator in their debates to show the &quot;other side of the issue.&quot;  You can usually pick the guy out as being the ugliest, fattest, or most awkward of the trio they have talking to Hannity.  They proceed to call the liberal names and interrupt them when they try to make points.  <br>
<br>
Hannity once asked that night's liberal, a defense attorney, that was challenging trial prosecution methods, &quot;do you think that they should not have arrested Scott Peterson?&quot;  Such a comment was of no value to the discussion.  Peterson is already awaiting trial and his arrest is a non-issue.  It was absurd.  Hannity threw it in while the defense attorney was speaking just to throw her off... and then went to commercial.  What you have there is a gangbang, not a &quot;fair and balanced&quot; debate.<br>
<br>
But perhaps the most convincing evidence that it is a largely conservative network is its imagery.  During the &quot;News Updates&quot; between the shows they have the prettiest doll blondes with 5 pounds of makeup giving the updates.  Its an obvious ploy to their viewer demographic's notion toward women.  Just watch and you will see what I am talking about.  The venerable men run the intelligent shows as people listen to their opinions while the pretty little women are best suited for the least contestable information.  The epitome of conservative thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xenojones>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1581<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/26/03 4:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=887.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair and Balanced?  </span><hr size=1> MSNBC &gt; Fox<br>

They had some expert who painted all the protestors as disruptive communist, his exact word was communist, that didnt believe in fair trade.  The guy was some silly shrill brit with a bow tie to boot.  <br>
<br>
The fact was there were about 45 rowdy self proclaimed anarchists.  Several hours prior to when the few idiots showed up there was a march by the AFL-CIO in a very civil and organized manner conducted on an approved route.  I would hardly characterize blue collar union folks as commies.  They never retracted or challenged any of the information and if you were form a different area your view would be so scewed about what happened that I'm frankly shocked they even aired it.<br>

I do not watch fnc anymore as a result, I wonder how much of what they present is as meritless, skewed and fabricated as that piece was.

<br>
I don't mind a news service with a conservative bent.  I do mind, however, when the news out-and-out lies, and that's what Fox does day-in and day-out.<br>
<br>
Jason Blair at the NYT was an aberration, and he was dealt with accordingly by the Times.  Fox News engages in that kind of behavior all the time.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, an awful lot of left-wing people and groups regard the so-called &quot;mainstream&quot; media as being somewhat right of center itself.  The New York Times has often been accused by gay and lesbian groups of being somewhat homophobic in their coverage of gay issues (if you want, I can cite about a dozen different books and articles on this).<br>
<br>
I don't mind bias.  I do mind lying.  There's a difference, and it's unfortunate that those who defend Fox News can't see that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/LASLAN.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

It is generally assumed (by intelligent viewers anyways) that ALL news services are guilty of being biased (leaning one way or another if even just slightly). But Fox News is doubly idiotic for claiming that they are the model and paragon of objectivity.  <br>

I think it has to do mostly with the repeal of the FCC regulations on how much media can be owned by the same organization in the same market, and by the over-saturation of information because of the internet. <br>
<br>
When one organization has too much control over the news, be it print, TV or radio or a mixture of the three, they have too much control over what the public finds out. The stories they chose to cover will be the only things covered, whereas if the ownership is spread out, there is a greater chance that various editors/owners will cover more topics. Ommission is probably an innocent sin, but there is also the more sinister implications of cover-ups. <br>
<br>
(And on a side note, the &quot;Clear-channelization&quot; of America has ruined the music industry. You basically hear the same stations in every market playing the same crap in the same pidgeon holed categories from Boston to San Diego. WXRT Chicago is the one notable exception that is left. How can any new talent break in unless they can be cheerfully boxed into a convenient category so clear channel can determine what station to play it on?)<br>
<br>
Add in that they are fighting for ratings, and the specter of news as entertainment, and real news can be completely distorted. So what do we do? Those of us who think of these things try to assemble our knowledge from a variety of sources. Personally, I think the most fair and balanced news comes form Public TV and radio, but I do watch Fox News (when I am at my Mom's) and CNN (at my sister's) read the Washington Post and Chicago Tribune and try to sift the info from them all. <br>
<br>
As far as the internet, well I am convinced that you can basically find a link to just about anything you want to promote, regardless of any truth, and it will be dressed up to look like a legitimate news source. If we look hard enough, we could probably find a link to a &quot;source&quot; that says Jesus was a cannabalistic Nazi and the KKK are in existance to promote racial harmony. The sad thing is, some people believe whatever they read. <br>

Really, though, that statement you made may characterize your own reactions to those with whom you disagree, but do not assume that everyone &quot;sides with those who agree with their world view and feel antagonistic towards those that disagree&quot; simply because that's how you behave.<br>
<br>
I said you have a &quot;reading problem&quot; because I so very clearly said the opposite: I don't mind disagreement, but I do mind flat-out-lying.  There's a significant difference between, say, the American Spectator or the National Review and Fox News.  The first two, while being very conservative, don't bald-faced-lie.  The latter does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kazot>Kazot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Your powers are useless<br>

Robin I'm sure you have seen numerous occasions where I have belittled and or insulted others here. Why in every thread I post in you will probably find where I labeled others as ignorant, unaware or even went as far as to insinuate they had more malevolent tendencies.<br>
<br>
Or maybe not.<br>
<br>
It is of little concern, this playground of words has little relevance to the world. <br>
<br>
In the words posted we can see where some post their opinion others agree or disagree and then a few attempt to attack the poster to try and bolster their own belief. <br>
<br>
I for one find it humorous. The wisest of the wise all meet here, on a board for a role playing game to spread their treasure of knowledge and insight.
