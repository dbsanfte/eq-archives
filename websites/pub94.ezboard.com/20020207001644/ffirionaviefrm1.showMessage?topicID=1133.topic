Im just looking for some ideas on which class/race combination would help fit what im looking to play.<br><br>1) I dont like being evil, in fact I usually help out others and I  play really goofy a lot.  Hell back on E'ci I freaked out lots of people on my druid for doing the &quot;spawn dance&quot;.<br><br>2) I hate soloing, its the most boring useless waste of time in the world.  Yet being completely solo incapable is something im not wanting, good groups are hard to find.  Let alone a group at all on this server (as I have heard).<br><br>3) Lastly, I dont like playing a class which is a dime a dozen.  Nor do I care much for INT casters.  Also no Barbarian warriors or Halfling druids for me thank you very much.  Being an uncommon combination is always nice.  I have no plans on being uber, or hell probably ever breaking level 50 (been playing for a little over two years now and my highest character is only 36, but I did spend a lot of time on Rallos Zek so that could be a big reason why).<br><br>Heh, any suggestions?<br><br>P.S. For those of you who say play whichever class I will enjoy the most, (other then the INT casters) I enjoy all the classes and know how to play them all.  Other then bards and INT casters but eh, close enough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukelisk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelisk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>No, YOU'RE evil</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/16/02 9:37:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> 1: You say you like to play &quot;goofy&quot; characters.
