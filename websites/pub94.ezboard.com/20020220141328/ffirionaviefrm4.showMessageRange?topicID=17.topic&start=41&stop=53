The funniest part of everyone arguing is that it'll mean nothing when the server goes up.  Those who enjoy it will keep playing.  Those who don't will come here and complain.  Cases like these are the only times I find myself visiting message boards and getting worked up.  Bludge's post is a perfect example at how easy it is to get burnt out on a server before it's even online.  I used to be into Shadowbane when I first read about it, but I got bored of it over a year ago and it STILL hasn't come out.<br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
<br>
--EDIT--Oops, I posted again, I wasn't going to do that.  Ah, well, it had no relevance.<br>

Your response to Bludge's post was cold.<br>
<br>
 - It was honest. He also made the attempt at twisting what I said into something it cleary wasn't. I won't apologize for a rebuttal that defines the truth.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;You show no compassion for people who have a harder time roleplaying in EverQuest than you do. Someone saying, &quot;Could you please spare a Sow?&quot; is not an example of someone who is disrespecting you.<br>
<br>
 - They aren't disrespectfull at all. As I said earlier, I give respect until I am disrespected. Don't put words into my mouth.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I cringe when I read what you said to Morrizar on Bludge's thread (before that movie, though  ). And about immaturity, please read your last post here.<br>
<br>
 - I wrote it, why don't you adjust your bifocals and pay attention to just &quot;half&quot; of what I've written.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;That's one of the most immature posts I've seen on this entire board. What does you being a man of your word have anything to do with what we've been talking about?<br>
<br>
 - Your the one casting judgement on people you don't know, you go figure it out.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think that should have read, &quot;I'm incapable of respecting someone else's opinion.&quot; Both here and on Bludge's thread, you claim you're only &quot;stating the facts.&quot; Do you know how ignorant that sounds? You are stating your opinion.<br>
<br>
 - No ignorance to it. You looking for an excuse to escape? <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Will you be saying you're the one with the bullets if powergamers outnumber roleplayers on FV? I don't see any reason why it won't happen. The rules are harder, but that's about it. I know this is a pessimistic point of view, and I know it's crappy to rain on everyone's parade, but I think it needs mentioning. I don't know what's left for roleplaying in EQ if this happens. To be honest, I really don't see much hope if this fails. Maybe after everyone's moved on to other games it'll be different. Who knows.<br>
<br>
 - I don't think that will be the case at all. Not with one character and the server architechture.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Banegrivm, all I hope is that you'll realize that such a dismal outlook on non-RPers only hinders roleplaying on the server. That kind of thinking is what got powergamers and roleplayers fighting in the first place long ago. Look over this entire board. I see barely any examples, if any, of powergamers complaining about roleplayers on the server. Almost all of them are just here for the change of game and the challenge, and most have specifically gone out of their way to say that they hope to get along with roleplayers fine. If you roleplay to them, I'm sure they will return the favor. On the other hand, this board is flooded with fanatical, extremist views that basically represent roleplaying only, and at all costs. If you categorize yourself as one of these people, then I suggest cancelling your subscription to EQ and buying DAoC where roleplaying is enforced, because you'll never be able to get what you're looking for here. On the other hand, if you'd only look at things a bit more moderately you'd discover a bright future for Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
 - Maybe you should take some of your own advice. I like things fine just the way they are. I don't make excuses. I came here to RP, not put up with people that come out and say blatantly they have no intent to RP and want to farm uber loot so they can dominate an economy. If you don't like that, tough. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urazzlerdazzler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razzlerdazzler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/01 9:18:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A thought on the Non-RPers</span><hr size=1> Damn you took a long time writing that post to accomplish absofreakin lutely nothing at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umorrizarthesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morrizar the Sorcerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/01 9:19:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A thought on the Non-RPers</span><hr size=1> I have several things wrong with that post...<br>

Which half?  The part where you called me Mr &quot;I know Banegrivm&quot; that doesn't, or the one where you said I was judging YOU.  I thought, originally, it was you judging nonRPers.<br>
<br>
I haven't judged you.  I'm sure we could be best friends in game with or without knowing each other.<br>
<br>
Stop inflicting me with your &quot;truth.&quot;  I'm going to out on a limb here.  Just because you think what you're saying is the truth, doesn't mean it is.  It'd be nicer for everyone if you'd admit you're stating your opinion.  ROLEPLAYING PREFERRED.  PREFERRED.  Where's the required?  So stop acting like you own the place.<br>
<br>
At least, &quot;I don't think that will be the case at all. Not with one character and the server architechture,&quot; is upbeat.<br>
<br>
You won't have to put up with people who want uber loot.  They'll be off getting it and you'll never see them, except when WFP becomes the main auction zone.<br>

 - I never judged non RP'ers. In fact if YOU actually stopped to read back through my posts you would see even where I stated that I am sure those guys in the powergaming/uber guild are good people. Great, but again this isn't a a standard blue server.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't judged you. I'm sure we could be best friends in game with or without knowing each other.<br>
