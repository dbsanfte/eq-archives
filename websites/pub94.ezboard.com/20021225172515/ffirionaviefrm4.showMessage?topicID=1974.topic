Cata, you know I love you, and this really doesn't have anything to do with you, but I thought I'd say that anyway.<br>
<br>
I talked with Tokins today, in the infamous chat area. Several of us did. I'm taking the crazy Kuladen hat off and putting on the RL Will hat, the guy who has a masters in public relations. This is a nightmare when it comes to PR, as Tokins honestly seems to just keep shooting himself in the foot, as a LOT of people do on here. Here is the conversation, with but ONE edit (editted out a name to prevent another fight elsewhere). <br>
<br>
I do, personally, think he is sorry about it.. even if his pride is showing a little. I think that comes out at the end.<br>
<br>
And I'm pretty darn sure he won't do something like that again. I hope. For my sake.<br>
<br>
Begin:<br>
<br>
Tokins:: Damn people still wont leave me alone in soap<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: hehehheheeh<br>
Kaldesh:: What did you expect?<br>
Tokins:: What do you mean what did I expecT?<br>
kuladen:: I'm trying to collect the set of 'public enemies of the soapbox' trading cards. Are you the 13 year old guy?<br>
Tokins:: I didn't post that and sit there and wait for people to rip into me<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: I think ders Worst out der... *cough* ((NAME EDITED TO PREVENT ANOTHER FLAME WAR))<br>
Kaldesh:: No you just posted in a public chatroom &amp; expected it to remain private.<br>
Xadria:: hmmm well you sure were going on and on last night Tokins <br>
Tokins:: Nah i just figured if someone was going to log it they would atleast log 100% of it<br>
Xadria:: turst me I think it woul dhave made you look ever worse that is already does <br>
Tokins:: Xadria - yeah well when you got 5 people ripping into you and your trying to explain but no one listens it can get aggravating<br>
Xadria:: if you take it personally aye <br>
Tokins:: Why wouldn't I take it personally?<br>
Xadria:: but if you are not in the wrong to start with you have no reason to take it that way &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
ChanceFV joined<br>
kuladen:: Ok.. really.. the only thing I am going to say about this whole situations, and this is coming from a guy with a Masters in public relations who winces every time people get in this situation... and it happens frequently: Stop posting. I am serious. Go away for about a week. Every time 'your' post takes a turn towards something else you post again and bring it back to you. The nature of the soapbox is chaotic.. it will blow over.. as long as you be quiet and just ... let it blow over.<br>
ChanceFV left<br>
kuladen:: ((Back to IC))<br>
Xadria:: have to remember this is a game... not RL<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: hehehe<br>
Katryna Sowdier:: (( agrees 100% with kuladen))<br>
Ilmarin Celeborn:: *cheers at kuladen<br>
Tokins:: I dont like it when people diss my dwarf rogue (oioc)<br>
kuladen:: I don't care. Take it. Come back in a week. I SWEAR to GOD they will be discussing something else<br>
kuladen:: or.. someone.<br>
Xadria:: /nods<br>
Kaldesh:: They'll be working on FnF or Reso again by that time.<br>
Tokins:: But I don't want to leave =(<br>
Xadria:: *nods* again <br>
Tokins:: I kinda like it here and still want to make friends despite the fact everyone here hates my guts<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: I don't hate ye<br>
Maritzia:: If you really want to recover your reputation.<br>
Ilmarin Celeborn:: ooc he means the boards. You dont need to become a trollie just let it blow over and maybe come here or just pop in to look at some posts.<br>
Maritzia:: Then abjectly opolgize to everyone involvoed (sincerity helps) and promise never to do it again.<br>
Maritzia:: than live by that promise<br>
kuladen:: Right.<br>
kuladen:: It is called apologia.. I alluded to it earlier with clinton's 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' comment. I will tell you what to do.. and do it.. <br>
kuladen:: You go to THE post.. the main one.<br>
kuladen:: You APOLOGIZE. You do NOT give excuses. You say you are sorry. You have learned your lesson, and you hope others can forgive you. I don't CARE if you are really in the wrong. Public opinionis against YOU. <br>
Tokins:: I did apologize<br>
Ilmarin Celeborn:: *nod*<br>
kuladen:: And that is what you are fighting. Not Martizpan, not Drach or Me, or Cata<br>
Maritzia:: and he's the guy with a master's in public relations.  listen to him.<br>
kuladen:: No.. you really didn't. You performed apologia. You danced around it.<br>
kuladen:: You keep it simple.<br>
Ilmarin Celeborn:: common sense no masters needed<br>
kuladen:: You put this:<br>
Maritzia:: No, Tokins, you actaully didn't.  You made excuses.  Not the same thing.<br>
Tokins:: i like to keep things simple<br>
Tokins:: here let me find my apologie<br>
azindar joined<br>
Tokins:: yay azindar<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: hello<br>
azindar:: hello<br>
Tokins:: Tell these folks I am a cool guy<br>
Tokins:: how do I copy paste?<br>
kuladen:: Fellow players. I apologize for my actions the other day. I have learned a lot from this experience, and I hope in time this will blow over, as I really do want to continue on this wonderful server. I can hope we can move on from this .. and I hope to see you in norrath. Again... I am sorry. Signed.. Tokins.<br>
Maritzia:: this was the only apology in the whole post &quot;Sorry if you think my language was foul&quot;<br>
Maritzia:: That was the only time you said you were sorry.<br>
Tokins:: no it was NOT maritzia<br>
Tokins:: Allow me to quote myself<br>
Tokins:: How do I copy paste?<br>
Katryna Sowdier left<br>
Tokins:: For the people in the chat that I went off on. Sorry. But people were starting shit with me all day and I was very irritated. Afterwards I was just trying to RP. <br>
Maritzia:: Oh, sorry, I forgot this one &quot;For the people in the chat that I went off on. Sorry. &quot;<br>
Maritzia:: and then made another lame excuse<br>
Tokins:: How did I make a lame excuse explain yourself<br>
azindar:: why are they so pissed of with you tokins<br>
Tokins:: I gave an apologie and I explained myself<br>
Maritzia:: You only did it because people were starting in on you.<br>
Maritzia:: You excused your behavior<br>
Maritzia:: There is no excuse for your behavior, Tokins.<br>
Tokins:: Someone dared me to do something and I did it and they logged half of it and posted it in soapbox now everyone hates me<br>
Maritzia:: That's what you don't get.<br>
azindar:: you opened his heart or are you god now judge people motives Maritzia<br>
Tokins:: Maritzia I apoligized 2 times<br>
Tokins:: Actaully 3<br>
Maritzia:: Did you apologize to cata for the disgusting things you said to her?<br>
Tokins:: I dont see why I have to do it again if you think I am going to apologize to your for some odd reason you are wrong<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: (afk)<br>
Tokins:: Yeah <br>
Tokins:: For the people in the chat that I went off on. Sorry. But people were starting shit with me all day and I was very irritated. Afterwards I was just trying to RP. <br>
Maritzia:: I don't want you to apologize to me, I want you to apologize to the community<br>
Tokins:: Cata and everyone else was in chat - You were not<br>
kuladen:: ok back<br>
Maritzia:: And, you should apologize for all the crap you spewed in response to this thread on the board.<br>
kuladen:: You didn't apologize.. you said that.. you said what you said because 1) you were having a shitty day and 2) were dared. <br>
Tokins:: I did<br>
kuladen:: Those are excuses<br>
Tokins:: How do you people fail to see my apologizes?<br>
Maritzia:: Look, you obviously odn't want to redeem yourself in this community.<br>
Tokins:: I shall quote them once more<br>
Maritzia:: You would rather keep your pride intact.<br>
kuladen:: you will have to bow some, Tokins, to get out of this.<br>
Maritzia:: I've read them, Tokins.  They are halfhearted at best.  That is what you aren't getting.<br>
azindar:: Maritzia you seem well intented to cast your judgement without even looking at what he is saying<br>
Tokins:: Maybe I only have a half - heart?<br>
kuladen:: He's posted it a couple of times Azindar <br>
Maritzia:: Azindar, I have read what he said half a dozen times.<br>
kuladen:: Tokins.. tell me the difference between these:<br>
azindar:: Then he is saying i am sorry<br>
Tokins:: Yeah but you failed to see my other apologizes when you insisted that you did<br>
kuladen:: 1) I am sorry for my actions. 2) I am sorry I did what I did because I was forced to<br>
Tokins:: Kuladen ok<br>
Maritzia:: I've quoted parts of it back to him.  He just doesn't want to have to bend his pride to get out of this<br>
Tokins:: I didn't say #2<br>
kuladen:: It doesn't matter.. same principle<br>
Tokins:: I out them in seperate sentences - Do I have to teach grammar now?<br>
azindar:: ok to get this over with <br>
Tokins:: Not really<br>
azindar:: Tokins your sorry right?<br>
Tokins:: Yea<br>
Kaldesh:: errm, &quot;I did it because I was dared to?&quot;  that sounds like #2 to me.<br>
azindar:: great<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: ok back<br>
azindar:: he is sorry lets move on<br>
kuladen:: Heh.. azindar.. I don't need to be apologized to. Trust me. I could honestly care less. I'm trying to help him get out of this<br>
Maritzia:: Tokins, you refuse to take personal responsibility for your actions.  That is what my problem with you is.<br>
kuladen:: When you put qualifiers on your apology.. that invalidates your apology. I don't care if there is a period in between or not... I don't care if five minutes have passed or not. What you do is say: I am sorry. PERIOD.<br>
Tokins:: Umm Maritzia - If I wasnt taking personal action why did I spend my time typing up posts with apologies in them?<br>
Maritzia:: See, you still don't get it.  Excuses invalidate the apologies.  Your whole post was about excuses, not apologies.<br>
Tokins:: You know what I am with Azindar - I am done arguing I have apologized it is over with let it die<br>
Maritzia:: Don't make excueses.<br>
azindar:: good for you Tokins<br>
Maritzia:: It seems to me, Tokins, if so many people can't see the sorrow in your post that maybe it should tell you something.<br>
kuladen:: I've told you what you need to do Tokins. If you 1) Don't leave and 2) Don't do the apology like I said.. this will nooooottt diiiieee. I can promise you that.<br>
Maritzia:: We are actually rather forgiving on this server.<br>
kuladen:: Qualifier: leave for a week.<br>
Maritzia:: But first you have to take responsibility for your actions.<br>
Maritzia:: And that is all *I* have to say ont he topic.  Have a good day.<br>
azindar:: um Maritzia who made you server spokesperson<br>
Tokins:: Exactly<br>
Tokins:: ((ooc I am a rogue and I rarely apologize if you wondering my class))<br>
kuladen:: Azindar.. are you the dude who dared Tokins to do it?<br>
Tokins:: no lol<br>
Drachma son of Trach:: I say dropp it...ders nothing to be gained by arguing<br>
azindar:: nope <br>
Tokins:: this is the first time I met Azindar in chat i helped him get his corpse ingame<br>

Maritzia:: ((tokins, none of this has anything to do with IC anything.  All of this is strictly out of character.  You need to apolgize out of character.  period))<br>
kuladen:: Oh.. yeah.. this is all totally ooc. Kuladen the bard does not hardly know how to read.. he wouldn't be saying ANY of this<br>
Tokins:: oh<br>
Tokins:: Well shit<br>
Tokins:: This isn't from Tokins<br>
Yiben Bloodheart joined<br>
Tokins:: ((ooc: I am sorry for all the trouble my character has caused))<br>
Yiben Bloodheart:: wow that was the wierdiest thing, the ezchat messed up really badly<br>
Maritzia:: Honestly, Tokins, if I didn't think you really wanted to turn all this around, I wouldn't be dealing with you here, I'd simply put you on ignore.<br>
Xadria:: that is a start <br>
azindar:: ((loooL))<br>
Tokins:: Xadria <br>
Maritzia:: &lt;sigh&gt; I'm done.  this is obviously going nowhere.<br>
Tokins:: You have no idea - You helped me so many times in my EQ life and you would never know<br>
Tokins:: We are all closely connected <br>
azindar:: Maritizia you are having too much fun in this aren't you<br>
Xadria:: I have helped you?<br>
Tokins:: All you people that drop your roots and fishing grubs I am the dude that picks those up<br>
Tokins:: Yea Xadria<br>
Xadria:: how exactly <br>
Tokins:: You hang out with someone with a very similiar name?<br>
kuladen:: Ok.. tokins... you have a third option. Cut and paste this wholeeeee conversation.. and put it up. Like Cata did. You said simply you were sorry. But on here.. not out there. If you want I will do it... no editing.<br>
Tokins:: I will trust you to do it<br>
<br>
End::<br>
<br>
My hope is that this will all blow over. <br>
<br>
Again, Cata, I apologize also. What he did I find reprehensible.. but I guess I'm the dork who thinks everyone should get a second chance. <br>

Apology under torture.<br>

That said Kuladen is absolutely right.  Saying I'm sorry and actually meaning it seldom falls on deaf ears.  Having forced out of you and someone else posting it for looks a tad less sincere.<br>

Yes, before that he was and his appologies were as sincere as a $3 bill.  But.. mayhap he finally understood.  <br>
<br>
If you are appologising, really appologising, you don't excuse it, you don't say &quot;I only did it because&quot; or &quot;but I was right anyway&quot; or try to &quot;save face&quot;.  The appology is saying I goofed, I will try not to do so again, that's all, that's it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/10/02 9:28:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1974.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/didi/a_didisig.gif height=120 width=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Apologia</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tokins:: ((ooc: I am sorry for all the trouble my character has caused))<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This would be considerably more convincing if I hadn't seen him in chat last night emphatically saying over and over that chat is totally OOC and that at no time was he IC in chat.<br>
<br>
Which makes this apology for &quot;the trouble my character has caused&quot; just as empty as the other apologies &quot;because someone dared me&quot;, etc. ... How about an apology from the player for being a complete moron and harassing a complete stranger in an offensive and profane manner?  <br>
<br>
Y'know what?  If somebody dares me to be a jerk to someone else ... I will say &quot;no&quot;.  It's not rocket science.  The moment I agree, it becomes MY responsibility and MY fault no matter who suggested it. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
