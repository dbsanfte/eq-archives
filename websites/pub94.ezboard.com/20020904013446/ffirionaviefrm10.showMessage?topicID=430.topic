Trust Jhithra as you trust me. She knows who you are, and will provide for you.<br><br>I wrote this letter because I want you to know the perils of your heritage, but also wanted to wait to tell you of it, until you could understand what it means.<br><br>I wished you to be a child for as long as you could be, inlul eoul, before life's prison over takes you, even if that means Im not around to explain it to you in person.<br><br>You have never met your Father, but have always known, in your heart, who He was. I hated Him so increadibly, so completely, that it was beautiful. Perhaps that is what drew Him to me. I have always been His. I never doubted Him until you were born.<br><br>He told me so many things... Created such visions in my heart, of what He would do for you, of how you would be hailed as His son, the Incarnation of Hate, visions of glory and dominion.<br><br>And I believed.<br><br>When I realized His lies, how He intended to fulfill none of His promises, and in fact had His followers seek to prevent your birth, and then try to hunt you down, I came to hate Him in a way, with an intensity, that even I had never thought possible.<br><br>I hated Him so absolutely, in fact, that I decided to raise you, not as He wanted, but in an opposite way. <br><br>I learned of love as well as hate, mercy as well as cruelty, forgiveness as well as ruthlessness, in order to teach them all to you. You are His son, Valsharn, but my child. And He will hate you for that.<br><br>However you address your future, whether it be to accept your heritage or deny it, know this: You Are The Way. How you proceed is up to you, and you alone. You are an entity unto yourself. Hold that close to your heart, for there will be few other things that will venture there.<br><br>Be prepared to be hunted for this, to be hated, by many of His followers. You will be able to walk among them briefly, until they realize who you are. <br><br>After that, the Temple will pursue you until one of you falls.<br><br>May it be them.<br><br>Ssinssrigg lueth phlith.<br><br>[to be continued] <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimperialson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImperialSon</A> at: 8/30/02 6:03:13 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=430.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=430.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=430.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=430.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=430.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=430.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
