<br>
Yes, I would have to agree, it's much harder to claim someone is hogging all the spawns in an outdoor area. More like someone can hog all of the spawns in part of an outdoor area. Such as in the Rathe Mountains, when a level 60 player kites around 6 Hill Giants, which i've seen done, and part of the reason I won't every go HG hunting again. <br>
<br>
But it is possible to hog an outdoor area. I certainly know, that when I need batwings, I go to West Freeport and aggro all the bats, and PB AE, mainly cause I'm one cheap wizard. I certainly know I could run all around the zone, aggro 90% of everything thing and PB AE it. If I did this enough times, I'm sure it would get the attention of the GM's. <br>
<br>
I bet I could run around the East Commonlands doing the same thing. Which would really piss everyone off.<br>
<br>
Thank the gods I'm not crazy.<br>

Yet.<br>

Ok, first of all that chat log has been altered but who am I to try to make you actually believe that, as that is not the point of my response. First, I was going to let it go because I think someone that would actually sit here, alter a log and try to degrade another individual who is just playing a game merits no response but whatever. Anyhow, I do think that I am entitled to my own version of events. First of all, yes I was hunting in that zone and I was in fact engaging Tribal’s seeking Acrylia ore in so that I could benefit my guild. I had been in the region for about 2 hours and did not notice anyone. I went over to the other side by Maiden’s Eye and broke up the camp. When I climbed back over the hill I saw two people by GE zone so I actually told myself, ok give them a chance, stay on the hill and let them have the pops down below. <br>
<br>
A couple of minutes later I do get a tell, and believe me folks, the tell was nowhere near as polite as what is listed. I do forget exactly what was written but it was more along the lines of (and it was rather polite) but the main point of the message was that I should move because they were not happy I was hunting in the zone. However, the initial message did accuse me of Kill Stealing. I responded nothing like what was written but rather stated that I had been there for quite some time, (no time was given) and that I was not going to move because I was doing nothing wrong. I also stated that kill stealing as I understood was defined as engaging an engaged mob and I was doing anything but that.<br>
<br>
This whole stupid bitch issue is a complete fabrication and an absolute joke, not only that but the remainder of the conversation is also a complete fabrication and never happened. What did transpire however was about 6 or 7 subsequent tells basically aimed at telling me off to which I brushed aside. However, I am not 100% innocent, I admit to being a little frustrated and nuking a tribal but I left it at that and did not try to steal it. Why was I frustrated? I will tell you why I was frustrated. I come on line and love playing this game. I was perfectly content and minding my own business having a great time. Then, as is all too often the case, someone comes along and ruins all the fun. If anyone knows the zone in question you will know right off hand that for 1 person soloing and a group of tow, there are more mobs then anyone can handle. Pure speculation on my behalf but I believe that these people were just…..envious of the fact that I was making off far better then they were. Now, because of this, they see fit to message me and basically tell me what I should be doing, how I should be doing it, what I am allowed to do, what I am not allowed to do, then actually come to a message board, waste..I don’t know, 30 minutes of their time actually trying to ruin someone’s fictitious name with fabrications and alterations to a chat log? <br>
<br>
This is not the end of the story, not by far, abut another ten minutes following this, I get a tell from someone I have never heard from before in my life telling me that hears I am being rude to one of his friends. When I ask him who exactly he is? He gets mad because I have never heard of him before. So right here and now I know exactly where this is going! This guy … well….here comes the Everquest police…..yep…..the very next tell he is going on about how I shouldn’t be playing the game the way I am playing and how I am a dood and a noob and how I don’t belong on this server and how he is going to ruin my reputation, blah blah heard it all a million times. Anyway, I respond trying to explain the situation to him pretty much as follows, Look mate, let’s say that you are hunting in an area and I come up to you and ask you to move because I don’t think it is fair that you are getting more kills then me….are you going to move? That just drew more doob calling and more…..get back to another server comments, you know, the same old stuff.<br>
<br>
Well, somewhere in the conversation I tell him, ok, let’s settle this by calling a GM in and telling him exactly what is happening, he says, no no I solve my problems by talking…something which made me laugh considering how juvenile this guy is being. Then at one point he goes on about how he has heard of me and how I don’t belong in his world, well to myself, that does pretty much sum up the entire situation…..”his world” where he can come in and tell people how he thinks they should play, how he thinks they should respond, where he thinks they should or shouldn’t hunt.<br>
<br>
I don’t think my response is so much of a response rant as it is a point. My point is, some people really really need to stop playing this game and get a reality check! To actually become annoyed because someone has not heard of you, to actually try and tell someone else how to play a game, to actually sit there and fabricate lies and alter transcripts…….wow……come on…….get back down to earth before it is too late.<br>
<br>
In essence I think that certain people should really be ashamed of themselves. You are taking this game far far too seriously and should perhaps think about seeking professional help. Let us just imagine for a moment that I did call this individual a bitch, should such an action merit a whole essay on how I should be avoided? I wouldn’t think so, everyone, each and every single one of us has run into people that we do not like, do we all sit down and write essay’s about it? Do we all fabricate lies and alter scripts about it? Do we all go running to our guild leaders and have them argue useless points with nothing better to say then you’re a dood? Well, if that is the case then by all means, call me a noob, call me a doob I don’t care, but you know what dear? If I saw your corpse laying in the ground somewhere I would still happily load my little res and fix you all up….why? Because it is a game dear, a game I love playing regardless of people like you who from time to time make me question my own beliefs. Thank you.<br>

Today, I met a member of Ablayze called... of all things... &quot;Funkdocta&quot;. I cannot even be bothered going into what happened, but it was an attempt at RP which ended with this juvenile idiot shouting repeatedly across Gfay in an OOC context that I was a racist Nazi because my character doesn't like Dark Elves. Those exact words.<br>
<br>
How roleplay is that?<br>
<br>
DeathWatch, you should choose who you allow in your guild very carefully. They reflect on you, and they're not reflecting very well. You don't like my RP? Fine, but I sure as hell won't put up with being called a god-damned Nazi for it.<br>

You are correct in that what happens to you, especially from a member of a guild does reflect the general outlook of the said guild in question, to that there is no doubt. However, before continuing just let me state that I find it rather bizarre to see you write that you would tend to lean towards one person. With all due respect, who made you judge, jury and executioner? You, nor no one else here was present during the said encounter and thus are merely witnesses to an argument based upon hearsay and she said, he said. It is not my goal to try and come here to convince anyone of what might have happened or might not have happened but rather to state the utter futility of it all. On one hand it seems to me that what I have said is logical, intelligent and factual whereas on the other side you have pure fabrication, complaining and speculation. To further my point, it now appears that I am brothers with a man I have never in my life before met…well whatever.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
As for the incident with Funkdocta, I have not been on line, (in the game) in a couple of days so I am not quite sure what exactly is happening, however, in a very brief appearance I was warned by Tuppen that a member of the guild, (recently arrived from another server) was shouting recruitment offers POK. I am well aware that such actions lead to the recruitment of individuals that you have just bumped into. Now before I do solve the situation I request that you contact me with details of what exactly happened in so that I can take appropriate action with all individuals concerned.

<br>
No, seriously, all comments are OOC for me on the soapbox anyway.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Deathwatch, in your last post, you misunderstood what Talethia was saying.  Let me reiterate her (I hope I'm putting the right gender there) quote again:<br>
<br>
&quot;I am inclined to lean towards Briony here. I have had nothing but good experiences with members of Ring of the Light.&quot;<br>
<br>
Note the second sentence.  She's not being judge, jury, executioner.  I think you're overreacting.  All she's saying is that due to her experiences with Briony's guild (and probably Briony himself), it would not fit with her prior experience for Briony to be fabricating stuff here.<br>
<br>
You may also notice lately that I disbanded from Ablayze this week.  When I was initially approached, I was under the impression that you were seeking to build a friendly, good-race-rp-based guild focused on comraderie and helping others.<br>
<br>
What I found when I came back online after my last stint of 12-hour shifts at work was a whole slew of low-level folks who didn't speak, didn't work together, and were quite obviously non-rp.  (&quot;Funkdocta&quot; being one of those)<br>
<br>
I should have waited longer before joining a non-established guild on Firiona Vie, but the few folks that I met initially struck me as being good, honest, cooperative people that I would be proud to associate with.<br>
<br>
So, I disbanded if only to keep from dragging myself down with everyone else.  Selfish?  Possibly.  I tried talking in guildchat to see what was going on, and the complete lack of any response despite there being 20+ individuals roaming around pretty much confirmed that any structure or purpose to the guild was either non-existent, or not really in line with why I chose FV for my new EQ home (i.e. building an rp persona and finding my niche as a supporting member of the community).<br>
<br>
Okay, okay; I'm going to quit hijacking the thread now.  In short, I don't think Briony's original rant was out of line, considering what the soapbox is intended for.  This forum is meant to alert/complain to others in the community so that people are aware of unpleasant situations they may wish to avoid.<br>
<br>
If you wish to counter Briony's rant, it might do better to make a simple, polite rebuttal rather than a multi-paragraph rant which degenerates into a Mr. Rodgers lesson on &quot;lying is bad&quot; and &quot;don't take this game too seriously&quot;.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This followed by a rebuttal that states &quot;On one hand it seems to me that what I have said is logical, intelligent and factual whereas on the other side you have pure fabrication, complaining and speculation&quot; as a central point.<br>
<br>
Errr... where's YOUR proof that Briony is fabricating and speculating while you are being &quot;logical, intelligent and factual&quot;?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They probably got that assumption from me. You told me your brother sometimes plays your character, that you would never KS anyone, and asked me to talk to Deathwatch about it. So I considered it a possibility.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=talethiatayberry>Talethia Tayberry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Excitable Elf</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/30/03 10:48:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2851.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.lycos.co.uk/janeway7/flower.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: who</span><hr size=1> DeathWatch,<br>
<br>
Tobrin has interpreted my point correctly. I was not making a comment on your character based on speculation, but merely warning you that it is indeed out of character for any member of Ring of the Light to be less than reputable, whereas your own guild (from what I have experienced) are badly behaved, rude and downright childish. This reflects on you, whether you are in the same vein or not. You must be very careful because it is all too simple for someone intelligent and well mannered to be lumped in with those less so. People often write off a whole guild based on their unpleasant experiences with one or two of its members.<br>
<br>
As for Funkdocta, I am afraid I don't keep logs so I have no evidence other than the two members of my guild who were there to witness the goings on. I was ready to simply ignore the person in question due to his name not being terribly roleplay, but when he began attempting RP I decided to give him a chance. We were in Felwithe, and he was speaking with a Guildmate of mine. We spoke about Tunare and so forth, and he said that he doesn't like Tunare because she allows him to keep dying. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, we went on for a few minutes and I said that Tunare had nothing to prove to him, he was meant to prove himself to her. Suddenly he began speaking in Dark Elvish. Still RPing, I told him not to speak that foul tongue within the gates of Felwithe. That's when things started getting hairy. Funkdocta started accusing me of being racist. Fair enough, I thought, many people like to RP that way, leave him to it. He continued jeering for a good few minutes and in the end, my character made a rude gesture and went to walk away. Funkdocta followed me, making rude gestures back at me, but the comments began to get a distinct OOC feel to them. <br>
<br>
Having had enough, I challenged him to a duel. He asked me to step outside. I assumed he was worried about the guards attacking him, so I did as he asked. Not so. As soon as we got outside he starts shouting that I am racist all over Gfay in an attempt to give my character a bad name, and the last straw came when he began calling me a Nazi. There is nothing RP about calling somebody a Nazi, and in my opinion that's just about the most disgusting insult you can throw at someone. At this point he was sending me abusive tells and repeatedly shouting insults over the Gfay. I sent him a clearly marked OOC tell saying that calling me a Nazi and swearing (which he had done repeatedly in tells) was not roleplay and that I would be reporting and petitioning him. He sent me a tell back saying &quot;Well, your last tell saying that wasn't roleplay either. I'm reporting you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; I said, &quot;my out of character comment was clearly marked, sent by tell and said nothing derogatory. Yours was calling me a Nazi over shout in Gfay to ruin my reputation.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the end, I put him on ignore. At one point he ran up to me and started emoting, so I took him off ignore for a second. I had to laugh when I saw him shouting &quot;Giving Dark Elf lessons outside Felwithe!&quot;<br>
<br>
I just /em rolls her eyes at Funkdocta's pathetic and blatant attempt to annoy her and laughs.<br>
<br>
Then put him back on ignore.<br>
<br>
This is not the behaviour of a roleplayer. It is the behaviour of a grade A, top choice asshat. What annoys me more than anything was that only last week I was giving away items outside Felwithe to lowbies who needed them, and I remember giving that arsewipe a Velium spear. How quickly we forget... /sigh<br>

Tobrin, I could flame you, very easily but I wont. Because I don`t engage in pointless arguments with people I consider or considered as friends, however, let me once again repeat because it obviously went over the heads of many a person. Anyone can come to this board and fabricate or even slightly alter any conversation or bit of information in a derogatory manner and thus harm the reputation of any given individual and in my opinion that is wrong. I could be doing it right now, maybe I did call her a bitch or maybe I didn’t, as you stated, where is the solid and undeniable evidence? There is none except in what I know to be true in my own heart. This board is nothing but a negative contribution to our game and should be eliminated immediately if not used properly. <br>
<br>
Let us take this situation as an example. One person comes in and claims another individual was rude and was kill stealing. Ok…fair enough, why not. Now look at the subsequent posts that follow, people immediately assume that what is being said is true. Two camps start to form, one camp that says, show us proof and another camp that says, oh my, it is being said so it must be true! I mean stand back for a second a look it at, this is nothing more then a school yard fight where people are picking sides based on a popularity contest, (well I know members from that guild so it must be true ….lol). For example, one person stated something along the lines of, Yes he didn`t do anything wrong but he was kill stealing and another states, I have had nothing but good encounters with people from that guild so I am inclined to lean towards it. As stated, people making assumptions based on hearsay and as we all know, hearsay amounts to nothing but rumor and unproven fact.<br>
<br>
Put it this way, and I direct this to Tobrin and a few others. I walk into this board after a questionable conversation we might have had. Now I change a couple of words to better suit my attempted argument and make you look like you were the root of all evil. Now even if only 5 people believe what I have said and post negative comments that five quickly turns into 10 which quickly turns into 20 which quickly turns into 30 and so forth. So Tobrin, if you think for a split second that I do not have the right to come back in here and write multiple paragraphs on how I feel about the situation my friend, the your are dead wrong. Furthermore, if also for a second I do not have the right to question someone who makes a comment such as, Well I am inclined to lean towards so and so on this issue because I met someone from whatever guild and he was rude, then my friend, you are also dead wrong.<br>
<br>
Let me once again site an example, I have been friends with members of Fellowship of the Wolf for quite some time. A couple of days ago someone starts a post on XxMike and his questionable behavior. Now someone during that thread, one person brought the whole guild down. Yes, one person can reflect on a guild, that much is true, but should the final and ultimate decision of everyone be based on one person? No it should not, such as is the case with Funkdocta, (which by the way I am hearing two very different sides of the story…but whatever). Perhaps XxMike is as bad as he is made out to be but will that cause me to refer to the other 120 people as doods? No it will not, not in any sense of the issue.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you think that matters such as this are what the soapbox should be used for, I argue that it is not. The soapbox should be used for pure hands down irrefutable problems that have arisen and not for petty little issues stemming from the mouths, or in his case, fingers of frustrated little children with nothing better to do. I mean come on, need I say another further then the FACT that somehow in all of this, I someone acquired a brother? That fact alone; that fact alone proves how detrimental certain people are and how they bring negative forces into a game, a game friends…… game. You know, funny thing is, I have had so many people come to me and say, DW man, what is all that crap, I am going to go on that message board and say how wrong it all is and how your actually a good helpful guy….etc etc. Truth is I have told them not to because frankly, it is not even worth arguing about. It will only prolong the entire issue and drag more people in then need be. I can take care of myself and make my points as clear as they need to be made without any help from anyone. If you fail to see them, then your bias and prejudice are far greater then suspected and you should sit back and think about what you are doing.<br>
<br>
Let us look at what I have become from those that spread the negative propaganda, a dood, a noob, a kill stealer, a liar, I have a bad guild full of little evil people, I have a brother with a real bad reputation, I am friends with a guild full of the same as listed above etc etc etc. Not bad…not bad at all….yes long live the soapbox and people on it (shakes head). Now ask those that really know me if I am any of those,……wait I will answer that question….probably not to a greater extend then yourselves (think about it).<br>

I don't doubt that you are. At one point he was sending me tells hurling abuse at me whilst protesting in shout and say that I was lying and he was doing nothing wrong. I find it difficult to believe that he would come clean to you.<br>
<br>
Believe me, you have no idea how much I wish that I had logged his behaviour. As I have said, the only evidence I have is in the two guildmates of mine who stood and witnessed his behaviour. If they choose to come forwards and say their piece, then so be it. If they don't, I'm not going to ask them to. The soapbox is a volatile place, and if you play in mud you may get dirty. I won't ask people I respect to get involved if they don't want to, and besides that I am sure that Funkdocta will simply protest that my guildmates will defend me no matter what (which is entirely untrue - if they believe that I am in the wrong, we have a good enough relationship to be honest with one another about it). As I have stated, my main annoyance is that I gave him an item in good faith and now I wish it had gone to someone more deserving. Makes me wonder why I bother sometimes.<br>
