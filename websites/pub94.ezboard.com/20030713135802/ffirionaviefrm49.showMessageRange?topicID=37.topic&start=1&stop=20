And what is the deal with some of you folks lamenting about how the `Golden Age` of Firiona Vie is gone, for the aforementioned reasons?<br>
<br>
Well, firstly, this is the Soapbox. Do not come into the Soapbox if you have reservations about reading flames. This is the purpose of the Soapbox. And if you don't like it, and don't come here, don't write off other people entirely just because they're using it for it's intended purpose.<br>
<br>
Also, as long as the people using this server, and less so, the people using this server's board, remain the same, we aren't becoming a blue server with a special ruleset. What makes FV FV isn't the players choosing to call another a &quot;troubled and confused player who should think twice before taking my mob again&quot; versus &quot;an incest-born fuckface with a needledick and a fancy for little kids motherfucking KSer.&quot; The latter flame might give you insight into the emotional maturity of that flamer in particular, but it has zero bearing on the quality of FV.<br>
<br>
IMO, what it comes down to is the players and the way they play, not what the players write on a flameboard when they're mad.<br>
<br>
So come on, stop with this nonsense. Your words can be gentle if you'd like, but again, it has zero bearing on the quality of the server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thraallfv>ThraallFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 549<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/20/03 11:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~msamuel/frgSthrl.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FV lost</span><hr size=1> I found FV, its about the 3rd from top on the server select screen.<br>

<br>
When loot becomes more important than roleplay;<br>

<br>
When people behave as rudely (Or WORSE) than on regular &quot;bluebie&quot; or &quot;carebear&quot; servers;<br>
<br>
When roleplay takes a back seat to pretty much everything else on a &quot;roleplay preferred&quot; server...<br>
<br>
Then yes, I would have to say that the Golden Age of Firiona Vie is indeed over.<br>
<br>
The patches were not the cause.  They were the catalysts and good indicators of the direction.  The symptoms were evident in the d00d to rp'er ratio when the ruleset was modified in order to keep the server population up (or so we were told).<br>
<br>
I cry for Firiona Vie.<br>

It has fewer asshats for sure, but that's merely a product of the low server population. The ratio is about the same, and can be demonstrated on these boards on any given day. You have fewer KS/Camp Stealing/etc rants only because there are so many open places to hunt that there is simply no reason for confrontation. I'm so sorry, but you guys are no better than the people on any of the other blue servers. Some of you would appear more honest if you traded your &quot;Once was a RPer&quot; sign for a simple &quot;Sold&quot; sign though.. <br>
<br>
Nonetheless, there is salvation and much meriment to be found here. It's in the same places that it's found on other servers. That of course is your friends and guilds. There are still a few good guilds here that I would consider friends of FV, in that they haven't completely sold out or copped out. A couple of them (Clan Twisted and Ebon Storm come to mind) are probably the best guilds on the server atm, in that they seem to have a solid combination of power and faithfulness to FVs values. I'm betting that they'll go down as # 1 and # 1 in terms of raw power at some point. Anyway, good stuff has always been here and always will be, but it's the same stuff you find anywhere else. Considering that most of FVs population came from other servers that's not really a mystery. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://domain-pending.com/varhola@sbcglobal.net/gnicsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stavehamvaliant@firionavie>StavehamValiant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/21/03 9:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FV lost</span><hr size=1> Ok, as my ingame friends tell me, I may be the only person that started playing EQ because the disk came with my new computer. I play no other computer games, as I generally don't enjoy them. But I like EQ aot.<br>
<br>
I started on FV, cause the Rollplaying perfered caught my eye. I thought, that seems like me. <br>
<br>
I've created other characters on other servers for fun, but mainly play on FV. You could say it's 95% FV, 5% other servers. It's well over a year.<br>
<br>
For me, the server has changed much. First, it is more crowded. But not nearly as bad as other servers. FV at first seemed a haven for those that didn't like PvP or the regular Blue servers with it's long time players.<br>
<br>
The idea behind nothing being no drop and TLC seemed geared towards people HAVING to work together to complete quests. When I was the newbiest of all newbies, running around EC trying to get my armor quests done. People would just give you things you needed. And on that level, they still do for the most part. Now and then you run into the person that wants 10plat for a jar of snake bile. I even had a level 30 player give me 17 plat for simply being nice to him. I never begged for anything. I got some really lucky breaks in my lower levels. And in return I tried to give other lower levels breaks. For many season, I would give decent weapons and items that weren't worth trying to sell to lowbies. I would make a game of wandering around EC and the first person to find me got the item.<br>
<br>
I really don't see that as much now. For me the bazaar changed alot. Suddenly it seemed like everything was viewed with a $ in some peoples eyes. If I can sell it, I will. <br>
<br>
More dOOds as people like to call them have shown up on the server. Drawn because of the fact of being able to sell everything. These are the people you read about camping and running all over other players in the Soapbox. Those that move into a camp and say and do anything to try and get you to leave. I've encountered many like that in the last few months. Most I just ignore and go about my business. Then even more dOOds came once it was found out you can bypass TLC with the raid feature. <br>
<br>
But yeah, FV has changed. I can't say for good or bad. Because everything changes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Order of Crimson Hands</span><br>  Posts: 1417<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/21/03 9:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FV lost</span><hr size=1> EQ was never an ideal platform for Roleplaying, changes in the game and the nature of the high-end also tends to discourage RP in some ways.<br>

Bullshit. You cry because FV doesn't live up to your standards.<br>

You 'Golden Age' whiners need to get off the selfish bus somewhere else from now on. This is the oldest, tiredest crap in the game now.<br>
<br>
'Whaaaaa, they changed something! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!'<br>
<br>
Why don't you guys shut your collective pieholes and try to filter the game thru something other than your own greedy, self-obsessed world view. I've been here since literally day one and this shit has gone on non-stop. Every 10 minutes some me-monkey is claiming the server is ruined. Get a hold of yourselves and realize that the game doesn't revolve around YOUR vision of it and that it had to change to make the server more fun for the majority of people who were ALREADY HERE. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

<br>
If you look for d00ds you'll find them, expecially around the starting cities / freeport / &quot; ez l33t &quot; xp zones<br>
<br>
If you look for roleplay you'll find that as well.<br>
<br>
The best thing about FV is that is someone pulls a <br>
<br>
smasharoo , ( sure he's still around prolly ) or a Xarpolis.<br>
<br>
IE directly attacks roleplay as a viable way to have fun then the community trashes them.<br>
<br>
The server has changed , eaaaak !<br>
<br>
yes yes it has unlike back when we were all sporting banded and liveing large and could understand each other because the languages were bugged, and shouts were gimped down to a radius, and etc etc the server was different.<br>
<br>
with the fixing of the languages, and shout folks could actually talk to each other, and greif each other better.<br>
<br>
Also with the lack of the nodrop tag raiding guilds as they chew through content generate alot of extra loot that  can be sold off, meaning places like Karnors which is usually heavily camped for good dropable weapons for sale and saleable armors is actually just and xp zone now and folks generally are better equiped than you'd see on a blue server.<br>
<br>
IE with my rogue at level 1 I was useing NtoV weaponry<br>
<br>
Sure there is the same ebay just that goes along with every server but at least now you don't see ebay'd toons with nodrop gear fuxoring things up badly, which is a real issue on blue servers.<br>
<br>
Any way there were E-bay issues day one on the server :cough: iskar regen breast plate anyone remember that ?<br>
<br>
What I do know is I'm able to find good roleplay everytime I log on, I'm able to have alot of fun. I'm not tied to one toon I can easily reroll and sell and reequip to the level of gear I'm used to.<br>
<br>
Personally I'd much rather deal with twinks from h3ll blowing though the first  50 levels of the game ,than try to deal with a top geared character getting sold and haveing to see it's face again and again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roninsenshi>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia<br>Jihad on that ass!</span><br>  Posts: 1956<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/21/03 11:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FV lost</span><hr size=1> Simply put, you have no choice but RP a style that allows one to be a pussified version of him/herself (only EQ), i.e. the 'Drizzit' darkelves that pretty much overtake most of the Darkelves on the server now, the Paladins that don;t crusade agains people, and such and such to be able to experence duengons and such. Don't conform and the best you can do is cybor your eyeballs out in 3rd Gate.<br>
<br>
Why is this?<br>
<br>
Well, lets think about it now, using how I RP as a example, I guess.<br>
<br>
Of course, Shintou kills anything that isn't Evil. That is to say, its basically bound by racial/Religous/Class lines, the specifics of such isn't really important. Such things are really destined to fail, and it didn't really dawn upon me why I was failing at getting Shintou to the skill level that I throught he should be for complete overlord slaughter of everything that moved in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Why? Because Genocidal socities are destined to fail. Look at Real life. The Nazi's got their shit waxed. Those countries that are learning (I say learning 'cause total and complete acceptance of all peoples just isn't there yet in the world) to accept all people reguardless of race/religion/creed what have you are the ones that are successful. I'm not gonna list examples, just take a look at the world and you'll see, those countries that have Intolerance aren't really that good, where the ones with tolerance are that good.<br>
<br>
Now, lets slap this on EQ.<br>
<br>
The guild that isn't tolerant will never be able to raid better then the guild that is tolerant. Why? If you're asking that, read the above paragraph again thx.<br>
<br>
Same thing, when all peoples come together it just works better. When you don't tolerate, it just doesn't. <br>
<br>
As for RP or not, well. RP doesn't just have to be look a Darkelf and a Paladin hacking eachothers limps off everytime they cross paths, acceptable roleplay can be found in the drizzit style or whatever the hell you wanna call it.<br>
<br>
A problem of the Hardcore RPers (I myself included, I slip up and fuck up myself): Is that we see these guilds with all races/religions in them and automatically smack them with the Non RP Tag/RaidingGuild/Uberd00dfucktards whathave you. Wrong on our part.<br>
<br>
A Problem of the non Rpers. Not roleplaying. You got really no excuse not to be. Even Resolution and FnF on down, everyone can do it. Why aren't you. We're not asking for a 10000 page essay on how your character cut up a fire bettle. Read above. Everyone can RP. Just because you're a ShadowKnight of Innoruuk guilded with a Paladin follower of Nife, that doesn't mean its not RP, and its not entierly hard either. You can easily just toss off gods and hatred and say you're working together for the common good.<br>
<br>
Of course, you can't expect a &quot;Oh, well thats okay!&quot; answer from someone like Shintou or any of the other I guess I can use the term Religios Fanatics of Norrath. Just because we do this doesn't mean we're hammering your RP, we're just doing what we do. Roleplay. Take it personally at your own cost, not mine.<br>
<br>
Do I have anything else? Lemme see...<br>
<br>
You know what?<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>

<br>
But you know, Im never so shitty that I dont leave the possability open for conversation.  Two of the most recent &quot;random&quot; RP'es I've had were with a wood elf and a froglok.<br>
<br>
Vabris loathes them, would rather kill them then look at them, but the RP was fun and when it was over there was a quick ooc exchange between us and that was that.<br>
<br>
RP is far from dead and FV is still the only server Ill play EQ on.<br>
<br>
To comment on what Shintou was saying, the people at the extreme suck ass.  I think that the people who use RP as an excuse to be an ass to someone are as detrimental to this server's health as the dyed-in-the-wool Doodz power-looterz.<br>
<br>
There is a happy medium, but I fear that some people will never reach it as it requires some work on their part.  I do my part by trying to get people involved with things RP wise and trying to coax the doodz into at least speaking in character.  I tend to get 1 out of 3, which isnt really a bad ratio considering.<br>

FV as a &quot;roleplaying server&quot; died last year around May 8th,when the rules requiring a lot of RP-friendly play were eliminated.<br>
 <br>
Take it from someone who LARPs. Roleplaying only works in an environment where the rules require it. Entropy drags everything down to the lowest allowable point otherwise.<br>
 <br>
RP is either required or you end up with a situation precisely like anywhere else in EQ-which barring the No-drop/language rules is precisely what we have here on FV. People will do what is natural-make friends and try and play the game with the optimal combination. Which is why I can go zone into Dulak's Harbor and see ogres and high elves sitting there cheerfully kicking the crap out of the pirates together.<br>
<br>
Unless the game itself forces people apart (see Dark Ages of Camelot for an example) they will naturally group together to do what the game is about-explore and enjoy.<br>
<br>
Can you RP on Firionia Vie? Sure. Is it a supportive environment to do so anymore? Hell no. <br>
<br>
People want to have fun together,and the game says that it doesn't matter if you're good,evil,or whatever.<br>
 <br>
It -means- nothing. There is no alignment system. No &quot;good people don't get xp helping bad people&quot; or vice versa. I was at a GM event the other week,where halflings were invading Nektulos.<br>
 <br>
I had a real honest-to-goodness halfling and at least two high elves sitting there killing halflings alongside me. No illusion spells either. And the first thing out of people's mouth after the main bad guy died?<br>
 <br>
&quot;What was the loot?&quot;<br>
<br>
Frankly,I wish they'd gone farther with the alignment system. Even made it that certain factions,if raised or lowered too much resulted in swift,divine,and permamently fatal death.<br>

<br>
Morgrist, take it from someone who has designed and will soon again design games: RP is what you make of it. Adding rules and mechanics always limits RP. Sorry if you don't like that the rest of us were frustrated with the evil-centric adventuring world (because of the mechanics), but the May 8 patch saved this server for i'd wager more than 2/3 of the population.<br>

<br>
I refuse to roleplay a dark elf as EVIL and anti-social.. and I REFUSE to give into the racist bullshit that floats around the server.<br>
<br>
One of my friends had a *light* elf walk up to them as a dark elf and call them a WHORE.<br>
<br>
HELLO?!  I would say that if this is the roleplaying you are so adoring.. then I am gonna start shouting to every zone that this is just a game and to wake up =P<br>
<br>
I started on a *blue* server.. we had about 6 months of storylines and roleplay... and we did NOT do what Verant wanted us to... I played a maternal and caring dark elf cleric, who would do nice things and then go and pray to Innoruuk to forgive her because she could not help it.. I also played a high elf who was so dark and evil inside and mean, but worshipped Erollisi because it was the *thing* to do in society ay the time.<br>
<br>
If you want to make social commentary do it.. but please leave your tired racist bullshit at the door.. and stop with the Golden Age stuff.. this server is WAY too young to have anything but a golden tricycle.<br>

<br>
I mean, what the hell...  No one can enforce anything on anyone as far as RP goes outside of their own guild... so relax.  You dont want to role-play, or are happy with the current enviroment?  That's dandy.  Some people aren't and their views are just as valid.<br>
<br>
Throwing a hissy fit though just makes you look like a tool.  Why so hostile about the whole thing, and why take digs at people who RP in diffrent games?<br>

I still hold the same view point now as I did then: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The people who moan about the May 8 2002 changes are being selfish.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It does not bother me that they are being selfish, it bothers me that they claim that it has ruined the server. The implication is that people who don't agree with them have ruined the server and this is frankly belittling, insulting, degrading and so infuriatingly self-righteous as to inspire me to verbal violence.<br>
<br>
If you don't like that I'm mad, oh well. So sorry.<br>

Thank <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Fajon for insulting me. I am quite the opposite of senseless and frankly I don't care what the 'higher powers' think of me. I do not supplicate to them for protection, I do not ask them for wisdom unless it is on an administrative issue and I certainly do not consult them before or after I post. As far as them agreeing with me, well so what? They have a right to agree or disagree as they choose, however I counter your accusation (and it is an accusation) with this:<br>
<br>
Why do you care? Is it because you believe that you can drown out my very valid point with volume? Do you wish this to become a shouting match?<br>
<br>
It seems that the May 8'ers all seem to think that they can generate enough noise to break the patch. Here's a novel way to look at it. Our complaints got the May 8 patch roughly 6 months into the server life. You've had more than a year since then and still haven't gotten it reversed. Consider how many active voices on this server were clamoring on each side now, given that time discrepancy.<br>
<br>
Now, not only do I think that the May 8 2002 patch was the best thing for the server, I also think that my viewpoint is actually in the majority. That being said, Do you think that it is fair for you or them to claim things would be better if a minority imposed a restrictive set of rules on the majority? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

They will continue to be said probably for the entire life of this server. I dint know why people were saying the server had worsened since the May 8th patch (lights a candle in rememberance) - all I saw was a server which was much more enjoyable to play on than my previous few. I came to play here at the urgings of a good friend and because I was sick of the attitudes I was seeing displayed on other servers. I wished to try my hand at a bit of roleplay but I dint expect that I would be forced to do it 100% of the time. <p>Vulrath Vadrigaar<br>
