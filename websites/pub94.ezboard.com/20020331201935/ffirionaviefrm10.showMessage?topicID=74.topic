<br>
&quot;I think my boyfriend is cheating on me,&quot; she confessed between choked sobs.<br>
<br>
I nodded in understanding.  &quot;I once knew a young Tier'Dal mage who told me the story of her ancestor, Lady N`Varre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lady N`Varre was the eldest daughter of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in Neriak.  A dark knight of Innoruuk she was, betrothed to another Shadowknight of equally noble birth.  The engagement was not of her own choosing; rather, the alliance had been arranged by her parents long ago.<br>
<br>
&quot;A stubborn and headstrong girl she had always been, and when the time of her wedding drew near, Lady N`Varre shocked all of Neriak by defying her parents' will.  Instead of marrying the Shadowknight to whom she had been promised, she chose as her mate a common warrior with neither family nor money nor heritage.  N`Varre and the warrior were wed, though many advised her against this union, she would heed none but the voice of her own desire.<br>
<br>
&quot;After several months, Lady N`Varre began to suspect her husband was keeping secrets from her.  He seemed increasingly distant and inattentive, and spent much time away from her.  She decided to have him observed, and sent one of her family's servants to follow him when he was away, one of the few who had remained loyal to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Several days later, the servant reported back to Lady N`Varre that her husband was indeed having an affair.  His mistress was a thief, a common rogue, of no family worth mentioning and no money save that which she stole.  Furthermore, as the servant learned, the two had been meeting in secret since well before the wedding.  Apparently the warrior had only married Lady N`Varre for her money, power, and status.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what do you suppose N`Varre did, upon learning that her husband had betrayed her even before the wedding, that her family's doubts about the warrior had been well-founded?  Do you think she confronted him?  Do you think she demanded a divorce?  Do you think she killed them both in a jealous rage?  No, Lady N`Varre did none of these.  In fact, she spoke not a word of what she had learned.<br>
<br>
&quot;One night, a few weeks later, after sharing dinner with her husband, Lady N`Varre looked across the table into the warrior's eyes and smiled.  'Did you enjoy the meal?' she asked him.  And he said yes, in that way of his that she now knew to be utterly false.  Yes, he said, it was the best he had ever tasted.<br>
<br>
&quot;'I am not surprised,' she said, 'since it was what gave you the greatest pleasure in life.  That was your mistress you just consumed, and now no one will ever come between us again.'  <br>
<br>
&quot;And she would never let him go, until the day he died, and even then she reanimated his bones and summoned him as her pet, so that he would serve her even in unlife.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young woman's tears had dried on her face while she was listening to my tale, horror and delight mingling in her eyes.  &quot;You might want to tell this story to your boyfriend,&quot; I advised her.  &quot;He might find it most... interesting.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a grin and a wink, I paid for our drinks and went on about my travels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=74.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=74.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=74.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=74.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=74.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
