Reptiles and other habitants prick up at the fast beat, then scurry away as two figures come bounding over the hills. Two young women, running at incredible speeds, the magick of the beat driving their feet to move faster and faster.<br>
<br>
One is well armored in black chainmail and plate, her skin is the dark of her teir’dal heritage and her flowing long hair is grey as slate. Her red shield emblazoned with a white fanged skull is the only bright spot on this womanly silhouette.<br>
<br>
The second young woman is slightly taller, pale in skin with bright red hair and billowing cloak. She is dress in black, well-tailored leather that hugs her form. Her pair of swords are sheathed at her hips, and another, smaller set are crossed on her backpack. She beats on the drum she holds with amazing speed and skill, the beat forming into coherent magick around both of their bodies.<br>
<br>
On they run, over the rolling hills and past clear ponds and lakes, scattering the scant wildlife of this Luclin landscape in their wake. Bounding down a hillside, the two women skirt the edge of a large lake to a great rocky opening in the hillside.<br>
<br>
Cautiously approaching the yawning black hole, the red-haired half-elf ends the magickal beat and hangs her drum from her pack. She draws her two blades, one sword with a blade of rolling, razor-sharp shadow, the other quite machete-like with a magickal sheen. The teir’dal unlimbers her shield, securing it to her back, then pulls her long dark claymore that was sheathed across her shoulders.<br>
<br>
Prowling up the side of the rocks, the teir’dal pokes her head up to gaze inside, her huge sword held ready in her right hand. The red-head followed after, but stopped suddenly, gazing out over the lake.<br>
<br>
“Ooooooo, tres belle!” she exclaims as Norrath just begins to rise over the horizon, its reflection cast across the shimmering lake and silhouetting the couple of small sandy islands.<br>
<br>
The teir’dal ducks down in reflex, then glares back in annoyance at the bard.<br>
<br>
“Francesca!” she grumbles.<br>
<br>
“Oo!” the red-head slaps her hand to her mouth, “je m’excuse, Mademoiselle Viennique!”<br>
<br>
With a glance across the lake, Viennique agrees, “xas, the view is quite pretty,” then she clambers inside the cave. Francesca shrugs, then follows after.<br>
<br>
Once inside the darkness, they wait for their elven sight to adjust. The sounds of chittering and grunting can be heard echoing up from darkness. Resheathing her swords, Francesca pulls out her flute. Pursing her lips, she begins to play a soft melody, the magick flowing from her to envelope them both in its caress. She nods to Viennique, and they move off down into the cave.<br>
<br>
As they walk, the splendors of the caves and caverns they pass through reveal themselves to the two travellers. Underground lakes lapping lightly against their rocky shores, brightly coloured sentient fungus, skittering, blind creatures, majestic multi-coloured stalactites. Every so often, Viennique pauses to check her map, then they continue on. Francesca continues to play, trusting in her companions lead.<br>
<br>
Stepping out from a cave, they emerge into a large cavern dominated by a shimmering lake. Colourful fungus grows up around the lake like a garden. As they cautiously make their way through the garden, the effects of Francesca’s song readily becomes apparent.<br>
<br>
Strange humanoid fungus creatures make their home amongst the fungus. Not as passive as the other creatures encountered, both women know the creatures’ sharp jaws and claws are meant to tear apart any that enter their home, indiscriminately. In addition to the nasty wounds that can be inflicted, the bodies of the ‘fiends’ are coated in fungal spores that cause a wasting illness, even if those attacked survive the attack of claw and fang.<br>
<br>
Yet, instead of instantly leaping upon the pair, the creatures sniff the air, sensing the music as it weaves through the cavern. Their bestial minds cloud over, the melody becoming their only focus. Ravenous, predatory eyes are diverted from the two women as they make their way to the opposite side. As the music drifts away and the pair vanish down another cave, the fungus fiends  blink awake, trying to comprehend what occurred, but then not really caring.<br>
<br>
Deeper they walk into the bowels of Luclin, until a good time later, Viennique stops at a T-split, her eyes gazing down the cave to the right of them. The clicking of multi-legged creatures moving across the rocky ground and their high-pitched screams touch the elven ears as Francesca brings her song to a close and puts away her flute.<br>
<br>
“We will set up here,” Viennique says as she begins to chant, summoning magick around her. Within moments, an undead warrior rips through the fabric of life and death to stand beside teir’dal warrior.<br>
<br>
Francesca nods, seemingly unperturbed by the presence of undeath, though she moves away a few feet as she draws her swords again. Viennique smirks, watching the young bard.<br>
<br>
“Ready, dear?” she asks with her typical dark elven lilt.<br>
<br>
Francesca throws her red cloak back off her shoulders, blows an errant strand of red hair from her eyes and levels her swords.<br>
<br>
“Oui,” she says, “I am ready”<br>
<br>
With a nod, Viennique disappears down the passage, Francesca watching her carefully until she is out of sight. Faint chanting, then an inhuman scream of anger echoes back up the cave’s walls, followed soon after by the running form of Viennique.<br>
<br>
“Mon dieux,” Francesca gasps, seeing the monstrosity that pursues her companion. An enormous insect with greatsword-like forelimbs slashing at the air, trying to cut Viennique to ribbons. It opens its fang-filled maw in a piercing scream. Francesca steps back, a chill running down her spine, but she clenches her jaw resolutely and grips her swords tightly.<br>
<br>
Viennique’s undead conjuration bounds into the attack just as she stops and turns, swiping out with her large sword at the monster. With reckless abandon, Francesca leaps from the rock at the creature, her soft voice chanting an ancient magickal song, inspiring the women to fight harder and faster. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/baddog117/fransig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=francescafv>Francesca FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/1/03 4:43:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/baddog117/france1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Monster Bug Hunt</span><hr size=1> The greatsword-like talons flash out against Francesca as she dances in to meet her foe.<br>
<br>
Parry.<br>
<br>
Parry.<br>
<br>
Slash.<br>
<br>
The creature screams in pain as her shadowed blade slices deep. Distracted, it leaves itself open to Viennique’s smashing blade and her summoned warrior’s crushing fists.<br>
<br>
Stumbled and disoriented from the combined assault, the monster becomes enraged, forgetting all semblance of defence. Francesca ducks under a sweeping slash of a hind leg, parries a stab from a forelimb, and nearly side-steps a punt from a second hind leg. Catching the clawed foot in her stomach, she stumbles backwards, rolling onto her back and flipping over back onto her feet.<br>
<br>
Viennique’s slower, heavier blade is unable to parry a slash from a talon quick enough, hitting her across the upper thigh. Knocked off balance from the powerful swipe, she is slashed by the second talon, her chainmail protecting her, but not completely.<br>
<br>
Gritting her teeth, Francesca belts out her chant, leaping towards a large boulder then bounding off onto the back of the insect. Locking her legs amongst the four hind limbs of the monster, she slashes and stabs downwards as she is beaten at by the small wings.<br>
<br>
It spins its large head around, opening its massive fanged jaws with a deafening, terrible scream. It lunges at Francesca’s face, determined to rip it off. She rolls back as far as she can, then with horrible realization, she knows it won’t be far enough.<br>
<br>
Screaming in fright, she is splashed by bug ichor and the flying head bounces off her chest to hit the rocky ground. The monster collapse to the ground, dead. Francesca opens her eyes to see Viennique grinning at her, breathing heavily, her greatsword held aloft.<br>
<br>
“Scared you?” Viennique asks teasingly.<br>
<br>
“That was very not fun,” Francesca growls, untangling herself from the dead creatures legs and wiping disgustedly at the bug slime.<br>
<br>
“I am now all goopy thanks to you, merci!”<br>
<br>
Stepping off to the side, she watches as her teir’dal companion steps up to cut free the creature’s two large dragonfly-like wings. Viennique then drags the creature’s remains off to the side of the cavern. She comes back to find Francesca sitting on the boulder, gagging in disgust as she plucks the ichor from her armor.<br>
<br>
Seeing the teir’dal return, she softly begins to sing a light melody. Motes of blue shimmering energy permeates around her, flowing from the sound of her voice to envelope the two women. Viennique’s wounds stop bleeding and slowly begin to heal as she moves over to sit beside half-elf.<br>
<br>
Eyeing the wings on the ground, Viennique mumbles, “only five more pairs to go.”<br>
<br>
“Why are we ‘ere?” Francesca asks, blending her words into that of the song’s gentle lyrics.<br>
<br>
Viennique simply shrugs, “a couple of the witches asked that if any of us were in the area, that they needed six pairs of these wings for some ritual. I figured it would be a nice day trip.”<br>
<br>
Francesca stops singing, an incredulous look coming to her pretty face.<br>
<br>
“A nice day trip?! You are tres... tres...,” she fights for the proper word, then  gives up in exasperation, her hand rubbing her hurt stomach as she glares at the teir’dal. Viennique simply shrugs, then collects her sword up and saunters off down the cave again. Francesca shakes her head and stands, preparing for the next monster. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/baddog117/fransig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=925.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=925.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=925.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=925.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=925.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=925.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
