<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In the begining<br>
<br>
   The Annual Greater Faydark Wine Festival was Faydark's most glorious event. The king sponsored a huge banquet, and many foreigners traveld from across the continent, and abroad with gifts from all over Norrath.. Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes,Half Elves and  even Halflings came from all over the world to celebrate and partake in this wondrous festivity. Gnomish fireworks, Halfling pies, Dwarven Ale, Elven Wine, Dancing, Music, Singing - the festival had started as an Elvish tradition, yet had become a world wide event among the good races of Norrath. It was at this festival that the most unlikely two residents of the faydark would find their destiny.<br>
<br>
   Arikonias Starbane, Captain of the Felwithian Guard, had always served his king with the highest degree of loyalty. He took his rank within the Elven Royal society quite seriously. He was very punctual and precise. Swift with the sword yet gentle at heart, he was truley a noble man.  At the age of 21, he held the position that his father once held, and his father before him. The Starbane's had always been very well thought of throughout Felwithe. He'd never dream of defying the will of the king, or giving up his culture that he'd spent his life waiting to defend - or so he thought. This paticular night, Felwithian security was at its peak.  There were many new faces amongst the Faydarks as the festival took place and the safety of Felwithe was carefully considered. Also, Orcs still took residence in the nearby fortress of Crushbone and would easily use this oppertunity to try to make a strike for the king.  <br>
<br>
   Rosetta Moonkeeper, a commoner from the tree city of Kelethin was quite the opposite. She loved being free to spend her days running through the forest of the Faydark. She'd climb trees, befriend animals, pick wild berries, and most of all spend time with the youth of faydark. She loved children, even tho she herself was only of 18 seasons old. She hadn't many friends, as she was painfully shy. She had been a loner most of her life, the animals and the children were the only ones she truley opend up to. She joined her family, due to her mothers insistance that she needed to be more social, or she'd never find a husband. That was fine with her - she was quite happy being 'free' as she thought of it. Marriage seemed to be a prison cell, an entrapment of sorts and she was in no hurry to commit. <br>
<br>
The firework's lit up the night sky over the Faydark and the Elven music could be heard all throughout the forest. Rosetta, being shy as she was, watched the festivities from a distance. She sat with her legs curled up, her arms embracing them and her chin resting carefully on her knees. She was deep in thought. Thoughts of random things, like children, her freedom and her mothers words repeating themselves in her head : &quot;If you don't learn to socialize more often, you're going to end up an old, single seamstress. You'll never find a husband, Rosey!&quot;.  Suddenly she was startled by a deep, heavy unsettling noise. It was the low growling sound that Orcs made as they breathe, she'd heard it before. She jumped to her feet but it was too late, she was surrounded. She reached for her schimitar, and managed to be-head a few of the pawns, but the centurion's outnumbered her by thrice. She screamed out for help, knowing she was in over her head. <br>
<br>
Arikonias made his hourly rounds within the city and checked with the gate guards for news of any disruptions. He was assured that all was clear and running smoothly. He decided to take his break of one-half hour and use it to go view the fireworks of the Faydark. He tried to avoid the heavily used paths so as not to be spotted by the 'outlanders' as he called them. His guardian instincts had taught him that in order to keep a watchful eye, ones presence must often be unnoticed. As he took a short cut through the forest, he heard what he believed to be a woman screaming, and he quickly drew his sword and followed the noise. <br>
<br>
   He came to a small clearing in the forest where he spotted three of the hideous Orc's he so hated. They had an Elven girl tied to a tree, all of them laughing and spitting at her. He climbed the tree nearest to him to get a better view, knowing he could take them by surprise better at this vantage point. Using his knowledge and wisdom, he tossed a small piece of branch to another tree a few yards away. Two of the Orcs went to see what the sound had been caused by, leaving only one with the girl. He took this oppertunity to jump down and slay the Orc before the others returned.  When the others returned, he caught them both of guard managing to kick one to the ground while he battled the other. When the battle was over, three Orcish corpses lay on the ground at his feet, and the girl, who'd obviously been frightend into shock, had passed out. He untied the girl, and carried her to Felwithe where she could be seen by a cleric, and he could alert the gate keepers of this incident. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
It had been two days since the festival had taken place. Arik was making his rounds within the hidden city walls of Felwithe, when Sulonia, the head of the Cleric's guild caught up to him. 'Sir, the girl is awake', she told him.  Arik had left explicit instructions to be informed the moment she awoke. He finished his rounds and started for the southern part of the city, where the girl had been since the night he brought her to Felwithe. He wasn't sure why he wanted to know of her situation. Something about her peaked his curiousity and concern. He was shown her quarters, where he found her sitting up on her bed, lacing her boots as if she were in a hurry to be gone.<br>
 <br>
'Hello' he spoke, his voice louder than he'd intended it to be. <br>
<br>
Obviously startled, the girl jumped at his words. 'Hello' she replied as she regained her composure. <br>
<br>
He noted that her beauty was outstanding and wondered why he'd not noticed it before. She seemed coy to him, perhaps she was intimidated by him, the captain of the guard, but she bowed before him with elequence and grace. Her voice was soft and light as she told him she must be on her way, as her mother was probably worried sick about her. He insisted upon escorting her to her home in the Faydark, and she didn't argue.<br>
<br>
    As they strolled the path to her families cottage, they spoke of the forenight's events. She thanked him heartily for saving her life and the conversation carried on to other things such as children, poetry, animals. They both found that they had alot in common and Arik found himself intrigued with this girl. She was profoundly wise, for a commoner and carried herself with the grace of a Pixie. Her eyes had a magic within them that he'd never seen before. It was kind and gentle. He saw her safely to her cottage as the sun was going down and he surprised himself by asking her something he hadn't even pondered before the words escaped his lips. <br>
<br>
'Can I see you again?' he blurted out.<br>
<br>
Her face flushed crimson, and a smile spead across her rosepetal lips.<br>
<br>
 'I'd love that', she said<br>
<br>
  From that day forward, all of his free moments were spent with this girl, Rosetta Moonkeeper of the Faydark. They were inseperable. He showed her the beauties of Felwithe, she showed him the elegance of the Faydark. He opend her up to him and in doing so found a wonderful world of adventure within her. He was in love with her, and he knew it. The two of them would face many challenges, and they knew it.  They had been raised in the same culture, the same lands, abided the same laws, and served the same king, but came from two very different worlds. <br>
<br>
The laws of the Faydark were set in stone. The king was quite strict on his enforcement of these laws as well.Some laws were that the blood of Elven Royalty was not to mix with that of a commoner. Another law was that anyone serving the Royal Court was not allowed to marry below their station. I.E , If Arik wanted to marry Rosetta, he would have to give up his position as Captain of the guard. They both faced very hard decisions and knew that to be man and wife, they'd have to make sacrifices. Arik could no longer be Captain of the guard, a position that the men in his family had held for generations. Rosetta would have to let go of her dream of having children. <br>
<br>
After a few months of soul searching, they both knew that this was their destiny. Tunare would surely not deny them of this love they'd found. Arik stepped down as the Captain of the guard, and in October of the same year, just 6 months after he'd saved her life, he took Rosetta Moonkeeper to be his bride. <br>
