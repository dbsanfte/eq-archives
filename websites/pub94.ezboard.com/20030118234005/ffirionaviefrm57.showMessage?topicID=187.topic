I make it really really thick, because chili is NOT soup.<br>
<br>
makes 4 good sized bowls<br>
<br>
2 lb ground beef<br>
1 green pepper<br>
1 red pepper<br>
1 yellow/orange pepper<br>
1 red onion<br>
1 small can tomato paste<br>
3 cans tomato puree<br>
2 tbs chili powder<br>
1 tbs garlic powder<br>
1 tbs crushed red pepper<br>
1 tsp salt<br>
1 tsp black pepper<br>
<br>
(i never measure, and i like a whole lot of garlic, i just kinda shake the bottle over the pot until everything is nicely yellowish, or my arm gets tired. so season to taste)<br>
<br>
brown ground beef in giant pot, drain, add beef back in.<br>
cut up into little pieces onion and peppers, add to pot.<br>
add in seasonings. stir some. when onions are see through, add in paste and puree. stir once in a while. if its too thick, add water, if its too thin, bring to boil with lid off for 20 minutes.<br>
when its hot, its ready.<br>
i always put cheese in the bottom of my bowl, add the chili, then put sour cream on top. YUMMY STUFF! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> In Perfect Hate, and Perfect Faith</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Wendy's chili is decent, but the only problem with it is that you have to put like 8 packs of crackers in it to bring it up to the consistency that I regard chili of having.  Tossing in about 2 or 3 of their spice packs in the small chili isnt a bad idea either.<br>
<br>
Of all the fast food resturants that I have seen that have tried chilil Wendy's is the best, but its still sub par.  If you really want chili, find an old mom and pop resturant, or a golden coral, or a shoneys, etc and get it from there, otherwise, your really just setting yourself up for dissapointment.<br>

A friend and I went every other week to drink Dos Equis and eat chili.  That was years ago, and we stopped when they changed their recipe to some runny shit... jerkies.<br>
<br>
Now, REAL chili is simple to make.  However, too many people have the wrong idea.  They make Chili con Carne (Chili with Meat).  I try to give people a better understanding of chili when they try my Chili con Carnage.  Now, there are two simple meanings behind this name: (1) the chili is filled with a variety of meats and vegetables making a cornacopia of tastes, and (2) I create chili that &quot;cleans you out&quot;.  If you do not shit away at least 10 pounds the following day, my chili has failed.<br>
<br>
Seriously though... chili is a great food.  You can make a ton of it and use it not only as a meal in and of itself, but as a sauce of sorts as well (hotdogs, chicken, over rice, etc).  I love using big chunks of steak and chicken, each marinated in a separate concoction (tabasco, citrus, chipolte... ) and mix it in with browned hamburger and sausage.  Big chunks of peppers and onions are great too.  Sometimes I use fresh habeneros or chilis or whatever else tickles my fancy.  However, this all DOES have a downside.  I have had a raging ulcer for the better part of 15 years now.<br>
<br>
Still, nothing beat the college days when my roommate and I announced &quot;Chili Night&quot;.  The rules were simple:  bring your own bowl and spoon (less dishes for us), a six-pack of beer, and a roll of toiletpaper.  I cooked chili from fresh farmer's market fare and my roommate provided cornbread and rolls.<br>
<br>
Now, there is no one recipe I use for chili but, for those of you in need of a &quot;cheap&quot; chili, I give you this tale:  In college my roommate and I used to purchase 2:00 AM &quot;Devil Dogs&quot; from the Uni-mart below our apartment.  2 dogs and a Hog's Head of cola came to under $2.  We would make little boats out of tin foil and pile the &quot;meat&quot; topping on.  When we got upstairs we would scrape the &quot;meat&quot; topping into cleaned out butter containers.  When you accrued enough &quot;meat&quot; topping you mixed it with a can of tomatoe soup and VIOLA!!!!  &quot;Cheap-O Chili&quot;.  That comes of desparation  ;P<br>
<br>
Anywho... chili rocks!!!<br>

It is very simple &amp; tastes better than you can ever imagine<br>
<br>
Appx 2lbs of CHEAP steak<br>
(I can usually ge it for about $.99 a lb)<br>
<br>
1 big can of tomato juice<br>
<br>
1 big can of crushed tomatos<br>
<br>
3 big cans of black beans (rinsed)<br>
<br>
cut the beef into little pieces (about the size if the beans) and then cook it in a stick of butter (so, its not good for you, it IS good) with garlic, season salt, onion &amp; pepper. When the meat is not pink anymore, toss in all the rest of the stuff plus about a cup of water. Turn it down to LOW &amp; let it cook (barely simmer it, otherwise it will get all funky on the bottem) for about 4-5 hours. Add chili powder &amp; cumin about 2 hours in....and add your heat with your favorite flavor (I prefer red pepper)..toss some grated chedder into your bowl &amp; there ya go!  Super yummy!<br>

INEXPERIENCED CHILI TASTER<br>
<br>
Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Tester Named FRANK, who was visiting<br>
Texas from the East Coast:<br>
<br>
&quot;Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The<br>
original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be<br>
standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer<br>
wagon, when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native<br>
Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told<br>
me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.&quot; Here are the<br>
scorecards from the event:<br>
<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
CHILI # 1  MIKE'S MANIAC MOBSTER MONSTER CHILI<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very  mild.<br>
<br>
FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint<br>
from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope  that's<br>
the worst one. These Texans are crazy.<br>
<br>
________________________________________________________ __<br>
CHILI # 2 ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILI<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.<br>
<br>
FRANK: Keep this out of the reach of children I'm not sure what I am<br>
supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who  wanted to<br>
give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer  when they saw<br>
the look on my face.<br>
<br>
_______________________________________________________ __<br>
CHILI # 3 FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILI<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a  bit salty, good use of peppers.<br>
<br>
FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I<br>
have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now get me more<br>
beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in<br>
the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.<br>
<br>
_____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
CHILI # 4 BUBBA'S BLACK MAGIC<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or<br>
other mild foods, not much of a chili.<br>
<br>
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste<br>
it, is it possible to burnout taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing<br>
behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT<br>
just like this nuclear waste I'm eating. Is chili an aphrodisiac?<br>
<br>
_______________________________________________________<br>
<br>
CHILI # 5 LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVER<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding<br>
considerable kick. Very Impressive.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the<br>
cayenne peppers make a strong statement.<br>
<br>
FRANK: My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no<br>
longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics.<br>
The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me<br>
brain damage, Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly<br>
on it from a pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off? It really ticked<br>
me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those<br>
rednecks!<br>
<br>
________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
CHILI # 6 VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETY<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice<br>
and peppers.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.<br>
Superb.<br>
<br>
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric<br>
flames. I shit myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the<br>
chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except Sally. Can't feel my<br>
lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!<br>
<br>
___________________________________________________<br>
<br>
CHILI # 7 SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILI<br>
<br>
JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.<br>
<br>
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili<br>
peppers at the last moment. I should take note that I am worried about<br>
Judge Number 3, He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing<br>
uncontrollably.<br>
<br>
FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I  wouldn't<br>
feel a damn thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it<br>
is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid<br>
unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit to  match my<br>
damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me.<br>
I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting<br>
any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch<br>
hole in my stomach. <p>Serinity Di'Marcia<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Thank you Serinity.<br>
I needed a laugh like that.  Laughed so damn hard I have a headache!<br>
<br>
By the way, beans are a must.<br>
<br>
Ground steak<br>
Red beans<br>
A *few* habeneros<br>
An onion sliced<br>
Green peppers<br>
Lots of stewed tomatos<br>
A little salt<br>
<br>
Cooked over a low flame in a Dutch oven (big heavy iron pot) until the tomatos completely dissolve into a nice thick chili.<br>

I damn forgot the name though, you could find it at Kroger in the health food section, the same people make Veggy Burger mix, and this taco filling that is sooooooo damn good I could cry.  The chili gets kinda bland at times though, I usually mix with a bit of habanero's, that spicy tomato and jalapeno mix that the name eludes me, beans, and rice.  I toss in some Tabasco sauce too if it's a good day.  Too bad it never gets as chunky as real chili,  I stopped eating beef a few years ago, so I miss out on a lot of the good stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/extern/821180.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
