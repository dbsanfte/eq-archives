<br>
  Many seasons have I now tread this great world of Norrath and the moon above.  Though I have always prefered the solitude offered to me by the wilderness, I find myself amidst more and more evil in this land, much of it too powerful for I alone to confont.<br>
<br>
  With the recent discovery of the lost islands of Broken Skull Rock, I can feel a resurgance amongst the Tier'dal of Antonica.  They are plotting; gathering their forces.  For what, I am unsure, but I know that their plans will not bring peace to these troubled lands.  For too long, our dark cousins have remained to themselves.  But now, they emerge again from Neriak.  Shadow Knights of Innoruuk travel Greater Faydark, slaying Elven warriors and innocents alike.  Necromancers bring their undead armies to bear against the guardians of Felwithe.  Warriors and wizards assault the human outpost of High Keep on a regular basis.  The good citizens of Norrath live under a great shadow of hatred and fear.  And though I call no one place my home, I will protect the innocent and lend my blades and bow to those who champion a peaceful existance.<br>
<br>
  But I cannot fight this battle alone.....<br>

<br>
Hello all, I am a new character to FV, but not a new player.  After a few other servers and a few other characters here on FV, I've come full circle back to my Ranger roots.  After a couple of guild memberships, I've found that being a part of a team and family is the best way to go for me.  I've looked at a few of the established good/neutral guilds, and while they are all great guilds with great people, I would really like to take a guild in a different direction....well, maybe not a different direction entirely, but with emphasis on roleplaying.  Such as building guild rivalries and alliances, only grouping with other 'good' races/classes, etc.  I would like to eventually get to the point of open guild wars and such.  ( I really like dueling, but can't stand to go back to a non RP server )  I've been playing EQ close to a year now, and though I'm not an expert, I'm pretty confident that I have a firm grasp of game mechanics.  I'm looking for any 'good' race players that are also interested in the aspects listed above.  I would also ask that anyone interested have a least 6 months of experience with EQ and have a character level 15 or higher.  Ability and willingness to RP is a must, as I would like to keep ooc comments to a minimum.  I would also ask that your FV character be your 'main'.  I've been in guilds where many members were just alts for another character on another server, or another account.  I also ask ( I know, I'm asking alot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) that you be able to spend a good amount of time in game.  I'm not asking for 40 hours a week or anything, I just want the guild members to be around more than once or twice every 10 days. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  Bottom line for the guild is to fight any form of evil, help out other guilds and individuals whenever possible, form a good in-game friendship, and most of all, HAVE FUN!<br>
<br>
  High Elves, Half Elves, Wood Elves, and Humans are welcome.  <br>
<br>
  This post is rather general in nature as I haven't sat down to brainstorm ideas completely as of yet.  But I would love to discuss particlars and hash out ideas with anyone who is interested or just has a good idea they would like to share.<br>
<br>
  If this sounds like what you are looking for, please leave a message here or contact Camthelion in game.<br>
<br>
  Thanks and happy hunting!<br>
<br>

Biased?</span><hr size=1> OOC - Sorry, Ansur, didn't mean to offend!  I like you Frogloks and am very impressed with the abilites given to you by Marr.  Call me trendy if you like, but I am playing Camthelion more along the lines of a Tolkein Elf.  Such as:  I have a little bit of a superiority complex, but I don't let it show very often.  I have a grudging rivalry with Dwarves.  Gnomes annoy me.  I see Halflings as indifferent to the world around them, though a peaceful people that I would fight for to protect, just as gnomes, humans, dwarves, etc.  I also have a mistrust of humans, but if they prove themselves as friends, I will fight alongside them as well. <br>
<br>
  As for Frogloks, I am happy to have them as allies, but I have yet to form a decision about this new race.  ( all in characters sentiments, of course. )<br>
<br>
At any rate, that brings me to another point to add about the guild.  I would love to have some others interested in playing a Tolkein inspired roll.  I know, this isn't Middle Earth, but RP is subjective, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Regardless, I have already made a few Froglok friends, and if you ever have need of a ranger, feel free to call on me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eledhwen@firionavie>Eledhwen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/28/03 4:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hello</span><hr size=1> Greetings, I am a Paladin of Tunare and have been searching Norrath for like minded friends who I can one day consider a family of sorts.

<br>
I am Sir Loric Leondegrance, holy knight and defender of our Mother, Tunare. I have fought against the Darkness which spreads over the lands like a plague for the past 30 seasons. At one point, I led an organization called the Conclave of the Righteous which strove to bring light to this growing darkness. Unfortunately, the agents of the underworld had deceitfully laid a trap under a guise of a truce. As a result, I was captured and was made prisoner of the enemy.<br>
<br>
The time of my imprisonment was difficult. I cannot recount the numerous times my captors had tried to break my spirit and compel me to forsake my Mother. The tortures to my mind and body attempted to force my capitulation. The pain was excruciating. I was near submitting to the brainwashing and begging for a merciful end when She came to me.<br>
<br>
The tier'dal had surmised that transforming me into an agent of hate was never going to be successful. So they had decided that the best way to make good use of me was to give me as an offering to the ogres of Ogguk so to reinforce the alliance between the two peoples. I was to be the main course in a feast to celebrate the latest victory of the dark armies in a recent battle.<br>
<br>
I was bound by my arms and feet, and placed in a wagon which would carry me to my doom. Resigned to my fate, I began praying to the Mother, requesting that She give me the power to die well,and not to disgrace the blood of my peoples. Apparently, the Mother had decided that it was not my time to die. <br>
<br>
As the caravan was passing through the forests of the Eastern Commonlands, we were assaulted my a multitude of animals. Black bears, lions, snakes, even wolves began attacking the caravan. A pair of squirrels had worked their way up into the wagon I lay in, and began to gnaw on the bindings which restrained my hands and feet. Within moments, I was free and limping my way off the wagon and into the forest.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I made my way back to Felwithe, only to discover that the Conclave had diminished,with many losing faith in the Cause we had embraced. Save only a few loyal members remained....Lasgalen Lothir, Bellewyn, Whittle, and Talaysen. It was with this shocking discovery that I resolved to disband our organization, and seek out allies so that we may once again take the fight to our enemies.<br>
<br>
OOC: Hello Camthelion. I am interested in the guild you propose. Many of it's idea were those shared by the Conclave of the Righteous in the past. The Conclave was a great guild, yet I was unable to invest the amount of time necessary to enable it to flourish. I would be greatly interested in aiding you in the conception of this guild if you so desire, and would be an eager  applicant for membership after its creation. If you have any questions of comments on this matter, please either contact me in game or on this thread.<br>
<br>
May Tunare continue in your travels,<br>
Sir Loric Leondegrance <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showPrevMessage?topicID=456.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showNextMessage?topicID=456.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.threadControl?topicID=456.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=456.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=456.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm47>Guilds and Associations</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31d<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
