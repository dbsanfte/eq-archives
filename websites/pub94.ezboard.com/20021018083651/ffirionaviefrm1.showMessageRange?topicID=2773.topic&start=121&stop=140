The Sleeper is part of the game. If he wasn't, he would simply be an NPC. If I may draw a parallel(sp) to RL, we all need something to strive for. That goal is important, to keep us motivated. To never give up when times are bad.<br>
<br>
The journey is also important. But there has to be that moment where it all comes down to one thing, that feeling of accomplishement and pride. WAKE the Sleeper! If a guild has the capability and heart, then do so. I for one couldnt walk away from the ultimate confrontation after years of toil and strife.<br>
<br>
This is only a game. The Sleeper is &quot;part&quot; of that game. I also believe there is alot more in store for the Sleeper than everyone realizes. I don't think it would be the last we would see or hear of him...<br>
<br>
If anyone believes they will suffer harshly because the Sleeper is awakend, get a grip. The Primals still drop in the zone, just not on the same mob, albeit more rarely.<br>
Awakening the Sleeper is an accomplishment, no more no less.<br>

<br>
This game is very trivial, if it weren't for the competition between guilds for content we would all be happy in the guilds we are in, knowing that some day we will get to experience everything that we paid for. With sleepers tomb, and a few other nerfs, thanks to VI, those of us who are not totally commited to EQ get the shaft. We move to slow, or aren't in a guild that can mobilize the instant a mob spawns, then you are SOL(and I don't mean Shadows of Luclin).<br>
<br>
I was hoping FV would be different, but I guess its not, there is the same gay ass people who think that just becuase they work hard at the game they deserve to ruin it for the rest of us. <br>
<br>
Well thanks for nothing, you finally ruined the one last hope for a server that would be fair about waking the sleeper.<br>
<br>
Now we'll have to be content with ST, which by the way they made harder, so those of you who were still working to make it there, can forget it, it just got harder. Not only did they make it harder, but the but the loot that drops there is a nerfed version of what was there before. <br>
<br>
So once again, VI, gives it to you right up the ass, and the people who can experience the content as fast as it comes out see absolutely nothing wrong, and wonder why teh rest of us bitch.<br>
<br>
It took me 3 years to get my character to 60, with the hope that something would be done to return ST to the way it was originally. Well guess not. <br>
<br>
Those of you uber a-holes who felt it necessary to wake the sleeper, think how much harder your raiding would be if you lost all the gear you got form sleepers tomb.  Now lose all the gear you got from luclin because of the gear you got from sleepers tomb, that is where the rest of us have been left, with a game that has shafted a large percentage of its players, who don't even know that the game is getting harder, and all teh best equipment has dropped already, and wont' drop again.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hear Xbox has some good games.<br>

<br>
*mod hat off*<br>
<br>
You say that like you have plans on someday being that high.<br>
<br>
If you're upset because it's a one time deal, gripe at VI, not Reso. <br>
<br>
It's not up to them, or anyone else on the server, for that matter, to ensure you get to do all you think you may someday want to.  I wanna see the planes....so, I roleplayed my ass, to level 46. I missed the sleeper, and I'm kinda bummed*grin*, but that's my deal. It's not Reso's responsibility to check with my playtimes before planning a raid, ya know?<br>
<br>
And for you to insinuate that they, or anyone, keep you from doing something when you're obviously doing something else...is silly, and I am tired of hearing it in this board, not just from you, but from every person who has used RP as their &quot;excuse&quot; for not leveling, and blaming it, somehow, on folks who do. <br>
<br>
I've played 46 levels here,RPing all the way, and I plan to get any of the rest of the levels I get, the same way.  My eq time, is fairly &quot;raid intensive&quot;, but interestingly enough, it's RPed too, and I'm not that much of a multitasker, really.<br>

<br>
I've been more of a RPer than a PLer.  But, when I heard that the uber competition between FnF, Reso, and AS to &quot;Wake the Sleeper&quot;, I decided that I need to hurry up and level so I could try to get that damned gnome mask and a primal.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sweating the primal because prismatic are about the same.  But, the gnome mask...  I REALLY wanted to get that mask.  And, I refuse to pay 200kpp for it in the Bazaar.<br>
<br>
I had hopes of earning all the rogue illusion masks.  Now...that hope is crushed.<br>
<br>
Will it ruin my gaming experience?  No.  But i will always kick myself in the ass because I didn't throw RP to the wind,  PL my tail off, apply (with hopes of getting inducted) to Reso, and get that mask.  Then maybe focus back on RPing on a RPing server.<br>
<br>
I just thought I wouldn't have to worry about it.  I thought that FV was inhabited by a mature group that would see that waking the Sleeper was nothing more than &quot;Mine's bigger than Yours!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh well...  There's always my friends here, but that mask is forever gone for me...<br>
<br>
Congrats on Reso on your accomplishment.  Yours is bigger.<br>

<br>
Ok, I know that one cannot theoretically &quot;win&quot; eq.  But there are milestones for every player...you mentioned the gnome mask(and for that, I'm sorry, the illusion masks are cool), and for me, the old world dragons and the planes are mine.  For the high end raid guilds, to be able to say they woke the Sleeper, what a kickass thing it must be.<br>
<br>
I just notice how important many are making themselves to the guys who play the toons in Reso....I'm pretty sure they didn't sit around going, &quot;Let's do this for no other reason than to piss off the whole under 40 populace of the server&quot; <br>
<br>
If you ain't happy for the guys(and gals) in Reso, right on, but ffs, everyone, he's awake, it's over.<br>
<br>
Let's get back to the real problems on this server, like when will I ever get a set of armor that matches, that's not the FP newbie Dismal Rage armor? *grin*<br>

But, the bright side to all of this...<br>
<br>
There is a dwarf mask in the new ST.  Ok, feeling a little better.<br>

We have slain the first 4 new warders on ST yesterday and have begun to collect quest peices for the new quests in ST.  <br>
<br>
Its our intent to provide FV with an EQ first and show the value of the new ST.  Most on Ledgend where the new ST was the only place it was on dont go to ST cause they raid other dungeons like SShra and VT and soon to come PoP.  They have little information on the new one.  There are some who have spent time in ST and call it a nice creation.<br>
<br>
Also note that primal still drops but under a new name.  Same stats.  As well as lots of BP gems and blue diamonds.<br>
<br>
New and different gear mostly with focus III on them drops now.  The warders are little harder but with some good planning and work they are doable with a raid of 30 balanced.<br>
<br>
There are new NPCs in ST with stories to tell, and the warders refer to each other as they fall as well as refer to Kerfym(sp) and his growing weakness with the slaying of the warders.  Perhaps there will be eventually a way to spawn him after a long quest and set him to rest.<br>
<br>
On FV we have traded a stopped storyline for another (appearingly) working one and VI had every intent to implement it on all servers.  <br>
<br>
Sleeping sleeper = Gnome mask and no Dwarf mask<br>
Wake sleeper = Dwarf mask and no Gnome mask<br>
<br>
Seems to be the only real difference other than names of items, new quests, new NPCs and new mobs.. and of course monk shrouds.<br>

Warriors need a full assortment of weapons to deal with aggro, but there are alternatives. Having SoDs will allow you be sloppier in your play and not much more besides good DPS. Primal is the key from ST and everything else is gravy and primal will drop more now in ST with the new revamp.<br>

Well seeing how the old content was so crappy (otherwise why would you destroy it) Resolution might give you one of those crappy masks??? <br>

&quot;primal will drop more now in ST with the new revamp&quot;<br>

No it won't. <br>
<br>
<br>
I have a great idea too, how about anyone who gets those new awsome prismatic's trades them to reso for those old crappy primals (afterall they're part of that great new content are they not?)<br>
<br>
Oh one more question - who's reso alt was selling the brawlstick in the bazaar today for 350k ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What they did do was add more kinds, there is now a prismatic staff, mace, and hand wraps, maybe battle hammer too. Before the battlehammer became hand wraps, now hand wraps drop on their own. I believe the loss of AC everyone is talking about is the dagger, it has no AC, where as the spear did, but the new spear still has its AC (and even if it doesnt, who cares about 10AC for a weapon you proc and swap?). The prismatic seems to drop as much as primal did from the warders PLUS it drops off of the yard trash. So if its primal you seak, then its primal you shall have.<br>
<br>
The gnome mask is now the dorf mask, both are just toys that are kind of a &quot;Hey, we got here first&quot;  thing, you dont become a worse rogue/bard by not having access to one.<br>
<br>
As for the brawl stick, I believe that was all of Ramels gear that was being sold, he ebayed about a week ago, so this is whoever bought him/his gear. <br>

What a riot.  FoL runs 60-80k tops on Legends and is a relatively common item to see for sale (it rots a lot).  No one really sells primal, there, though.  If you have a key, you have primal for free.  If you don't have a key, you can't zone in to buy a rot.  One thing about Legends is that no-drop items are never refused for transfers.  Unfortunately, that makes FV the perfect dumping ground.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW, Coin is very correct in that the new faux-primal practically rains from the sky now.  It is both more common and more work to get -- you need more people and a more balanced raid force than before even to do motg/prog.  But, it drops off of everything.  If you're willing to forgo the names, a small force could patiently farm entry critters all day for the roughly 1:25 (at a guess) chance at primal from the yard trash. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxethux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xethux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tyrannical ruler of the Galaxy</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 1:09:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2773.topic&index=140>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> new content</span><hr size=1> Ahh, so it being more difficult to hunt there makes it better for the server how? hell, only the top end guilds can get there anyway so why is everyone worried about content?<br>
