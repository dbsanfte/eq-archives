<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:x-large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ayrielle's Offical writing contest!  Valuable prizes!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Deadline for story submission is Midnight on June 30th!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ----------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This will give four weeks from the start for the stories.  If possible, please submit your stories ahead of time, so as to avoid a large rush at the deadline.  Please, please, please, if possible, turn in your story early.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> =)<br>
<br>
Creativity is what seperates each individual from another.  It is the primary force that drives ourselves to be ourselves, it is the ability we all possess that causes us to be different, special, unique.<br>
<br>
Since I have retired from adventures, I have found much more time to resume all of those pasttimes I enjoyed so much before, and have quite honestly felt far happier in these past weeks than I have in a very long time of adventures.  This is a happiness that I do hope to inspire in others, even if only for a short time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What is this contest?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
It is a creative story writing contest, although the contest part is not the reason I wish to do it, and the prizes only available to help motivate.  I aim to inspire people to do something more meaningful, more personal, more dynamic than any adventures that can be found in Norrath.  Each participant will write a story or compose epic poetry.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What are the rules and guildlines of this contest?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
The stories can be about anything you wish.  They can be of yourself, your own adventures in Norrath, fictional stories of Norrath, fictional stories in worlds you create on your own, stories written entirely from the perspective of your OOC game.<br>
---- The stories can be of any lenght, there will be no maximum nor minimum limits.  They will however be judged on quality, and not lenght, although a quality story that takes a long time to tell is always rewarding.  If you can tell a very good story in few words, that is rewarding as well.<br>
---- The stories must be original works of your own creation.  Please do not use the stories of other people.<br>
---- Only one submission per person will be considered.  If you submit two, only the first will be considered.<br>
---- If you wish for an example, I will attempt to provide one as soon as I am able.<br>
---- It IS acceptable to submit a few chapters from a large work of (as my own example is likely to show) but your work will be judged based upon the chapters submitted.  How well do those chosen chapters either stand alone to drive me to find out what happens with the rest of the story?  If you do submit only a partial story, please not this fact at the very start under the title as follows:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Title of Story</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
(partial submission)<br>
by<br>
Anonymous<br>
<br>
If you wish to leave any forenotes or details or words of personal inspiration about the story, please leave them before the title.<br>
---- Please do not submit half of a story, and then one week later submit the second half.  Only your first will be considered, so if you know there is more you wish to write, simple wait for it all to be done at once.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Where and how do I present my story?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Since so many more than had been expected have submit their stories, someone was kind enough to grant this contest a room of it's own!  Please place your stories in the room marked 'Ayrielle's Story Contest!'.<br>
---- To present your story, please place the title <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>to be read from the outside, with the following to finish &quot;(STORY CONTEST)&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Please use the paranthesis and all capital letters for clarity, and if you cannot fit in the entire title of your story, please cut it off so you can fit all of (STORY CONTEST) in.<br>
---- Within your story, please give at the very start the entire title and author.  Please use <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the name you go by in Norrath</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> here, as well as any OOC alias' if you care to use them.  I absolutely must know the name you are known as within Norrath.  There has been an example provided above on how to entitle your work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:large;">What are the prizes</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Since over fifteen people have already submit stories, the prizes are as follows:<br>
1) <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=21808" target="top">White Chain Bridle (value of 100,000 platinum)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
2) <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1200" target="top">Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
3) Many little prizes to a bunch of people<br>
<br>
Various little prizes will probably include things such as:<br>
<br>
1000 platinum coins to several different people<br>
<br>
2) <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28771" target="top">Earring of the Solstice</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11017" target="top">Wristband of Stratagy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
Perhaps a <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29046" target="top">Valorium Ring of Galantry</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> or two, depending on how lucky I am in my three possible attempts to create them.  (UPDATE) I was properly created two rings from my three attempts, so they can now be prizes. =)<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=15802" target="top">Cloak of Greater Pernicity</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
and whatever else I may find of value in my packs when I awake next.  =)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How will the prizes be awarded?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I will be the only official judge, and will make the final call upon each award, but I wish to be open to other reviews of the stories.  I want to make this as interactive as possible for the readers and writers, so I would strongly encourage all people to give your thoughts on stories, both from a creative and structural standpoint.  Your words will very certainly help to influence my decisions.  Praise and critizism is asked for and welcomed, and for the benefit of both the writer (so they can better their craft) and the awarding of prizes, be as detailed and constructive as possible.<br>
<br>
If the main goal has been met, and over fifteen people submit stories, and you are the fortunate one who wins the top prize of the White Chain Bridle, you may trade down for the Blessed Coldain Shawl if you wish for that more, and second place will be given the bridle.  To do this, you MUST inform myself either in the award discussion or directly to myself BEFORE the awarding ceremony on July 6th.<br>
<br>
That said, the<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:x-large;"> prizes will be announced by at least July 5th</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> and will be awarded upon July 6th.  They may be announced early, but that largely depends upon how much of a rush there is from people who wait to the last second to submit stories.  If you cannot be awake to accept your prize on that day, I will give it to someone whom I trust to give it to you at a later time when you are both able.  I will never again walk your mortal lands after July 6th.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please ask here and I will continue to update this flyer with answers in the following fashion:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Questions that have been (or will be) raised</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Can two people submit a story together?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes, although you two will be responsible for sharing any prizes won between yourselves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If [the lore and history as written by others is] only used to describe a historical backdrop will it violate your rules of originality?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No, this does not violate the rules.  You may use the worlds and histories as written by others.  I will consider both real history and written fictional history in the same fashion.  You may use it, and you may even explore it, but do not copy it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Can I help go over the stories?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes, as explained above.  When a new story is put forth, all are encouraged to speak their praise and constructive critisism for it.  I will use these reviews to help my own decisions for who is awarded what.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Do the stories have to be about the people and places of Norrath<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No, and if anything, I highly encourage people to step beyond Norrath for the stories.  You may write stories about yourself as a character and your friends in Norrath, or you may write about a made up world of your own creation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As a bard, I find my talents lie within song rather than novels.  What can I do?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Epic poetry is always an option, althought it can be extremely difficult to pull off well, and often takes an extraordinary amount of time to prepare.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Should they be anonymous to prevent favortism?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No, I would prefer all names are known.  I believe myself to be more than fair enough to know that I will look beyond favoratism, and when reading the reviews of others, I will look for the explainations of WHY they think something is good, rather than just 'I like it.  She should win.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>May I use a few chapters from a longer story I am already working upon?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yes, you may, but your work will be judged upon the chapters submitted.  How well do they stand alone as an individual peice of art?  How well does it make me wish to read what preceeds, and what follows?  =)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>May I use a story that I have already put up within the Bard's room?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I would honestly prefer this not be done, but will not make any rules against it.  I would prefer people be given something to read that they have not yet had an opportunity to experience.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Does anyone really care who wins?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> No, this is about the fun of writing and reading stories.  The prizes are only there to get everyone going. =D<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How often do you plan upon doing this?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This will be the only time for myself, as I will be leaving your mortal lands forever at the end.<br>
<br>
[/quote]Will you hold the rights to these stories, and can I still publish them later[/quote] No, I would not ever dream of trying to claim or hold rights.  I am not the one putting these stories up, you are.  I have only asked it be done.  Therefore, I (nor anyone beside yourself) would hold no rights whatsoever over the stories.  These stories are your own and will stay your own, and if I am correct, your putting them up here is an act that protects any others from copying.  You may certainly publish your works later, and need not refer to this contest at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Is it against any moral rules to give and accept prizes?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I do not see why it would be.  I am not buying nor selling anything.  I am giving things away to people who I feel put forth a well enough effort to deserve it. They would be more akin to gifts than a form of currency.  You will retain full, unblemished rights to your stories.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Can you submit a story if you're a published writer?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Certainly, unless you are held back by an obligation to the ones who published the work.  Such complications would have to be worked out with them, and not myself.<br>
<br>
As far as I am concerned for these laws that may or may not apply, if there is a rule that means people cannot tell their own stories for whatever reason they want, it is a foolish rule that needs to be changed.  =)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:x-large;">New Questions!!!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Can one person have both themselves and their slave submit stories?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I do not believe this would be fair to those who do not have access to similar slaves, so I would have to say no.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why have you not yet commented on my story yet?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I did not expect so many submissions so early.  =)  I will get to each story in time, but I believe I should pace myself so that I may enjoy each one in its time. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/ayrielle/AyriSig1.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ayrielle>Ayrielle</A> at: 6/7/03 6:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elhanamistfall>ElhanaMistfall</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.mistfits.com/tgrobb/elhanaportsmall.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hospital with a pony tail</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/2/03 11:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4413.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 'Ayrielle's Offical writing contest!

The business man in me (which is usually in control) wants to know does this mean you will hold First International Rights to all submissions?<br>
<br>
Those of us who occasionally make RL coin off of peddling our yarns need to know whether we can still sell those rights to publishers.<br>
<br>
I'll still let my writer submit something either way, but it needs to be clarified or writers may get into legal hassles with pubs if they don't know.<br>

<br>
Vague (or non-existant) contracts are construed against those drafting them.  Here there was no claim or forewarning that submitting an entry would mean that it would somehow be published, copyrighted, etc. Nor did the contest that the author would lose his or her ownership of the piece submitted. <br>
<br>
Finally, even though EQ items are often sold for RL cash, this is expressly against the game's official policies (as far as I am aware at least, isn't it?) and this doesn't mean that EQ items are worth RL money for most people.  In fact, the majority of EQ players I've encountered find the notion of paying RL cash for EQ items to be absurd.  ((I might have misinterpreted what you meant by peddling yarns...but still the author's intellectual property would be weighed against and EQ item....))<br>
<br>
A novel case, but I dont think an author could lose ownership rights in exchange for an item in an online game in the absence of an express contractual agreement.<br>

Pretty sure the poster meant peddling yarns as in selling stories for a living. I couldn't imagine anything wrong with earning eq items for stories. <br>
<br>
I mean, worst case scenario, ther person ebays it, and thus the story is worth money. <br>
Best case, it would be an item transfer not unlike paying for a service in game, or paying for a sig.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 1119<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/4/03 7:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4413.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 'Ayrielle's Offical writing contest!

<br>
I just wanted to say that I am deeply impressed by this contest and by the quality of the prizes you are offering up.  You already have 12 submissions!  Wow.  This is just one of those events that makes FV great.<br>
<br>
I have less a question, and more a situation you can consider.  I will submit a story shortly, in support of your event and because I have one that's almost polished to my satisfaction that I think people might like.  However, I am not currently active in the lands at all.  Similar to your stated intentions, I retired from adventuring some time ago, and my retirement is quite firm and definite.<br>
<br>
If you judge my story to be a valid entry, and I happen to win any prize, there are many worthy folk in my guild who could surely benefit from your generosity, and I would happily nominate someone to accept the prize in my place.  If you judge my entry to be unofficial and not eligible for any prizes because I am not currently active as an adventurer, that's okay too, but I'll submit something anyway, just because I like this idea so much.<br>
<br>
Take care, and be well in all your endevors, within Norrath, and when you finally retire from it as well.<br>

Allow me to introduce myself.... I am Spiritwind Taleweaver, Masterbard to The Tranquil and herald to the Elven Blades of Fironia Vie. From the time before my own life began, the adventures found in Norath had written their tales upon my heart. Forever more do the deeds of the mighty write the songs that I should sing. This makes my profession rather simple to me... so I propose something a bit more challenging. I pray thee, Ayrielle, give to this old minstrel a topic of your choice. Tell me of a great deed, and I shall sing of whatsoever ye wish. By this may all within Fironia Vie know that Quellious has raised up his servant before the eyes of Norath as her Masterbard. I come to serve the whims of your hearts, and shall play my lute for those who would forget themselves, if even for a moment in time. And when the tale has been given, I shall stand before your seat in the hall, and by the gods... I shall claim the prize you offer if my tale should please your ears.<br>
