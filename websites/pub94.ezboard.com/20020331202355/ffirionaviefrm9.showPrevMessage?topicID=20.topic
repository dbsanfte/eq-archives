<br>
I thought that the best way to protect FV from becoming what we all left was to encourage the role playing in whatever way I could.  I thought that a good way to do that was to encourage the stories of everyday life.  Not necessarially the epics of our lives, but the little encounters we have with new people we meet, detailing how you were beating up an orc so badly that he had to call in 3 of his friends and you still wiped the floor with them, how you're proud of the new bow you finally learned how to make, or even of the big fish that managed to get away from you.  <br>
<br>
I also thought that by human nature (or dwarvish nature, or elvish nature...) offering a little prize for a good story would encourage the stories to  flow.  Do I really have money to shell out for prizes?  No.  My character is a cleric and that means that she needs armor and spells.  She will also be taking up blacksmithing which I'm pretty sure is about the second most expensive skill to work up.  Is actually getting a time and place to hand out the prizes going to be a nightmare?  I fully expect it to be.  Did I think it is worth the sacrafice?  Yes.  Anything I can personally do to encourage role playing and discourage &quot;out for loot at any cost&quot; mentality, I'm willing to sacrafice for.<br>
<br>
I felt that by having the tavern here, it would encourage the whole community to become involved.  I suggested it be placed here so even those who walk in darkness, or those who just don't care for the Fist for any reason wouldn't feel awkward about still participating.  I also felt it would help get the word out faster that this is available to all.  I am the one who was going to run it, not Bane.  His name was to be put on the modorator list  only until I came up for a name for the bartender and it could be switched to her.  That was my fault, I was waiting for help from someone who is much better with words than I am to help me write the introduction and pick a final name.<br>
<br>
This is not going to be a plug for the fist, or be a tool of propaganda, or center in on the fist and it's designs.  If it was, we certainly would have kept it on our own boards where we would have total control over it.  I do feel it's unfair for anyone to put work and money into something and then not even be able to use their name tho.<br>
<br>
I know I'm getting kind of wordy on this, but I'm watching something that I dreamed up, got all excited about, pitched, and finally got to see come close to fruition, suddenly slammed as some manipulative, controling propaganda.  I honestly feel slapped in the face.<br>
<br>
I'll leave it up to all of you however.  I'd like to leave it an open  tavern here.  If  you all feel that I'm going to turn it into something wrong for this board, tell me so and I won't even start it.  Please let me know what you think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udanaminfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DanaminFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/9/01 9:39:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A word from the barmaid</span><hr size=1>  I personally like the idea.

Following Tunare, like I do.  My mother is a druid of Tunare, and my father a Warrior.  Only problem is that Mom's human and Pop is a wood elf.  They told me I'd have a hard life, but they both understood that Tunare was calling me.  <br>
<br>
When I went in to volunteer, I found myself whisked away from my home in Qeynos to Felwithe.  I had seen pictures of the city, and even visited once.  I had a note in my possesion telling me to visit Tynkale to start upon my chosen career path.  I found him shortly, and handed the note as I introduced myself.  He was so kind, he helped me figure out what to do with the sword I found myself with, and gave me a guild tunic.  I left with my head held high, proud and true serving Tunare, heading to the nearby forest to begin the blooding of my sword.  <br>
<br>
To my surprise, the beings in the forest were talking in a strange way.  Not a different language, as they were all speaking the tongue of my father.  But they were using strange words, like &quot;OOC&quot; and &quot;Ding&quot;.  I just could not understand.  I followed a likely looking road, and came to the city of my father, but by that time, I was so confused, I just set up camp.  <br>
<br>
I am so glad to have found this tavern.  I'm not sure I have the strength to enter into the forest again.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=21.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=21.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.threadControl?topicID=21.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=21.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9>OT/OOC Forum</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
