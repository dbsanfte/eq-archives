<br>
About 25 people charged Vox, no Enchanters, no bards, one Cleric, one Warrior lev 52, three Pallys, last one standing was Vox and Vox alone.  <br>
<br>
For a raid that had only 16 or so people at raid assembly time, I was amazed it came together as it did.<br>
<br>
Honestly I didn’t think we would have what was needed to even make the attempt, but figured we could at least kill giants, and get some practice separating Vox from her giants in the lair itself.<br>
<br>
As it turns out our awesome Iksar pull team doesn’t need that much practice, because they have SINGLE PULLING from Vox’s lair down cold…<br>
<br>
Thank you Kenea, Tulip, and Rafeal for changing my mind that it was even possible to make an attempt on Vox this Teus.<br>
<br>
..and yes it really took all 3 of them working together to smoothly single pull.<br>
<br>
Also Turing the tide to make an attempt was the late arrival of our only cleric, Hailhammer; Elder Beornn and Thraall of Fire and Fury, and Bruslance, to become our terrific buff team and last moment giant wranglers; Mariuss to help us out with resists and help with our mana needs for lack of any enchanter.<br>
  <br>
In retrospect, haste would have been a good addition to regular buff lineup, but is mana expensive, it definitely would have slowed the process down.  I was already hearing folks logged to other servers talking about falling asleep and we were up against giant repop in the lair if we were too slow in making the charge.<br>
<br>
Special thank you to those who hung in there from the beginning, not knowing if we would even be able to make an attempt at all.  <br>
<br>
Thank you to Corrina for scouting as always, this worked will with the pull team =)<br>
<br>
Thank you also to those arriving late to join the rush on Vox.  <br>
<br>
On assaulting Vox we didn’t all get on the same side quite as well as planned, so Vox was not getting pushed enough and got off two complete Heals or so, however she never touched a wall and I was pleased to see people position themselves to keep her away from the walls when she got close.  <br>
Voskor as did a great job holding up as MA, and getting agro back after LoH.   For future raids, I would like to have MA run to the opposite side of Vox from the entrance to the lair on the initial charge, rather than to try and have the rest of the melee crowd remember to do so.<br>
<br>
Somehow I made it into the chamber without an MR buff (or my MR helm…) so this was the first dragon raid I have ever been on that I spent most of it spinning in circles.  Note for other intended raid leaders ---when feared you can’t even make announcements (like when to charge for example).  In future I must take more care in insuring I am up and capable of keeping watch over things.<br>
Not sure if Korhil and I did LoH at the same time, pally announces we should have in the listen channel next time, raid channel text was flying so fast I could barely read anything.  <br>
<br>
 I was actually very surprised how long we lasted after Voskor, Hailhammer, and Korhil had finally gone down, there were only two left in my group, but it seemed like a long time before she got the bulk of the rest of us down.  Something to be said for massive numbers of folks on the raid… it takes Vox time to kill everyone one at a time.<br>
<br>
<br>
CR – HUGE thanks to Handa, Hailhammer, and Mariuss for diligently getting folks summoned, and rezzed, and to Corrina, Alnlaiel, Kuluvin, Trail, and Kalevalatar in seeing everyone home.<br>
<br>
If you paid for a coffin to have your corpse summoned, please see me for reimbursement.<br>
<br>
We also got 1 Idol and 2 pickles (SK epic peices/) on the raid, I will post details shortly.<br>
