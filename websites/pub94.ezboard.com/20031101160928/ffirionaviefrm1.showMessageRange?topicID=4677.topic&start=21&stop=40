<br>
True.  I see bad things done by supposively &quot;good&quot; people all the time (( and not just on Norrath )).  Bad apples are everywhere, and rotten to the core.  In my humble opinion, they should be dragged up before a justice or tribunal and tried for their crimes.  Our family will do that to a family member which has been reported for violating our rules.  We have done just so, and will do so again, if necessary.  Not everyone does this though, but that is their business.<br>
<br>
Personally, I believe that one's actions and deeds speak volumes.  Also, &quot;villian&quot; is a relative word.<br>
<br>
(( I'm sure to the Saracens defending their homelands against European Crusaders, the Crusaders were the &quot;villians&quot;. ))<br>
<br>
Are you saying you're not evil?  You're good?<br>
<br>
As I've seen from the other message here, there are those among the Tier'Dal that consider you a &quot;bad apple&quot; too, because you say you're good (or imply, thereof).  That may be true, that you are indeed good.  Would you like to prove this?  I have something for you - we call it &quot;The Test of Evil&quot;.<br>
<br>

<br>
We've yet to meet a Tier'Dal, Iksar, Troll, Ogre, or whatever &quot;normally evil aligned race&quot; that is willing to take the test.  I, for one, would actually like to see someone complete it successfully.  Care to try?<br>

Your memory fails you.  I know not this Frayzer person.<br>

I do know that we slew as many as we wished, including some of your more famous defenders that came to shout challenges, and then left when we desired... quiet honestly, because we were bored with you and your pale elves.<br>

I know from your story that your family was far to weak to be allowed to continue to exist.  It is well they died, Nerriak is stronger for it.<br>
<br>
That is the way of things.  Do not lament society because your families wealth and position was recycled to a more worthy House.<br>

Then you were not raised properly, for if you were, we would not be having this discussion now.  It takes a strong individual to carry forth the Father's faith.  You have obviously been found lacking.<br>

Come for you?  Silly boy.<br>

Experiance has shown me that the trust way to injure a warrior or swordsman, is to attack those that they hold dear.<br>
<br>
When I decide it is time for your lesson, boy, make no mistake... it will be your allies, your friends, and your &quot;loved&quot; ones who shall scream for Saryrn's amusement.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't dream of touching a silver hair on your dainty scalp.  I wish you to be in perfect health so see the results of your misguided choices.  I want the ruined faces and ravaged bodies of those you hold dear to cry out to you... and for you know that only your own weakness was the cause of their despair.<br>
<br>
And there is nothing you can do about it.  Kill me and I will return.  Imprison me and I will escape.  Gather defenses and I will find an opening.<br>

Such is inevitable.<br>

Bury my head?  I would think not.  I have had loved ones stolen from me.  My father, a supposed stouthearted warrior of Rallos Zek, left as soon as he discovered that I was to be born.  My mother died during the birth of my sister.  The cousin that raised the both of us into adolesence, was slain by the Shadowknights of Cabilis to force a brave Iksar outcast into their command.  The same Iksar outcast that bore me these scars in a battle *<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>rolls up his sleeve to show three scars that look like claw marks on his upper arm</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->*, due to my blind faith in Tunare at the time, who I soon grew proud to call my friend.<br>
<br>
I wretch at the stench of Paladins preaching their blind faith, just as soon as I would a Shadowknight.  I attack only those who would attack me.  I draw my magic from Nature, the essnce of Norrath, who would as soon bring quakes to the grounds of Felwithe, as they would Neriak.  Who would draw roots to crush the decrepit township of Oggok, as surely as they would the grand spires of Erudin.<br>
<br>
The life of an Elf of the woods is not as flighty and carefree as the butterflies that flit their way through the treetops, like you would like to believe.  Tunare is not the saint you would think, Vabris.  She has her own treachery, she is just more subtle about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eveningshadow>EveningShadow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cookie-Cutter Cleric<br>

The War of the Broken Crown story was distributed during BETA. The game lore was not firmly in place during BETA. The elves were NOT on Faydwer before the fall of the elven empire in the area now known as the Desert of Ro. They moved there as they built druid rings to explore a place to relocate due to Solusek Ro rising the Broken Spine mountain range.<br>
<br>
You Teir'Dal can dance and love the Broken Crown story all you like, it IS NOT GAME LORE. It's as outdated as the story that claimed the iksar revere Innoruuk as their father. Goddammit. Get your damned facts straight. Read the History of Norrath, it's in your manual that came with the game. Forget a link on a fan site, Sony/Verant no longer considers it offical, that's why it's no longer in game supplements, ne?<br>

<br>
Here's an idea, how about you not try to tell me what I can and can not roleplay?  That'd be super, thanks.<br>
<br>
I know the game lore, and &lt;gasp&gt; Vabris is wrong about it.  Its misinformation that he accepts as fact.  Gee golly, isnt that different... Just because a player has all the information and the internet to look it up on doesnt mean the character does.  I liked the story, even though its not accepted lore, and decided to use it.<br>
<br>
And now Ive had to explain myself, and break the rythem of the thread.  &lt;thumbs up to you&gt;  Super job!<br>
<br>
So why dont you RELAX and be less critical of what other people are doing when you have NFI what you're talking about.  You should esp. be sure you have YOUR facts straight before you bust into a thread and acuse people of not knowing what they are talking about.<br>
<br>
If you want to continue on with this with anything short of an appology, post it in the soapbox and dont clutter one of the few RP threads on the board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eveningshadow>EveningShadow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Cookie-Cutter Cleric<br>

Call me a traitor if you please. Call me tainted, cowardly, whelp, etc....take your pick. I know what is right and wrong and you, my friend, do not. That, and only that, is what truly matters to me. Nothing else. I do not require anyone's respect (though it would be nice) nor do I require their love or friendship. I have all I want. Firstly, the chance to stand aside from the insanity of Neriak, and secondly, the chance to sate the hungry spirits of the victims of my kind in their tormentor's blood, if necessary. I require nothing more. As soon as I am proficient enough in combat with this style I will be happy to-no, overjoyed to- fight and defeat the citizenry of my former home. Quite happy, actually. I have my own reasons for hatred of Neriak and I do not require more, though some of the hateful comments here have given me more.<br>
<br>
What hurts me is not the derision of my kin-I can live with that and I in fact welcome it. What hurts is the derision of those who I wanted to be called ally by. Do you hear yourselves? Your spewings of hatred and callings for my blood would do Innoruuk proud! Are your principles universal, or do they only apply to yourselves? Are you hypocrites?! Justice and kindness are ideals that are all-encompassing in scope, they do not merely apply to those whose race or method of combat are those you are comfortable with.<br>
<br>
Before you call yourselves goodly, take a good look at what you say and how you think. I think, unfortunately, that some of you and those that you hate....are more alike then you would wish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=roninsenshi>RoninSenshi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia<br>Jihad on that ass!</span><br>  Posts: 2142<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/03 7:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4677.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Double Standards</span><hr size=1> Nothing speaks louder then anything else.<br>

<br>
&quot;Starve, whelp?&quot; I have food beyond your comprehension. I may falter. I may die. My existence may be forgotten. But you CANNOT win. Eventually, just when your most triumphant moment is upon you, it will turn to ashes. <br>
<br>
Your victories are hollow. Your rewards are physical in form and their price is everything that is eternal and truly matters. Your truths are lies that only damn you to eternal misery. Your very natures aid the cause of your enemies, for you only turn upon each other in the end-you cannot unite or cooperate for the good of all. In short, while you sit and chew your hatreds like stale vomit in the corner and demand veangeance, you have NOTHING that matters beyond monetary wealth or temporary power. Everything that is evil in nature or gain is eventually undone and comes to nothing, and you will be forgotten and consigned to the true oblivion of forgotten history that you deserve, probably backstabbed by those you spawned. In short, I may have less then you in body, but I have infinitely more in spirit, will or nil those who I wish to be my allies consign to be so.<br>
<br>
I have nothing to fear from you. The pain of your blade cannot be greater then the pain that you will one day suffer, as you stand on the brink of death and see that in all the world, there will be no one that will mourn you. I have no need for your paltry promises, or empty insults, or pathetic threats. Grovel before the lightbringers? Perhaps so in your eyes. I can live with or without their acknowledgement, though I would prefer to have it then not. All that I question is that they view their own beliefs and act accordingly to ALL, not merely those they are comfortable with. Even so, I would rather grovel before those who may deserve honor, even if they would consume me, then be master or ruler of slaves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alidore>Alidore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/30/03 8:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4677.topic&index=36>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Double Standards</span><hr size=1> Bah, I'm a Ranger, go into the wildes and do what Rangers do, when I come to a town all I want is an ale, not to challenge the guards etc, a good ale, a bowl of food and a bed.

<br>
However, most interestingly, you've noticed that the &quot;lightbringers&quot; don't follow their professed beliefs. As I said, everyone is evil -- some are just more honest about it than others. The lightbringers deny the wickedness that infests them and claim to be &quot;good,&quot; while judging and quickly slaying those they find unworthy. They torture, maim, and harm those who they brand &quot;evil,&quot; regardless of their actions or words. Thus is the evil endemic to the world.<br>
<br>
The only solution, dear knight, is to recognize the evil and seek to excise it. The only effective way to do *that* is to destroy it, the world that creates it, and the cycle of life that sustains it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nikirose>Nikirose</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://webpages.charter.net/filespace/images/rainbowball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>You did WHAT?<br>

With so many trying to be &quot;unique&quot;, a dark elf of Tunare or a druid of Hate, the uniqueness fades into oblivion.

The simple reasons I chose to play Tehr as a good guy are as follows:<br>
One: I like tormented characters.<br>
Two: I am incapable of playing someone truly evil. So, to be blunt, are most of you. I notice all these 'evil' people with loving spouses, etc...You don't seem to understand the nature of good and evil in fantasy. Neither, really, do many of the 'lighties'. It is REAL. It is not just some racial war. An evil person is EVIL and there is no doubt about it from any moral spectrum. A true follower of hate would gladly vivisect their spouse to gain personal power or sacrifice their children. They do not care about racial justice or equality-all others are to be used as tools for their personal power. They have few to no redeeming traits if they are truly evil. All they care about at base is themselves. So, by definition, we are almost all 'part-good' characters because I don't really think it would be interesting or fun to play as a truly evil character. In other words, don't criticize me for trying to humanize a DE. You do it all the time or you'd be playing banal incarnations of evil.<br>
<br>
Next: You seem to confuse Tehr's personality with that of the stereotypical dark elf renegade. He is not. He is 'well-intentioned with a good portion of good', really, rather then truly and utterly 'good', because while he believes in the 'good' moral code he is also bitter, vengeful, and at times quite bloodthirsty. While he does not commit evil acts against goodly people (hell, I run from faeries rather then fight them) he is not someone who sees compromise in alignment-evil is evil and good is good and there is no excuse for choosing evil no matter what horrible things happen to you. He does not worship a god-he is a confirmed skeptic and doesn't trust the limited paths of any of the goodly gods, though he respects the ideals of individual religions that he agrees with. He does not, in truth, have a lot of use for the divine beings, though this is due to his refusal to follow only one spectrum of what he considers good rather then any true disdain for the goodly and neutral gods. He sees things in terms of alignment rather then religion. <br>
<br>
Because he is a self-taught shadow knight (one of his siblings was the traditional rogue shadow knight and he listened to her incantations, then when he lost his left arm and had to get a prosthesis he was forced to use them to augment his fighting to make up for a somewhat more clumsy left arm.) and did not school himself in the philosophy of or ever take service with The Dead, he has no ties to them and as such I have NEVER done a shadow knight quest. On the other hand, because his memories of the incantations are imperfect, he has all sorts of bad side effects- among others having at times an almost irrational hatred of everything on the other side. Notably, by the way, he does not see Hate as something holy or unholy, but merely a more negative emotion. Basically, trying to compare him to our more stereotypical Tunare-loving darkie is not really fair.<br>
<br>
And finally. So the good-baddie thing is used a great deal. Who cares? As I have repeatedly said, all of our characters are stereotypical at heart. Let people play what they would like. Who are you to tell them what they can and can't roleplay? There are NPC examples of good-aligned evil creatures and evil-aligned good creatures. So why not for players?) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ansurfv>AnsurFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 433<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/31/03 9:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4677.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/5c494d09/bc/Yahoo!+Photo+Album/Picture+40.jpg?pfLr8b.AhDvj2B36 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Double Standards</span><hr size=1> /sigh<br>
