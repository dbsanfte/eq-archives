<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The cold night settled over Freeport, the wind whipping through the city, only walls of brick to block the chilling draft of the wind this evening.  A man, garbed in plate, walking towards the city, his cape flowing in the whipping wind, tossing it to and fro.  His eyes affixed on the side wall, as he turns and runs his hands across the walls of freeport.  His hand finally sinking into a brick, as he leans sightly foreward, the brick wall moving to the side as he walks into the tunnels of the underdark of Freeport</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Following the Chasms, the finally arrived to the pinnacle of the underground of the Dismal Rage, tired from his long journey, he walked pasted the onlookers and went to his old barracks room, and sat down, resting himself down and heaving a sigh of comfort</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A young squire, garbed in tattered clothing approched him.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Sir Kaneer <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The young squire said to him softly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The knight turned his eyes to the young initiate of Hate and nodded</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The squire spoke softly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Lord Pietro wishes to see you Sir.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer removed his helm, his hair flowing out from under it, as he tossed the helm haphazardly from his hand as it made a soft crash upon the ground</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
What does he want? <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Knight inquired</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I.... I don't know m'lord, but he wishes to speak with you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The boy says reluctantly, a look of fear in his eyes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Very well, Take me to him squire <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He says, as he stands to his feet and follows the boy into Pietro's chambers</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Well Sir Kaneer, has been a long time my child! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro spoke, as he looked Kaneer over with a keen eye</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Yes, Pietro, it has, hasn't it... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer spoke, staring at Pietro and his judgmental eye</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I am glad you decided to come back to Freeport, instead of bedding yourself with those darklings.  You may live at the Fathers temple, but your place is here in the Underground with us, Grave Lord. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro says, his voice firm and condescending as it always has been</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
My place.... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer says, looking him over, not backing down in fear as he did in his youth</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  My place is in the army of Innoruuk, not serving your self indulgence, and making yourself fat of the work of the Tier'Dal, you foolish old man.  You..<br>
<br>
Silence Kaneer! <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro says, scowling at him as he interrupts him in talk</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  You seem to forget who brought you into the fold of Hate, and who taught you how to use the weapons you battle with, and the magic you attain...<br>
<br>
I have forgot nothing Pietro... but you have... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer says, his eyes scowling at Pietro, staring him down as he walks towards him</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You have let the Dismal Rage grow weak, its knights... fickle... even when I placed your philosophies into my battles, I myself was found as fickle as you are now Pietro....  Innrouuk frowns on what you have turned the Rage into... it was never meant for the fickle... it was meant to aid Innoruuk's will, not to sit stagnant as you grow rich of the work of the powers of the Indigo Brotherhood.  Your insolence sickens me Pietro.... I am not here to come back into your fold... I am here to possess it.  Tis time the Rage become what it is destined to be... not what you want it to be.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer says, his eyes glowing red with hate, as his hands begin to glow malignant red in color, as he raises his hand and clutches it into a fist</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A look of slight distress comes across Pietro's face, knowing in his old age, the stronger knight could easily put him down</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  But Kaneer, you seem to forget... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro snaps back, a sudden rush of assurance coming across his face</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  The Rage is my creation, forged in my blood, my sweat, my tears... you are but a minion of mine, and always will be... I made you... and I can destroy you as well... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro says, grinning slightly, in his usual overconfidence</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You are not worthy to carry this Pietro <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer leans in, wrapping his arms around the amulet of the Rage, and ripping it off his neck</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  We will continue this soon... I hope you have polished your sword and readied your magic, for now I come for you... to purge your taint from the Rage, and bring it to its true glory... you will know the true power of Hate, and so will all these young Knights and Squires of the Rage... So ready yourself old man, for the Darkblade commeth....<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer says, laughing maniacally, as he tosses the amulet to the ground, and looks into Pietro's eyes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro stares back, sweat dripping slightly from his brow, as his eyes affix to the knight</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I hope you are ready Kaneer... if you think you can best your master...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer laughs as he watches Pietro draw his blade and point it towards Kaneer, then with a yell, he draws the blade back, lunging at Kaneer</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer draws forth his blade and meets Pietro's, as he deflects his blow with ease, and with a swift kick, strikes Pietro's hand, as his sword falls from his hand and to the ground</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro looks nervously at the knight as Kaneer presses his blade against Pietro's throat, as he looks Pietro dead in the eyes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ready yourself to meet Innoruuk.. and may he have mercy for your corruption<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pietro winces and a tear drips from his eye as Kaneer kicks him in the stomach and pushes the old man to the ground</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ready yourself old man... for next time I come, your blood will coat the walls of Freeport, and the Knights of the Rage will once again be under the free reign of The Dead...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Kaneer laughs as his flesh falls form his body, a skeletal shriek replacing his laugh as he walks out of the room and leaves the Underground, Pietro slowly stumbling to his feet and looking out the door as he watches the skeletal form of the Knight leave the halls</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

        I once called you one of my most promicing students, in fact, one day I may have chose you to succeed me as the leader of the Dismal Rage.  Tis sad that I shall have to bury you instead of pass you the amulet of the Grandmaster of Rage, for your insolence has cost you not only my seat, but your life.
