Norrath had been created, Veeshan had already swiped her claw, and the creations of the Nameless decended upon this world to leave their mark.<br>
<br>
They left their mark by their children, each race a creation of their own.<br>
<br>
As they designed, created, and made children that suited their own needs, and that repesented what they were, and how they felt about Norrath. Some even stole the works of others and &quot;perfected&quot; upon this form. Some of the children evolved on their own to entirely different forms. However, they began to realize a problem in all of their works.<br>
<br>
These beings were soulless hulks. They had no soul, they were just constructs of flesh and bone, created differently from one another. They could not properly represent them because without a soul they didn't even diserve to live. It was then when they realized that the nameless had another creation.<br>
<br>
Souls. Millions of spirits created by this enity, each with their own feelings, their true selves in their true forms. Some shined differently then others, some were bigger, some were smaller, each were infused with that which seperated one soul from another. Personality. Desire. Will. Morality. Loyality, and other traits<br>
<br>
These 5 traits at varing levels. Some had alot of Desire and Will but had a lack of Loyality. Some had high levels of Morality, but no desire or will. But they had Plenty of Loyality. The latter 4 is what creates the 5th, the personality. Their are other traits as well, and as the Gods looked over the pools of millions of souls that had been created.. they saw the way to make their children complete.<br>
<br>
They began to pick and choose which souls were suited to follow them, and be one of their own children. These souls were placed in the bodies and gave them life. The Gods also asigned certian skills to each soul, skills that best suited their personalities. <br>
<br>
For example, Innoruuk chose souls that were hateful. Tormented. Ones that could serve and be within hatred, and be loyal to him without crossing the barrier and loving him like a father. These weren't his only specifications, for one cannot truly know all of the specifications the gods place upon people. He placed those that had these types of souls into his children.. the Luggalds and the Tier'dal.<br>
<br>
Mithanel Marr chose those with the will to fight for a cause, with the Honor to protect the weak and destroy the vile in this world. He chose valours souls with high morality to be apart of his children.. The Barbarians, and the Froglocks.<br>
<br>
Solusek Ro chose those souls who wished power among anything else. He only allowed them to be casters, for that is what Ro believed the only true path to power to be. Solusek Ro has no true children upon Norrath, for he sprinkled his souls among most of the races of Norrath. We will discuss this a bit later on.<br>
<br>
The Gods sprinkled the souls upon their unique creations first. Cazic Thule to the Iksar, and Trolls Veeshan to the Dragons, Wurms, Drakes, and Wyverns, Tunare to the Fay and Elves.. and so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
These beings then truly became their children. They are the First Children, or the Children to be short.<br>
<br>
The Gods then realized that the First Children could not take up ALL of the souls.. This is where the conflict begins. This is where the comprimizes lie.<br>
<br>
In wake of this realization, they becan to spread their &quot;lesser&quot; sprits out into other peoples creations, or the evolution of their creations. They did not cross over too far however, wanting to only ensure that even these lesser souls got a suitable body that would fit their needs. Rallos Zek would never toss a soul over to an Highelf, for they are not combat hearty enought for his needs.<br>
<br>
This is where the Childless gods can get their own fills in. They did not create a race upon Norrath, so they tossed their souls into the races that had been created already. Solusek Ro found that the Erudites, an Evolution of Marrs Creation, The Tier'dal, and the Highelves were WELL suited for his magical power gaining needs.<br>
Rallos Zek saw that every race that had the ability to be a Warrior could create war. That is all he truly cares about, so he granted it such.<br>
Cazic Thule saw that the Erudites as well had a capasity to create fear. I dont know, maybe its something to do with the head.<br>
Everyone saw that the Evolution of Marrs creation, the Humans, could do just about anything. They got infused with alot of souls from the gods that were not of their creators.<br>
Bristlebane, being the ass that he is, throught it would be funny to have a twisted creation such as the Tier'dal be able to pull his worthless pranks, so he sent some souls there as well.<br>
<br>
These souls are known as the Second Children, or for short, the Followers.<br>
<br>
First Children or Second Children, or the Children and the Followers get asigned classes in the same way..<br>
<br>
The Gods assigned classes upon the children. From Bard to Warrior, they asigned each soul with a class that suited them best. Rallos Zek perfers and asignes martial classes, while the Tranquil perfers and asigns the classes of Monk and Paladin, usually. Ro perfers Wizardry, Karana perfers Druids.. some gods like Veeshan perfer none, and just asign upon how the soul appears to them.<br>
<br>
And when all was said and done, their were the souls that remained untouched by the gods.<br>
These souls were unworthy of any of the gods blessings to be a First or even a Second Children. Some of the Gods scorned them. Some of the Gods took pity upon them. Some of the Gods tossed them into bodies just to be malious and give them lives of torment to be weak. Some of the gods did this just so they could one day accept their teachings..<br>
<br>
But the Major ones who found use of these souls were the Demi Gods. Granted, they got some of their fill from the souls already touched from the gods, but they also had souls of their own. Terris Thule, Morrell Thule, Saryrn and the like. <br>
<br>
They are still Second Children if they follow a Demi God. <br>
<br>
For those that even the Demi Gods did not touch..<br>
<br>
They are the final Children. The Third Children who just fall into the world without the gods blessings.<br>
<br>
For short, we just call them.<br>
<br>
Agnostics. Faithless. Most of them are Vah Shir. They sprinkle across all of the races, some chose for themselves what race to be. I know not the creator of the Vah Shir, but I personally believe them to be evolved from the Kerrans. Their god must not like them much. These bastard children among all of the races. Cazic Thule faught vigously to protect his Iksars from these weak, bastard sprits. For you will not find an Agnostic Iksar.. I assume some of the other gods did the same.<br>
<br>
These sprits went to which bodies they throught suited them best. They made their own choice. Where ever they were allowed they went. The Vah Shir allowed them the most. Even if they were rejected by the gods, they went anyhow and found cracks to fill bodies just to be alive. Such is the desire of the soul.<br>
<br>
Once your soul fills a body and becomes alive, you forget all that has happened before you filled the body. Its like passing throught a viel which tears your memories.<br>
<br>
This is how we came to be.<br>
<br>
Children of the Gods.<br>
Followers of the Gods.<br>
And the rejects of the Gods. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125476" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Shinsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Truly, disreguarding the move for agnostics in the Necropolis, if you are not a First or Second Children then you have already been rejected from Darkness. The Third Childrens are unworthy to be dark, no matter how much they try to play the role, they are just fooling themselves because of the hollow hole left within their soul because no god would take them into their fold. They cannot be First or Second Children, but that is what they desire so much deep down in their spirit. <br>
<br>
They will do anything to belong. They will do anything to be apart. It is our duty as the First and Second Children of darkness to destroy their dreams, and shatter the remains of their worthless souls, for they are unworthy.<br>
<br>
Those pathetic souls who feels pity upon them and allows them to be apart will share the fate of the Third Children and no longer be apart. It is how it is, and it is how it should be.<br>
<br>
But this isn't how it is. Many Dark Guilds allow these Third Children, these unworthy souls, into their halls because they &quot;Act Dark&quot; or they &quot;Are of a Dark Race&quot;.<br>
<br>
A Race, A body is nothing without a Soul. If a Dark God didn't put it there, then it is unclean and unworthy. A perfect dark society would be one that is clenzed of agnosticity, for only the First and Second Children are worthy of the Glory of the Dark. At best, the Third Children are out of Guild slaves. They can toil for the rest of their lives trying to reach what they can never attain in the service of us, if their form doesn't offend us. <br>
<br>
But this isn't how it is, and never will it be this way.<br>
<br>
I throught I'd just inform you of such.<br>
<br>
That is all. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125476" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Shinsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You are a First Childen of Innoruuk, ordained as a Priestess. Your soul is clean, your soul being given a Tier'dal body by the Dark Father, Innoruuk. Enjoy it, their is alot of pleasure and power comming to you, priestess. You're life will be one thats enjoyed.<br>
<br>
But more then likely, upon your 55th level of power, you will not stay in this life. You will leave, joining a lightbringer house and becomming docile. You will betray your own soul and become soft, and you will assist the light in gaining power.<br>
<br>
How can this happen? The answer is simple. While a soul may show traits of what the Dark Gods need, it is not always a lock that these souls will follow this their entire lives. These are the Fourth Children. (Or the Fallen Children.) They are below the agnostic, for they had the gift of being a First or Second child, but tossed it away because of their own weakness.<br>
<br>
They can reclaim such if they return and repent to their Father or Mother diety. Or they can die to the hands of the Children and the Followers.. the First and Second Children.<br>
<br>
The line for this is drawn at the Guild. Joining a Lightbringer guild implies alliance to the light, except in certian circumstances which has been organized in operations by the First Children. (For example, Ven'Sho's spy network.). Such should be approved by the First Children and the Followers before it being done, or you have become a Fourth Children.<br>
<br>
Their are also offences that do not involve guilds. Innoruuk didnt allow Tunare sponcered souls within his children. A Tier'dal or Luggald following Tunare is a Fourth Children. Understand? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125476" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Shinsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

This must be the one her Mother called Shintou. There could not be two that could rant on so.<br>

<br>
*But the Lady is no longer here. And Kesh knew that she was no match for a parrying of words with this fool so she picks up her glass and trys to keep down this foul drink called Yukon Jack. She slowly leans back in her chair and waits to see what more Shintou can find to rant about.

<br>
Their are reasons why the Gods put some souls into the bodies they created, and put other souls into bodies created by other gods. The reason may be because that the Children are better in some way then the Followers..<br>
<br>
Or it could be that the Gods just see them differenlty, saying that this soul is suited to be in a body I made, while this other soul is more suited to worship me from another body. Maybe its to spread influence elsewhere, or to mock the gods creation by twisting it to his own will.. who knows. It doesnt nessarily mean the First Children are Better then the Second Children.. just that the First Children came before the Second Children. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125476" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Shinsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Elluden is not agnostic. She follows Desturction, a trait within most of the Dark Gods, as I call them. Of course I mean no offence to Zildrax and the Ven'Sho, I only call them dark because its easier for me, thats all.<br>
<br>
And she is not exempt. I examined her long and hard before I was able to determine that she was a Second Child of Darkness, and I will do such for every agnostic I know. Infact, I'm currently investigating the Vah Shir issue, do you know that their is no god that created the form of the &quot;Cat&quot;. From House Cat to Plains Cat to Panther To Cougar To Kerran To Vah Shir, I have no Idea where they came from.<br>
<br>
I believe the ones on Kerra Isle and the ones in the Stone Burnt Mountians follow the Tranquil, but I need to kill a few to see who they say their final prayers to. But who created the form of the Cat? Not much is known about that, for only a Dark God can create a vessel approate for a dark soul. Either a Dark God or an Evolution, it seems. Something created from a god of the light is unfit for a soul suited for.. <br>

At least I'm sure of myself.  You folks seem to spend more time arguing which one of you is 'right' than you do trying to deal with people such as myself.<br>

Of course, the truth lies in the fact that none of you are ever right.  The truth lies solely in knowing yourself, not knowing everyone else.

&quot;Sir Shintou Shinai, I believess you sstill have it wrong.&quot;  He spoke softly.  <br>
&quot;What iss it you are truely sseeking.   If it iss knowledge, and the truth of what isss, then you must ssstudy ssomes more.   For there iss much you do nots know.   You do not knows youself evens.<br>
Tell me, who created the Ssnarnaks?  Was it not a mad iksar?   He wass not god.   And [i]all[/i] soulss havingss been already assigned their formss in the beginningss,   froms where did these new oness get theirss.   <br>
Iss there not the possablility that all were born with souls sstreight from the nameless at the time of their physical creation?  That the two are not seperate to sstart with.?<br>
<br>
If you woulds be wise, consider thiss, the Vah Shir worship their ansestess and for good reason.   They honor those that journied this planet before them and can aid and give them power and advice that the gods do not bothers with normally. <br>
Who created the Vah Shir?   Their ansestors were the Kerrins.  <br>
 And who created the Kerrins?   <br>
The Kerrins came from the nameless.   They, along with us and the dragon kind are the oldest of races to roam Norrath.  <br>
<br>
And you are also misstakens about the agnostics, for ssomes are simply labled asss such because they worship the nameless.   And you are wrongs about there being no agnostic iksar.   You just wount normally sssee thems.&quot;<br>
<br>
Recquiem dropped a leather bound book upon the table next to Shintou.   It was titled &quot;A Forbidden Tome&quot; .He grinned slightly.<br>
&quot;There are other copies of thisss floating around.   We can't sseem to gets rids of them.   As for the agnostice iksar, they do exist, mostly for a very short time, our leaders find thems out and exterminatess them.   Or they flee to the swamps.<br>
<br>
But that iss not the point, the point, Sir, iss that ssome choose their own path, and their own god.   Irregardless of what race they are.   They, a physical, creating thing, chooses a god to worship or to not worship at all.   Think about it Ssir, they may be stronger thans either you or I in spirit.   They are certainly ....freer.   <br>
<br>
What iss it you ssearch for, what iss it you sseek?   To know who to kill and not to kill?   That iss a judgement call.    You do not wants the responsibility for making ssuch a call on your own?  To take ressposnibility for perhapss killing something inbetween light and darks?  You woulds put thiss burden or responsability upon the shoulderss of the gods themselves?   So you cans kill without havings to think or takes responsibility?    <br>

Sssuch is the way of a foot soldier, not a knight.   Ifs you sso desire to kill a person because you dont like hiss race, gods or profession, thens admits so.   Do nots try to hides it behinds a god's will, when you are nots a priest...or a true leader......yet. &quot;<br>

<br>
I do not believe the Nameless creates physical bodies. It leaves such work for the gods.<br>
<br>
The Iksar did create the Sarnak. The Sarnak however do not worship their creator. They are not dark. Their bodies are acually the combination of an Iksar and a Dragon as I understand it, I'm sure Zildrax will correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
<br>
But the Sarnak do not serve the Iksar. Nor do they serve Thule.<br>
<br>
Not serving ones maker is a swift way to becomming a Third Child, which they are.. I dont think they even follow a god.<br>

My information comes from looking at the world. How things are, why things are.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125476" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Shinsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Shintou, I have looked long and hard into the history of the Vah Shir, and before them the Kerrans.<br>
<br>
I believe the young iksar is right.<br>
<br>
Should the Kerrans have evolved...well, they evolved from other cats upon Norrath.  And the Nameless formed Norrath along with everything on it.  Then it formed the gods, and gods formed their children.  And so on.<br>
<br>
Cats come from the Nameless, and therefore Kerrans were ultimately created from the Nameless.<br>
<br>
The Nameless is creation, pure and simple.<br>
<br>
It can be neither light nor dark.  It just is.<br>
<br>
Kerrans and Vah Shir hold to the tradition of the spirits.  They are not god-touched.  They do not fit into your theory, and they never will.  Vah Shir, and Kerrans, are the ultimate embodiments of free will, as created by the Nameless.  They can be whatever the spirits they follow bid them to be.<br>
<br>
They, of all the races, are truly agnostic.  And they are the ones who are most free to choose...light or dark.<br>
<br>
You will not like this, because it will force you to accept the Vah on the basis of their actions alone.  So continue to dig.  But you too will run into what I did.<br>
<br>
The Nameless.<br>
