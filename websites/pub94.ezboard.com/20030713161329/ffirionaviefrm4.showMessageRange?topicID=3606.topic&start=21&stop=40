Such was my reptuation, that the facists of Pernmush put upon F'loyd, a robot object in our OOC room, my name. See, F'loyd could be asked the name of anyone on Pernmush, and he'd tell you a phrase of who that person was supposed to be, and a brief description of them. Some of them were quite funny, some were insulting. It almost got to become an honor if someone put your name up there, and well, one day mine was -- though I'm sure the person meant it in the nature of an insult, I thought it was quite funny.<br>
<br>
It went something like this:<br>
<br>
F'loyd, who is &lt;bleep&gt;?<br>
<br>
&lt;bleep&gt;? Oh, she's Pern's first assembly line. She turns things out in volume I hear.<br>

But anyhow.. that was a long time ago, in a place far far away. <br>
<br>
Eventually, cyber can get boring and you stop doing it. Then you find someone  special who makes it all interesting, and you start doing it again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Mistells of people doing cyber can be a bit funny. But if they choose to do it, its their concern, not yours. However I am in complete agreement that people should not be emoting it outloud in areas where people are known to pass through, and if they are, they should not get upset when another person comes through and asks them to stop or informs them that they can be heard. Too many kiddies play this game that don't need to be subjected to that.<br>
<br>
As for folks propositioning for cyber -- very lame. Cybersex should just happen naturally between two consenting adults who want to have fun. Don't go trolling for it, good grief. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And no, I'm NOT going to boast about how good or bad I am.  But I will say, there are a lot of folks out in the world who suck at writing erotica and have absolutely no experience or imagination. I ignore them completely or send them something to make them fall down and worship at my feet and ask me for lessons (Some guy via ICQ actually did ask for lessons, really!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've never had anyone bluntly proposition me on EQ yet -- and I'd know what to tell them if they did, but have had lots of folks try this via ICQ.

<br>
Absolutely. Regardless of their reasoning : RP, creative, just plain horny -- I am in no position to judge on how anyone spends his 12.95/month. <br>
<br>
I do, however, believe in discretion.  I don't personally care about hearing of your virtual threeway with the troll and the gnome... it is none of my concern. Likewise, should I choose to indulge, I would make my choices well. The only ones who would even know I had done it at all would be those directly involved. <br>
<br>
As far as mistells go .... I do have a rather prudish friend that I've known for a long time. It is quite fun to send him semi-explicit &quot;mistells&quot; in an attempt to get him to lighten up if he's had a pissy day. <br>
<br>
I'm so infamous for my horrible mistells -- often for quite a bit of time where I don't even notice -- that it would be a mistake for me to cyber constantly. I tend to babble to anyone who sends me so much as a &quot;Hi,&quot; and would end up licking the ear -- of worse -- of everyone in Norrath. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So what if they want to cyber and stuff? Trakon seems to have zero tolerance to what he thinks is deviant behaviour.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
I think you're misinterpreting what he's saying.  I didn't see that he was calling them deviant and he didn't seem to have zero tolerance.  He was just saying that 1. it's kind of sad to see people who send random requests for cyber to total strangers and don't even have the bravery to say it's for themselves; and 2. if you're hunting with him, he doesn't want you to be distracted cybering.<br>
<br>
The first is perhaps somewhat harsh, though personally I have to agree - that's just sad and desperate.  The second, he's only speaking for himself alone - and quite within his rights to say &quot;don't group with me if you're cybering&quot; He's not saying &quot;nobody should group with anybody if you're cybering&quot;.  Just don't group with him.  Fair enough.  If I'm grouping with people I'd certainly expect their minds to be on the hunt at hand, I don't think that's unfair for him to request.  And if there's down time, I'd rather group with someone who exchanges chat amongst the group and gets to know people, rather than talking to someone whose mind is miles away and doesn't say a word.  Trakon's got the right to say he who he wants and does not want to group with.  He's not saying who anybody else can group with.  You're out of line calling him a &quot;I-am-holy-and-always-right-person&quot;. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
I understand the concept of cybering, and understand why some people might enjoy it. I'm not that dense. I have nothing against anyone who does it, either implicitly or explicitly. It's like other people's RL sex lives : if it doesn't involve or affect me directly, it's none of my business. <br>

Just don't do it in my group while we're hunting. <br>

Guess what. If you send random tells for cyber to people you don't know, you are in fact a loser.  You can't even score with people you merely know virtually. <br>
<br>
If you don't know enough people that engage in cybering that you are forced to approach random Joes and Janes on FV, you need to get your ass to a chat room or something to where they cater to things such as this. AOL perhaps ? <br>

Deviant behavior?  I am not judging people that cyber at all.  I was laughing my ass off at the mistell and thought it was funny.

You think I am preaching about how great my life is because I referenced I had a girlfriend?  The only reason I brought that up was to discuss how I play EQ.  Does that mean any time someone mentions that they are married or have a girlfriend that they are trying to preach about how great their life is.  Preaching to the message board?  Sending someone an unwelcome tell for cyb0rz (and pretending it is for a friend) is a sad act in my, and many other's, opinion.   <br>

See, that's just it.  There should have been zero deaths in the group.  However, our enchanter died and a wizard died shortly thereafter from a razor that was returning to the camp.  If each of the groupmates would have been prepared and ready, neither of the deaths would have happened.<br>

Now, if you want to /emote your actions, I don't don't personally have a problem with that, but other people might; after all, the game isn't labeled with a Mature Content rating. Hence, out of respect for those less liberal, or mature, among your fellow players, I would suggest you keep all such actions to /tells. Besides, unless your virtual partner is an exhibitionist, (s)he may well feel much more comfortable that way, and thus be willing to act with greater freedom--and how could that possibly be a bad thing, eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for, ah, fully expressing your passion while hunting with people apart from your partner(s), that annoys me. If I group with someone, I do so expecting a certain modicum of performance (no pun intended) out of that player. That doesn't solely pertain to cyber sex, mind you: if, for whatever reason, you can't keep your mind on the game, then don't join an XP party; your fellow players are there to gain as much XP as possible in as short a time as possible, and perhaps to enjoy a bit of roleplaying, too; if you don't do your part in those regards, you aren't pulling your weight. At least that is how I see things.<br>
