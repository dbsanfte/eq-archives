Her eyes, pools of silver, scan the room as she waits for a moment to speak. Her voice is a deep, sonorous, commanding tone, perhaps more applicable to a follower of the Art.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Look around. Go on; look at those around you. See the Trolls and Frogloks drinking ale together in the corner. Note well the Koada'Dal priest nipping the neck of his Teir'Dal priestess. Eye the followers of Bertoxxulous chatting quaintly with the warriors of Tunare.<br>
<br>
Now, open your eyes and truly see. Feel the fear inside them all. Visualize the betrayal, the self-loathing, the deception, and the failure of ethics that causes all of these weaklings to betray themselves for the sake of their own power.<br>
<br>
Oh, yes, children, all here is a game, a game of power, which in the end has no rules. And why is this? Because there are really two worlds -- one material, and one spiritual. All you who touch the latter know of what I speak. The world was split long ago by the beings of power some of you might call the &quot;Pantheon,&quot; because they couldn't stand to remain in the presence of their worthless, evil creations who couldn't hold to their own paths, much less the paths set out for them from above.<br>
<br>
Shunned, the demons -- oh, aye, which we all are -- sought power over each other and over creation itself. Why? Because they're filled with hatred. For what? For their banishment from the pure unadulterated truth of the spiritual. And it's this hatred that's created the wars of our fathers, the sins of our daughters, and the deaths of our sons.<br>
<br>
I don't propose peace. I don't propose war. Both are tools of the evil stench that infests the material. No, I propose an end to everything -- not out of hate, nor righteous indignation, but out of love. I love Norrath -- I love you all -- so much because you hate yourselves. And as a loving one oft must take the hardest path to save those she loves, it is by my hand that I will see this material plane overthrown, broken, and destroyed. <br>
<br>
Death and the perfect love of annihilation await us all. I hear even now that the &quot;gods&quot; plan to wipe their twisted creation away with the purity of their purpose. While I hold no faith in any &quot;god,&quot; I appreciate that these entities know enough to cast down their inherently flawed creation.<br>
<br>
Do I hold myself above any of you? No, I don't. I, like you, am a creation of this wicked place. I, like you, am a force of evil. But I have seen the truth, and by my hand death will be brought into this world to purify it.<br>
<br>
I am Hakaisya -- the Destroyer. As in the Destroyer of Worlds. Fight against me if you will. Join me if you see the truth of my cause. Some of you will join me inadvertently in your pursuit of power; while I pity you and your misguided beliefs, every time you slay, you strengthen my cause.<br>
<br>
In the end, I, and those who stand with me, will watch the end, as the stars fade into eternal darkness, and we will be laughing as annihilation embraces us as well.<br>

After some time, he had come back, hoping to enjoy an ale in silence, to reflect on what had occured in his life since his last time here. He closed his eyes, enjoying the smell of the ale. The pugnet scent crawling up in his nose as he took a long pull from the mug. <br>
<br>
Then, his nice, quiet time in the tavern was shatterd. His steel grey eyes, locked onto the half elven woman as she spoke. A deep sigh escaped his lips as she started to spout more inane drible. As the woman finaly goes silent and steps back, Zaith rests his arm on the hilt of Tranquility, his eyes locking into hers*<br>
<br>
So, instead of preaching war or peace, you are preaching total destuction? <br>
<br>
*Zaith smirks softly*<br>
<br>
Lady...Hakaisya , was it? The Destroyer. <br>
<br>
It matters not how strong your faith in the destruction of Norrath may be, it wont happen. You are so full of fire, vigor and rage for your cause. This world is the way it is because there are those who do not care for what thier Gods teach or thier forfathers taught. The Gods make no effort to come and set us straight. Innoruuk cares not if his darkest sons and daughters have thier way with followers of Tunare. Cazic Thule does not come forth and smite us down because the Iksar marry those who destroyed thier lands. <br>
<br>
No one, mortal or God, care for what occurs on this world. <br>
<br>
*Zaith points a gauntleted finger at the woman*<br>
<br>
You claim to love us. And because of that love, you shall see us all destroyed. Such a flawed thought. You love no one here. Mayhap that is why you seek the destruction of the world. You hate everyone. For those who love, do not wish total and complete annihilation for those they claim to love. Only those who hate would seek desctrution. <br>
<br>
*Zaith takes a long drink from his ale and glances over her armor*<br>
<br>
Your colors already fit the Crimson Tear. Mayhap you should go and join Rebelle and his ilk in the Lust. They seek a grand war, mayhap you could try and destroy us all that way..<br>
<br>

<br>
Dear knight, you misunderstand me. Perhaps my words were too passionate, too inflammatory? <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She shrugs slightly, her smile brightening somewhat.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> That's because I'm just so passionate about the truth, love.<br>
<br>
It's a simple matter that this world, and all in it, are tainted, evil, and impure. That's why you have entities like the Lust for Blood, or even the Knighthood of Mithaniel Marr. Both are filled with such hate! They seek to kill and destroy those who fit their definition &quot;evil&quot; without really seeing that their struggle is in vain and silly; everyone here is evil. Even I am filled with some &quot;hate,&quot; some desire to purge what is &quot;evil.&quot; I'm evil, you're evil, this tavern is evil. It's the birthright of having been born into this... prison. As I said, I don't hold myself above any others.<br>
<br>
So, yes, I do love all. I love some more than I love others, but I love everyone, and that is why I wish to gift them with the ultimate freedom, the unconditional love of the void. Then their souls will be free to return to the pure light of the spiritual, and their material forms will no longer tempt them and drag them into wickedness. All are pure; it's this world that's the problem.<br>
<br>
But I understand if this seems like hatred to you. If it makes you feel more secure in your bondage, you may see me as evil, a servitor of darkness and not the pure nihil. You will eventually glimpse the truth, though. Your eyes will open and you will feel free as a sword thrusts through you and drains the life from your body -- at least until the curse of this world drags you back, kicking and screaming. <br>
<br>
In the end, the warm embrace of death is all I seek to offer, to free us all from our cage.<br>

<br>
But I dont. Not everyone is evil. Lust, the Knighthood and the other factions are foolish, I do not disagree with you there. Everyone should be seeking a path to a inner peace, a tranquility. <br>
<br>
Yet they do not. Because it is thier right. We are born into this world with freedom of choice. We can all do what ever we want, when ever we wish. No one has the right to push any idea upon us. We are able to turn that idea away if we do not wish it. <br>
<br>
Much like yourself. You wish to push what you call..&quot;Ultimate freedom&quot; upon everyone else. That is pushing your views upon everyone else. Killing everyone solves nothing, it only causes more suffering. <br>

You seem to have much hate for one who professes to seek an inner peace, though, dear knight. Your eyes betray your hatred for me. When you are free, you will no longer suffer from such, as hate is a construct of the material.<br>

Dwarves, halflings, humans, Tier'Dal, Fier'Dal, Iksar, Ogre, Troll, Barbarian, Vah Shir, half elves, gnomes and erudites. I have cut down every class that has come before me. Death is part of life, as is coming back from that death. Tis a never ending cycle. One that the Gods granted us. <br>

*Zaith takes a long drink from his new ale and tilts his head to the side, looking at her closer*<br>
<br>
The truth? Your truth mayhap. But not mine. Nor Danys or many others in Norrath. The truth is such a hard thing to actually have. Do be honest, there is no real truth. It is in the eyes of the beholder. <br>
<br>
*Zaith smiles, his white teeth standing out from his dark skin*<br>
<br>
I hold no hate for you, child. I do not hate. I simply told you what would occur if you tried to harm those I care for. Tis the same for those I have slain. They wished to bring harm to me for what ever reason, what ever truth, they saw. Paladins, rogues, bards, necromancers and the rest. They all find a reason to look at me and see me as evil or a traitor. I am a Knight. Simple as that. I have more honor than most paladins I have met. <br>
<br>
And I say again. Come to harm anyone I care for, and you will taste Tranquility. <br>

To every fight, arguement, debate, there are two people to have agreed to have such.  There are nay any innocents.  To every truth, there are three sides.  Yers, mine, and what t'is.   This world hast been made by those who live with in it.  We are but what we choose to be.  Reality itself is but only the concensious of the masses.  Even the world that we cling to is but an Illusion created by our minds to explain that which we are unwilling to understand. Love, Hate, both but opposite sides of the same coin.  Too much of either is harmful.  Perfection is a lie, Balence does nay exisit.  We simply are. We twist, we turn, one moment black, the next white. We are the masters of our own destiny, and in the end, there is nay a fate then what we hast made for ourselves.  In the end, we are but shades of grey.<br>

I thank you for your compliment of my music, lady. I've spent much time practicing this most primal of arts.<br>
<br>
I must also commend you on your Sight. This so-called &quot;material plane&quot; is but a shared delusion to which we're all bound. And, aye, the opposite of love is not hate; it's apathy. Love and hate are one, and it takes very little to flip one to the other.<br>
<br>
It then only makes sense that I, brought into hate, should choose instead to love, and it makes sense that some would interpret my infinite love as the purest hate. Even my love, though, is infected by the disease of this world. I can not help but hate, even as I attempt to transcend it; this damned place forces it upon me as it does all of us.<br>
<br>
We are all shades of grey, but only so long as hatred lurks in our souls because of the split of the spiritual from the physical. Once our souls are freed to rise above, we will no longer hate. The love of the abyss will fill us all.<br>

The next ones on me M'lady,now whats this about destruction and death will bring peace to our lives? No M'lady, it causes more pain and suffering as Zaith said.Love and Hate were created because there would be nothing without them.If Good and Evil didn't exist there would nay be a Norrath nor would there be life itself.Good and Evil is the reason why the gods placed us on Norrath.<br>

Love, there is good -- &quot;light&quot; in the common parlance -- in this universe. It simply resides in the spiritual, not in the physical. It hides above and behind this world, in higher planes of existence, and the only way to achieve it in a pure way is to free one's soul through death. Any love that exists here is channeled from there and will always be tainted by the infection of evil. Annihilation, as one might suppose, is not the end; it's the beginning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She smirks.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Now, if I were to simply pass from this world forever, I would be unable to gift freedom unto others who wish it. Not to mention, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*giggle*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> it'd be more than a little selfish! I love all, and I wish them to understand and be free.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She next turns her attention to the other knight, the newcomer.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> If everything is destroyed, there can be nothing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>but</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> peace, dear knight. When the souls ascend, released from the cycle, they will be enraptured in pure light, the total opposite of the wickedness that infests this plane. And... hmm... if good and evil are so necessary to life, how do you explain those who remain neutral of such struggles?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Finally, she looks at Tammitha, pouting slightly at the fact that she's walked away.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Yes, my angel, I'd not want to bring enlightenment to those who don't want it, but I don't blind myself from the fact that I bring death to those who oppose me or seek to harm me -- or even those who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*snicker*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cry out for repose in their own way.

We all have our different beliefs and I believe that you,I,and everybody else that walks Norrath were put here for a reason.What that reason is,is unknown, but over time it will become clear and any belief can become real when that happens.Maybe you speak true words,maybe Zaith speaks true words,but it will all be shown soon enough.What reason do you think we were put here for?<br>
