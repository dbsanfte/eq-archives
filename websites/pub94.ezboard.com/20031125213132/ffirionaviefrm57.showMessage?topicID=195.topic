That's not that important. What is important is that today they were discussing something out of 'The Smoking Gun' newspaper (magazine?) discussing the lawsuit against and from Michael Jordon, over paying hush money to a woman he got pregnant but never coming through with the rest of the money.<br>
<br>
I don't know why, but the story really saddened (is that a word?) me, as I watch another hero fall. I grew up thinking that Michael Jordan was the best because not only was he a superstar basketball player, but was also a stand up citizen who gave back to his community and was just a hard working moral decent guy.<br>
<br>
They told stories this morning about how he claims that his wife is nothing more than Hired help who he married to boost his image, how he got this woman pregnant and didn't come through with the money, and who slept with countless women, boozing it up and gambling, etc etc. <br>
<br>
And another hero falls.<br>
<br>
People say that one of the problems of our generation is that we don't have any heroes. No one to look up to any more. My parents had great men and women like Martian Luther King, Jr, JFK (Who we have since found was't that great of a guy), and Jackie O. We have.. spiderman. And, since 9/11.. people can count Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and other public saftey workers amongst heroes. <br>
<br>
I don't know.. I'm just doing a lot of thinking this morning, and was wondering what you all thought about this subject. Is the day of the Hero over? Has the media become so profiecient as to show that every hero is nothing more than a person with big flaws, sometimes much greater than ourselves? Is that why we now look to the honest, hard working men and women of public service instead of the multi-millionares who all seem to live horrible lives of sin. <br>
<br>
I know this is going to mark me as a paraiah, but I actually liked watching this show this summer entitled American Idol. And one of the best things about it was this sweet, honest girl from Texas won the competition. She was so meek and caring, but when she got behind a microphone BAM God could she sing. Her soul poured forth enough to bring tears to people's eyes. And it made me happy that someone so nice and deserving won the contest. She, I thought, is really someone I want to be an Icon for the younger generation of today.<br>
<br>
But now.. I fear she will be absorbed into the life of 'hollywood'.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm rambling, but what do you all think? Have heroes gone to the wayside? Are they necessary? And, more importantly.. are they possible?<br>

Everything we believe in is challenged more than was the norm. We still have these old fashioned ideas of what heros should be, but in today's society, are these ideas really attainable? Everyone needs someone &quot;good&quot; to look up to, but that doesn't have to be someone famous. I would rather it be someone close to the person. Someone the person can actually get a chance to know. Instead of knowing only what the media flings at them, and having those views shattered when the media shows them for what they really are, humans. We all have flaws, big and little, but that doesn't mean You (the generic you), can't be a hero for someone else. <br>
<br>
 I don't think they have gone to the wayside, rather they are just in out of the way places. Where our heros used to be public figures, I think more and more they are becoming the &quot;guy/gal next door&quot;. People want to believe that we all have that certain &quot;heroic&quot; quality about themselves, and it<br>
s easier to see in someone who is not so famous as to be &quot;unattainable&quot;.<br>

WTF did Michael Jordan ever do to deserve the title of &quot;hero&quot;. Um, so he can play basketball really well. BIG DEAL! There's lots of people who can play basketball really well... but they arent called &quot;hero&quot;. I'll even give it to you that he very well might be the BEST there ever was when it comes to basketball, but that doesnt make him a damn hero. Idol maybe, but hero, no freaking way.<br>
<br>
Im currious as to when exactly the word &quot;hero&quot; changed from ...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1 a : a mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability b : an illustrious warrior c : a man admired for his achievements and noble qualities d : one that shows great courage<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
to anyone and everyone who happened to be in the right place at the right time?<br>
For example, and I know im going to hit really close but i want you to think about it objectively... the people who survived 9/11 are not heroes. They did nothing heroic. They survived. There is nothing even remotly heroic about being in the right place at the right time to get out of harms way. Now, I am not saying the firefighters and police and ems and the people who helped SAVE those trapped people arent heros, they obviously display heroic qualities by being brave (showing courage) and had noble qualities. That is not in question. But random secretary_01 who was on the first floor by the door and ran outside to see what happened is NOT a hero. <br>
And random joe_01 who survived when a tornado flipped his trailor is also NOT a hero. The guy who runs in and saves a baby from a burning building is a hero. <br>
You're NOT a hero because you survive something, you get your own special word for that.... you're a suvivor!<br>
<br>
Im so annoyed with todays liberal use of the word hero, the meaning of the world is being cheapend and lessened to the extent that hero could mean person.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> In Perfect Hate, and Perfect Faith</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

I saw Michael Jordan as a hero because definition #3. A man admired for his achievements and noble qualities. <br>
<br>
He played basketball so well he revolutioized the sport. He was the standard others were set against. To watch him was magic, and he rarely failed to please. There are his achievements. Noble Qualities? That is what I am talking about. He had them at that point. Before this morning I thought he was one of the good ones. He was happily married, three kids, loving father, etc. Someone to look up to. He never cussed, he gave to charity, he did service work.. etc. He was probably even more noble standing next to a whining pippin and wedding-dress wearing Rodman. <br>
<br>
That.. by your definition.. is why I saw him as a hero. Someone who was given a spectacular gift and used it well, to the betterment of himself and others.<br>
<br>
On to the other half of your argument.<br>
<br>
I never said 'random secretary' was a hero. I said the Police officers and Fire Fighters of 9/11 were heroes. We agree on that. I have never heard anyone calling 'random Secretary' a hero. To do so would cheapen the word.. it would soften the effect of the men and women on the plane who fought back against the terrorists and ultimately ended up in a field in Penn. It would sanitize the Police officer running against the flow to go back into the building.<br>
<br>
I am probably as liberal as the come. And I don't see anyone labeling 'random-joe_01' who's house got turned over a hero. A survivor.. maybe. .. a lucky mofo.. almost definately. But not a hero.<br>

As the Michael Jordan hero thing, thank you for clarifying it. I can see the justification for you calling him a hero based on what you said... im not even a little bit of a sports fan, unless you count the two times a year I watch football... superbowl (for the commericals of course) and the Ohio State Michigan game ('cause Michigan sucks! go buckeyes) anyway... I wouldnt call him a hero, but Im glad that you found qualities in him to respect, and im sorry you lost some of that respect today.<br>
I have just found in the last few years that the media is getting their nouns messed up and are confusing Hero with Surivior, and its really on my nerves. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> In Perfect Hate, and Perfect Faith</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Michael Jordan isn't a hero, he's a guy that can play some damn good basketball.  Any charitable donations he gave, obviously weren't made anonomously, he did it for the  exposure.  He wanted people to pay more attention to him, and a fraction of his massive amounts of income was worth it.<br>
<br>
Now, Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron were heroes.  Both received death threats and the like for doing something they enjoyed.  Sure, they were getting paid to play baseball, but not the rediculous salaries offered now, and they sure as hell didn't fly around on private jets from game to game.<br>
<br>
Celebrities can kiss my ass, I'm not one to worship someone else just because they wrote some crappy ass music, or were in a few movies.<br>
<br>
The Police and Firemen and the like are the only hero's left in the world.  There's no room for anyone else, save your random Joe Schmoe who saves someone elses ass out of just being a decent human being.<br>

<br>
the mass media that is force feed to us everyday and they dont care about anyone its about, money and power. we were taught is school when we were little kids to help others and even though they didnt believe it themselves doesnt mean we shouldnt try. screw everyone that only wants hate and pain to others in exchange for their own gain. there is no one to fight them, they tell u only what they want u to know. its just our job to filter the poo they spew. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=asotus007>Asotus007</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/24/02 10:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=195.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heroes</span><hr size=1> The reality is to many young people, especially guys, sports stars are heros.

He understood that people of color were not treated equally in this country ( something entirely lost on M.J. ) and worked to bring about change.

A hero is someone who excels to extraordinary stature, regardless of the medium he was in. Time after time, the man showed poise and confidently hit the shot to win the game. He shot a lot of shots, and missed a lot- but when the game (the big game usually) was on the line, he hit the shot.<br>
<br>
We are not a warring society. Sporting events is a major reason why. Much of our aggression as a society and culture is channeled into these sports and keeps us rather peaceful. <br>
<br>
But making the shot would just make Jordan a sub-culture legend. What made him a hero beyond the hardwood is the timing, in history, that he made his journey down the road to stardom. He is the small town boy, an African American in a still racially biased country, who pulled the sword from the stone and wielded it to strengthen the stance of his people in America. You see, it is not just the jumpshot that made him a legend- it's his grace, his poise, and his charming wit that endure the hearts of Americans and most the world. He stepped up to the challenge and succeeded- whereas no other has ever done before. Thus, he is a hero.<br>
<br>
I say this as an avid Magic Johnson fan. I will still contend that Magic is a better all around player than Jordan (Magic scored 42 after switching from point guard to center in the 82 Finals- his rookie season). But there is no denying Jordan's stature. Gatorade bit the bullet, put his face on a bottle, and he surpassed all expectations of his presence.<br>
<br>
And there are heroes in our day and age. <br>
Nelson Mandela stayed in jail for many years (2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  while fighting for apartheid, before being released and becoming president of South Africa- the first black one ever.<br>
<br>
There are many others, but I have to get back to work and cannot get into it too deep, but before I go:<br>
<br>
Consider modern explorers- cancer researchers, genome researchers<br>
Consider people giving up their lofty existences for peace- Jimmy Carter<br>
Consider people who use extremely limited resources to help others achieve- Jaime Escalante<br>
<br>
And there are many others, so do not despair. And don't forget that most heroes are not wholly realized until after their existence is reflected upon.<br>

And to millions of kids around the world, Michael Jordan IS a hero.  There is no truth more real than the beliefs inside the mind of a child.  Kids all around the world want to 'be like Mike'.  They don't watch the news for the most part, so they could care less about a court case involving His Airness.  They see the basketball, the smiles, the man in the nice suit, the tongue, the posters, the championships, the Magazine covers.  THAT is the reality for those who dream.  They completely overlook the moral side of his actions.  Just as your mother often overlooks your shortcomings.<br>
