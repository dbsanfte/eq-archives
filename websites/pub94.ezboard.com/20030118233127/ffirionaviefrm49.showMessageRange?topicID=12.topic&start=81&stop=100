i rember that day to clearly.  6 people in oasis on day 2 of sever /w<br>
nabikki, akane,heagan,reghar,rist,iryn<br>
<br>
kinda froget things like that. was really shitty tho cuz i could not speek gnomish to ask to join akane but i really doubt he would have let me any wase haha.  <br>
<br>
not to mention the scufle in hhk, with per fnf members such as auno and honeybear and a rogue named wingly.  then first people in runny eye to get armor and rist wanting to leave heagans body deep cuz rist fucked up. haha thats one of the few times ive seen heagan get man /chuckle.<br>
<br>
then you getting pissed at kahaveen and drus for getting in scuffle with fnf mebers of that day.  i rember heagan was blushing red when the arguemnt broke out in the pool room.<br>
<br>
oh now on to the topic.  zerging?<br>
<br>
well as most people know i have been in bolth resolution and fnf.  and i never really saw reso zerging so to speek.  nor did i see fnf zerging. point closed? hardly.....  all i have seen are two vastly differnt styles of running raids and guilds.  bad?  hardly just differnces of oppions.  to me when i think of zerging i think of lots people bound at zone with lots of bodes on ground.  the differnts in takgin KT with 50 and 30.. well just 20 people and perferace.  what would u have the other 20 people do IF you ONLY wanted to kill him with 30? sit on there ass in bizar and cause lag?  its hardly fari to ask people not to come to raid cuz we areldy have enough.  IMO<br>
<br>
now on a persionly note killing CT with so few was fun also killing KT with few was fun and mobs like that but there Are bigger fish to fry.  hell lets go kill emperor in Sshra with 30 eh? now that sounds like someting to brag about. but sadly for an avrag guild it takes two times that if not more. and if its a slopy guild it takes way more than 60.<br>

<br>
“Grats on buying gear with real life cash, doesn't make you any better at the game either.”<br>
<br>
Here Fuvi is plying the popular opinion of the message board (anti-Ebay) to achieve his goal:  buying gear = bad IF Kzan = buying gear THEN Kzan = bad.<br>
<br>
“If you want to talk about people buying gear should talk to Kzan, I've been on AS raids if they are buying gear they aren't spending the money well.<br>
<br>
There are signs that Stabbington is bought, he dies a lot on raids, then again so did Lolodory.”<br>
<br>
Then he attempts to feign ignorance to the, fairly well observed, instances of gear and toons being purchased by people he raids with.  Note the “IF they are buying gear” comment and the attempt to draw a correlation between Stabbington and Lolodory’s deaths with the implication that just because Stabbington dies a lot doesn’t mean he’s “bought”.<br>
<br>
Yet Fuvi uses the same process below to try to demonstrate that Kzan is a liar: <br>
<br>
“&gt;&gt; We might have done a 425 dain.<br>
<br>
This is the same lie, he knows very well they haven't.”<br>
<br>
What’s good for the goose apparently isn’t good for the gander….”IF they are buying gear”…<br>
<br>
Then Fuvi qualifies himself as being a &amp; b below:<br>
<br>
“(a) But mostly it was calling me a liar, I'm a lot of things, I'm not one of those…<br>
<br>
(b) Sleep easy Beornn, I'm not a hypocrite…”<br>
<br>
Now, does Fuvi really have no idea that the people he raids with have bought toons/gear?  Unlikely given that the majority of the server has a good idea of a few of the transactions that have gone on, and Fuvi is far from clueless.<br>
<br>
If he does know, and is using the “Kzan bought toons/gear so Kzan is bad” argument, then it’s pretty hypocritical to admonish someone for doing something that people you associat with have done as well.<br>
<br>
Likewise, given that Fuvi is drawing negativity to Kzan by attempting to ply the anti-Ebay sentiment of the FV community, it’s pretty hypocritical that he would use it against Kzan yet ignore it where some of Fuvi's associates are concerned.<br>
<br>
So is Fuvi lying about not knowing if his raid partners are doing something that he attacks Kzan for?  Or is he lying about implying that buying gear/toons is bad, given that his associates have done it and thus it must sit relatively okay with him, only to try to attack Kzan and make him look bad?<br>
<br>
But really, the only one who cares is Fuvi.<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt; Here Fuvi is plying the popular opinion of the message board (anti-Ebay) to achieve his goal: buying gear = bad IF Kzan = buying gear THEN Kzan = bad.<br>
<br>
Correct, if I'm going to take the time to flame the gimp I might as well bring this up to prevent the masses from posting oh Kzan is cool, he KEI'd me.  I'm surprised to find out Dalnin has been playing that long, snide comments tacked onto a thread with no content are generally posted by people who have no connection with the thread and are the posts that generally lead to name calling.  The correct correlation of this was Kzan bought a toon and gear for cash, treat him accordingly based on your views on EBay.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Note the “IF they are buying gear” comment and the attempt to draw a correlation between Stabbington and Lolodory’s deaths with the implication that just because Stabbington dies a lot doesn’t mean he’s “bought”.<br>
<br>
As far as I know they haven't bought any gear.  I'm sure you know less than me Kurley.  Stabbington is a purchased toon, I assumed anyone reading this would already be aware of that.  I then point out my main concern with puchased toon playing the class poorly, Stabbington is on a learning curve, something not unique to EBay'ed toons though.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; What’s good for the goose apparently isn’t good for the gander….”IF they are buying gear”…<br>
<br>
If they are buying gear, correct, what gear have they purchased?  You mean the Ry'gorr armor that was on Stabb?  I think Eldraed wields Greenmist so he wasn't completely stripped, I don't see that being from the AS bank, but Eldraed has gotten far more gear from AS than the purchase of Eldraed introduced to the guild.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Now, does Fuvi really have no idea that the people he raids with have bought toons/gear? Unlikely given that the majority of the server has a good idea of a few of the transactions that have gone on, and Fuvi is far from clueless.<br>
<br>
Correct, they bought toons, incorrect that they bought gear.  Thanks for the compliment though Kurley.  You have reached an incorrect conclusion however in your string of quotes, I'm not even concerned about buying gear.  I just brought this up to call attention to what I know will be viewed as a negative action by Kzan from many of the people that read this board.  Because of the actual facts I was given a beautiful opportunity to transition an AS buys gear quote and everyone hates AS and EBay and pointing out that Kzan buys gear where AS doesn't.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; If he does know, and is using the “Kzan bought toons/gear so Kzan is bad” argument, then it’s pretty hypocritical to admonish someone for doing something that people you associat with have done as well.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna quote this as well just to hammer into everyones mind that indeed Kzan buys gear.  I don't tell people what to think though, I just told them the truth.  If you want to read my thoughts on EBay they are on another thread, summarized I don't buy or sell personally but don't condemn people who do.  I'm well aware making people aware that Kzan buys things for cash does nothing to improve his image.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Likewise, given that Fuvi is drawing negativity to Kzan by attempting to ply the anti-Ebay sentiment of the FV community, it’s pretty hypocritical that he would use it against Kzan yet ignore it where some of Fuvi's associates are concerned.<br>
<br>
Stabbington posted on these boards that he was bought, Eldraed posted on these boards that he was bought, they did something and accept the consequences of their actions.  My concern with EBay is if you NEED a shortcut to get to 60 do you play enough to be effective raiding at 60.  Eldraed and Stabb both do, Stabb wasn't 60 when he was bought.  But yes I'm well aware of the general anger directed at those two and more than happy to have Kzan share that anger.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; So is Fuvi lying about not knowing if his raid partners are doing something that he attacks Kzan for? Or is he lying about implying that buying gear/toons is bad, given that his associates have done it and thus it must sit relatively okay with him, only to try to attack Kzan and make him look bad?<br>
<br>
Wow, Kurley should class B horror movies, he's good at finding plot where none exists.<br>
<br>
No I'm not lying when I say IF people in AS have bought gear, I don't believe they have.  No I didn't attack Kzan for it, just brought it to the attention of people who might attack him or atleast think less of him for it.  Stabb, Kaelzor and Eldraed are bought toons all 3 had crap for gear.  Kzan bought a very well equipped toon and has also bought gear directly.  Heagan started a post, not sure if it out-lasted the purge, I made references to Kzan buying a toon in that post, chuckling at Zsuzsana's vehemance against EBay and pointing out that not all character transfers occur through a public site.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; But really, the only one who cares is Fuvi.<br>
<br>
Thanks for coming to post Kurley you confirmed that Kzan has bought both a toon and gear through the lack of denial from his close personal friend.  You did this even though you don't care.<br>
<br>
KZAN IS A LIAR.<br>
<br>
Kurley is a spin-doctor, although I don't think he did a good job this time, Kzan should ask for his money back.  Kzan lied about a dozen times in that post, you admit Kzan was lying but say I was lying as well and make no mention of the other 11 lies.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, you can't defend Kzan because all I did was post the truth, his habit of lying, his lack of skill at the game and his spending habits are all fact.  So your spin doctoring was trying to get the topic off Kzan.<br>
<br>
Correct Vulrath, if you wanted to post I think FaF is the bestest because I got a corpse summon from Cuku once it has nothing whatsoever to do with the thread, go make the post in Kudos instead.  There are a few people who have raided with both FaF and Reso, I'm one of them and relative to the number of people who come to the board a small number of people who have raided in either guild.  Your opinions would only be based on what you heard and read and would lack any conviction.<br>

<br>
I guess I haven't been paying much attention to the headlines lately, so I could be wrong.  But I think Kzan bought a set of abilities, the gear was kind of trivial (though the epic enhances the abilities, granted).<br>

But, yes, Aary is definitely much more tactical, which is why I rate her harder.  It requires more skill as a group to do her.  IMHO, if you can kill Aary, your guild either has the skills needed to kill anything in NTOV or at least has the ability to learn them quickly through experimentation.  Fuvi seemed to be implying that if you could kill 425 Dain, you can kill Aary and all of NTOV.  I agree that you have the DPS for it, but I don't agree that 425 Dain implies you have the skill, discipline, or temperment for NTOV.  <br>
<br>
Dain is not tactical.  Dain is one of those MOBs I would feel good about success leading even an open raid of relatively unskilled raid-newbies (assuming they're 60 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  He's just &quot;buff up&quot;, &quot;stand here&quot;, &quot;pin here&quot;, &quot;CH chain on MT&quot;, etc. etc..  All of that is fairly easily taught in one raid (well, assuming the clerics know how to do a CH chain).  Aary has a lot more details and timing issues that mean a little mistake by one person can move it from a rez-CR to a coffin-CR.  Basically, Aary offers far more chances and harsher CR for a fuckup.  I rate grouping and raiding skills as harder to acquire than DPS.  That's why I rate her harder.<br>
<br>
As for the other things, all I can say is wow.  Fuvi, I'm not your enemy, I was just offering you the view of what your post looked like from the outside.  You're rabid and foaming.  Go get your shots or something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fuvi>Fuvi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/12/02 11:13:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'm here to inform</span><hr size=1> Vindicator killed with 6, Cazic Thule killed with 18, about as meaningful as the N ToV with 24.  People like myself not only wanted to see that but be part of it, but the most skilled and frequent players on the server were neutered by a leader afraid of his own shadow who is motivated purely by loot.<br>
<br>
Killing Gorenaire was awesome because it had great drops, Fire and Farming, some people aren't primarily motivated by loot and next problem is people who are motivated by loot only show up for the mobs that drop loot for them.<br>
<br>
Ya WWX, you're kind of out of the loop Kzan bought Gwenlynn, you kind of spoiled too much info so I'll add in the name to protect the rep of the other 2 epic lvl 60 bards on the server (don't think Lyricat or either ES Virtuoso has epic), it's going to be a wedding present for Kurley, oops spoiled that surprise too.  That would compare to the purchase of Eldraed.<br>
<br>
But you see Kzan paid cash to get gear for himself as well.  Oh you didn't know that, ya I guess that's why you shouldn't post because you don't know what's going on.  If we have a thread on account sharing in AS and how they are evil and violate the EULA you can chip in and explain the reasons account sharing is valid.  If there is a post you know nothing about probably best not to reply, you can assume Kzan or Kurley would reply if my base accusation was false.<br>
<br>
Bjond, Aary is really simple once you've killed him a couple of times it would require something fairly severe to fail on him.  Because trying a mob even if you fail is the most effective way to learn.  If you get a stretch of bad luck on interrupted heals against Vyemm the 24 man N ToV force is dead.  The 24 man force will kill Aary every single time.<br>
<br>
Dain 425 is not that hard but your open raid CHeal chain force will die, yes I realize elite temple guards almost hit for as much as 425 Dain and more than 350 Dain and are also unslowable but Rampage and Banish and a lot more hp makes it a fairly difficult fight.  Aary is won as soon as MT has aggro and Turgurs is on, Dain is won when he's a corpse with his feet sticking out of the wall.<br>
<br>
FaF is 0/1 on Aary, 1/3 on Eashen/Ikitiar the 3 on 1/3 is because Bako/Cap is a coward who likes to look at past accomplishments like old bowling trophies rather than trying things that might mean dying, might also mean having fun, not sure which he's more scared of, the 1 on 1/3 is because of Kzan.<br>
<br>
KZAN IS A LIAR.

I have 7 characters here on FV (2 chars came back from legends).  They are all 50 plus. most of them 60.  I run them from 2 workstations if I have to, but usually just 4 at a time. I use dragon naturally speaking and hotkeys.<br>
<br>
I own at least 3 fungi tunics. Rollen if you saw a lower level twink in Fungi etc running around a month ago that was probably one of my guys. Don't think he was tagged yet though.<br>
<br>
Through some inventions / concepts I have created I have gotten some nice checks recently. I have spent close to 3k u.s. on gear and charaters in the last 3 months for EQ. I wont say which guilds my twinsk are in, but they are spread out through the different guilds here on FV. Alot of the times I just put them in trader mode and go &quot;afk&quot; to monitor guild chat in the different guilds. Info &gt; all.<br>

There you have it. Or am I lying?<br>
