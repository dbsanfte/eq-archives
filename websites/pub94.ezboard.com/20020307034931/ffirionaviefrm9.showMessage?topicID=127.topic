<br>
So here it is.  No grammar/spelling comments are needed I know I can't spell worth a darn =)  I can add like nobodies business though =/<br>

<br>
Role-playing Guide v1.0<br>
by Gozar <br>
<br>
Real life reflection or invented persona?<br>
The first thing I would think you have to decide is if you want your character to be you.  Many of us in game take what we know about someone in game and try and psychoanalyze who the RL person is.  This seems to work on other servers but maybe on FV it's not a good idea.  If you have yet to really interact with people on FV be sure to keep that in mind when you do.  Is the RPer doing a good job to hide his/her true self or are you seeing their true colors?<br>
<br>
Stats or RP:<br>
At some point you are going to have to make a choice about items.  The best item may not be the best item for you.  Do you really want to run around holding a dirty smelly disease infested paw of opalla?  How important is that to you?  Your story is going to affect some of these choices.  The rich cleric who's father is a council member will probably stay dressed in Gold platemail rather then wearing leather (gator legs) or a red tunic (bs tunic).  You may give up a head piece just so people can see your hair style.  Maybe you can keep those items in a bag and when you get into a group for just exp purposes you can put those one =)   or maybe you want to RP 100% of the time.  It's up to you isn't it...<br>
<br>
Morales:<br>
This is a strong characteristic that I think is important.  Maybe it's time you looked at your /alignment and picked one.   Learn what your alignment means and develop your characters actions around that.  IF you are orderly try and be more orderly.  If people around you are acting chaotic.. through a fit =)   Keep in mind that you may limit yourself to who you can group with.  And who says you can't be whatever alignment you want and act totally different.  /alignment is just a mechanical burden you can be whoever you want.<br>
<br>
Family Background:<br>
Develop names for your parents.  What do they do?  Are they alive?  Perhaps they are one of the merchants in Freeport? or maybe you are the son of the Rivervale Mayor?  Once you know who your parents are maybe you can better understand who you are?  Are your parents rich?  Are you spoiled?  How did your parents affect who you are?<br>
<br>
<br>
 Social Status:<br>
  Who are you socially?  Do you come from a well known background in your home town?  Are you the son/daughter of a shoemaker?  Should you know how to tailor then?  How does social status affect you attitude?  Are you being realistic about your story and the way you talk?  The son of a shoemaker would probably not run around saying things like &quot;Greetings traveler, wouldst thou like to buy a ...&quot;  Heck I dont' know.. maybe they would. =)  Dialect is in the last section.<br>
<br>
 Wealth and poverty:<br>
  Is your family rich or poor?  Is it important to you to look the best?  at what point are you going to give up your shiny gold Breast plate for a tunic soaked in blood.  Think about it.  who walks around in a tunic soaked in blood (referring to the blood stained tunic that most clerics prefer because of the wisdom).<br>
  <br>
<br>
Age:<br>
how old is your character? do you act that way?  Are you a veteran eq player playing a young new character and you know to much?  Maybe you should think about what you do and don't know and roll with it.  Don't know so much about everything in the game.  Pick your age and stick to it.  Know only what you have done on Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
<br>
Life goal:<br>
Do you have a life goal for your character?  Do you have a reason to level or are you just leveling cause you have nothing better to do?<br>
Some possible life goals could be:<br>
Revenge, <br>
To defeat a certain dragon, <br>
To meet Tunare in person?   <br>
To become a master .<br>
<br>
RL friends as Relatives:<br>
Do you have relatives in the game?  Can you collaborate your character with your friends and become relatives?  Maybe you are human and your RL friend is a half elf.  maybe you can be relatives?  maybe your mother died in a war and your father took a new wife or vice versa.<br>
<br>
Justify who you are:<br>
Can you justify the characters you group with?  Do you group with other races?  Why do you group with them.. How did you meet?  Do you know enough about their Persona to talk about them in 3rd person? (i.e.  Don't mind  he can be a jerk sometimes)<br>
<br>
<br>
Develop your Dialect:<br>
One you decide who you are and where you come from you need to learn how to talk.  Even in the old days in England people talked a lot different based on all the items above.  Someone in London might have said &quot;Good day to you sir&quot; while someone in the outskirts may have just said &quot;Well hey there pal&quot;.  <br>
Since EQ is fictional you might need to consult some books to find the way you want to talk.  I for one have a problem with this section.  But hey since my characters are human I should be ok =)<br>
<br>
Body language:<br>
make some hotkeys.  Lets see some more /shrugs /giggles and /salutes out there..  Integrate them with your speech.  IF someone says something funny  /laugh .  If someone compliments you on an item or the way you fight give them a /blush<br>
Note: You can find all the emotes in game by entering  &quot;/help emote&quot;<br>
Most people I meet already do this but hey this is a guide it's not FOR most people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please reply with ideas you have to help people create their persona.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. - Since it does look strange that a person with the guildname Iron monkey would make a RP guide I figured I would add this note. Our guildname was created before this server and before that movie came out.   Our guild is really organized at fighting and we are very particular about the way we do things.  Kind of like kungfu... so well.. it's a fun name and we like it. Not to mention that movie was just a play off the original Iron Monkey move in the 70s.<br>

Be Flexible, in your roleplaying. I don't mean make your character be flexible, many are not.  I mean as controller of this character, if something's going on that you didn't expect, or...I'm not very good with words, so bear with me on this.<br>
<br>
All I'm saying is this. your character's journey through the game is that character's life.  Things happen that your character can't control, or didn't plan for.  This, to me, is some of the beauty of roleplaying, the not always knowing how any given conversation, or encounter may turn out. Obviously, this is not always....erm, feasible.  But when something unexpected happens, something you didn't plan for,roll with it, as your character would, which means, of course, getting to know your character at least a little. <br>
And remember, this is supposed to be fun.*Smile*<br>

<br>
Unexpected encounters in the game can do more for your character development than all the pre-conceived ideas you had about your character to begin with.  Your current storyline, Sarhea, reminds me somewhat of some storylines I had going on on my old server.  Reminds me a lot, actually.  Just as in RL things happen to us that we couldn't have imagined, that change us sometimes, the same happens in the game.  You (not you Sarhea, but &quot;you&quot; in general) might think your character is a pure evil type who can never feel pity or love or any &quot;light&quot; emotions, or a pure goody two-shoes who would never under any circumstances have anything to do with a dark elf, and then you meet someone or you find yourself in a situation where you feel your character changing from what you thought they were.  And that's when RP is best, when you're that in tune with your character that you feel them changing in a way you couldn't have predicted.<br>

Afterall &quot;role playing&quot; is picking a &quot;role&quot; and playing it.   Although Norrath is a fictional world it's very similar to RL.  There are towns, stores and social structures (kings, mayors).<br>
<br>
It's a rich environment and for those that might want to pull them selfs a little deeper into that environment this guide is for you.  The guide is probably a joke for veteran RPers, but hey if I want to waste my  time typing that's my business =) <p>Gozar<br>

I'm not always that organized about it though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I usually start with a personality concept and work out the background details later.  Most of the time I end up &quot;discovering&quot; something about the character I never knew, which probably sounds crazy since the character was my creation to begin with, but any author will tell you characters start to take on a life of their own.  Like Gio's penchant for saving absolutely everything she can from whatever she kills and using it all, whether it's ruined pelts for patchwork or snake scales for bog juice or wolf meat for beer braised wolf.  I didn't know why she did this and then one day I realized, it was because she doesn't come from a rich family, she grew up in the slums of Freeport and had to make do with whatever she had, make her own armor and food and drink and everything, so it was important that nothing go to waste.  If you want to be really organized about it it's good to know all those things from the beginning (or if you think someone else is going to ask you about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), but sometimes you can just start with the basic concept and fill in the details later. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usliver123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sliver123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/01 5:56:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=127.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Roleplaying Guide</span><hr size=1> RP isn't as hard as people think.
