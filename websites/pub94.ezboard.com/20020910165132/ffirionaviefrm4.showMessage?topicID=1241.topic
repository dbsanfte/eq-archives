If I wanted to play a whatever, then by golly, I would have rolled me up a whatever.  <br>    But having said that, I have in all likelihood played a whatever.  I have played most classes up to 15, and some up to 30.   Not enough to make me a master, of course, but enough to have a begining of an inkling.  I think the only classes I haven't played are rogue and druid (druid was played up till level 6, my very first character.  Then I overheard a conversation in Kelethin that included the quote &quot;Dude, over 85% of the people here now are druids!, and a /who showed he was right.  Ugh.  We don't need any more of )those_! )  If you're a snare capable class (this means necros and SK's too) and you aren't snaring the run-aways, I am going to complain about it.  <br>    And what about the level 20 wizard that goes full burn at the begining of fight, gets agro, and then dies as I go oom trying to heal him?  I'm no wizard now, but I do know that it would be much better if they would hold off nuking this the mob was _at least_ half dead.  What about the shaman that isn't using slows?  Or that throws an unasked for strength buff on me, the cleric, in the middle of tough fight, when all are low on mana and hitpoints?<br>   Sometimes, not giving hints is alot worse than just hopping that they will magically figure things out on their own.<br>   Btw, if any of group with me,  please tell me if I am doing something obviously wrong.  But don't bitch if I get up and take a few swipes at the mob... Chances are great that I'm at full mana, and either no one needs any healing yet, or it is too early for me to heal without drawing agro. <p>-- <br>The Council of Mithril Dreams <br> <br>Teapray Oogrog <br>An Elven Cleric in the Service of Tunare for 31 seasons <br>Wife to Lenny the Traveling Ogre <br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 690<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/18/02 2:48:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1241.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lecturing others about their class</span><hr size=1> What I love are the people that tell you how to play your class and claim they know because they have a '54 bard on Drinal' or something similar.

It might also have made sense if I hadn't previously figured out that the elementals being cast on partially resisted Expel Summoned, meaning sometimes it would do 30 points of damage, sometimes 131.

If I hadn't already thought of using my anti-Summoned spells, and hadn't already tried them more than three or four times and found them less efficient, this person's &quot;advice&quot; (read: rant) would have been helpful.  However, this person was just wrong, and when I pointed that out and explained why Firestrike was a better choice, instead of apologizing, this person said I was the one being rude. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>-Monique Wittig, "The Straight Mind"<BR>andersonrob@earthlink.net<BR>http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/index.html<BR>AIM: RWAnderson<BR>ICQ: 43988595<BR>EverQuest: Lasgalen Lothir of Lux Aeternam, Firiona Vie server<BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A> at: 8/18/02 5:35:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unakath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nakath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/19/02 12:37:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1241.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lecturing others about their class</span><hr size=1> Personal favorite:<br>-note- at the time they asked me this, they were higher level than me, of the same class, and I was not /role or /anon (so they knew what level I was)<br><br>&quot;Why aren't you using X spell?

If - after thought - you are convinced they are wrong, and wrong enough to endanger others, then you really have to mention it. Done politely and sensitively there should be no offense taken. <br><br>Some examples that I have seen:<br><br>Paladin as main tank stepping back from the fight to cast heals when there is a cleric in the group.<br><br>Paladin not using stun on casters.<br><br>Warrior as main tank failing to hold aggro from using a high damage but slow weapon instead of dual-wielding.<br><br>People trying to use Stun on Giants.<br><br>And of course the bane of every enchanter's life. People who cannot use /assist. Or work with mezz in general<br><br>This last is one of the most obvious causes of lecturing. For the enchanter someone breaking mezz is more than a waste of mana, it can be immediate death. They can either tell the group how to do it nicely or they can screech in capitals. Either way they get to the point of the group learning how to work with them or they use their other spells instead, or disband - to the detriment of all. <br><br>I guess what I am saying is it is better to &quot;discuss tactics&quot; than lecture someone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulexxiclockwork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lexxi Clockwork</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/19/02 8:19:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1241.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Lecturing others about their class</span><hr size=1>      When I see someone doing something very wrong in a group I always wait until after the current fight.

No one is there to teach the character or the player &amp; most muddle through in the dark.<br><br>Recently I was grouping with a bard and I -had- played a bard to 23 on another server but a few months ago and haven't followed it since.  I frankly don't remember what level gets what song (&amp; frankly could care less).  However, I do remember a few things I used to use/do when I played bard but I know I wasn't the be and end all of bards.  Anyway, disclaimer aside, I was grouping with a -young- bard and a rogue.  The rogue was physically sitting in the same room with me (great way to learn another class without playing it is to play in the same room with someone playing it, grouped with that person) so we could (&amp; do) exchange the OOC comments verbally (IC is all in type).  There were a couple times I asked the bard about specific songs, but tried always to word it as &quot;if you happen to have thus &amp; so, I would love to hear it&quot; (the main one for that was the mana song while we were in downtime, since I was the healer and the tank &amp; rangers aren't exactly the most efficient at either).  She told me she didn't have it which puzzled me since I -thought- I had it an earlier level than she was.  But I said nothing more on it.  Next time I was grouped with her... she did have it which was helpful for the wizard and druid in that group.  I then realised prior to us grouping the previous night, she had been mostly soloing (comments about XP gain also indicated that as well), so she just needs time to adjust to the difference in a group.<br><br>For myself... I really hate it when healers get annoyed that I self-heal.  I know my light healing is not uber, but it's keeping the healers mana on the main tank or at least letting them maximise it a bit better.  Plus I hate seeing my mana bar at full when we start the med downtime.  I have even tried to tell the healer that I can help on the bubble or less down heals while they start their med.  Some are grateful, others have been a bit.. well... regard a ranger as nothing more than a weak warrior who bleeds a lot.  Now that I have made 30 (just did last night.. with barely a sliver of blue in *laugh*), I will have a few decent buffs and a couple DOTs, so I might not feel like my mana is totally useless in a group with a healer.<br><br>Anyway....<br>I'm rambling... it's Monday morning, I haven't had enough caffiene and stayed up too late getting the last of the XP for the ding.<br><br>-Caillou (&amp; her player)<br>&lt;Saga&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udinaekgroffgar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinaek Groffgar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/19/02 10:19:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1241.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Lecturing others about their class</span><hr size=1> I have to agree about the higher level of the same class asking you &quot;why aren't you casting xyz spell?&quot;...<br><br>I had a druid constantly asking me why I was using Ignite instead of Careless Lightning..<br><br>Well maybe because I am a 17 druid and I don't get that spell until 19..<br>------<br><br>Also yesterday was in a group at bandit #2 in Paludal.

It's not a matter of fair or should, it's just how people behave.  The number of people that like to fight is very very small (the number that like to win fights is a lot larger, but they don't necessary like fighting, just winning).  It's obvious Robin is one of those &quot;likes to fight&quot; types.  His posts vary from incendiary on down to provacative.  They're always well written, but they're never tame.  Most people probably don't relate to this and likely just see him as a troublemaker.  People view you (Tzaroth) the same way, but you're more ham-handed and personal in terms of writing style and thus get a lot more kickback.<br><br>This is all opinion, but any care to bet I get replies from both Robin and Tza arguing about it?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1241.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1241.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1241.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1241.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1241.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1241.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
