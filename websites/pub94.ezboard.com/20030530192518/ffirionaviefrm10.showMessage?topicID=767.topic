Lots of it. Hate Gore? Don't read. Minimal Language. Also not some of my best work, the story might be a bit.. lame))<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;It is not enought to defeat the enemy. True victory is attained by the true cruel destruction of your foes!&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
.....It had been a long time.....<br>
<br>
 Within the Mountains of Rathe.. their rests an outpost. Hidden behind the mountain on which the great evil spinx flew, hovering above the ground and watching the world from his Mountain, swarming with Drakes.<br>
<br>
Below, a battle was ensuing already. Shintou had spotted the Emerald Drake of the Mountains, the Priest Drake in which he needed to gain the spine of to assist him in completing the quest, given to him by one of the Plaugebringers in Qeynos. He needed to complete this quest for Duriek.. and assisting Duriek would grant him a weapon of grand power.<br>
<br>
A weapon he needed greatly if he was going to defeat those that have turned their back on darkness.<br>
<br>
The battle was short, two parties from the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>League of Shadows</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was all that was needed, the drake fell to their combined blades, dying with a pitiful screech.<br>
<br>
&quot;How could you! You cruel bastard, that creature did nothing to you! How could you strike it down!&quot; cried a Ranger who was near by, elvish in race denotated by his slanted eyes and lack of sence. Shintou had already cut the spine from the back of the Drake when this new annoyance presented itself. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am Oaktree Thunderleaf! By my blades, you will pay for the life of that harmless drake! I'll make sure yo.. You're.. Shintou!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shintou finally brought himself to a standing position, enought for the elf to see the face of one who has slaughtered so many.. and then he realized his prediciment..<br>
<br>
&quot;..I'm gonna.. die aren't I?..&quot; The elf said, his conviction fading as fast as his fear gained, denoted by the streams of yellow trinkling down his leg. This Ranger was a young one, his killing of Hill Giants had gotten him lost.. and wandering into the wrong part of the mountains.<br>
<br>
Shintou's slow nod sealed his fate, and in a swift move, he lunged forward toward the novice, his fist burning red with his harm touch powers. The aura had an unholy feel to it as he went in for the kill, his fist striking the elf square in the chest.<br>
<br>
No, his fist had sunk in.. Punched throught the flesh, the bone, and organs, it had allowed him to get a firm grasp upon the ranger's spine. That elf's eyes went wide as the pupils bludged as his lifeforce suddendly began to slip away, two hands grasping around the bracer of the hand that impaled him.. his body twiching wildly from the hammer of pain that had just been dropped onto his head. Blood came from his mouth in rivers of crimson.. blood oozed from his chest around the hand of Shintou as he lifted him up into the air a bit, one foot up was all he needed..<br>
<br>
The hand inside of the Rangers body then opened as a dark smirk flew across the lips of Shintou. Their was only one word that could descibe the elf's prediciment. One word to show what the elf was to him, and what was about to happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Fatality&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Place a lit firecracker in the palm of your hand, you burn your hand.<br>
<br>
Close your fist around the firecracker, you lose your hand.<br>
<br>
This elf was no excpetion. The Power released inside of him was just way too much to bear.. the force took his body and tore it to shreads. Pieces of flesh and chips of reddened bone flew from the hand, the Elf exploding in a huge mass of blood. It rained it down about the area, a red tint covering the blades of grass and the rocks from the area.. but Shintou just stood there..<br>
<br>
Unmoving. Unflenched. He just closed his fist and took a look back to the party, those that were Stunend and confused by the sudden display of his more malious ways of ending life..<br>
<br>
&quot;I have something I need to take care of. Thank you for your assistance.. I will catch up to you for the next attack..&quot; Shintou so notated as he then turned, and began walking towards the Mountain of Drakes, leaving the party as it was.<br>
<br>
Stunned and confused..<br>
<br>
It had been so long since he was in this Area. This was a place from his past, of course.<br>
<br>
The Encampment of the 'Primodial Malice' rested here, a place for those who followed the Lady of Envy, the Former Chosen one of the Tier'dal, the Daughter of Innoruuk herself, Lanys T'Vyl.<br>
<br>
It was so long ago that he stood upon that hill as a Child, looking over the camp with wonderous eyes.. day by day as he slaughtered the members of the Indigo Brotherhood for them, awaiting that day for their acceptance of him. That day did come, however short lived it was. Their was a time where he walked where he walked now, down among the ones trying to return Lanys to this world. <br>
<br>
Shintou walked past the gates as he looked upon the symbols of what he throught of to represent <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>THE END</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of Norrath as he did as a Child. .. Only a Child in his 22nd level of power.<br>
<br>
&quot;There he is, the Young Knight that has faught his way to be with us. Welcome, Shintou Shinai. Nice of you to make it here with us. You have indeed relieved the 'Call of Malice'. Lanys called to you and you came willing, for this, you have proved yourself to become one of our Innate members. Of course, your fighting skills will be tested.. In fact..<br>
<br>
Here and now, you will have your first lesson in the T'Vyl Malious fighting style!&quot; Said the 'recuiter' of sorts for the Primodial Malice, drawing himself two short swords from his sides, drawing them in an offensive duel swing right for the head of Shintou.<br>
<br>
Any Knight that put on his guild tunic could of seen this attack comming.. but even so it was blazingly fast.. Shintou had hardly ducked the attack, saving his neck.<br>
A draw of his Scythe, the weapon he used as a child, he took his stance.. but that Warrior of Lanys was comming. His blades was swinging as Shintou struggled to keep pace, a cut across his arm, one across his stomach..<br>
<br>
Shows of his inexpreence against proven fighters .. But he finally caught a hold of one of the swords with his weapon, parrying it and using the blade of the weapon to push it down..<br>
<br>
Mistake. The sword cut throught the tarnished metal, breaking it easily and ending the useful ness of Shintou's weapon. No more weapon.. no more choices. This one was too strong to use spells upon..<br>
<br>
Well. All but one spell.<br>
<br>
His fist lit a flame in a dark red glow as he lept to his feet, delivering a punch directly to the chest of the Warrior..<br>
<br>
&quot;Burning Knuckle!&quot; he called this one, it was more of a 'Harm Punch' instead of a simple Harm Touch. The warrior slid back a little.. but not much.<br>
<br>
A Harm Touch from a young knight? Nothing to him.. he just laughed..<br>
<br>
&quot;You've got yerself there one heck of a punch, kid.. Maybe the ShadowMistress can show you what to really do with it... Our ShadowKnight trainer is near the Tower of Envy.. you should report there now... Get up, tell them Dolruek broke yer weapon. She'll have another Sythe for yas. Hahaha..&quot;<br>
<br>
Damn this shame, for now.. <br>
<br>
Shintou simply stood to his feet, keeping his hate in check and did as he was told, heading for the Shadow Knight trainer for the Primodial Malice.. <br>
There.. he looked to see a male kneeling before a Woman in a Dark Bleak armor, glaring down fiercly towards the person kneeling..<br>
<br>
&quot;Falure once again.. you pathetic fool! How dare you fail me again!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mistress! Please.. One more Chance.. I shant fail you again!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Shadowmistress of Envy.. a woman of extreme hate and rage..<br>
And one that demanded perfection. Fail and you have only one option.<br>
<br>
Her fist glew with Harm touch energy as the student looked to her.. he knew what was comming, the attack that put an end to many lives who dare end up on the end of a Malious blade.<br>
She impaled the student with her hand, watching him struggle about as the fist ripped throught flesh.. cracking throught his ribcage..<br>
Shintou stood from afar.. watching all of this from a safe distance of course. He heard the choking of the male as he gasped for air, blood bubbling into the mouth of that man as her hand was riddled with his blood.. it was as if she had grasped his heart within her hands..<br>
<br>
&quot;Failure is unacceptable.&quot; Her last words to him as she released her harm touch.. from the inside out did he explode, flesh and parts of his now dead body flying about the tower..<br>
<br>
&quot;Your request is denied.&quot; She said with a dark chuckle at her work.. the man reduced to a red splatter on the ground.. and various pieces of flesh about the tower..<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you there, boy. Enter here. I know who you are..&quot; <br>
<br>
And he did such, jumping when he realized that she had saw him.. he presented himself by walking along the blood stained path to her, looking up to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is what I do to those that fail me. You wouldn't fail me, would you boy. You had best not you worthless fool. The style of T'Vyl is .. ..  What? Boy, what do you look at me like that for?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Teach me. Show me that attack again. I wish to learn.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Malious Touch of Lanys? Haha.. in time, it will be one of your first lessons. It takes a lifetime to master however.. You should know that I learned it from the Lady of Envy herself! .. It was used to destroy some Elf who dared to stand in her way towards victory. You will learn it, but you will not truly perform it for quite some time..<br>
Quite some time..<br>
<br>
Quite some time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Quite Some Time..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Shintou jumped up from his resting spot within the abonded camp. He had fallen asleep it seemes.. getting too comftable in his spot, here within the camp.<br>
<br>
So long ago.. that ShadowMistress did show him how to use the Malious Touch of Lanys.. even after their destrution.. that one attack lives on throught him.<br>
<br>
The ability to totally destroy one who dares to defy him. A Power suiting him..<br>
And a power he was just now finally learned to master.<br>
<br>
Lanys still watched him.. she grows in his Envy of the Lightbringers and their power. She tunes his hate to the father.. even if Rhael defeated him...<br>
<br>
She still was with him.. his hate did not stem for love as most did..<br>
<br>
His stemmed from Envy. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.leagueofshadows.net/"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> League Of Shadows</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
