dungeons like Droga and Nurga.&quot;<br>
<br>
In classic RPG fashion. You and a group of people would crawl through a dungeon and defeat the big bad boss at the end. Problem with EQ is that all dungeons don't work that way, only the planes.<br>
<br>
You and a group of players all get together to reach the bottom of this fierce dungeon. The goal is to kill the overlord's henchmen and the Overlord himself. On the way there slaying all minions that get in your way. In EQ you battle your way down to a henchmen and find out he's not there. So you stand around for hours waiting for him to &quot;spawn&quot;. After he spawns you keep working you way down. Finally you get to the bad boy himself and guess what?.... he isn't there as well. So you and group of fellow players stand around for hours waiting for him to &quot;spawn&quot; to kill him. Hours go by and still hasn't spawned.<br>
<br>
Only the planes in EQ were to me the best dungeon crawl there was. Each plane had a different way of being completed. The henchmen were always up and the Overlord himself is always where he should be. It gave everyone there a feel of achievement. Waiting around for the climax of the crawl is like watching Star Wars Episode 2 and having the movie paused for hours for bathroom break right before the ending.<br>
<br>
The spoils of the fight in plane raids are actually good. Someone will leave with something they feel was worth it all, increasing the achievement of the fight. With normal dungeon crawl not everyone will leave with something or with anything at all.<br>
<br>
DAoC didn't have planes when it first came out. What I think people were referring to was the plane type raids that EQ is so famous for. That is why months after the game came out Mythic added planes to each realm. People were begging for a true old style dungeon crawl that everyone can benefit from and feel like they've done something important. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vick>Vick</A> at: 5/22/02 12:27:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukrazakthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krazak Thule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/02 1:34:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1984.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dungeon Crawls</span><hr size=1> The problem with any dungeon &quot;Crawl&quot; is that such a thing is designed to be done once. Like I said above, this is *great* for a single player game like Baldur's Gate. <br>
<br>
This is undoable in a large, persistant, MMORPG, like EQ.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, you have to design the dungeon around the game. In huge, MMORPG's like EQ, you need dungeons like Guk. They are well designed, and can allow for multiple parties of adventurers to inhabit at one time. Most of the &quot;camps&quot;, where named montsers spaw, are isolated in such ways that a train from one of them to the zoneout doesn't run over the other parts of the dungeon (this is a problem with dungeons like Mistmoore and Unrest). <br>
<br>
The dungeon is also level-based somewhat. The assassin room is a place where people level 35-40 can easily camp it, where as the Lord room is a place where higher level people are required. <br>
<br>
When that dungeon is at max capacity, it can support upwards of 50 people. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying &quot;crawl&quot; dungeons can't, or shouldn't be put into games like EQ. They can be popular. Howling Stones is one such dungeon. <br>
<br>
But a &quot;crawl&quot; dungeon, especially one that is physically designed to promote that type of experience (one-way drop offs and zone-out points that are far away from zone-in points) requires a higher time committment from the players, and requires different tools in terms of spells. <br>
<br>
For instance, if you die in Guk at level 35 in the assassin room, there's a good chance that there is a level 49 cleric somewhere near the Lord/Magus/Frenzied Ghoul room that can rez you. Because of the way the dungeon is designed, you (or a friend) will probably be able to drag your corpse to them. They will likely help you because they won't have to give up their camp. <br>
<br>
Now... take a dungeon like Droga. If you die there, you have to do CR, starting from the beginning. And if there, for some reason, is a 49 cleric in the zone, they probably wont' help you, because they would have to give up their camp to go fetch you. <br>
<br>
Linear dungeons work great in single player games because if you screw up, you can just hit &quot;load&quot; and go back to your last savegame. If you bite it in a linear dungeon in EQ, you have to restart from the beginning, and this time without your gear. <br>
<br>
Now, biting it in Howling Stones, and biting it in Droga, are two different things. <br>
<br>
Suppose you and your group wipeout in Howling Stones. If you're group has a cleric, he/she is probably level 50, and has a rez that will get you back most of your exp. If you had a druid/wiz with you, some of you probably were able to evac to a safe place and port to SF. And if you had a necro/sk with you, they were probably high enough level to summon you. <br>
<br>
But suppose your group of level 35's and 40's dies in Droga. You're cleric is at least 9 levels away from a rez that means something. Your necro or sk can't summon corpses yet (which means having to fight your way down with inferior backup gear, or paying high levels to come do it). The druid/wiz in your group might have an evac, but it probably puts you a continent away... <br>
<br>
From my perspective, this all comes down to tools. It has seemed to me, all through my EQ life, that classes don't really start to shine until level 50. At that point, you finally get all of the good spells, and everything else is just a matter of getting stronger and doing things better. <br>
<br>
This seems especially true for clerics... <br>
<br>
There are certain spells and abilities that are central to a particular class. I'd love to see these class-defining abilities given to classes at extremely low levels. I think this would promote two things: <br>
<br>
(1) Players would get a *true* feel for their class at a much lower level. I think you'd see people finding a class that they were truly happy with at a much earlier stage in their character's life. I think this would be good. <br>
<br>
(2) Players would become more knowlegeable about their class much sooner. People would start learning tactics at a much younger level. <br>
<br>
As it is now, people really don't learn good grouping techniques, and raiding techniques, until after level 46.. <br>
<br>
That seems like 46 levels that are overlooked, to me. <br>
<br>

There are lots of players who have never gotten to level 50 and many who never will.  I can't agree with a statement this blanket.<br>

EQ can be fun at first level.
