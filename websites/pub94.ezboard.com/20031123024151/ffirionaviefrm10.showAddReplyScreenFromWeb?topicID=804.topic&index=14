No companion joined her back, the only odd part of the watch was the fuming priestess came out of the temple, of course angry priests and priestesses SHOULD be coming out of the temple if they were worshipping properly. No that wasn't the odd part, the odd part was when a short time later the priestess stumbled back to the temple, obviously in pain but not using her healing arts to ease her pain.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Must be some Inny iniatiation thing i suppose</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused while she waited for the old woman. Eventually the old woman had left and seemed a bit more pleased with herself for whatever reason. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She heard something she liked it seems like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri decided. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But nothing i'll learn about here.<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   Not expecting anything to occur, Kyri kept track of the woman until she came back to the shack, which Maelgroth still inhabited. Staying out of sight, Kyri figured she's listen for a bit then go report to D'Vir.<br>
<br>
   &quot;So my sister will be joining us for dinner tonight after all mother?&quot; Maelgroth asked as his mother came in.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes son she is. in no small thanks to you I would think, she thought to challenge your power didn't she?&quot; Naelaelayle asked and at her son's nod she continued looking at the new table now sitting in the shack, &quot;And you bent her to your will didn't you my son?&quot; At Maelgroth's brief smile the old women laughed.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah I am sure you waited for that day to happen for some time now. She was not happy at having to come back to the Temple and bruised and battered and have to make excuses as to why she did not heal herself. Yes son she told me, was not pleased with the idea but she will obey.&quot; Naelaelayle told her son. &quot;But if she is to be joining us for dinner then I shall have to get to it then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Listening to the old woman wander off into the kitchen, Kyri knew she had another piece of the puzzle, the battered priestess was actually the old woman's daughter- and sister to Maelgroth. A power struggle of some sort had obviously taken place between the siblings and maelgrowth seemed to have come out on top.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Back to D'vir then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought. Also what to tell him. With Maelgroth's involvement, in a more growing role it seems, things got complicated. Rather than a simple identitfy and get paid, she now had to decide whether to turn in one who walked the Shadows halls with her. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Of course if this was Gray we were talking about there would be no problem at all. Heck I might even give D'vir a discounted price for THAT job. But this is different. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she went back to the League halls to change into something more suitable for her employer's presence.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What to tell D'vir- I already sent word i learned something. How much do i tell him to keep him happy while i decide what to do for sure. Obviously these folk won't be able to pay more for my silence. Still a servant of the Dead beholden to me is something not to be tossed aside idly. Besides no doubt this is what Gray would hope I do, turn against a Shadow so he can banish me from the halls and have the rest of the League come hunt me down after betraying one of my own. I'd never find any allies to aid me against him if I go through with this.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri mused. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>NO Gray won't win that easily!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided aburptly, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I'll keep D'vir curious for now, but now to find someone to pin this on instead. Misdirection always works best. Just need a victim so D'vir doesn't decide to come after ME for this. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
   Chaning into the same leathers she wore at their first meeting Kyri made her way towards D'Vir's estates. She always knew when she was expected, the guard's patrols grew markedly predictable. Gaps unnoticable to the common eye yet huge gaping holes to those in the know of such things openned in their lines and soon enough she found herself inside the D'vir study and sure enough Nystyre D'Vir sat at his work. She was not decieved by his apparent inattention- she had made just enough noise entering to let him know she was there so it came to no surprise when, without looking up, Nystyre D'Vir asked, &quot;So you have learned something?&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;What no hello?&quot; Kyri asked glibly- she enjoyed trying to toss these serious folk off their game, Anson's reactions especially made her smile. <br>
<br>
   &quot;Spare me your humor. &quot; D'Vir asked unaffected, &quot;You pass a cryptic note about the return of the Waes'Haventhar and then leave me waiting all day before further contact? I am not amused.&quot;<br>
<br>
    &quot;If I had anything of use to speak of then, I would have came then. I sent word so you could be aware of what may be happenning.&quot; Kyri replied all business, &quot;I have nothing concrete to prove it one way or the other- only a glimpse of their symbol on a chest in a shack. Thinking that most of their artifacts had been destroyed when the house fell,it seemed to make sense that someone got missed to bring it along with them.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;And why is it so odd to see some chest, perhaps it was merely looted and kept as a prize by some house. I expected better of you Velkyn.&quot; D'Vir asked.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Because this chest was 'alive' for lack of a better term. It was a soulbound chest of a great house, you know the type- can fuse itself into whatever location it wished by magic. Could only be openned by either someone of the house or one of a handful trusted enough to be given the secret words by the ruler of the house that they may protect it in case of fire or some other emergency while a trueblood was away or injured. It can't be picked open, and people who try tend to die nasty deaths. So either we have a true member of the house or some high ranking servant of the house who was missed.&quot; Kyri replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah, I misjudged you it seems,&quot; D'vir replied, &quot;And where is this chest at now?&quot; <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>OK here we go</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought before replying. &quot;I saw it in some shack in the foreign quarter, the building was abandoned by the look of it so where its kept there long or not i'm not certain. I went back later and it was gone, a third time and it was back again. Some sort of temporary hideout i'm guessing for this person. I tried tailing some people who were seen nearby but nothing turned up. Never actually saw the person moving the chest around but they can't be from around there. I mean what noble would even think about living with trolls?&quot; Kyri finished with a laugh hoping this mismash of truth and lies would be swallowed. That's the key with a lie, be sure to have enough truth mixed in in case you get called on it, and toss in just enough of a lie to keep your victim off target.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Perhaps.&quot; Nystyre mused, idly fingering a sealed document in his hands. &quot;Well at least we know of one possible meeting place for these Waes'Harventhar remnants. That being the case, perhaps you could deliver this inivitation to this spot. If they do visit irregularly, I am certain the guest to my party will recieve it in time.&quot; he finished tossing the note at Kyri.<br>
<br>
  &quot;A party?&quot; Kyri asked with a smile, &quot;Filled with lots of rich nobles?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes it is and no you can't come!&quot; Nystyre declared knowing what sort of chaos Kyri could cause at such a function.<br>
<br>
  &quot;But I'd ONLY think of coming along to help Nystyre,&quot; Kyri cooed, &quot;after all it would be MUCH more helpful if i could see this person who has your attention. After all he DOES seem to be tied in to this Waes'Harventhar business somehow and things would be MUCH easier if I knew who i was looking for. Besides,&quot; Kyri added &quot;I PROMISE i won't take anything from people of your house, anyone else is fair game though.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Eyeing Kyri cautiously, D'vir answered &quot;There is some merit to the idea of having you and this 'Jindurn'Plynnar ' at the same function. Perhaps you might be able to find him more easily having contact with the fellow. Be assured I will be holding you to your word- if even one coin is found missing from my house after this...&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Don't worry i always keep my promises.&quot; Kyri assured him.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Very well then, having you among the servants that...&quot; D'Vir stopped as Kyri raised her hand in a negating gesture.<br>
<br>
  &quot;No no, a servant would not have the kind of access I'd need for this. &quot; Kyri interrupted before smiling brightly, &quot;However, isn't this a fine time to reintroduce your long forgotten neice from a very junior branch of the family, left in the Faydark to fend for themselves after so many years. Yes uncle, this party would be a fine time for everyone to meet your favorite neice Vynna K'yari.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps you're right,&quot; D'Vir agreed, then stopped suddenly looking up only to find Kyri was no longer there. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Where in Innoruuk's name did she come up with THAT name!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Nystyre wondered. After all the last members of House K'yari were killed about 25 years ago by some light bringers. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just a coincidence i'm sure.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> D'vir concluded, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>after all, Kyri couldn';t have been more than an infant if she was even born then</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  That night, as an old woman slept, a guardian was slipped past and an invitation to a party was placed on a new table. A killer slipped back into the night and toawrds her quarters- again the odd question of &quot;what to wear to a party&quot; crossing her mind.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanare>Tanare</A> at: 3/24/03 8:59:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=maelgroth>Maelgroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/25/03 5:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=804.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Flayer</span><hr size=1> “How goes the war brother?” Maelgroth asked Malingrad. The assassin was wearing new armor, ravenscale from the swamp, he was sure if the shack had a mirror he would be preening in it. <br>
<br>
“It is most profitable.” Malingrad reached into his pack and brought out a small leather sack. He slid it across the table.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth picked it up and looked inside. Gemstones winked back at him in the dull light of the room. “You have done well indeed.” The necromancer replied giving the pouch over to his mother. He knew she would be placing it in the family vault upon their return to the League Mansion. He got a bit of amusement at seeing the momentary flash of emotion rush through his brother. <br>
<br>
First there was his usual smug satisfaction when he handed over the pouch, then surprise as it was given to his mother for safekeeping, this emotion was followed by anger, when he realized he would not be getting his reward back. Finally fear washed away anger. Tithing was something all house members did. This was the first time he had ever contributed something personal to house Waes’Harventhar. He got a curious sense of satisfaction from it.<br>
<br>
“Where is Bliss?” Malingrad had heard about the run in his sister and younger brother had. <br>
<br>
“She is on an errand for us. Something in second gate.” Naelaelayle growled.<br>
<br>
Malingrad looked at his mother carefully, he had hoped to see her open the chest that had squatted in the corner of their shack for years, and perhaps get a peek at what lay inside. He had tried to open the chest once as a young rogue, he still had nightmares about the pain. Now the chest was gone. He had the good grace not to ask about it.<br>
<br>
“You have something for me to do?” Malingrad asked carefully. He still had an assignment to carry out for the Ragar’Golhyrr. It would be an easy one. He had already discussed the details with some of the other assasins involved in the house war. It really was laughable how these houses thought they controlled affairs. Both had contracted outsiders to do much of their dirty work and those they contracted with had already planned out who would die and when. The Ebon Mask pulled the strings of the houses now. Their destinies lay in the palm of the Rogue’s House. It had already been decided that the Ragar’Golhyrr would win this war since they paid better.<br>
<br>
“It shall be a small matter.” Maelgroth replied.<br>
<br>
Malingrad was beginning to learn about his brother’s sense of humor. It was as if someone entirely new inhabited the shell he had grown up with.<br>
<br>
“Speak the words and you will shall be done.” Malingrad replied in the old tongue.<br>
<br>
“We have been discovered, you are responsible for our security. Find out who knows and report back. Take no actions on your own.” Mael replied. He watched his brother turn pale with fear.<br>
<br>
Mal was afraid. He had two very good reasons, the first being that if an enemy house knew of the Waes’Harventhars their lives were in danger. The second was that he was ultimately responsible for the security of the house. It was his fault. His brother could order his death by torture.<br>
<br>
“The invitation.” The assassin was kicking himself, he had not taken its arrival seriously. He had always been better at planning offensive action than defensive. He realized he had not even asked to see the note. Suddenly he felt foolish and alone. He had placed his family in danger because of his interest in personal gain.<br>
<br>
“Exactly.” Naelaelayle replied. She was angry that her son had not put the information concerning the letter together on his own. It pleased her to see he was at least aware of the enormity of his failure.<br>
<br>
“May I see it?” Malingrad asked using the old tongue, using the most formal and submissive of tenses.<br>
<br>
“Pay particular attention to the coin that accompanied the invitation.” Maelgroth said handing the letter over.<br>
<br>
“None of the others were accompanied by such a trinket?” The date on the coin stood out. Such coins were scarce in Neriak, it would not be too difficult to find out who might have a supply of such old currency. Of course it could have come from a collector, or the vault of an old house.<br>
<br>
“I take it you have taken steps to protect yourselves?”<br>
<br>
“We have removed the vault and ourselves to a new location.” Naelaelayle replied. Nothing else would be shared with Malingrad until he redeemed himself.<br>
<br>
“House D’Vir knows some but not all.” Malingrad mused.<br>
<br>
“Now you begin to think.” Naelaelayle chuckled. Maelgroth was silent.<br>
<br>
“A third party, who left the coin knows our identity.” The assassin continued.<br>
<br>
“Now that you have caught up to the rest of us, find out who, how, and what they know.” Maelgroth ordered.<br>
<br>
Blisshadow stood outside the gates of house House Vlos’Shannaal (the Blood Chalice). The building bore all the marks of a shrine to Innoruk converted into a House mansion. It was a small house by any standard, but a wealthy one. She knew from her family history that this shrine had once been the property of the Waes’Harventhars, a showcase for their wealth and loyalty to the Maker. <br>
<br>
This building should have been hers, now their enemies slept in rooms meant for worship and danced where they should kneel. A cold but certain fire of hatred burned in her heart, and she knew that what she did, was with the tacit blessing of the god. Never had she felt so close to him, not when she had transcribed hymns, and written reports, not when she had groveled before her superiors, not once had she felt the sure touch of her god, but now that she embraced her family, she felt the strength of her faith growing. Innoruk was near and he whispered his will in her ear.<br>
<br>
“I seek entry into the house.” Bliss shouted. Inside she could her raucous music.<br>
<br>
The door burst open as two drunken Teir’Dal stumbled out. Their tongues stained a dark black from the wine they were besotted with. It took a moment for her to realize that these elves were the guards.<br>
<br>
“Why you wanna enter?” the first guard leered at her skeptically. He was sloppy drunk, and swayed on his feet.<br>
<br>
“This house has not paid their tithe to the church.” Bliss replied. It was true, in fact practically none of the houses paid tithe to the church anymore. It was a tradition that had lapsed out of favor. Indeed the Vlos’Shannaal had begun their rise to prominence as cup bearers during church ritual. That role had slowly moved from one of serving the church to serving themselves. All the great houses had shrines of their own, or had them at one time, they were a good place to send lower ranking family members. Over time many shrines became petty houses in their own right.<br>
<br>
“Well, you are welcome to come in and state your case to our Matron.” The other guard burped, gesturing for her to enter.<br>
<br>
The Vlos’Shannaal (Blood Chalice) might be their name, but the Xuil’Z’hindar (Wine Trippers) might be more apt a description. Security was totally lacking as she stepped over passed out house members and their insolent slaves. No one asked her why she was there, though a few made half hearted attempts to lure her into their rooms. When she asked where the matron might be found she was usually greeted with blank stares followed by a pointing finger up stairs.<br>
<br>
No doubt this house curried favor with others through entertainment and the occasional bit of blackmail. At last she found the door she sought. She knocked loudly.<br>
<br>
“Come in, and bring some more wine!” came a giggling voice.<br>
<br>
Bliss opened the door, inside the sanctuary, the most holy place in the shrine lay the quarters of the Matron of house Vlos’Shannaal. It was a disgrace. The holy chalice, a relic from the earliest days of the Teir’Dal lay upon the floor, a discarded drinking vessel, still holding the dregs of some wine, instead of the clotted blood of their enemies.<br>
<br>
“You are in violation of church law!”<br>
<br>
“Sure, sure, I will tell you what, when you can get the Chath’elg’Caress, the Ragar’Golhyrr and the Sol’Calar to pay your tithe then we shall do so, and gladly.” The matron laughed.<br>
<br>
“Very well, I shall have to post a notice of your delinquency.” Bliss said.<br>
<br>
“Post it where you will, we use them as toilet paper.”<br>
<br>
In reality, the notice had little power of its own. It simply stated that the house was not in the good graces of the church and was not under its protection. The church had never offered protection to any house at the detriment of any other, it could not act in such a manner without loosing its tenuous position of authority. As it was, the church had given up on even posting the notices, since they had become something of a joke, as houses flaunted the will of the church willfully collecting the postings.<br>
<br>
Bliss was eager to leave that den of foolishness. She had carefully tacked up the notice next to the front door, though she had her doubts it would be there for long.<br>
<br>
“It is done, master.” Bliss announced when she returned to the shack. It was quite nice, actually to come home and see her family seated around the new table she had bought. Malingrad looked like he had swallowed a tadpole though.<br>
<br>
“I take it security was lax?” Maelgroth asked.<br>
<br>
“It was non existent.”<br>
<br>
“We have acted indirectly with the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr, now we act together as a true house. We will enforce the writ of Innoruk on the Vlos’Shannaal.” Maelgroth laughed.<br>
<br>
“No one has enforced those writs for centuries.” Malingrad chuckled.<br>
<br>
“Exactly. They won’t be expecting it, and house Waes’Harventhar is within its rights to enforce payment of the writ if they so wish.”<br>
<br>
“When was the last time they paid tithe?” Maelgroth snickered.<br>
<br>
“I checked the records, they have never paid tithe, and they took possession of the shrine unlawfully.” Bliss replied.<br>
<br>
“What do you mean, unlawfully?” Malingrad asked.<br>
<br>
“Lands once given to the church always remain in the church’s hands. They cannot be passed from house to house.” Bliss replied.<br>
<br>
“So, you are saying they have stolen this land from the church?” the assassin whispered.<br>
<br>
“Indeed.”<br>
<br>
“What’s the penalty for stealing from the church.” Malingrad mused, already aware of the answer.<br>
<br>
“Death…”<br>
