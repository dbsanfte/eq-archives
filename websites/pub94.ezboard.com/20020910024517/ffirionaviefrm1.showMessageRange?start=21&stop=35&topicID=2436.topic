I understand that some people don't have time for the high-end, but that doesn't entitle you to extremely rare gear.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't have much to say about the money situation, and while I know this isn't a Soapbox thread, I'm going to complain about things that have been said here: I have a minor understanding of the new Bazaar, so I could be a little unreasonable in my whining, but -- it's really unfair of you to set up camp in the Bazaar while you're away from your computer for an extended period of time. It's not your fault that I, as well as several hundred other players on this server, have a dial-up connection; but you certainly aren't making it any easier by kicking back for six hours doing absolutely nothing in a zone that is already over-populated. Whenever I enter the Bazaar, turning the corner at the end of the hallway leading from Nexus takes about twelve seconds (and I have one Luclin model active, not counting the horses / elementals). I'm not saying that you should only be there for the amount of time it takes to handle your transactions -- to my knowledge, there's a browser that allows you to see everything that's -currently- being sold in the Bazaar, and that buying an item works similarly to the merchant system, so the seller has to actually be there in the zone -- but at least have SOME courtesy for people who are passing through. In my opinion, if you're there for more than an hour, you've pissed at least someone off, albeit indirectly.<br>
<br>
I don't go there much since I'm still at the low-end of the game, but my few experiences there have been really frustrating. Almost as frustrating as walking halfway across the zone, then being shown your corpse on the other side of the map where you died about two minutes previously.<br>

<br>
As we have heard before, money in the end game becomes less of an issue (you referred to 100pp being little more than a hanshake recently, for me its a big deal).  What we are likely to see is a modest redistribution of wealth as &quot;the rich&quot; pay for larger amounts of commodities that the poor are prepared to farm, silks, pelts etc.  Pretty soon &quot;the poor&quot; are going to start spending the money they now have and begin chasing a finite number of items at the low-middle end.  Demand will rise and prices will rise with them, at least a little.  The bear market will eventually turn around, but it could take a fair old while.<br>
<br>
Either way, it's interesting to watch it happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm really not trying to tell anyone what to do. I'm just attempting to inform all of you who plant yourselves on your asses inside the Bazaar shortly before you go out on errands that you're making things incredibly inconvenient for other people, all in the interest of getting platinum for yourself.

Heagan, you're right that the market won't be stable but I like the idea of a volatile market with fluctuating prices, gives a chance for merchant venturers to make and lose fortunes. From a roleplay perspective its a lot closer to the economics of the age, although having several competing entrepot would be more realistic and create competing economies.<br>
<br>
How long before a wealthy lvl 60 character makes a few bad transactions, blows it all and ends up begging for coppers on the Freeport docks (unlikely but it would be fun)?<br>
<br>
There's going to be as many losers as winners out of this, but it adds a new dimension to the game for some people at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ak'Anon Sex Symbol</span><br>  Posts: 695<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/27/02 10:36:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2436.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 1-character rule dictates FV economy</span><hr size=1> I do agree with the people that say that supply far outweighs demand. <br>

It's true for this server, because of the 1-character rule. <br>
<br>
On the normal blue servers, the average player uses 3 or 4 other twinks to play with.  Those twinkies all need to be clothed and equipped.  So there is plenty of demand for commodity items, and those servers will always have stronger and more robust economies compared to ours.<br>

The very design of the trader-player characters seems to encourage this.  I would point out that that you can get to Shadowhaven from the Nexus by using the teleportor, and the only reason I can think of this shortcut is to give people who have bazaar lag issues to avoid the zone altoghether.  So really, yeah, it may cause more lag, but it does help both the buyers and sellers, and I personally would have no moral qualms at all about going afk for hours in the bazaar. <p>-- <br>
