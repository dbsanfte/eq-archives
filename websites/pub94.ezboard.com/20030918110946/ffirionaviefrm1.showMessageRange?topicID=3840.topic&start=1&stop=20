Many of these restrictions have been removed (particularly the alignment &amp; grouping restrictions) but I've reposted them here for those who are curious or are looking for the information so they can create a character that fit one of the old alignments.  Please note that an alignment had to be common to all 3 aspects (Race, Class, Diety) for you to choose it for your character.<br>

<br>
 This is a new server, not a split server. There will be no transfers to this server.<br>
 Characters will be wiped before the server goes Live.<br>
 This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words, it's a standard &quot;blue&quot; server with the same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the &quot;Zeks&quot;. <br>
 Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin. <br>
 Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster. <br>
 Each character will be assigned an &quot;alignment&quot; upon creation. This alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in the same location their Deity is described).<br>
 Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after they reach 10th level if they choose. A character is not required to change alignments, but may do so any time after attaining 10th level. The player will be able to choose from a list of alignments based on their race, class and deity. <br>
 A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group or guild with other characters. <br>
 A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty when grouping with other characters. <br>
 A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial spells on other characters (including resurrections). <br>
 Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone and from /say. <br>
 Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at level*5+5 skill points. <br>
 Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily available to certain races. <br>
 One character per account. <br>
 The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. <br>
 Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons.<br>
 Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on other servers. <br>
 /emote will be language specific <br>
 All characters will be /roleplay. <br>
 /alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a more detailed description of that alignment. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">* Trivial Loot Code *</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes effect. This can happen when either a member of your group is too high in level to receive experience from killing the monster, or when a member of your group is outside of the level range of the group for receiving experience from the kill. If any member of a group does not get experience for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is a ton of information about the alignment system.<br>
<br>
Choosing an alignment<br>
<br>
With this server we have decided to introduce the idea of alignment into the world of Norrath. This is an idea used in many roleplaying games to help the players and the game master further describe their characters, to express their social and emotional personality in much the same way that we take the time to describe a character's physical appearance.<br>
<br>
Because this concept is new to EverQuest, we have written descriptions of each of the nine possible alignments. Each description is an outline of the ideals of these alignment types; characters can, of course, move around within the border of those ideals as they see fit. We encourage you to choose an alignment that suits the personality of your character. A character that is in all ways neutral, but refuses to aid a dark elf or troll because he believes them to be evil, might be neutral good, not neutral.<br>
<br>
These are things that often develop as you play your character. When you started out with a new character you may have had certain designs in mind for her. You might have seen her as tolerant of both good and evil, willing to help anyone that needed it. But as she travels and meets people, she might realize that helping evil people has never been a pleasant experience, and that indeed she feels obliged to obey the rules and learns to despise rogues. A character that you thought would be neutral when you created her may end up being neutral good after the two of you experience Norrath a bit.<br>
<br>
This is why you will not be able to choose the alignment of your character until you reach 10th level. Instead, your character will be given an alignment when you choose his class, race and deity. That alignment will match the ideals of that character's teachers. If your character starts as an agnostic human warrior, he will have left his training with all the impressions that his teachers gave him about the world. Because the character spent so long under the tutelage of people who insisted that a warrior must follow the middle road and be willing to fight when and where he was needed, he will enter his career as a neutral. But adventuring changes people, and after ten levels of such adventure you will be able to decide your character's alignment, within restrictions determined by that character's race, class and deity. For example, high elves must be good, and will be restricted to good alignment options when they reach tenth level, or at any time thereafter.<br>
<br>
This will be the only time that you will be able to make this decision, so choose wisely. Get to know your character before choosing.<br>
<br>
Below we have included several documents that might be useful for you to read over before choosing what character to play on this server.<br>
<br>
Alignment Descriptions - outlines the general beliefs of characters of each of the possible alignments.<br>
<br>
Racial Alignments - outlines the alignment options for each race.<br>
<br>
Deity Alignments - outlines the alignment options for characters that follow each of the gods that are available to worship.<br>
<br>
Class Alignments - outlines the alignment options for each class.<br>
<br>
These last three (racial, deity and class) essentially form a matrix that will determine the alignment options that your character will have, and also have a hand in determining the alignment that your character begins with.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Alignment Descriptions</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Neutral (N)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A person of neutral alignment can be very different from another person of the same alignment. For example, a druid might actively defend the center, holding a strong desire that neither good nor evil, order nor discord gain control in the world, for each of them is inherently unbalanced and unnatural. But a warrior of neutral alignment might be unconcerned about such things and simply wish that all those with such strong opinions keep them to themselves. In either case, the neutral character is not strongly allied with the ideas of order or discord, good or evil.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Discordant Neutral (DN)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
This is a character of unruly nature. Whether one is in opposition to the tenets of order or just desires to be unconstrained is immaterial. These folk tend to be unmindful of the rules of society, preferring to do what seems correct to them at the moment. This isn't a destructive kind of chaos such as would make a person evil, nor is it a gentle chiding of the rules intended to show where constraints hinder the ability for one to do what is good. Folks of this alignment are most often just unable to understand why others have the right to blanket their lives with rules when those rules can't be accurate for any of the specific situations they find themselves in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Orderly Neutral (ON)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment believe foremost that sentient races must have rules to abide by, or they will become lost in uncivilized discord. This does not necessarily make them proselytizers of order. It is just as likely that one of this alignment would hold only themselves to such restrictions. Even so, their belief in the ordering of things is strong and they will often find it challenging to allow discord to work around them. One of this alignment will follow the rules of any society he finds himself in, and will tend to avoid the company of those that hold no rules or laws important.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Neutral Good (NG)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment believe that being good is more important than being orderly or chaotic. If rules make certain people happy, then they should have such rules. If rules cause others to be troubled, then they should be able to go where such rules do not apply. But neither rules nor a hatred of such rules should be an excuse for a person to be evil. Above all else, being good is what matters. This may only be a personal goal, or it might be something that the character desires for others. In any case, such a person will be unable to abide evil in any form. How they respond to such evil will vary from person to person, but they will never encourage evil and will never aid one that does evil.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Neutral Evil (NE)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment are uninterested in order or discord. Such disinterest might stem from a lack of concern, or it might spring from disdain. For the most part, a person of this alignment strives primarily to achieve evil ends. Their goals might be personal, or they may wish to impress evil upon others. But evil is in them, and they cannot tolerate goodness. They will never aid a person of goodly demeanor, and depending on their personal desires will either hinder them or shun them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Orderly Evil (OE)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment form the heart of many evil societies. Their rules may be cruel, perhaps even frightening, but they are the devices that keep society in line. Evil to the core, these characters understand the power of organization and order, and they know that the way of discord is the way of self-destruction. If you want your dreams to come true, either as a person or as a society, then you must have the strength of order to build on. Structure is what makes evil terrible and mighty. Ambitious orderly evils desire the destruction of all that is good, and often have a plan for making that happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Discordant Evil (DE)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment eschew rules as restrictive to the purpose of evil. They believe that confusion and mayhem are the most effective tools available. They find those of order to be far too constrained by their own rules to be effective. Only those willing to throw off the shackles of order can ever truly be great. Seething chaos is the soil that nourishes true evil. Honor is for fools and paladins, both of which make fine mulch for the garden.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Orderly Good (OG)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment believe that good is enhanced by order. True peace can only be achieved through the foundation of just rules and true goodness. Discord breeds evil, for those who are unwilling to follow rules most often do so because those rules enforce what is good. Certainly some rules are unjust and should be defied. But such rules are only created by those who are evil at heart. Societies, families, and individuals alike should be willing to do what is right, and to set what is right down as law. Some might be asked to make sacrifices for the good of others. Those unwilling to do so, those who say that rules are too constraining and are unwilling to abide by them because it discomforts them to do so, are selfish. Selfishness often leads to evil. Evil is intolerable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Discordant Good (DG)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Characters of this alignment believe that being good is an internal measure, not a societal one. Many of the rules that societies create have nothing to do with being good, but are designed to restrict people so that they can't be evil. A fine distinction, to be sure, but how can a rule, written onto a piece of paper or carved into stone by someone days, months or even years prior have any pertinence to an action taking place right now? Stealing is against the rules in many places, but it is not by its very nature evil. It is only the intent of the person doing the stealing that determines the goodness of the act. Stealing money from an evil man and using that money to feed those who have little is a good act, not an evil one. Rules hinder many acts that are indeed good. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Racial Alignments</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Each of the races of Norrath has a society, and that is where they learn how to behave themselves (or, for some, how to misbehave). Below are very brief descriptions of the alignment tendencies of each race. The alignments available to characters of each race are listed in parentheses after the description. The most common alignments will appear first, with those after each successive dash being less common than those previous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Barbarians</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These isolationists tend toward neutrality and slightly toward goodness. They also tend to be orderly, primarily because the most commonly worshipped deity in Halas is the Tribunal. However, they are a wild people in a wild land, and not a few of them feel constrained by rules and follow the ways of discord. For the most part their society honors bravery and skill over trickery and greed, and desires of power or other evil thoughts are channeled and controlled by the overwhelming need to prove themselves to their people. (N/NG/ON - OG/DG/DN)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dark Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Driven primarily by the hatred that created them, dark elves are strongly evil. Their society is orderly (as order is the only thing that keeps their society stable), but in some the urge for evil is unrestrained by the rules of their society. There are discordant elements among the dark elves, primarily among those of the necromantic arts. Upward movement in the society of Neriak requires great cunning and self-control, however, and it is rare that those who do not posses orderly minds gain power in those circles. But dark elves are driven by all kinds of hatred- wild, flaring, dangerous hatred as well as cold, seething, dangerous hatred. (OE/NE - DE )<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Dwarves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
As sturdy of mind as they are of body, dwarves tend strongly toward order. Moved more by the smooth strength of steel and the beauty of precious stones, they are rarely motivated by the temptations of good or evil. However, through a long and occasionally strained relationship with the high and wood elves, and from continuous battle with the evil of the goblins, they will stray toward goodness rather than evil, if indeed they stray at all. The dwarven society prides itself on its honor, steadfastness in times of trouble, and its loyalty to its kin. (ON - N/NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Erudites</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Erudites are a people of two societies. The first was founded by Erud himself and still hold his strong beliefs at its core. Meticulous might be a good way to describe these folk. Their lives are ever bent toward discoveries of the mind. Their society reflects this. They are generally peaceful and orderly, and have become even more dedicated to the ideals of peace and order since their civil war gave a face to those among them who were dedicated to evil. <br>
<br>
The heretics of Paineel are just as orderly and meticulous as their estranged cousins in Erudin. Where the Erudites see order as a device that allows people the freedom to be good, the heretics see it as a tool that gives strength to their evil. They are no less organized in their daily lives than the people of Erudin are, but the goals of their society involve powers of dark necromancy and evil, rather than the enlightenment of good and kindness. <br>
<br>
It isn't unreasonable to envision these two societies as distillations of the two faces of order. Both have a tendency to be harsh in their adherence to order, as they have very real evidence of what can happen when one strays from the path of good/evil. Erudites (ON/OG/NG), Heretics (OE - NE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gnomes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Gnomes run the gamut, being as likely to follow one path as any other. They are, however, unlikely to follow the strict life of order. They tend to be an unstructured people, and their amazing skill and detailed work seems to come from an inherent understanding of things, rather than any strict organizational skills. The rising influence of Bertoxxulous in Ak'Anon is considered by some among other races as evidence of the disorganization of the gnomes. There exists an odd truce between the worshippers of the gods of the gnomes, almost as if they are too busy or absentminded to take notice of the potential conflict that exists within the cavern walls of their clockwork city. (N/DN/NG/NE/DG/DE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Half Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Being born of humans and wood elves, and having a tendency to be independent of either society in any case, half elves can be of any alignment. They tend to fall into professions and forms of worship that suit their dispositions rather than conform to the needs of any society. It is possible to find half elves as members of almost any religion. In this fashion they take after their human parents. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Halflings</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These little folk tend to be kindly and warm, outgoing and inquisitive. While some are less friendly and some are more orderly than is most common, on the whole they are a pleasant people. While some will take up duties and keep at them tenaciously, this is stubbornness rather than orderliness. Unfettered and gregarious, these folk tend to chafe at rules they don't understand. Sure, it's wrong to hurt people, but everyone knows that, so why do you have to make a rule that says you can't? Despite what is often seen as rashness by some of the more stoic races of Norrath, halflings are never swayed to evil. (DG/NG/DN/N)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>High Elf</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These children of Tunare embody her sense of order and goodness. They are a people of high values and great light. While some might be slightly less lawful or marginally less good than others, high elves are incapable of evil and chaos. This does not make them immune to errors in judgment, and it is not uncommon for them to appear haughty and even rude due to their strong sense of self-worth. As a society, they value actions over words, though they do not take words lightly. They value the good hearts of their cousins, the wood elves, but find their flightiness disconcerting. (OG - ON/NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Humans</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Diversity is their strength as well as their weakness. Humans can be of any alignment, and much like their half elven kin, they tend to take up professions that suit their desires. Those who feel a need for structure in their lives will often settle in the cities they have built on Antonica. But it is just as likely that you will meet a lawless human brigand on the road as a pleasant human cleric. With a human you can never know what to expect until you get to know the individual. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Iksar</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Even though their empire has fallen, the Iksar are still an orderly society. Evil to the core, there is very little variance from the path of order and evil among the Iksar of Cabilis. Those who are too disorderly are exiled into the wilderness of Kunark, where most find only death. Those who are too weak are often killed trying to prove their strength. Their single-minded acceptance of Fear has given their society its strength, and has given them the reputation as a terrible and dangerous people. (OE - NE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ogres</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Perhaps at the height of their society (if you believe such rumors), ogres were the epitome of order and the strength of evil. But these days they are just too stupid to have much need for laws. Somewhat mellower than their green-skinned neighbors, ogres tend to be just evil, as chaos and law require more work. Their society decays as their attentiveness to their old ways slowly fades. They can't be anything other than evil, but they can be motivated to be orderly or discordant, depending on how frequently they were dropped as children and on what part of their body they landed. (NE - DE/OE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Trolls</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Trolls are more motivated to destruction than ogres. They are, in fact, a people bent on destruction and tend to be both discordant and evil. There is no reason to believe that trolls as a people ever had a society to speak of. They are ruled by the strongest among them and their society shifts with the latest battle, rarely fixating on a long-term goal. Their ferocity is their strength, serving them well enough in the place of rules. They are never other than evil, though some are less disorderly than the rest. (DE - NE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wood Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As the high elves are an orderly folk, the wood elves are wild. They tend to be chaotic and willful. They represent all that is untamed in the forest and in their beloved Mother of All. They are at heart a loving people, though they do stray, some becoming more wild than good. They are never evil, however, no matter the consternation they may cause their high elven cousins. Their society is built on respect more than on a sense of order. It is only reasonable to take the advice of one's betters, but that does not mean that one is constrained to obey that advice as if it were the only path. (DG/DN - N/NG)<br>

Travelers, arbiters, tale-spinners, lore masters and often heroes, bards have many personalities. While it is not uncommon for any given bard to have several personalities all his own, as a group they are as diverse as the gods they follow. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cleric</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A cleric is often the pinnacle of his society. Spiritual leader, often lore master for the tales of a society or of the god that they worship. Only those whose souls are most closely bound to their deity will become clerics, and so they have alignments restricted by that of their deity and of their race. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Druid</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A druid fights for the balance. Not content to be a bystander in the battles that often occur between factions both religious and racial, a druid might actively defend a forest from the ravages of good or evil alike. (N)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Enchanter</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Enchanters are often known for their ability to disguise themselves and to cloud the minds of others. There is a tendency, therefore, for such a person to understand other races and to at least study them somewhat. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Magician</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Elemental mastery and the power over the servants of the elements are not preclusive to any attitude. The only true requirement for this profession is a strong will and perhaps an equally strong ego. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Monk</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In order to be able to control one's body to the degree that a monk is capable, one must first control the mind. Monks must be orderly to follow the path that leads only along the razor's edge. (ON/OG/OE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Necromancer</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The desire to raise and manipulate the corpses of the dead is an unpleasant one at best. Most societies make rules against such activities, as disturbing the dead can have accursed consequences. Necromancers, therefore, are always evil and they rarely concern themselves with order. (DE - NE/OE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Paladin</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Paladins are the heroic knights of legend. They are the epitome of their people and their gods. This means that they must be goodly, and are most often orderly, but can be neutral good. (OG - NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Ranger</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rangers are the warriors of nature. They shy away from no duty that calls them to the service of their god. They share many of the beliefs of the druids, though their methods may vary. A ranger cannot be evil and tend indeed to be neutral, as do druids. But they are closer to paladins in this regard; they are more closely tied to the desires of their deity than to the balance of things. (N/DN - DG/NG - OG/ON)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rogue</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Rogues are just that, rogues. They find rules amusing things, obstacles at worst, toys at best. A rogue may not be orderly. They, in fact, tend to be discordant. (DN/N - DG/DE/NG/NE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Shadowknight</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Often seen as the counterpoint to the paladin, and justifiably so, shadowknights are knights of legend, too, though of the dark sort. A shadowknight must be evil, and tends to be orderly or discordant in resonance with their deity and society. (OE/DE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Shaman</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Much like clerics, shamans are the spiritual leaders of their people. Those who are most like unto their deity will be called to be shamans. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Warrior</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The warrior is as varied in personality as the battles he fights. They tend to be less extreme, for those of highly religious nature tend to become paladins and shadowknights, but this does not mean that a warrior can't be just as righteous as any paladin. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wizard</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Theirs is only the desire for knowledge and power. Their intent for that knowledge and power is dependent only on their character. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Deity Alignments</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Agnostic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Followers of no specific god, these characters are not restricted to any particular alignment, though they do tend to be neutral. (ANY)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bertoxxulous - The God of Disease and Decay.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A seditious and unpleasant creeping comes to mind when thoughts turn to Bertoxxulous. It is often thought that without this god things might never fall into chaos and age. His followers are never good, nor are they orderly. (DE - NE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Brell Serilis</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A complicated god to define, Brell Serilis's most prominent worshippers are, of course, the dwarves of Kaladim. However, if the rumors are indeed true, he is the creator of many races, both good and evil, orderly and discordant. Regardless of the truth of the matter, many evil races do indeed worship Brell. However, the belief that he created such creatures is not held among most races of Norrath. In fact, the fundaments of his worship among most societies posit that he is not evil, but a lover of creation in its purest form. He is worshiped as a non-evil deity, and is most often considered an orderly being. Modern worship of him follows that course. (N/ON - NG/OG - DN/DG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Cazic-Thule - God of Fear.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mindless terror is his goal; Order and discord are irrelevant to this god, and he cares only to spread paralyzing fear. As long as the result is terror, the cause or method is of little consequence. How his followers choose to inspire fear is up to them. His followers must be evil. (NE - DE/OE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane - God of Thieves.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
His followers accept only one tenet: Laws are something to be ridiculed. As his following among the dark elves might indicate, he is not necessarily only a god of fun and tricks. While each society will have a slightly different understanding of his nature, none of his followers can be orderly. (DN - DG/N/DE/NE/NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innoruuk - God of Hate.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
His primary place of worship lies deep within Neriak, but his power is universal and touches everyone at some point in their lives. He has followers among many people of Norrath. His followers must be evil. (OE - NE/DE)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Karana - God of Storms.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
His essence is the torrential rain and fury of the storm, the discord of the storm and the goodness of the nourishing rain. His followers can't be evil or orderly. (N/DN/NG - DG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Erollisi Marr - Goddess of Love.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Her designs are in direct opposition to those of the god of Hate. It might indeed be true that her influence is as far reaching as Innoruuk's, and that even the darkest heart can be touched by Love. Her followers must be good. (NG/DG/OG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mithaniel Marr - God of Righteousness and Truth.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mithaniel Marr is a more dedicated force for goodness than his sister, Erollisi. Order and goodness are within his realm, and his sword arm defends both. His followers must be good and cannot be discordant. (OG - NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Prexus - God of the Oceans.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Prexus is most often worshipped by those who sail the seas. For many, such worship is not just a desire to avoid his wrath while at sea. Prexus despises Bertoxxulous and calls Rodcet Nife ally. His followers can not be evil, but you will find as many who love the seas for their wild waves as for their calm on a clear night. (N/NG/OG/DG/DN/ON)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quellious - Goddess of Peace and Harmony.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
As seekers of inner peace, followers of Quellious can never be discordant or evil, and are most commonly both orderly and good. (OG - N/NG/ON)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rallos Zek - God of War and Battle lust.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
While there are indeed good and just reasons to do battle, those are not the only reasons. Rallos worshippers are those who love battle for any cause, and reason. They can never be good, though some are not as evil as others. (DE/NE/OE - N/DN/ON)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rodcet Nife - Prime Healer.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Only those of good heart can follow the god of healing. Whether they choose the path of order or discord is not important, as long as they heal the hurts and destroy the disease of the world as they travel that path. (NG/OG/DG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Solusek Ro - God of Fire.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Fire is, by its very nature, a discordant element. Often the followers of Solusek Ro worship him as a destructive force, a power of chaos and ruin. But not all of those who follow the Burning Prince see him that way, and some even see fire as a cleansing thing. His followers can't be orderly and tend not to be good. (DN/DE - N/NE - DG/NG)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tribunal - God(s) of Justice.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Justice is by no means the same thing as the truth and valor of Mithaniel Marr. For followers of the Tribunal, order is the primary concern. Some followers of the Tribunal believe that justice cannot exist without a measure of concern for those it affects, but it is argued (often and at great length) by most followers that this is a tainting of justice, not a tempering of it. Followers are almost always orderly, and some are good. (ON- OG - N) <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tunare - Mother of All.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It is said that Tunare created the elves, who in time became the orderly high elves and the more discordant wood elves. Her power is that of growth and life, encompassing both order and discord as forces of nature. Her followers can be of any non-evil alignment. (N/NG/OG/DG/ON/DN)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Veeshan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Virtually unknown in Norrath, only bards know much of Veeshan's mythology and are still willing to worship her. She is believed to be the mother of all dragons and dragon kin. Otherwise, the lore about the nature of her worship is all but lost. Her followers interpreted what little they know about her and, perhaps as much through ignorance as through truth, have created a path of worship to her that eschews order, discord, good and evil in equally.

Frankly if they all oppose it they should not be here - simple as that - this is (or should be!) a RP only (as a previous poster said NOT a RP optional) server - those who don't like it have 40 other ordinary and bland blue servers to choose from!<br>

As you might have gathered from my posts here and above - this is something I feel VERY strongly about and feel cheated and defrauded by Sony.<br>
<br>
I signed up to a rule set and got that taken away - without a by or leave! They didn't even give me a chance to transfer (free of charge and with all my equipment) elsewhere.<br>
<br>
If you buy one make of car (after having read the spec. and the price etc) and then 4 months later they take that away and replace it with one of lesser value and half the features - you'd be well pissed off - well this is exactly what Sony did here - SCUM the lot of them!!!<br>

I just bought the game and didn't do research or rulesets and stuff cause I had no idea what the game was actually about. I just installed, logged on and then got confrontated with 15 different servers to choose from.<br>

After being around for a few months, the server population was lower than they anticipated.<br>

They felt the reason the population was low was because some of the rules made it too difficult to play here, particularly for players new to EQ, so they dropped them.<br>

The fact that even after the removal of the rules the population never skyrocketed, and the fact that other new servers are likewise suffering on population, points towards the EQ populace settling in to their existing servers.  There's enough content available that old servers don't have the crowding that they used to, so there's not much alleviation gained by moving to a new one.  People can stay where they are and play just fine.<br>
<br>
The experiment didn't fail, there's just not a lot of motive for people to leave their servers anymore.  With Kunark, Velious, Luclin, Planes of Power, LoY, and the optional zones (Stonebrunt, Jaggedpine, Warrens, etc) the servers can support a lot more players than they used to.<br>

There were very few people on at any given time and this made it hard to find a group especially since you could only group with some of the people and only understand a small number of those you could.<br>
<br>
Do I wish we still had alignments?  Yes, I wish that the alignment was desplayable next to the name ALL the time like a guild tag.  If you don't care, turn it off.  If you do care, then there you go.  On the other hand xp bonuses and penalties and the inability to group with people of disperate views is not going to work for most people.<br>
<br>
As to the language barrier, that was also a bit far.  Cap the language at level x 5 + 5 and let the rest of the learning be as normal.  People hate not being able to understand, it makes them paranoid that they are being talked about.<br>
<br>
I REALLY wish they would reinstate the limited range shout rule, nothing worse than stepping into a zone and getting nothing but red text.  Well except getting harm touched by that damn Unicorn...<br>
<br>
With the new UI many of these problems can be avoided by makeing a new text window but it would be nice to have commerce restricted once more, it seems odd to me to be in south Karana and some one is selling pies.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing is they need to get more GM/guides on &quot;fixing&quot; names.  The stupid names that people choose, and think they are being cute or funny or whatever is just sad and distracting.<br>
<br>
Oh well...at least this server is still better than 99% of all other servers.  I do kinda wish they had gone to 3 characters per account though...<br>

I would have been more than happy IC to fire off a quick 37 point heal and leave, since the dark elf on the ground was as much an enemy of the orcs as I was. Instead, I had to get the &quot;The spell cast cannot affect this character&quot; message. Someone had fallen fighting the things I was determined to fight at all costs, and all I could do was stand around and watch them die. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blayzemeduenin>Blayze Meduenin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/3/03 4:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3840.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Original Firiona Vie Ruleset (including Alignments)</span><hr size=1> I say restore ALL the old rules, as has been said that is what we signed up to, and all the other servers cater more than adequately for those who dont like them.<br>
<br>
Also add the rules on inapropriate names and ooc talk (good ideas)<br>
<br>
The only proposed change for may 8th i agreed with was more chrs (i would have left it at 2 not 3 though) and thats the ONLY one they didnt keep!<br>

now anyone on FV that wants to try something different has to either re-roll or pay more money for their server that now has hardly any difference than the others!!<br>

<br>
For every player that wants alignment restricted grouping back in, for example, there's another player that joined FV after the May 8th patch and has a multi-alignment guild and would want that rule left out.<br>
<br>
Personally I think a compromise <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>might</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> work.  Something along the lines of... alignments go back in, as do the XP bonuses / penalties for groups of similar / dissimilar alignments; but the grouping restrictions stay gone (a paladin and a shadowknight can still group, they just suffer an XP penalty while doing so).<br>
<br>
We probably wouldn't be able to get anything <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>new</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> added, because that would require new code, which requires $$, which is something SOE doesn't like to spend much of <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I won't go too far on this, but I will state the following:<br>
<br>
Without a GM and Guide tool to change/fix alignments, Alignments should not be reinstated.<br>
<br>
Without an INFORMATIVE interface for alignments, they should not be reinstated.<br>
<br>
Without a FV specific version of the LFG tool that takes alignment into account, they should not be reinstated.<br>
<br>
Without a change to how languages work in /chat and /chat tell, the languages should stay how they are.<br>
<br>
Without coding to bring into account faction for alignment, Alignments should not be reinstated.<br>
<br>
There need to be MORE alignment options for EVERY race and more deity options. IF this is the RP server, then we need choices and we need interaction with the GMs.<br>
<br>
Freeform doesn't cut it because, frankly, I have good reason not to trust some of the RPers on this server.<br>
<br>
I will state outright. I waged a war of /petition, /bug, /feedback and email to get the alignment rules revoked and/or changed. If the alignment grouping restriction is returned to the server, it will ruin my fun. If my fun is ruined, you can bet your fun will be ruined. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

Then you were a fool for coming here in the first place - with a load of other servers without alignments what idiotic urge made you come here.<br>

And having come here knowing what the rules were you have only my utter contempt for trying to change them.<br>

I am also well aware that the powers that be dont really give a shit.  What're you going to do?  Going to go play Ultima Online?  They have all of us by the short hairs, and they know it.  Plus, one other thing that most fail to realize is that people treat EQ as a video game and not a roleplaying game. personally, i think that the only way to make FV a true RP environment is to get rid of its special no drop rules.  this is the _only_ chance we have of getting rid of the &quot;fuckos&quot;.  (which is a more accurate term for the &quot;d00ds&quot;).  With the no drop rules changed, the fuckos have no reason to be there, and we can all start rping again.<br>
Granted this will cause the population of FV to drop, but it could actually increase again if you let people have even just 2 characters, so they feel they have room to experiment.<br>
