He sat is a slump against the stone walls, leading to the entrance into Highhold Keep. Closed his eyes once more and let the sun shine radiantly on the other side of his eyelids. A few more strings were plucked, then the sound of a coin hitting the ground where he sat. He opened one eye and watched a man adorned in shining steel armor walk by. Tavarain sat his lute on his lap and reached for the coin. He hurled it back in the mans direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;i am NOT a beggar..&quot; Tavarian shouted with a scowl. The man looked back and payed no attention, as he kept on wlaking. Tavarian sighed and clambered to his feet. He walked over and picked up the coin. He tucked it into his pocket, then looked around. <br>
<br>
Tavarian gathered his things and left the gate to the city. He managed to find his way through the twisting rocks of Highpass Hold. He came upon an inn called the golden rooster. Despite the rather seedy condition of the place he strolled inside. Placed his recently aqquired gold piece on the bar, and requested a cheese ale. the bar maid said she's never heard of such a thing. Tavarian sighed and asked for a tankard of honey mead. <br>
<br>
He slowly went at the drink. He went outside for some fresh air, and made his way up a somewhat steep rockface. The sun was setting, the sky was an array of purple and blues, and pinks. Tavarian had to make music. He reached the summiit of the large rock and sat his drink down. Pulled out his lute and began to play. <br>
<br>
Tavarian heard something in a cave a few yards form him. Tavarian felt somehting watching him but kept on playing, keeping watch out of the corner of his eye. The drow crept out of the shadows towards Tavarians turned back. the drow had no clue Tavarian sensed him. <br>
<br>
The dark elf lunged at Tavarians back with his dagger. Tavarian ducked and brought up and elbow into the drows stomach. Tavarian grabbed the dark elfs arm which wielded the dagger, and twsited it behind his back. He took the dagger from his dirty hands, then pushed the dark elf out in fornt of him. <br>
<br>
The dark elf fell to his knees. He looked up at tavarian and glared. Tavarian looked over the drows torn clothing, and weathered dirty skin. The drow was a transient who tried to rob the wrong foreigner. <br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of here... &quot; Tavarian exhaled in elvish. Hoping the dark elf would understand. The dark elf got up and began to back away. Tavarian nodded affirmitavley then looked aorund his feet for his lute. The drow saw this and rushed at Tavarian. Tavarian ducked and stepped out of the way, as the drow  crashed down toward the ledge of the cliff. The dark elf tried to hang on, his malnurishment depleted the strentgh form his body. <br>
<br>
Tavarian dove to the drow with his hand out, as the dark elf lost his grip. Tavarian caught him by the wrsit and tried to pull him up.<br>
<br>
&quot;give me your other hand!&quot; tavarian commanded loudly. The dark elf looked down, then back up at tavarian with a pale, emotionless expression. The shook his way free from Tavarians grip and he fell to the rocky floor some 50 feet below. He crashed in a heap right before a guard. The guard knelt and examined the body. The guard looked up to the ledge, but Tavarian was gone. <br>
<br>
Tavarian picked up his lute which had a broken string. Collected his pack and his honey mead. He looked at the rusty dagger that lay at his feet. Tavarian tucked it into his pack then made hs way down the rock face.<br>
