I am going to sketch out where this is going to go from here, because I can see the process has already begun and I have experienced it myself.  A significant section of people believe that no grievance should be brought here and that those who do are &quot;just as bad&quot; as those asocial people who break the rules.  You are already being roundly condemned for posting the logs because that is beyond the pale.  These people believe that the victims of others' poor behavior are &quot;just as guilty&quot; if they vocally complain.  You were smart in that you robbed them of their usual arguments; normally, they would tear you apart for not having taken the issue to the guild's leader before bringing it here, but you did that.  But that does not matter to these people; you are still &quot;just as guilty&quot; as far as they are concerned.  There are already libelous whisperings about things you have done--things like &quot;you're no saint, I've got logs of your bad behavior but I won't post them because I'm better than you&quot;.  You will be labeled as a &quot;whiner&quot; and an &quot;asshole&quot; for having brought this issue, and later, if you have another legitimate grievance, these people will write you off completely because you are &quot;always whining&quot;, and your reputation will suffer. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

<br>
For me, however there is the additional issue of Mythria's reputation. Im sure that is of concern to her as well... Consider the following:<br>
<br>
1] No one witnessed her do it, not even Aailin.<br>
<br>
2] The log contains nothing other than her taunting in character. This is after Aailin admitted (reluctantly, I might add; he only did so after ImperialSon mentioned it) that they were also taunting in character.<br>
<br>
Her taunts would prove nothing in a court of law. She *may* have been taunting after training them OR she may have been responding in kind. One can only speculate. It is *not* damning evidence.<br>
<br>
3] Tthere are people who have pointed out that it would have been difficult (if not impossible) for her to train those mobs, even had she wanted to.<br>
<br>
So we have Aailin admitting he did not witness her do it; we have her taunts in character, which could merely be retaliation for previous taunting (ie, she admits nothing in her taunts); and there has been doubt cast on her ability to have been the trainer in the first place.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I understand that many people are only concerned with Viv's response, and frankly I find that very disappointing, considering this thread has taken real shots at someones reputation based on what could well be circumstantial evidence.<br>
<br>
Robin: I understand the reasoning behind your last post, but it does ***NOT*** change the situation I mentioned above. Yes, Aailin did log the incident, and yes, he did approach it in a well-documented and correct manner. He should be appluaded for doing so. But does that make it correct to torpedo someone based on circumstantial evidence?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
As Ive said all along, there are two elements here: Viv's response and Mythria's guilt. I find dismissing Mythria's possible innocence to be grossly neglectful and offensive. I do think Aailin (who has steadfastly judged her as guilty) and everyone who has jumped on that bandwagon, especially in light of the circumstantial evidence presented, owes her an apology.<br>
<br>
If Aailin receives flack for that aspect of all this, I feel it is justified.<br>

Before I start, I should say that the opinions expressed here are ooc and I hope they won't have an effect on my guild.<br>
<br>
Never, ever, under any circumstances should people defend training.  Examples I have seen of defending training:<br>
<br>
1)  No one died:  Ah, I see, so the rule is, if you train and no one dies, then things are all cool.  Wow, I never knew that, I wish I would have got this addendum to the Play nice policies. <br>
<br>
2) If you raid a town, expect to be trained:  I love this one, because it is totally true.  Using the word &quot;expect&quot; changes everything.  I know I can expect to be trained because there are jackasses out there who would do this kind of thing.  Does this mean I have to like it?  Does this mean I have to accept it?  Does this mean its ok?<br>
<br>
3) You were taunting the people: Just for the sake of argument, let's assume this is true.  In fact, let's go as far as to say that all of them were cussing people out, beating on the poor Tier'dal kid in the alley, and stealing platnium from the town's banker.  If all these things were true, does that make training ok?  I'd like to think that there is a more mature way to handle things.  If not, use /petition.<br>
<br>
Ok, now that I have dealt with that, let me say that I understand why people defending the sisters.  Some people may of thought it was harsh to open this to the public.  Yes, this may be so, but I think all the poster was looking for was an apology or hell, maybe something as simple as the fact that she was going to look into it and take some sort of action.  What he got back wouldn't have satisfied me if I were in his shoes, so I probably would have done something.  Would I go to the boards?  Maybe not, but then again, I will not fault him for this action.<br>
<br>
Also, I do not think he was rash in accusing Mythria of the training.  I am looking at this situation from a totally indifferent point of view.  First, he says he saw her run past.  Ok, we can chalk that up to hearsay.  Next comes the logs.  Mythria knew of the event, becuase she said something about him running from sisters.  Does this make her the trainer?  Not at all, just puts her there at the time of the event.  Next, he sends a tell to the guildleader and Vivienne first response is she knows of her daughter's activities?  Hmm, if I were in his shoe, I would be more suspect, though there is still no proof.  This is the kicker for me, though again, this may be out of context, so it's not proof, but if I were him, I'd probably be convinced:<br>
<br>
&quot;nobody did . so she used her brain to get revenge upon those who normally couldn't&quot;<br>
<br>
No straight out confession of training, though I believe I would assume the &quot;she&quot; is Mythria and the &quot;revenge&quot; was training, but these are both assumptions.  Given these things, I would have come to the same conclusion.  <br>
<br>
Hell, even after the event in question, I am still puzzled by one of Mizzery's responses.  In this thread ( <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=1337.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...1337.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) Mizzery writes a paragraph about &quot;Are you positive Mythria trained you?&quot;  Aren't you an officer, don't you know what happened?  The fact that you would question if he knows instead of flat out saying, &quot;I have talked with my sister, and she claims she had no part of it&quot; bothers me.  I see three scenarios for you.  1) You haven't talked to Mythria, in which case you don't have all the facts, so making him look like the guilty one isn't exactly the right thing to do.  2) You talked to her, and she claims she did it, in which case you shouldn't put up these questions and are doing so just out of spite.  3)  You talked to her and she claims she didn't do it, in which case, you should have stated that you talked to her, and you don't believe him.<br>
<br>
The posters only flaw here in this was implicating the whole guild.  The actions of a few people in a guild should not reflect the guild as a whole.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry if I have offended anyone by defending the poster, but I believe that alot of things are being said against him are completely unfair, and I cannot in good conscious keep my mouth closed.<br>

The sad fact is that most guild leaders behave like this.  They usually believe their guildmates over strangers their guildmates have wronged.  They are often as blind about the faults of their guildmates as parents are blind about the faults of their children.  They also know that there is really nothing that someone bringing a grievance to them can do to them.  There are some stock excuses guildleaders will use to absolve themselves of any culpability: &quot;I wasn't there&quot;, &quot;I know her/him and s/he wouldn't do that kind of thing&quot;, &quot;Why should I believe you, a stranger, over her/him, my friend?&quot;, &quot;S/he's denying s/he had anything to do with it, and I stand by her/him.&quot;  Taking things to a guild's leader is useless.<br>
<br>
This situation would not have happened if the guild's leader had simply said &quot;I'm sorry that happened to you.  I'll look into the matter and take appropriate action.&quot;  Those words, especially &quot;sorry&quot;, do not appear to be in most guild leaders' vocabularies, and this particular guild leader is not an exception.<br>
<br>
There is a lesson to be learned here for all guild leaders.  Apologies go a lot further towards assuaging bad feelings than defensiveness and they cost nothing to give.  Apologizing for a guildmate's bad behavior does not make your guild look bad.  If someone believes your guildmate has wronged them, arguing with them about it will make them think the entire guild is bad, while apologizing will lead them to believe it was genuinely an accident.  Unfortunately, I think this lesson will get lost in all the shouting (and because I am the one articulating it).<br>
<br>
There is also a lesson to be learned here for the rest of us.  Everyone says that you should take grievances to the guild's leadership, but my own experience confirms Aailin's story.  Guild leadership is more interested in saving face than resolving disputes.  If you want a dispute resolve, taking it to a guild's leadership will not be fruitful.  Taking it here will not be fruitful, either, because a significant number of people here believe that anyone with a complaint is &quot;just a whiner&quot; and your reputation suffers, too, not because it should, but because popular opinion is irrational.<br>
<br>
That leaves only two courses of action:<br>
1) do nothing, or<br>
2) /petition and /report quietly, put the person on /ignore if need be<br>
...and then go about your business. <p>"These discourses of heterosexuality oppress us in the sense that they prevent us from speaking unless we speak in their terms."<BR>

<br>
That's where the difference between a good guild and a bad guild lies: good guilds care about their reputations and take steps to preserve them even in the face of injust opposition. They do so through courtesy and respect, not temper tantrums or defensiveness. <br>
<br>
Good guild leaders listen to all complaints courteously and then take steps to resolve the complaint in a way that benefits all people involved, members and nonmembers. Bad guild leaders say, &quot;I don't care what you or anyone thinks. I must defend my member tooth and nail.&quot; <br>
<br>
I've led guilds, and showing courtesy and respect towards others goes a long way in resolving potentially ugly disputes.<br>
<br>
Mizzery took some pretty good steps toward that goal; Vivienne did not. <br>
<br>
So please, do go to guildleaders first, because if it is a good guild, the leader will listen to you and do his own investigation before dismissing your issue. And there are lots of good guilds out there; problem is, they usually have the type of people who don't need reporting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

I dont usually take intense exception to things, but I am highly displeased at being called &quot;irrational&quot; because I dont rush to judgement on people, and Im disappointed that so few people give a damn about the Mythria's possible innocence.<br>

<br>
For what it's worth: I don't hold Myth responsible for anything. If she *did* train Aailin, it was her GL responsibility to tell her she was wrong. If she didn't train Aailin, it is her guild leader's responsibility to investigate the matter and let Aailin know he has the wrong person. She didn't so much as even deny Myth did it when Aailin approached her, and in fact, if you read the logs, Viv seems to applaud that Myth may have trained Aailin. <br>
<br>
THAT'S the problem. Right off the bat, Aailin was thwarted from using the appropriate channels, and had to come here. If Myth has a bad reputation because of it, it's because Vivienne did not take the proper steps to remedy the situation when she was approached, NOT because Aailin came here with his grievance. <br>
<br>
I honestly don't think anyone is holding Myth responsible. I can't even remember how to spell the girl's name---that's how little I noticed her role. The crime here was committed by Vivienne, not Myth, and Vivienne has yet to state definitively that training, for ANY reason, is prohibited in her guild.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugnosisgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GnosisGnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/5/02 4:06:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=198>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sister of Myth...dishonored and griefers</span><hr size=1> Lasgalen,<br>

Let me open this with the disclaimer that I don't wish to be perceived as saying something nice about SoM or their guildleader. I know very little about the guild firsthand, and what little I know is negative. About their leadership I know nothing.<br>
<br>
I have to disagree with the spirit of what you have said, however, when you wrote<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The sad fact is that most guild leaders behave like this.

In the truth of what you say, you may be right. Most guild leaders do tend to give the benefit of the doubt to their guildies. I think, however, that this is a good thing for the most part. One should listen to complaints and should confront one's guldies with accusations against them, but if it degenerates into a &quot;he said/she said,&quot; in the end one must trust in one's own guildie. If you cannot trust your guildies, then the problem runs deep into recruitment, not in any particular incident.<br>
<br>
When I say I disagree with the spirit of what you have said, I mean this: Just because there is a good chance that your complaints will not be taken seriously does not mean you should not take the incident to the guildleader (or some other officer, if the guildleader is unavailable). Sure, there are some guilds out there with some pretty piss-poor officers, but you should always give them the opportunity first. If a guildleader abdicates her responsibility or, even worse, encourages nastiness (such as appears to be the situation here), then it becomes appropriate to bring the issue before the larger community.<br>
<br>
You seem to be suggesting that because some guilds (maybe even most as you suggest) have poor leadership, the victim should not bother with informing the guild. I can speak for at least ONE guild on this server to say that such complaints are always taken seriously, even when the outcome is not to the petitioner's liking. I would hate to think that some of my guildies are out there violating the EULA or the PNP and no one is telling us for fear that they may be ignored.<br>
<br>
If I were a betting gnome, I'd be willing to bet that Ledenyetz Troupe isn't the only guild for which your statement that &quot;Taking things to a guild's leader is useless&quot; is untrue. I'm also willing to bet that there are officers in other guilds out there WANT to hear of misconduct by their members so that they can deal with it before that bad apple spoils the whole barrel.<br>

<br>
Please read this and think about it so you understand where I am coming from. Those of us who are angry at Vivienne are angry because we are basing our anger on facts, not circumstantial evidence. For my part, the reason Myth's role in the training is irrelevant is because I do not know for sure whether she did or did not. THAT is why I'm not up in arms over Myth's situation, because I have not determined that she actually did or did not start the train. Thus, I can't feel passionate about her guilt or innocence. <br>
<br>
However, there are certain facts in the log, which no one has denied as being authentic. Vivienne's response to Aailin's grievance clearly shows that she knew something was going on and that she condoned whatever it was. Also, she did not deny outright that Myth did the training. Instead, she applauded such ingenuity.<br>
<br>
So, I am upset about the things I *know* to be true, not the things I don't know to be true. Does that make more sense? <br>
<br>
I don't know whether Myth trained Aailin or not. I DO know that Vivienne's response was inappropriate and inconsiderate. That's why I'm focusing on Vivienne and not on injustice done to Myth. Do you understand now?<br>
