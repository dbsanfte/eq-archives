<br>
As a Ranger (I opted to not go with a Druid, as I had decided in a previous thread -- as if there were any less Rangers), it is my &quot;duty,&quot; so to speak, to keep the area free of those who would harm it. So, during what would otherwise be downtime, I'll approach a random character and initiate a conversation; &quot;What brings you here?&quot; These are the reactions I received.<br>
<br>
• &quot;language training&quot;<br>
• &quot;excitment&quot;<br>
• &quot;i came here cause some girl was gonna sell me something, but i shouldnt have cause she was charging too much&quot;<br>
• &quot;wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuppppppppppppppp&quot;<br>
• &quot;afk&quot;<br>
• &quot;Nothing&quot;<br>
<br>
In the last case, a conversation followed. I said, &quot;I trust you have no ill wishes towards these lands. If so, you will pay the price of death.&quot; This doesn't differ much from the NPC dialogue in the zone, so I didn't really think of it as particularly menacing. I left the area, and awhile later I got a tell from one of the individuals in question. &quot;dont threaten me im a ranger i will kill you.&quot; I generally don't roleplay at all in tells, since it would indicate that my character was capable of at least some telepathic communication.<br>
<br>
&quot;(I'm a Ranger.)&quot;<br>
&quot;dont approach me ever again your an idiot yes a ranger im excepting but an idoit none the less i will kill you if you ever threaten me again ive been here since before you were aiove (I assume this means &quot;alive&quot;) .&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't bother to respond, since this only reaffirmed my belief that some people take this game way too seriously. Also, I was KSed in a circumstance where I obviously didn't need help (a gnoll pup? c'mon), and got trained twice, both of which led to my death.<br>
<br>
Another conversation included a Half Elf telling me that he would burn down Surefall Glade. I told him he would be killed if he did, and then he tried to /duel me. I asked him why he wanted to slay me, and he said that he didn't. I told him about my intent (to ensure the protection of the forest), and he expressed to me that he'd just cast a &quot;combust spell&quot; and nobody would try to stop him unless he hurt a living being. I explained that plant life is still life. He then called me &quot;little,&quot; which is kind of funny, since Humans are larger than Half Elves. When I pointed this out, he demanded that I go away.<br>
<br>
Oh well. I mean, granted, this could just be close-mindness. All of this could be perfectly acceptable roleplay. I just hope that I didn't &quot;miss the boat&quot; as far as this thing goes, and that all the real roleplayers aren't at high levels that I won't acquire until they're ready to quit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukreelosthehunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreelos the Hunter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 3:38:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1172.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I enjoyed our brief scene</span><hr size=1> I hope I did not disturb you too much by giving an OOC lesson on how food works.<br>

Language training is an OOC thing, but you CAN play it out like it's IC.  For instance, if I'm an Erudite, I may travel to Qeynos and desire to find a half elf tutor to teach me Elvish.  No reason that can't be roleplay.<br>
<br>
Excitement...well, isn't that the reason to go anywhere once you bar loot and xp?  There's lots of places I like to go that I consider more exciting than the safe places to grind xp or get great loot.  Befallen is my all time fav hang out, enough that once I get upper in levels I think I'll make that my gnomes 'home.'  But there's safer xp to be had in The Warrens, Blackburrow, Kurn's Tower, and a host of other places with much better xp or loot or both.  At the same levels I might be moving from the second to third floor I could be killing Sisters of Erollisi and making loads of money doing it.  It gets boring playing the rinse and repeat game though.<br>
<br>
The quest for better items only to be disappointed at a price the buyer can't meet can lead to some fun adventures.  If someone were to tell me of their inability to afford some INT jewelry, I'd take them to Cuburt beneath Qeynos.  That's one of my favorite places to fight, in the aqueducts, and I can't do the earring quest anyways due to faction, but I could help someone else do it and maybe earn a friend.  If I can earn a friend and convert an iffy person to roleplaying, that's a mega bonus.<br>
<br>
Eh...the rest I would have ignored. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'd have loved to find roleplayers when I was around and about...I didn't feel unique enough as a ranger though, nor as a druid.  I'd swear with all the rangers and druids in Norrath that not the entire pantheon combined could result in harming a single tree if all their power were combined. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Take heart.  There's likely roleplayers out there, just keep acting in-character!  There are people out there like me, who love to roleplay but are shy about it, who generally stay quiet until someone else comes along that they can reveal the RP side to.  Keep up the hope! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1172.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1172.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1172.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1172.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1172.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1172.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
