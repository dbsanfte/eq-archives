<br>
 The Orc Centurians under his care strained at the task. Sweat rolling from their bodies. Working with rusty weapons until the day they would be issued the weapons of war. Everyday preparation continued for the coming war. Everyday raids into the headquarters occurred. Their numbers increased everyday it was only a matter of time until Emperor Crush would order the Legions to attack. <br>
<br>
Orc Trainer shook his head. The newer recruits worked hard,but they weren't making the progress that was needed.The Emperor Himself had told him that the numbers of trained Orcs was growing. Soon he would have enough to push the accursed Elves from the Forest. Eventhough his efforts had caught the eye of the Emperor and earned him the Shiny Brass Sheild; he knew his efforts were not enough. There needed to be more trainers. It took so long to get a trainer trained and ready to take his place in the ranks. Just like it took a long time to train the Orc Emissaries. Just not enough time! Just not enough time!<br>
<br>
Lasonta knocked the dust from his clothes. It had been a long run from the coast to the Tree city. The small peoples here made there city for their own use. Many times had he tried to enter the Inns for a drink only to be unable to squeeze throught the door. &quot;Oh well, the Hi' Ones may look down o' me, but me money spends well in the Inns and stores.&quot; thought Lasonta. Talk and cries of Orc invasions had everyone in town edgy. Some say there are treasures to be had in Crushbone. Others say only death would be your reward.<br>
 <br>
&quot;With me purse feeling light may'be I'll be wanting some of that treasure for me self&quot;, thought Lasonta.<br>
<br>
     With that he hitched on his armor and checked the sharpeness of his weapons. Yea. The mace was looking a little worn, but it would do. The Foil was still as shiny as the day  it be bought off the stranger to Halas. It was a strange weapon that spoke to me as I fought. I kept telling me I didna have the will to use it. Maybe some day I will. The stranger said it came from a land called Veela-ness. Perhaps one day I will see this land for myself. For now it had served me well. Ho, that was an under statement. Many a Ice Boned skeleton felt it's strength. <br>
    Enough of this thankin time to find some treasure. Toward the gates of Crushbone I went. <br>
<br>
     On the train mound, the training continued. The Orc trainer could taste a tang in the air. A storm was brewing. He could feel the wind blowing form the west. That was unusual this time of year. Well back to the grind. Today those under him were doing pretty good. Ugre and Teloc would graduate to Legionaire today. They showed great promise. The newest pawns had shown some progress. Tonight a naming ceremony would take place and the pawn was be granted names to go with there new status as Orc Centurions. It is a good day even with the storm coming. Rumor had it that the 24th legion would be activated this evening. Good. Good. Crush had said that when he had 40 legions all of The Forest would fall to him. Soon. Soon. <br>
<br>
       At the entrance to Crushbone, a battle raged. The bodies of many types of peoples littered the ground as did the uncountable number of orcs. Most of the orcs had there attentions on younger warriors. I was able to slip by unseen. I entered Crushbone proper. Even here the battle raged. I spied a large hill in front of me. Perhaps I could see the lay of the land from there. I climbed the steep hill. On top was some sort of train ground. Young Orcs fought each other in mock combat. &quot;I think I need some room to see alone&quot;, thought Lasonta. I struck and stuck again. The Orcs in there numbers fell. All crying out for the Orc Trainer or that the Legion would get me. Who were these orcs? A voice cried out behind me as I finished to last of the young ones. &quot;How dare you kill my students!&quot; &quot;You will pay for this!&quot; I returned my with my battle cry , &quot; I have ruined my lands, Now I will riun yours!&quot; <br>
     Sparks flew from the clash of weapons. &quot;Ahh, I had met someone worth my effort at last, &quot;, thought Lasonta. The Orc Trainer thought to himself, &quot;He has some little skill, but he will soon fall to my superior skill&quot; The battle raged back and forth the advantage swapped between these two warriors. The pleasure of a hard fought battle rose in Lansonta. &quot;By Rallos, he is good!&quot; Then Lansonta stuck with a blow to the right arm of the Trainer. Piercing his bicep and slicing the artery. The Orc Trainer feeling the wound and feeling his strength going tried to run. Blows feel on him faster and harder.  With his last thoughts &quot;What a waste, what a waste as he looked one last time at all his students dead at his feet.&quot; With that he fell heavily to the ground. <br>
     Breathing heavily, Lansonta felt to his knees. By Rallos! The battle took a lot out of him. After catching his breath. Lasonta examined the body of the Orc. different than the Orcs of home and different from the Orcs from Freeport. What is this? A nice shield inscribed with &quot;For your efforts to advance our cause&quot; &quot;Emperor Crush&quot; Wonder who this Crush fella is? After surveying the land, Lasonta moved toward the hill to the East. &quot;I wonder what is there?&quot; he thought. <br>
      After Lasonta left the training field, the Warlord looked up from his paper work and out the window. The training field is empty! He turns to the Legionaire to his left. &quot;Find out what happened and report back here!&quot; he snapped. The legionaire  trotted out to find out. <br>
