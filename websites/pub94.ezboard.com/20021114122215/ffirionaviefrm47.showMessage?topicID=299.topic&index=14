If you're looking for a guild, I'd strongly reccomend looking into Dreadstorm.  Just to restate/add a few points, we're a fairly high end guild in a fairly unique spot on the high-end scale (above a lot of the 'lower high end' and high enough to do some of the things/mobs the three other 'high end' guidls do); we kill/do a lot of the mobs/things that you seem to be interested in trying (Kunark dragons, the Va'Dyn, Halls of Testing, etc; working on/very close to other things in that kind of range - UP bosses, Rhaggs, etc).  We look primarialy for cool and skilled players who know their class and the game well, and who're interested in having fun over loot and a heavy raiding schedule (although our raids are gradually increasing).<br>
<br>
Don't just listen to all this stuff though, come talk and raid with us sometime, see what we're like.  I'll try to invite you to some stuff with us, though you might want to talk to some of the officers, too (Inxihuinxi, Misterie, Braellar and Arynn come to mind..  sorry others who I'm forgetting! *duck*).  I think you'd fit in with Dreadstorm really well, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Awakened Souls/Souls Arisen is disbanded, at least they effectively are.  Eight or nine members, well ex-members now, have all applied en mass to Fire and Fury.  This now swings the momentum from Reso to FnF, as their average daily raiding force will most likely exceed Resolutions.  <br>
<br>
As far as my endorcement of Dreadstorm.  While I found DS raids very enjoyable, they are much to much &quot;pick up&quot; for my taste.  Fore the two or three weeks I asked to join them, I joined them for only a single raid.  Becasue their raiding is dependent on people showing up, one can never be sure when and if a raid will mataralize.  Should Dreadstorm cement their raid schedule into something  more concrete, I'd endorce trying them as a raiding guild, until then I'd take a wait and see attitude.  The establishment of a raid schedule, especially one that involves daytime (in North America) raiding, would allow the easy assemblage of raiders who would willing join DS (applicants or not).<br>
<br>
I'd suggest DS and NC host open raids.  While this wouldn't necessarily mean that they would attract members, they may start forming the relationships necessary to do inter guild raiding with, like the Fellowship does now.<br>

<br>
The DS raid schedule is pretty much cemented, we have a fixed guild raid on saturday (generally a big time comitment raid like one of the planes or HoT) and we do epic raids on the sunday. Friday nights are generally left for impromtue luclin boss mobs (depending on who is up). For each of the raids above we generally have 20-30 guild members attend.<br>
<br>
Our weekday raids however are very much pickup... if we have enough people on who are bored of grinding.... we will pick a target and go off and do it... if not people will continue grinding.<br>
<br>
I very much doubt that DS will start scheduling regular weekday raids like the big 3(2), this is one the things that set us apart from them. If you wish to find a guild that has a 24/7 raid schedule then I would suggest looking elsewhere.<br>

I enjoy a heavy raid schedule, and it is from that perspective alone that I posted my assessment of Dreadstorm, AS, FnF, and Resolution.  So when I compair Dreadstorm to raiding fanatics like Resolution and Fire and Fury, they simply won't measure up.  Fire and Fury has a raid schedule thats practically set in stone, I knew if I logged on any day other then a Sunday or Tuesday, there would be a raid waiting.  This is less true with Resolution in my opinion, and again less so with Dreadstorm.<br>
<br>
Dreadstorm however offers an attractive environment to the less dedicated, or more casual EQ players, those who have their weekends open, and don't mind a low key environment. Were I to measure guilds attractiveness, or unattractiveness, to say how much profanity and cyborz their chat channels have, I'd not give FnF, Reso, or AS a passing grade.  Each guild has their share of potty mouths, with Dreadstorm having much less so.  <br>
<br>
So while other guilds may score high in the Raiding department, Dreadstorm has its share of attractive characteristics.  Characteristics that while not ideal for me personally, might be ideal to a larger share of available players, who are unattached with guilds.<br>

Over all, FnF guild chat has more dripping sexual innuendo, insults, and general profanity then say Resolutions channel chat.  While this is more abbrasive then my personal taste would normally allow, its something I could tolerate as long as FnF raided hard and often.  However, FnF's guild chat reads like the transcript of a bible study when compaired to another guilds channel, now disbanded.  I had to unscrew my skull cap and wash my brain out with soap after one particular raid.<br>

We want the same end game as everyone else, but we won't break the /guildinvite filter to get there   over night. To us it's far more important to recruit people who simply enjoy playing the game together while raiding whatever, than it is to recruit the toons that will crush NToV and beyond by next week. FnF, Reso and the now defunct AS gave Dreadstorm a huge advantage there by offering an upper level tier to the people who want the end game now. That allowed us, and continues to allow, a gradual growth and a cohesivness built around our personal relationships with each other first and game encounters and loot second. <br>
<br>
As far as raiding goes, we raid every Saturday and Sunday, and hit single encounter dragons, luclin mobs or whatever two or three times during the course of the week.  Saturdays our raids typically will focus on strengthening the guild. Sundays, we raid for member epics. That could be a single planar raid, or multiple epic quest targets throughout Norrath.<br>
<br>
And yes we have very little potty talk. <p><CENTER>

Certainly, you can play only on weekends and be dedicated, or play every day and be fanatical about it.  I come from a fanatical background, and that is the status quo for me.  As I said, I enjoyed raiding with Dreadstorm, and under the right conditions would do so again.  But, I'm looking for a raid schedule greater then what Dreadstorm can provide.   You offer a refreshing change in raid environment, in any case.  <br>
<br>
I stand by my assessment:<br>
<br>
Raiding: C+  Raids infrequently, with adequate leadership.<br>
Atmosphere: A-  Cleanest guild chat I've encountered on FV.<br>
Membership: C  Raid force could be larger, with a greater presence of clerics and pullers.<br>
<br>
Overall, a good report card.<br>
<br>
FnF might get a:<br>
<br>
Raiding: A+  They raid really good.<br>
Atmosphere: D  Chat gets so hot steam rises from it frequently.<br>
Membership: Incomplete grade, were getting a B, AS/SA applicants are likely to increase this to an A.<br>
<br>
Resolution might get a:<br>
<br>
Raiding: A-  Good solid raiding guild.<br>
Atmosphere:  B-  Largely an unoffensive chat environment.<br>
Membership: C+  Large fluxuation in raid attendance, often six clerics even with a 12 cleric roster.  Alot of monks.<br>
<br>
Order of the Oaken:<br>
<br>
Raiding: F  Guild practically never raided, and when it did it got ugly for us.<br>
Atmosphere: C-  Powerstruggles within leadership = ugly..<br>
Membership: F  Guild was half druids, had a single warrior for a long time.  It was a halfling guild, so demographically it was squed..<br>
<br>
I enjoyed my raid time and/or membership with all of the above, even anemic Order of the Oaken.  <br>
<br>
Going up the EQ encounter ladder nice and easy is just as good in my opinion, as clawing up it fast and furious.  I'm not knocking Dreadstorm, you've found your nitch on FV, your like an EQ Australia, overflowing with marcipuals, and ecogocially radically different from the remainder of the EQ guild continents.  Thats weird analogy, but I'll stand by it to. =)<br>
<br>
Once again, I'm not knocking DS Zarsiss, just doing the compair and contrast thing with them.<br>
