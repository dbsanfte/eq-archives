His joints crackled in anguish, as he had been kneeling for the duration.  He relaxed again and focused his eyes on the far side of the lake.<br>
<br>
The chants of war echoed off in the distance.  Fire danced upon the lake, howls of foreign tongues filled the air, loud enough to hear, but fading to a whisper when Cook strained to listen to them.<br>
<br>
The force of magic was with him strongly tonight.  He felt the mana surround him, and his eyes glistened at every step he took towards the Arena.<br>
<br>
All those who dare to threaten and insult his allies would share the same fate.<br>
<br>
Surely he would not survive the endevour, as the blades of war always seem to have a way of reaching him.<br>
<br>
But he would drop as many of the misguided fools as he could, including Gore the Mad.<br>
<br>
He would burn them ALL to the ground until he was spent.  And then he would continue fighting until his body lay still.<br>
<br>
Lord Solusek would not let his disciple lay forever slain, Cook mused.  And everyone loves a good bonfire...<br>

Neither side stands to gain any sort of immense power from this confrontation (which is why we got involved in the first two battles - to prevent Innorruuk from gaining mad powerz). All that will come from this as far as we can see is that one faction will kill the other. Since Cabilis is enemy to both factions, we don't really care who kills whom. So Skathris Ven'Sho has no plans to attend. (All we'd do if we did show up is go in and try to kill all the stragglers left at the end.)

Huge armies had gathered and finally arranged themselves into some semblance of order.  Alliances and allegiances based on many factors other than merely dark against light had made for interesting blends of friends and foes, Rozemarijn mused...<br>
<br>
Then, the waiting had begun, and the rumors started.<br>
<br>
Would he show?  With more force than was already representing him in one corner of the Arena?  Did certain groups indeed suddenly change sides?  <br>
<br>
The excitement had continued to build till the arena air crackled like fireworks.<br>
<br>
Finally he had arrived.  And in a sealed Arena they faced off. Lizard, Vampire, races mixed and then segregated.<br>
<br>
Gore fell.  Rozemarijn had pondered his corpse and wondered what would be next for him.  But there was not much time to stand and muse.  For at the Lizard's death, War did break loose indeed.<br>
<br>
Roze thought that he had achieved that as he wished, even though he had not remained standing long enough to witness it himself.  And she could not help but be a tad bit intrigued, for just a fleeting moment.<br>
<br>
Then, the joyous realization set in!  The Bazaar would be a safe and free dwelling place for her once again!<br>
<br>
Eyes shining and coinpurse at the ready, she set off for some LONG overdue shopping.....<br>

A fine cloud of dust rose from the sands, kicked up by a myriad restless feet, creating a haze in the air and making the horses cough.  In the shadows of the Arena, shadowed figures slipped back and forth on secret errands, wishing to remain anonymous, while outside the murmur of the assembled crowds rose and fell interspersed with the clash of steel.<br>
<br>
Mustering his supporters near the entry, Lord Thrads von Teppish was an impressive sight as he sat astride his black stallion, shouting instructions and rallying support.  By his side were a  slender cloaked figure, and the slim necromancer Mizzery, her adamantite armour glinting in the light.  Close by stood Kazanti Er’Idine, displaying the banner of the Conclave of the Damned; Naught Headstomper leading Prime Nightmare; Veniemi Kult'Ressin standing proud amongst House Kith'Dring; and Didi D'Aryth, the banner of the League of Shadows fluttering from the tip of her spear, a short dwarf by the name of Ollias at her side wearing the insignia of the Twilight Bastion. <br>
<br>
On the far side of the Arena, Warlord Gore Bloodlust assembled his own allies.  The Lust for Blood banner flew bravely above, as Gore's faithful guild prepared their weapons for battle.  Ayida Winnower sharpened her twin blades at Gore's left hand, and his right hand position remained open, awaiting the arrival of his sworn defender Priestess Xadria.<br>
<br>
The shadows swept across the arena as the sundial marked the swift passing of time.  Gore's followers began to look concerned, as the priestess Xadria and those supporters she had promised were still missing, and the appointed hour drew close. <br>
<br>
As the noon hour approached, one of Thrads' servants stepped forth.  With the fanfare of a bugle, the armies entered the arena, and the mighty doors were sealed.  Gore and Thrads met in front of the main platform, and eyed each other across the sands.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Your madness must end, hatchling.&quot; Thrads stated in a calm voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rallos Zek has promised me glory as his champion as I meet you in battle, elf,&quot; Gore responded.  &quot;There will be no escape for the servant of Mayong Mistmoore!  I shall show you as much mercy as you showed Rieux when you slew her in cold blood on our wedding night!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what of your kidnapping and torture of Thrads' wife Ellishae, and the maiming of two of his children?&quot; demanded Mizzery, indignantly.  &quot;Do you think you can threaten and harm Thrads while his friends stand by watching?&quot;<br>
<br>
Thrads silenced Mizzery with a sharp gesture of his hand.  &quot;The time for debate is past.  Justifications will not restore my children.  And Ellishae ... there is much still to be revealed.&quot;  Thrads gestured towards the assembled ranks of Lust for Blood.  &quot;Gore!  It seems that your supporters run in fear!  What happened to your mighty priestess - your sworn protector - and the armies she promised you?  My forces outnumber yours ten to one - has Rallos deserted you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Gore hissed, narrowing his eyes.  &quot;You have intercepted my supporters somehow, this reeks of your treachery.  You undermine my forces rather than face a fair fight!  But I will not lead my brave guild members to their deaths simply to satisfy your megalomania.  Let this be between your forces and me alone!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Gesturing to Lust for Blood to stand down, Gore slid his swords from their sheaths, and approached Thrads alone.  &quot;Thrads, now YOU die!!&quot;<br>
<br>
As Gore charged towards Thrads, the battle began in earnest.  Gore's supporters remained faithful to their leader's instructions, though it clearly infuriated them to remain inactive while Gore fought for his life.<br>
<br>
Thrads' allies soon surrounded Gore, cutting him off from reach of Thrads.  The outcast Iksar's twin weapons flashed in the sunlight, glowing blue and red with their magical energies, as he wove a protective  shield about him with his blades.  His tail alone swept more than a few foes off their feet, while his swords kept those in front of him busy.<br>
<br>
The battle seemed impossible - there was no way a single warrior could withstand the onslaught of so many.  Yet against reason, Gore remained standing, and the piles of bodies at his feet grew with every passing minute.  Never had a warlord's blades flown so fast and so true.  Soon the attackers were stumbling over the bodies of the slain, having to climb over their fallen allies in order to reach the Iksar, yet still he stood strong.  For a period it seemed that time stood still, itself mesmerized by the intricate  patterns woven by Gore's blades.  Thrads exchanged a concerned glance with the robed figure at his side.  Surely this level of skill was beyond mortal endurance, could it be that Gore actually did have divine support?<br>
<br>
Yet at last, inevitably, Gore succumbed to an error.  His left blade dipped slightly, allowing a blow to slip past and damage his forearm.  Redoubling their cries, Thrads' allies pressed the lizard harder yet, taking advantage of his injury.  Unable now to protect his left side, Gore's strength gave way at last. Dropping his weapons, he fell to his knees in the sand, as his scaly hide grew slick with his own life's blood.  Gmek of Dark Affliction struck the killing blow, and Gore's body collapsed onto the warm sands. Yet as he fell, Gmek noted that the look on Gore's face was not that of defeat, but rather, something strangely resembling elation.<br>
<br>
A hush fell over the Arena as Gore's soul left his body.  Thrads stepped forward and replaced the Iksar's fallen weapons in his hands.  Standing up again, he spoke quietly: &quot;it is done.  Gore's madness is ended.&quot;   Those still standing lowered their heads in respect, and a moment passed in silence.  <br>
<br>
Thrads spoke once more.  &quot;He was a mighty warrior before the madness possessed him, and led him to this point.  He believed that Rallos Zek himself called him to be His champion, and his skill today seems indeed to have been a gift from the gods, beyond normal mortal ability.  Perhaps Rallos Zek made true His promise to Gore, although not in quite the way that Gore expected ... Beware indeed the promises of Gods, for we often hear what we wish, not what they truly offer!&quot;<br>
<br>
Thrads gestured to Gore's allies, who assembled on the sands.  Saluting their leader, they knelt, lifted the heavy body, and carried the fallen champion out of the arena.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Gore has died a champion's death indeed, and let us honour him for that.  May his reincarnation be at peace, and free of Zek's madness.&quot; <br>
<br>

A few minutes after Gore went down we entered the arena. There was confusion abound as the war seemed over and fear tugged at my heart as I saw our small force surrounded by a sea of evils. Our noble paladin Wyndsor engaged a foul drow shadowknight of the guild Dreadstorm(Braellar I think his name was), I set about healing our knight and Meledi engaged as well. The shadowknight caught on to my heavy healing, he was putting out some serious damage, and switched his wicked blade to me. I went into a defensive backpetal only to be struck by some bolt from somewhere. At this point the world began to fade and I dragged myself, to what I thought, was a safe spot to lick my wounds. As I gathered enough magical energy to begin healing myself I was cut down by the fell blade of the same shadowknight.<br>
<br>
We were avenged by a fair wizardess and her companion who saw our demise, to this I am greatful. And to the members of Dreadstorm and their ilk, this is not finished, we will have our day yet..<br>
