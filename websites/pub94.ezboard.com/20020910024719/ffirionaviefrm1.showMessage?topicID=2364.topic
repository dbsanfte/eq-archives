<br>
I was just thinking back a bit and remembering what it was about this game, EverQuest, that was truely special.<br>
<br>
There are two distinct types of memories that I have about this game.  The first type is the memories of when I was a newbie.  Unfamiliarity, immersion, and scale.  Experiences that I can never get back because I now know what to look for as far as landmarks (zone lines, zone walls, etc) and because I've seen most every zone there is to see.<br>
<br>
The other type of memory is of experiences and accomplishments.  Those types of memories are far more recent, but still are predominantly in the past.<br>
<br>
I started thinking about my fondest memories of this game and realized that most all of them came while grouped.  Dungeons in EverQuest are so...alive...so filled out and full of stories when compared to games such as Dark Ages of Camelot and Anarchy Online that it's almost magical.  Do you remember the first time stumbling upon the map room in Solusek's Eye?  How about seeing the face of Innorruk painted on the wall of the High Shaman room?  Even something as small as the dart boards there?  Do you remember wondering why water was hanging in mid air in the hand room of Lower Guk?  Do you remember wondering why the Hell the Sentinel was so far out of the way?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I started thinking about all the dungeons that I've seen and been through (which is all of them with the exception of VT) and realized that I've never really run across a truely bad dungeon.<br>
<br>
Exploring the world of Norrath has been an absolute joy for me.  Something that the people who started after Kunark and only soloed in the exp treadmills of LoIO, OT, DL, etc really never got to experience.  And, of course, those memories came almost exclusivly while grouped.  The social interaction with other people playing the game, in addition to the challenge and wonderful design of the dungeons, made this game truely memorable for me.<br>
<br>
I can understand the frustration of dieing when you're in an outdoor zone and some wandering bigass red mob comes stumbling down on you, wiping out your party.  I can understand the disappointment and the harshness towards the death penalties when a death is caused via training or carelessness amongst other players.  But I've actually had deaths that were genuinly fun.  Deaths that came as a result of combat that was so intense...so gripping...so immersive that rather than bitching at Verant for making death so harsh, you should be thanking Verant for making that death memorable and interesting!<br>
<br>
So, here comes my question to you all...<br>
<br>
What are your most memorable times in this game?  Do they involve groups of friends?  Were they enhanced by the game and world Verant built, or would they have happened even if Verant would have put out a vanilla wrapper game with boring dungeons and uninteresting spawns?  Why do you play and love this game?<br>
<br>
Everyone bitches about downtime.  Everyone bitches about camping.  Everyone bitches about class balance.  So in the face of all this, what did Verant do right?<br>
<br>
In my mind, Verant gave us a world in which to exist.  A world that was interesting, compelling, and genuinly challenging.  A world you could get wrapped up in and lose yourself in.  A world that was at its very best when you were with friends fighting together.<br>
<br>
So what do you all think?  What are the strong points of EverQuest? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urainik6.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rainik6</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/20/02 2:30:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2364.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning, I'm feeling very drunk and very nostalgic.</span><hr size=1> I think the most fun I had was level 1-20. Rainik was my first EQ character. A friend at work talked me and 3 others into forming a 6 man group. That friend and his bud had played eq up to level 45 on other servers but the rest of us were all pretty much new. We designed the make up of the group from the beginning. We had a Cleric (our leader), warrior, ranger, rogue, chanter, and wizard. We set out to do leveling the hard way. All of those levels were spent in dungeons. I think it really helped me out. Its amazing how many pick up groups I have been in at level 50+ that have people that don't know how to play the game very well. People that did the PL cycle of oasis, loio and all that. The way we went was pretty much newbie zones to level 10 then we hit the warrens. Stayed there to about 15 and then hit UGuk. After Guk we went to Runnyeye. Man that was so much fun. I still have screenshots of the time me and the warrior held of like 8 frogloks as the rest of the team ran to zone. It was so cool when we actually cleared that train, just me and the warrior. Or the time in Guk when i saved our rouge by casting my weak ass 10point ranger heal on him... I remember actually feeling scared and my heart racing when I was level 8 and got lost in Gfay. I pulled up tracking and there were Orc centurians all around me. I really miss those days. I think it was a combination of everything being new, me not knowing anything, and me being with a bunch of friends that gave each other hell.<br>
<br>
Well our whole division at work got layed off in May and our group broke up. Only 2 of us still play on FV and I am leaving EQ all together. I really do miss those days.<br>

I had all the maps printed from EQ atlas, and I was terrified. I got to highpass and got lost, a kind mage helped me to high keep, bound me and led me to the EK zone.<br>

I remember running down the ramp in EK, absolutely terrified.. the people in that zone were all 18-25.. I was 8.. I was petrified of getting trampled hehe.<br>

I did that at level five.  From Kelethin to Erud, not Halas, but the same principle.  I did all kinds of touristy things in Erud while I was there--sightseeing, mostly.  I didn't speak a word of human then, so it was a very alienating experience, especially once I got to the Qeynos area and the only people who spoke elvish were half-elves who didn't know they could actually speak elvish.<br>
<br>
I did get killed in Kithicor on the way, and in Highpass, too, but I did make it, eventually.  And, huge kudos to Elaira (I still remember her for this), when I got killed in Qeynos while bound in Freeport, at fifth level, she took me to Surefall and bound me there so my stuff wouldn't rot.<br>
<br>
[Edit: I remembered it was Elaira who did that teleport.  Kendara helped me out with something else at about the same time.] <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

<br>
this was about a year ago, and of course i was just starting out on another server.  my bardling came running up to the entrance of kaladim gawking at the huge stone dwarf over the entrance, pack slung over her back.  <br>
<br>
immediately, a little nekkid dwarf hails me.  so i hailed him back, and said &quot;i am a tourist in your land, and a thirsty one.  could you perhaps show me where i might be able to buy a frosty ale?&quot;<br>
<br>
he proceeded to lead me all around kaladim, showing me its wonders and pointing out the bank, the different guildhalls (he made special note of the orcbelt quest giver) and the nearest tavern.  i ducked inside, ordered a stack of booze, split it into two and slapped half of it up into a trade window for him while thanking him profusely.  <br>
<br>
then i skipped off down the road while he waved goodbye standing under the gigantic dwarf statue.<br>
<br>
*sniffles*<br>
<br>
from that day to my arrival on FV, i've been trying to recapture that feeling.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujaroodooger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaroo Dooger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/20/02 4:49:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2364.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning, I'm feeling very drunk and very nostalgic.</span><hr size=1> Doing the Stein quest with about four members of my guild.

<br>
(1) Moreth the High Elven Enchanter (my first ever character) was born on Tallon Zek earlier this year when a few friends convinced me to try EQ and asked me to hop on TZ because they thought the server name sounded nice...<br>
<br>
I still remember how moments after Moreth arrived in Felwithe he fell into the moat trying to follow his friends and swam around endlessly until he saw &quot;You have become better at swimming!(7)&quot; and sent my friend a tell &quot;My yellow bar is almost at 0, I'm gonna drown... bye bye...&quot;, then somehow bumped into a ledge and climbed ashore just before my stamina (luck) ran out and rejoicing at how I escaped certain death in a bottomless pond. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Soon after meeting some very friendly Elves and hours after wondering why the nice Troll I just buffed turned on me and killed me, I was introduced to the concept of PvP servers...<br>
<br>
(2) Zarknar (my second and now, only character) rose on Firiona Vie and gave me the chance to finally learn the mechanics of the game and it seemed every moment from there was a memorable one. Mostly because of the people... <br>
<br>
The most memorable would have to be assaulting the Kromdul Fort of Chalp with two good buddies when we hit our 14th season and complaining about how &quot;Taunt&quot; doesn't work until I realized I had to put a point into training it only when I was in my 16th season... Oh.. and how could I forget my first real Roleplaying experience, a little chat with Zildrax.<br>

I made it back to my corpse, I was a level 10 I think at the time, and ran into a guildmate at the Gypsy camp.  He kindly bound me at the camp, then solicited another higher level character to escort me the rest of the way.  It was so exciting.<br>
<br>
My best memories, though, are not from times of fighting or exploring, they are the times of pure roleplay, where we didn't worry about levels, but just worked through our story lines.  There was one night, when Maritzia was broken hearted because the elf she was in love with was marrying another.  She and Salelili got gloriously drunk under the docks of Qeynos.  Balumbus joined us for a while, and then Gatsu.  We spent about 12 hours just getting drunk and amusing our guildmates in guildchat, not to mention confusing the heck of of newbies at the front gate, who obviously didn't know you could get drunk in-game!!!  What a night.  I'll never forget it.<br>

Two of my favorite times....on my old server, I colead a guild called Stormreaver.  One night, a bunch of us(no one over 22 mind you), went into Runnyeye, the old runnyeye.  And we killed that silly evil eye....Granted, myself, the other druid and the cleric all died...but that was so much fun..We knew we had no business being there, but that seldom stopped us*grin*<br>
<br>
My second one was here, a night not too long ago, House Yigsawla was hunting the frenzy spawn in lower guk.  Gore shows up to hang out for a bit, and at some point, he starts pulling things....of course, not telling Zoronious, who continued to pull as he had been.<br>
<br>
Gore shows up with, I wanna say, 18, 000 frogs*grin*, Zoro shows up with three or four, and the room pops.<br>

There were frogs and heals everywhere. All the frogs got owned, so did I, but we were all having a blast. Some of the most fun I've ever had.*grin* (and I won't even mention Dalion getting stuck, after that*Snicker*) <p><center><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner"><img src="http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sarsig.jpg"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/21/02 8:24:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2364.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning, I'm feeling very drunk and very nostalgic.</span><hr size=1> I've lots of great memories, but none of them were when I was truly new to the game.<br>
<br>
My all time favorite was doing Befallen with a group.  It wasn't crowded like Blackburrow or The Warrens, so we actually felt like adventurers doing something for glory and profit.  Death after death and still we returned, and winning some Barbed Armplates, was great.  Then the wipeout on the third floor while killing ghouls and wisps.  Lovely CR except for one groupmate that ended up being very rude.<br>
<br>
I also remember my times with a few people in The Warrens as an Erudite SK back in October.  Those were the best times overall for me.  It was either me and Rayek or me and Despota, fighting back to back against those kobolds with all our might.  I remember sneaking through the Qeynos Catacombs before I ever knew the way, finally making it to Qeynos hills to buy some bottles from the Sayers to further my smithing career.<br>
<br>
And of course the Allizewsaur.  That was the most fun exploring I've ever had.  I've seen the occasional dragon, but never been in the high end game, so the only thing I'd ever really seen that made me feel short were the giants.  Plus that was a great adventure with the best friend I ever had in EQ, who's been there for me regardless of how many times I rerolled.<br>
<br>
*grins*  I also remember meeting Shintou for the first time in-game, and a long talk with Sarhea on the rock in the ocean of Freeport. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1201<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/21/02 8:49:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2364.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warning, I'm feeling very drunk and very nostalgic.</span><hr size=1> *grin* That was very cool, too Mad.

Um, ok, and so I start the run to the Field of Bone, from Qeynos, at 8th level. Oh man was that a long trip. Sneaking, hiding, runing back and forth in FV trying not to become a spider sandwhich cause at no point did I bind in between places. Eventually geting to the Big Pit, and having the monk go &quot;Did you bind yourself?&quot;  WITH WHAT??!!! Great Googlie Mooglie Holmes, I'm 8th LEVEL. So I send out a tell to the most powerful person in the zone...Cora the Goblin Queen..and she came to bind me, and then watch with great humor as a human cleric ran around in the Pit like a madman killing stuff. It still makes us laugh...esp since I am not a single step faster than before. Man sow is nice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
