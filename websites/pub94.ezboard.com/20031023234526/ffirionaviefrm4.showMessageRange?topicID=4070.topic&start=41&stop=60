<br>
I'm not sure when this was said as I certainly wasn't aware of it and I was group leader.  I would not have invited you had I known.  It is possible to play EQ while stoned but LDoN requires serious focus.<br>
<br>
And I don't know what drugs you were on because you were certainly not being mellow which I would associate with marijuana.  Were you on speed?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>she and the other say i wasn't snaring.. I was snaring and allot of the time I was being resisted which i didn't understand.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You don't understand resists?  You don't know to keep trying?<br>

<br>
You didn't think to stop swinging sometimes?  I think I saw you kicking too which adds more aggro than the damage it inflicts justifies in sitatuions like this<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the only thing i asked him to do was possibly change to two 1hs weapons.. because it seemed to me that his skill in 2hs want really that good, also if you remember him saying his taunt sucked.. as far as it's skill level<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope, he said his taunt didn't seem to be working well enough.<br>
<br>
By the way taunt works like this.  Either it succeeds or it fails.  If it succeeds you move to one point higher on the mob's hate list than the next person.  Taunt is not going to help if other people continue to draw more aggro after you succeed.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, you were in no way polite about it.  You did not &quot;ask him to switch weapons&quot; you said &quot;i you have other weapons USE THEM!&quot;  This is a paraphrase as I did not log but my groupmates all agreed you were being pessimistic, impolite and a jerk in general.<br>

I sent you a tell inviting you to the group.  You most certainly did not warn me you were not all there and if you said it at any point in group chat it spammed past in the heat of battle.<br>
<br>
I notice you failed to address the point that you claimed you had to leave and then stayed in the dungeon for ten+ minutes.<br>

Some people have said they have no problems with you.  &lt;shrug&gt;.  I hope they have no problems when they group with you again.<br>

<br>
The problem for me boiled down to the fact you acted like a jerk.  If you wish to attribute this to being stoned, which I again never saw any statement of such at the time, I recommend you stop playing stoned.  I don't think you'll get a lot of sympathy from that defence.  Depending where you are you probably just admitted to a crime...<br>
<br>
I won't group with you again.  I doubt you'd want to group with me again.  But I'm quite willing to let the issue die.  I never intended to bring your guild into this, didn't even know you were a in a guild.  I am not recommending any action to them either way.  They can weigh all sides of the issue and do what they will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sumrrose>Sumrrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/03 7:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4070.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>as a response to the elven blades guild one i dont mark a whole guild by a single members action and two as far as i saw maybe i didn't see it but i saw no mention of his guild until someone from the guild came here and said something about it which to me makes them look paraniod about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

It's entirely possible that I may well have misinterpreted your comments when the mask dropped.  &quot;I want to roll on it&quot; could either be interpreted as &quot;I want it&quot; or &quot;I want there to be a roll for it&quot; equally, so perhaps I was presumptuous.  However, you did make several comments along the lines of &quot;I'm a wis caster too&quot; and &quot;we should roll&quot; before our ML pointedly commented directly that you couldn't wear the mask.  I am sorry that the matter became an issue with your guild, because I honestly don't think that any of the issues brought up in this thread would warrant getting kicked from a guild.  I have nothing but respect for Elven Blades.<br>

Any issues I had with you should not have been taken to this board, and I apologize.  They were entirely too petty and relative, and I shouldn't have added my, &quot;yeah, me too&quot; to this thread.  I'm sorry.<br>

Bossiness I'm used to. (waves at Suometar and grins teasingly) However, there's a way to be bossy, and there's a way you shouldn't be bossy. Generally, Suometar's competancy will more than make up for the fact she's barking orders at us. I like the fact Suometar gives us instructions, it keeps things paced correctly and puts everyone on the same page. Communication is essential. The fact that she often appologizes later for having to be so gruff doesn't hurt either.<br>

Snare gets resisted, not often, but sometimes. Not sure why your snare was being resisted unless you don't have your caster skills up as high as they can be. Might wanna work on these if not. If it gets resisted once, you should keep snaring. Try snaring yourself repeatedly to work up your skill <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

(Maybe go do it while in them middle of a camp of ferocious monsters, that's fun!) (Anyone who has accidentally snared themselves can have a good laugh at this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

I would be very embarassed, and I'm sure Dorvum would be too if Pericles (our bard) thought he had to twist snare into his songs when we're along. It'd mean that Dory or I wasn't doing our job. :P<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong though. I am often grateful for bard snare. Like: If My snare is getting resisted by a high level mob, and Peri's running behind, and his manages to catch it, giving me a little extra time to get one of my snares to stick, which will last longer anyhow. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In Tak last night, I think 70% of all mobs resisted the first snare.  I've had similar experiences in Rujarkian (in level 65 groups)<br>
<br>
I often find myself walking a line between getting aggro and missing a snare.  In high DPS groups, if nobody is debuffing MR, it's particularly tough.  To ensure the critter doesn't run, I sometimes have to snare at 60%.   And again a few seconds later, after the resist.  With a warrior tank, that WILL get the critter's attention.  Of course, at 65, you also have the tools to lose aggro -- Jolt, Cinder Jolt, or wait 2 seconds for the wizard to land the next gigantic crit ,then search the critter's corpse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Hunter Gyre Redbranch<br>

I don't know the ranger in question. I do group with a very competent ranger on a daily basis; it's very rare that he misses a snare (if he does, it's due to multiple resists), and aggro generally stays where it should. I love grouping with a good ranger, and I find them a huge asset in LDoN. They can track, scout, root park, offtank, take aggro and ditch it as necessary, slow if epiced (or with Swarmy), snare, and add some impressive DPS to the group. Oh yeah, and they can heal. Sorta. Or like to think they can. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  There's a lot of sucky rangers out there, but if you find a good one, don't let em get away.

I'm assuming from this you have group chat in the same window as battle spam. Group chat should be in a separate window. No chat channels - especially group or raid, i.e. those that potentially carry important messages about the combat situation - should be in the same window as battle spam.<br>

Yanarii, I was gobsmacked to find out someone I'd heard such bad news about was in your guild.  I cannot beleive you would invite such a bad egg into your guild and I am left beleiving that maybe, just maybe Effect was telling the truth and you have seen a good side of the Ranger.

I have to say I believe Kreelos account more.<br>
<br>
( Oh and I like Elven Blades.  But even the best guild can have a shitty member occasionally... whether or not they get kicked out determines the quality of the guild! )<br>
<br>
a) Effect admits he was stoned.<br>
b) Effect claims he told the group.  But being stoned, his memory isn't all that...Kreelos said certainly he wasn't told prior to the group (might've missed it once grouped but that's something you ought to know BEFORE grouping)<br>
c) By all accounts Effect was being bossy. If a ranger and a warrior are in a group, it's the ranger's job to control aggro properly. The warrior can't do it (blame Verant for that).<br>
d) Effect claims he just wanted an open roll on the mask if appropriate and that he backed off when a caster in the group wanted it. Counterclaim by Kreelos says that he said things along the lines of &quot;I'm a wis caster too&quot;.   Not something that Kreelos would need to make up.  More likely, Effect, being stoned, didn't realize he couldn't even use it.  It might've been a mistake on Effect's part.<br>
e) Kreelos says Effect had to leave, then stayed in dungeon another 10 minutes.  Effect had no response.<br>
f) Effect says, and I quote: &quot;I warned you i was not all there.. but you still had me be the puller.. that was your fault NOT mine.. next group that is flaming me ...&quot;<br>
Blaming the group for your lack of pulling skills is always wrong, stoned or not stoned. You shouldn't be grouping if you suck. <br>
