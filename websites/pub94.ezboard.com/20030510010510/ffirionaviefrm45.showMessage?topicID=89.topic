<br>
Right now I'm putting a fair amount of time into alternate advancement.  By the time i hit level 55, I hope to have about 18 AA points total, with 12 to spend.  <br>
<br>
Looking at the abilities, I think this is what I would like to spend them on, eventually:<br>
<br>
1. Run Speed 3 - This I already have.  I think it's great, it's very nice to not have to worry about being outrun when I'm injured (for the most part).  <br>
<br>
2. Innate Natural Wisdom 5 - Why? because with 10 extra wisdom, I can wear a mask, earring or ring that is exclusively for resists, such as a velium diamond wedding ring.<br>
<br>
3. Mental Clarity III.  This is the first archetype I plan on practicing. The extra mana regeneration will be wonderful.<br>
<br>
4. Healing Gift III. It's a prerequisite to many cleric archetypes.  I'm not sure when I'll practice this one, 5 and 6 below are also very attractive.<br>
<br>
5. Spell Casting Mastery. Anything to reduce fizzles. Fizzling a complete heal may mean the difference between a tank living and dying.<br>
<br>
6. Spell Casting Reinforcement. Getting a little more out of buffs is very important.<br>
<br>
I don't want to look any further ahead, because it will be a while before I get into the cleric archetypes.<br>
<br>
I know this is pretty ambitious but I think it's something to look forward to.  <br>
<br>
Anyone have any comments on other skills they would like to study? Perhaps something that I've missed?  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

I would suggest strongly against this.  Do you have a magelo link?  If your wisdom is under 200, then this is worth it.  If it isn't, you will get more mana chosing other AA's.  Resist gear is for switching out for raids not for full time use usually - get levels and your resists take care of themselves against xp mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mental Clarity III. This is the first archetype I plan on practicing. The extra mana regeneration will be wonderful.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Mental Clarity 1 is definately worth two points.  There is a debate among clerics if MC2 is worth four points.  Almost every cleric agrees that MC3 is a waste of six points.  It isn't 2 points per level, it is 2+4+6 so 12 points by the time you get to MC3.  Get MC1 but then I would move on to the next thing on your list and come back for MC2 and possibly MC3 later if you decide you want them.<br>
<br>

You will need it eventually and the occasional crit is nice.  Not really a big deal though unless you want a class skill for which this is a prerequisite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Spell Casting Mastery. Anything to reduce fizzles. Fizzling a complete heal may mean the difference between a tank living and dying.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is the best cleric AA you can get before level 61.  It will give you WAY more mana then the extra wisdom.  I read the cleric board and I don't think there is a cleric there that wouldn't agree that this is a must have.  I would suggest pushing this up your list to the first arch skill you get but at very least suggest pushing it up to right after MC1.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Spell Casting Reinforcement. Getting a little more out of buffs is very important.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This is nice because it also works on your heal over time spells.  I think you need to be at level three for it to give you an extra tick but I'm not positive.  <br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind, AAs are important but level helps you a lot as well.  Now that you have run3, you might want to consider pushing ahead to 60 and then stopping there to get the AAs instead of slowing down your advance to 60 for them.  Of course that depends on the level of the people you group with and where you hunt, but you do get more mana and better resists with each level so don't neglect levels and new spells for the AAs.   <p>[65 Archon] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231627">Ariene</a> (High Elf) Bristlebane<BR>

I agree this is a waste of 5 aa points. Personally I sit at about 270 wis in normal gear (aka 255), switching out to resist gear brings me down to 240 or so. However in a raid situation you will usually have kei on... that happily brings you up to 255 again.<br>
<br>
I used my other 3 general aa points getting regen3, just because its the hardest of the abilities for a cleric to get on gear.<br>

MC1 is worth the 2 points, I didnt bother going MC2. Before you seriously consider doing MC3 I would suggest working on your 8th coldain shawl... much more bang for buck there.<br>

I am currently working on HG3, the celestial regeneration aa you can get in the class level uses this as a prerequisite, and at levels 63+ you can get upgrades to celestial regeneration that make it REALLY nice (800hp per tic regen... mana free insta cast)<br>
<br>

I have SCM1, currently, not for the fizzles but for the reduced mana cost it can trigger. I plan on getting SCM3 once I have hit 65.<br>

<br>
I see the opinion seems to be against spending AA on extra wisdom, but considering the ability to raise mana past 255 with PoP abilities, I think that this could be useful.  As well, I do not often have KEI. Nobody in my guild can cast it yet, and I don't have the funds to always pay for it. Also, seeing as I have to spend 6 AA in the general skills anyway, I thought I would go this route.  <br>
<br>
I've also been thinking about First Aid instead of extra wisdom, but I haven't decided yet.<br>
<br>
I also do not plan on leveling quickly, so saving up a large portion of AA points between now and level 60 is not a concern for me.  I have no desire to push towards level 60. There is still too much &quot;50s content&quot; that I have yet to see.<br>

My wisdom is over 283 (13+ points over my current cap of 270), with most of my gear being focused at mana gear and not wisdom gear, and with many of the things being obtainable either through question or through small (1 - 3 group) encounters.   Putting points into AA wisdom is a waste IMO, because you will find that once you have got that wisdom over cap, your focus will turn to straight +mana gear, and there is very few pieces of good +mana gear that don't also have solid wisdom bonuses.<br>
<br>
If your goal is resists, you would be better off spending those same points in AA resists so that you can keep your gear focused on mana.   Run3 is a definate, I prefer Regen3 as well but putting those three points on magic would be +6 RM. *shrug*   Spell Casting Mastery 3 should be the first set of AA's you get after, as SCM is the single biggest mana boost you can get for yourself. (My mana pool is roughly 4175, with SCM that pool is &quot;increased&quot; to effectively 5400, a boost of well over 1k mana, or effectively a 30% increase in mana pool).<br>
<br>
Every single thing you go for after SCM is entirely dependant on your playstyle.   Like to play battlecleric?  Go with casting fury for the nuke crits and hammer proc crits.  Stricktly a healing cleric?  Go for healing gift and adept.   Use the elixier series more often than direct healing?   Look at spell casting reinforcement / reinforcement mastery to extend the duration of the heal over time.  I agree with Tal,  putting 2 points in the first set of MC is a solid investment, anything beyond that depends on how desperate you are for mana regen.  Being in your mid 50's, there is multiple sources of flowing thought items you could group and / or get multi group events together for, IE 8th prayer shawl, slime boots. <p>Venerable Azhrei Hiever d'Phlith<br>

I don't know if you use stat foods, but it really isn't that hard to get into the habit, and you can have 10 wisdom and a bunch of other stats from Misty Thicket Picnics and Qeynos Afternoon Tea. <br>
<br>
Right now, I presume you're not post 60, and you aren't raiding the higher tier planes.  Getting runspeed, innate regeneration, mental clarity, SCM, SCF, etc, are all much more important and will make a difference in your efficiency as a cleric.  If you really really want that wisdom, you could always do it later, once you have the more important AAs.  5 AA points are much better spent in plenty of different areas.<br>
<br>
I would also argue that leveling to 56, in particular, is very worthwhile, for the summoned hammer and Yaulp V ( provides mana regen while fightin'! )  But I sat around at 52 for  AAs, and at 54, and again at 56.  52 was nice, got Heroic Bond; 54 nice also, got Mark of Retribution.<br>
<br>
Take a look at my Magelo, below my sig, if ya like to see what I spent my AAs on thus far.  They've worked out nice for me. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://itsinhere.com/saga/Elsbetsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

Almost all clerics know which are of least importance: Turn Undead, Innate IVU, A million PoP advance things, majority of General, alot of other class abilities <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Where clerics rule the AA world is quite simply in the archetype category.  Unless you really want to be an Archon or whatever just pop points into these abilties with the exception of the must have Mass Group Buff.<br>
<br>
I'll use 3 different clerics to discuss 3 different routes we took and why: Jherek, Penrif, Rundo<br>
<br>
Jherek: Jherek took the most classical approach to cleric AA's going for mana and healing abilities first.  After run 3 and something else 3 (here i'd recommend either regen 3 or stamina 3) he moved onto SCM 3, Healing Gift 3, got MGB, Celestial Regeneration, and Divine Resurrection, went on to do the PoP wisdom abilities, and I believe now is looking to do SCR followed by SCRM...<br>
<br>
Penrif: Penrif is a nutball and likes to nuke so if you are like him your AA will look more like:<br>
general stuff as above, SCM 3, MGB, Healing Gift 2, SCF 2, MC 2, Divine Arb (very useful I hear), Unfailing Divinity 3, etc.<br>
<br>
Rundo: Rundo is what we'd like to call a wanna be tank cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Fortunately clerics have many AA to help with combat skills<br>
general stuff as above, SCM 3, MGB, Unfailing Divinity 1, ND 2, CA 1...will move on to ND 3, then CA 3, then LR 5, then CS 3, then ID 5 then SCF 3 (for procs) ... all combat skillz all the time<br>
<br>
Other good AA abilities not mentioned above include Radiant Cure (very useful I hear) and Bestow Divine Aura (limited in use but can be useful)<br>
<br>
Pretty much do what you want but I wouldn't hinge around getting AA for wisdom, do that with your gear...same with mana regen...use AA to either get you new abilities or make yourself more customized as a nuker, tank, or healer as needed.  MC 3 isn't a waste I'd say since it stacks with worn regen...however it also shouldn't be a priority at 6 AA point cost <p>Venerable Rundo Nundodundo<br>

<br>
Didn't mention radiant cure or divine arbitration because those are PoP abilities that require level 61.  Both are wonderful though - I would suggest getting div arb 1 first thing after dinging 61 and then radiant cure 1 then div arb 2 and 3 as soon as you get the levels for them.  I'm pretty happy with radiant cure 1 - I'll probably get levels 2 and 3 eventually but level one cures a lot already and I can pull out a clicky cure earring (or pure blood now) if it isn't enough.<br>
<br>
In my opinion the best cleric AAs are tied between spell casting mastery and divine arbitration.  Those two are must haves for every cleric.   <p>[65 Archon] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231627">Ariene</a> (High Elf) Bristlebane<BR>
