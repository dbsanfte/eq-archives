In a duel you don't worry to much about a Wizard's AoE spells. On a dragon raid you do though. Why? Because AoE spells hit a lot of troops hard and fast. A race that lacks magical powers is going to have a tough time taking on those that do.<br>
<br>
In the end, my answer has changed to this:<br>
You'll NEVER beat the humans. Never. There's too many of them and their history is filled with them warring for the sake of war. Iksars are TOO structured. Comparable to Nazi Germany. They are efficient, quick, and brutal. However, things went downhill for them when a surprising, original attack broke through. I think the Iksar would fall prey to this. They would be just too systematic, and one wrench in the gears could bring about an entire collapse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 569<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/28/02 7:12:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Noone is strong enough.</span><hr size=1> Iksar could potentially fall prey to that, yes. They might also adapt around it if it doesn't upset the structure of their society. If it just means they have to develop a new plan, I don't think it'd hinder them much.<br>
<br>
As for humans, yes, they might win by sheer numbers. I personally feel however that in terms of military prowess, organazation and efficency, Iksar are just plain superior on a level humans are literally, racially incapable of ever achieving. Iksar have waged war their whole exsistance, (Except, ironically, the time their Empire fell) humans have been at war alot, but not their whole exsistance, and every living human in a society doesn't contribute somthing to their society like Iksar do. <br>
<br>
However their vast numbers, adaptability, versatility and innovative talents would make them a force to be reckoned with should they ever unify and properly organize themselves. (Without organazation all those talents would go to waste!) Un-unified they aren't too hard to take out.<br>
<br>
It's a real shame we'll never get to see such a war, eh? Ah well...it's fun to theorize... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/28/02 7:21:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uarkitip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>arkitip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/29/02 12:46:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Noone is strong enough.</span><hr size=1> Humans always pull through.<br>
The lore will show it. <br>
Norrath is just as cliched as every other fantasy realm. There's not a single exceptional thing about humans BUT their will. The odds are against them, yadda yadda, the humans win. Gnomish necros have created a race of super soldiers out of one Iksar rib bone, yadda yadda, the humans win. <br>
The Iksar don't seem very capable of adapting IMO. The Empire crumbled and shit hit the fan because they couldn't adapt. Maybe you can clarify better Zildrax, but aren't the Iksar essentially the same as they always were?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 570<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/29/02 1:22:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Noone is strong enough.</span><hr size=1> Are Iksar very adaptable? No, but they are a race that always learn from their mistakes, and they learn fast. They were adaptable enough to conquer all of Kunark, and with the knowledge gained from the fall of their original Empire they will be more so. (or should be, in theory) They are extremely militarily adaptable in my opinian and could devise a plan for nearly every sitution with their current resources. They would have trouble properly utilizing new technology, or fighting things they'd never comprehended before. (Guns, or somthing that actually had a big enough effect to halt them) But if they've thought of it, they could probably adapt to fight it. They aren't one trick ponies, but teaching them completely new and different tricks would be a hard and difficult proceedure. They are also less physically adaptable, they'd have trouble in cold terrain.<br>
<br>
I hope I said all that right, I'm tired so it may have come out wrong. Also, I may be misunderstanding the word adaptable. So I'll rephrase my basic premise just for clarity. Iksar would have absolutely no problem coming up with new strategies or tactics of all sorts so long as the strategies did not involve changing a fundamental value of Iksar society, or introducing a new element to it. <br>
<br>
And yes, in stories, humans do always win. I personally don't like this, and as such I base my assumptions of who'd be the victor on who I think would REALLY win, not who'd make the most heroic and story climatic winner. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/29/02 2:33:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ushinsyrth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shinsyrth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/29/02 1:23:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Noone is strong enough.</span><hr size=1> Only reason Humans always win is because Humans always write the story. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And assuming no alliances, even between wood elf/high elf.<br>
<br>
In terms of defensibility, Kelethin is up in flames in a second, while the dwarves, gnomes, and dark elves all have pretty good underground fortifications that would be very defensible.  <br>
<br>
However, gnomes are seriously underpopulated so unless there were a lot more of them, I can't see them beating the Iksar.  Dark Elves would probably have a fighting chance but I have to agree we do waste half our energy stabbing each other in the back.  I'm not so familiar with dwarves but based on the numbers of them that I see around, I tend to think there aren't enough to both defend Kaladim and wage war on others.  <br>
<br>
Ogres and Trolls, fairly defencible cities although not so good as Neriak/Ak'Anon/Kaladim, but again underpopulated.<br>
<br>
Vah Shir, Erudites, Barbarians, High Elves ... moderate population, so-so defensibility, no outstanding advantages.  Half elves, too scattered and un-unified to unite as one group.<br>
<br>
That leaves humans and Iksar as the main contenders, Iksar's main disadvantage is the lack of magic and clerics, but they do have necromancers and shamans, in large enough numbers this could be sufficient.  Humans have the advantage of multiple home bases, large population, and a very wide range of talents.  (Wood elves also lack casters, another disadvantage.)<br>
<br>
I think it would come down to Human vs Iksar with Dark elves a third runner up in the unlikely event we suspend the infighting and all work together for once.  Based on current server populations and mythos my vote's on Iksar, just, because they have a good population and are very well organized by the Skathris Ven'Sho, whereas humans tend to be scattered about and there isn't a strong human-only guild that would be obvious to assume leadership.  I think there'd be a lot of Human bickering before a leader was chosen, and that's where Humans would lose out.<br>

They own Antonica, and lets face it, the battle for Antonica is the one that would matter.<br>
<br>
About the Iksar, Arkitip makes a very valid point. The comparison to the German army in WW II is very apt. Their rigid command stucture hamstrung the Germans. They lost a number of major campaigns because of it. In the East, the Soviets defeated them with numbers (and an even more rigid command stucture, so who knows?). But most telling, Artillary is the Queen of the battle field, and in EQ terms, Artillary=Magic. The Iksar don't have the big guns. Anyone who thinks the side without artillary can win is wrong. They would hold Kunark, but would most likely expend themselves trying to invade elsewhere.<br>
<br>
The Erudites if able to overcome their differences would quickly own Odus, and may even make it inassailable, but would unlikely be able to move off their little Island Continent. I just don't see the Erudite amphibious assault force.<br>
<br>
Faydwer... faydwer would be devastated and factionalized. I doubt a clear winner would emerge here, and eventually either the humans or Iksar would move in after the natives there bludgeoned themselves to shadows of there present selves.<br>
<br>
I agree with Didi up to the point of it coming down to Human vs/Iksar. But my vote goes to the side with the bigger guns.<br>

While they do have a very rigid structure, in their history they actually introduced new castes (Swift Tails, Crusaders) and formed an entirely new division of soldiers (The Sokokar riding Air Force) extremely fast, implying that they may be able to adjust very quickly. They fought completely different races that would require entirely new strategies each time when conquering Kunark, as well. So this particular area, of how adaptable they are, is a bit unclear for me.  *rubs his head* They seem to, at least to me, have no problem modifying their army accordingly to match any imposing threat...<br>
<br>
Afraid I can't give a really accurate assessment of Iksar adaptability, so I'll go by what I said before. They can adapt their army to easily fight anything they can comprehend, as long as it doesn't involve changing a fundamental value of their society. <br>
<br>
Iksar do lose on &quot;big guns&quot; in the magical sense, but they probably could produce some damn nasty siege weapons that might be able to decently fill in that slot. They'd still be at a disadvantage in this regard though.<br>
<br>
As for breeding...I believe, although I may be wrong as there isn't any real information on Iksar breeding so this is all drawn from theory based on the rest of their society, Iksar could breed faster then any other species IF they wanted too. The Emperor could just order everyone to mate as much as possible, and everyone would comply.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/29/02 3:18:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugegblix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gegblix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/29/02 3:48:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2427.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another 2cp</span><hr size=1> Iksar wouldn't lose due to lack of artillary, Iksar would lose due to lack of battlefield control.<br>

No enchanter == no chance.  The fact that every race with access to the enchanter class also has access to the heavy guns of the wizard class is just icing  on the cake.<br>
<br>
In truth, no race seems to have been built to stand alone with the exception of the humans.  The top warrior races...Troll, Ogre, and Barbarian races lack cleric buffs, complete heals, enchanter buffs, etc.  The top magical classes lack strong tanks.  The priest classes are split apart, with clerics and shaman never being available to the same race, and in the case of the wood elf, having only the druid class to rely on.<br>
<br>
In straight up all out war, the human race is by far the most flexible.  I'd say that gives them a decided advantage.<br>

They were unable to work out any other way of governing themselves that would be successful.<br>
<br>
As far as artillery being magic, I agree. In the basest sense, a wizard is your cannon. AoE spells would own in war, and wizards have the best ones. You can't count foot soldiers like they're high level EQ characters. One AoE blast from one competent wizard would likely level a nice chunk of an attacking wave. Races that rely on shamans as their priests/casters just don't have this same level of pure destructive ability.<br>

It's actually extremely effective...probably moreso then any other races, espicially in regards to waging war. Their society works, for them. It was when they tried to change it, it didn't work. Yes, if somthing came along that would force the Iksar into making a fundamental change to their society, they would encounter trouble there. That's their one big weakness. However, I highly doubt such a sitution would occur in trying to conquer the world. If anything, that sitution would most probably occur AFTER they conquerd it.<br>
