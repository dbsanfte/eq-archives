Below are very brief descriptions of the alignment tendencies of each race. The alignments available to characters of each race are listed in parentheses after the description. The most common alignments will appear first, with those after each successive dash being less common than those previous. <br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Barbarians</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>These isolationists tend toward neutrality and slightly toward goodness. They also tend to be orderly, primarily because the most commonly worshipped deity in Halas is the Tribunal. However, they are a wild people in a wild land, and not a few of them feel constrained by rules and follow the ways of discord. For the most part their society honors bravery and skill over trickery and greed, and desires of power or other evil thoughts are channeled and controlled by the overwhelming need to prove themselves to their people. (N/NG/ON – OG/DG/DN)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Dark Elves</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Driven primarily by the hatred that created them, dark elves are strongly evil. Their society is orderly (as order is the only thing that keeps their society stable). But in some the urge for evil is unrestrained by the rules of their society, and there are discordant elements among the dark elves, primarily among those of the necromantic arts. Upward movement in the society of Neriak requires great cunning and self-control, however, and it is rare that those who do not posses orderly minds gain power in those circles. But dark elves are driven by all kinds of hatred– wild, flaring, dangerous hatred as well as cold, seething, dangerous hatred. (OE/NE – DE )<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Dwarves</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>As sturdy of mind as they are of body, dwarves tend strongly toward order. Moved more by the smooth strength of steel and the beauty of precious stones, they are rarely motivated by the temptations of good or evil. However, through long, if strained, relationship with the high and wood elves and from continuous battle with the evil of the goblins, they will stray toward goodness rather than evil, if indeed they stray at all. The dwarven society prides itself on its honor, steadfastness in times of trouble, and its loyalty to its kin. (ON – N/NG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Erudites</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>A people of two societies. The first was founded by Erud himself and still hold his strong beliefs at the core. Meticulous might be a good way to describe these folk. Their lives are ever bent toward discoveries of the mind. Their society reflects this. They are generally peaceful and orderly, and have become even more dedicated to the ideals of peace and order since their civil war gave a face to those among them who were dedicated to evil. It isn't unreasonable to envision those Erudites and the heretics as distillations of the two faces of order.<br><br>The heretics of Paineel are just as orderly and meticulous as their estranged cousins in Erudin. Where the Erudites see order as a device that allows people the freedom to be good, the heretics see it as a tool that gives strength to their evil. They are no less organized in their daily lives than the people of Erudin are, but the goals of their society involve powers of dark necromancy and evil, rather than the enlightenment of good and kindness. <br><br>Both societies have a tendency to be harsh in their adherence to order, as they have very real evidence of what can happen when one strays from the path of good/evil. Erudites (ON/OG/NG), Heretics (OE – NE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Gnomes</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Gnomes run the gamut, being as likely to follow one path as any other. They are, however, unlikely to follow the strict life of order. They tend to be an unstructured people, and their amazing skill with detailed work seems to come from an inherent understanding of things, rather than any strict organizational skills. The rising influence of Bertoxxulous in Ak'Anon is considered by some among other races as evidence of the disorganization of the gnomes. There exists an odd truce between the worshippers of the gods of the gnomes, almost as if they are too busy or absentminded to take notice of the potential conflict that exists within the cavern walls of their clockwork city. (N/DN/NG/NE/DG/DE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Half Elves</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Being born of humans and wood elves, and having a tendency to be independent of either society in any case, half elves can be of any alignment. They tend to fall into professions and worship that suit their dispositions rather than conforming to the needs of any society. It is possible to find half elves as members of almost any religion. In this fashion they take after their human parents. (ANY)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Halflings </u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>These little folk tend to be kindly and warm, outgoing and inquisitive. Some are less friendly and some are less disorderly, but for the most part they are a pleasant people. While some will take up duties and keep at them tenaciously, this is stubbornness rather than orderliness. Unfettered and gregarious, these folk tend to chafe at rules they don't understand. Sure, it's wrong to hurt people, but everyone knows that, so why do you have to make a rule that says you can't? Despite what is often seen as rashness by some of the more stoic races of Norrath, halflings are never swayed to evil. (DG/NG/DN/N)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>High Elf</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>These children of Tunare embody her sense of order and goodness. They are a people of high values and great light. While some might be slightly less lawful or marginally less good than others, high elves are incapable of evil and chaos. This does not make them immune to errors in judgement, and it is not uncommon for them to appear haughty and even rude due to their strong sense of self-worth. As a society, they value actions over words, though even so they do not take words lightly. They value the good hearts of their cousins, the wood elves, but find their flightiness disconcerting. (OG - ON/NG)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Humans</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Diversity is their strength as well as their weakness. Humans can be of any alignment, and much like their half elven kin, they tend to take up professions that suit their desires. Those who feel a need for structure in their lives will often settle in the cities they have built on Antonica. But it is just as likely that you will meet a lawless human brigand on the road as a pleasant human cleric. With a human you can never know what to expect until you get to know the individual. (ANY)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>ksar</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Even though their empire has fallen, the Iksar are still an orderly society. Evil to the core, there is very little variance from the path of order and evil among the Iksar of Cabilis. Those who are too disorderly are exiled into the wilderness of Kunark, where most find only death. Those who are too weak are often killed trying to prove their strength. Their single-minded acceptance of Fear has given their society its strength, and has given them the reputation as a terrible and dangerous people. (OE – NE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Ogres</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Perhaps at the height of their society (if you believe such rumors), ogres were the epitome of order and the strength of evil. But these days they are just too stupid to have much need for laws. Somewhat mellower than their green-skinned neighbors, ogres tend to be just evil, as chaos and law require more work. Their society decays as their attentiveness to their old ways slowly fades. They can't be anything other than evil, but they can be motivated to be orderly or discordant, depending on how frequently they were dropped as children and on what part of their body they landed. (NE – DE/OE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Trolls</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Trolls are more motivated to destruction than ogres. They are, in fact, a people bent on destruction and tend to be both discordant and evil. There is no reason to believe that trolls as a people ever had a society to speak of. They are ruled by the strongest among them and their society shifts with the latest battle, rarely fixating on a long-term goal. Their ferocity is their strength, serving them well enough in the place of rules. They are never other than evil, though some are less disorderly than the rest. (DE – NE)<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Wood Elves</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>As the high elves are an orderly folk, the wood elves are wild. They tend to be chaotic and willful. They represent all that is untamed in the forest and in their beloved Mother of All. They are at heart a loving people though they do stray, some becoming more wild than good. They are never evil, however, no matter the consternation they may cause their high elven cousins. Their society is built on respect more than on a sense of order. It is only reasonable to take the advice of one's betters, but that does not mean that one is constrained to obey that advice as if it were the only path.
