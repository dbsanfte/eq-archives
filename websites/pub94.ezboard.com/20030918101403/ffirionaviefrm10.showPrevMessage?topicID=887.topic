<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeolarn Bronzeleaf stood in the window of the great temple, watching the Koada'dal filter through the main gate. The patrol had just returned from an expedition close to the borders of orc controlled territory, Clan Crushbone. He frowned as he noticed that many of the Dal were brused and bloodied, but a quick head count showed that all that departed had returned. As he turned to go aid his fellow clerics in tending to the injured, he offered a silent thanks to Tunare, the Mother of All, for bringing them back safely.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the courtyard in front of the temple, just inside the gates of majestic city of Felwithe, the returning Koada'dal rested and were healed of their wounds. Their shining armor dirtied and battered, much like the elves that wore it. The mood was light with quiet conversations and the occasional congradulatory pat on the back. The healers were busy at work as the officers of the group gave their reports to a high ranking Palladin of Felwithe's Deffenders. Some of the cities children were already up and about dancing about the courtyard, and occasionally even working up the courage to ask a question or two from the weary band. The sun was just in the early stages of rising over the city walls, and it promised to be a splendid day indeed. As the returning patrol began to realax with the threat of battle behind them, the quiet voices raised in there volume. Songs were sung and stories told as more of the cities inhabitants went about their daily routine and stopped to congradulate the returning group. There were thirty Koada'dal in the patrol, mostly Palladins, three Clerics and a Battle Wizard. All of them were young and the patrol was a graduation of sorts, into their respective guilds. Yeolarn spotted the new Battle Wizard off on the edges of the group, sitting on the bridge to the temple, watching the waters gental flow. He sighed as he approached the yound Dal, who had been sitting by himself sinse the return of the group.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Congradulations to you and your fellows, Gilthenin.&quot; Yeolarn said warmly. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My thanks to you m'lord.&quot; Gilthenin replied with a tired, half-smile in the High Clerics direction.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Yeolarn could see the sadness on the yound wizards eyes, even though he did well hiding it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The patrol went well I see, and it looks as if you met the ranks of Crushbone and put the boot of rightousness right up their backsides.&quot; The High Cleric said smiling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That brought a genuine smile to Gilthenin's face. Regardless of his high station, all of Felwithe felt comfortable speaking with the Yeolarn Bronzeleaf,  for he had a way of connecting with everyone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Not only the crude Crushbones,&quot; said the patrols leader, who came up behind the two, &quot; but the Tier'dal that were accompanying them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Tier'dal? How many?&quot; Said Yeolarn, obviously concerned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Four of them, plus the band of fifty orcs and I say we did quite well. No small thanks here to the young Gilthenin, who thinned the orcs ranks before swords were even drawn.&quot; The paladin said looking down on the seated elf. Even with the words of praise, the High Cleric could see the uncomfortable look in the leaders eyes as he spoke to Gilthenin. The young wizard would have noticed it too, if he had turned around. But, by now Gilthenin was used to seeing that look when others regarded him, which was his reason for not bothering to turn around.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well fought Gilthenin. You make a truly worthy Battle Wizard of Felwithe.&quot; The paladin said with a respectful bow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gilthenin did turn to face the paladin to return a bow of his own, and the paladin tried his best not to meet the gaze of the wizards  violet eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When seated again, attention back on the flowing waters, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf regarded the young, newly appointed Battle Wizard. With his leather armor cut and dirty, staff laid beside him on the bridge, a long dagger sheithed at the small of his back, the cleric  smiled at the young elf that he had helped raise  sinse childhood.<br>
Gilthenin was an orphan. His mother died in childbirth and his father,a High Cleric of the Mother and Yeolarn's closest friend sinse childhood, was brought to Tunare five years later, during battle with the Crushbone orcs. Young Gilthenin was raised by the community, untill his apprenticeship into the wizards guild. Gilthenin had displayed an great amount of arcane power very early in life, a gift no doubt from his mother.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The cleric sighed at the thought, Gilthenin's mother....<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Master Bronzeleaf, Master Tarker Blazetoss is looking for you!&quot; a very young elf shouted. The child was soaked to the bone, his apprentice robes hanging to the point that they dragged on the ground behind him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I'll speak with you later Gilthenin. Good to have you back safe and sound. The Mother watches over you.&quot;  Yeolarn said going to follow the child.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye m'lord, till then.&quot; Gilthenin bowed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The cleric approached the soaked child with a mock frown,<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot; Aaranill, why can you not stay out of the river?&quot; He said, with almost managing not to chuckle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I think the Mother has not meant for me to stay dry, m'lord. Thats what Master Elisanel says...&quot; the child explained as he led the High Cleric off. The apprentice pulling his drenched robes up so he could manage to walk in them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gilthenin sat a few minutes longer before standing and taking up his helm and staff. He noticed a sharp pain in his ribs where the club of an orc found its mark, but decided not to bother the clerics with it. As he walked off back to his room in the garison, he looked down at his black and grey leather armor and managed a smile when he got to the runes of the Battle Wizards of Felwithe on his armband. The armor had taken a beating and needed some repair, but he was still proud to wear it. He was the youngest wizard accepted into the ranks, just barely out of his apprenticeship. This fact made his masters proud, and yet, worried at the same time. For as much as he was congradulated for his growing power, he was also closely watched.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Aaranill and the High Cleric finally made there way to south Felwithe, after a brief detour to retreive a missing frog, to meet the Master of the wizard school. Tarker Blazetoss stood at the steps of the arcane towers patiently waiting, a frown on his face at the sight of the soaked apprentice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;To your room to change child, you will need a dry set of robes if you're to begin dusting the entire library.&quot; The Master of the acadamy scolded, with a wink towards the cleric, un-noticed by  Aarandill who sighed visably and strode off, trying to remain dignifed with heavy soaked robes and a large frog.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I hear the patrol went well.&quot; The wizard commented offhandedly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yes it did, thank The Mother. I swear it seems the new soldiers get younger every year.&quot; The High Cleric said, casting a glace back toward the gate.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And I hear they ran accross some Tier'dal as well.&quot; Tarker continued.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Aye, that they did.&quot; Yeolarn knew where the questioning was going, and could see concern in the spellcasters eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So, how did young Gilthenin do?&quot; Tarker Blazetoss asked with more than a little curiosity.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Very well actually. I was told he made quite an impact on the battle.&quot; Yeolarn saw the wizard relax a little.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot; His power is great for someone his age, and he weilds it so naturally. I'll not lie to you, the Council is weary of his ability.&quot; the old elf stated.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Weary of his ability or his parentage?&quot; the High Cleric snapped.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;My appoligies.&quot; Yeolarn said, ashamed of his outburst. He knew that Tarker was concerned for Gilthenin as well, not suspisious like some others.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Yeolarn, I am worried about him as well. You know this. I trust your word totally when you say that The Mother is with him, but, I worry how he is handeling all of this. His peers say that hes withdrawn from them, and he spends much of his time alone in thought. It has been a month already...&quot; the wizard explained.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;A month is hardly so much time. Can you imagine how long it would take you to accept that your mother was Tier'dal?&quot; The High Cleric said, stairing back once again to the gates of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day Gilthenin walked through the gaurded gates of Felwithe again, but not on any mission this time. This was just a trip into the Faydark. Time for him to think without having to answer to others. The whole city knew of the news which Gilthenin was so recently told, the news that was kept from him &quot;for his protection&quot; all his life, untill he was deemed ready by the Elders. But, how can one be ready for such a revalation? Half-Tier'dal. All those years that he questioned why his eyes were different than the other children, why no other Koada'dal had violet eyes. He was given a childs answer, &quot;Your just special, Gilthenin.&quot; Special? Such a lie from those who cared for him. It amazed him how all those years he never noticed the suspisious stares, how looking back, he saw them all in such clarity.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sat down under a large tree there in the familier Faydark, with the sun filtering through the canopy of the forest. His thoughts briefly interupted by a fairie who insisted on making rude gas noises every time Gilthenin moved. But, the farie lost interest when Gilthenin never gave a reaction. That was the only way of getting the tricksters to leave you alone, ignoring them, which was usually very hard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gilthenin was told the truth only one month ago which to him seemed a lifetime, and just a moment ago at the same time. His mother was a powerful Tier'dal wizard. She was cast out of Nerriak, her home, for turning her back on her people. She adopted the way of the Light and sought redemption. She found Gilthenin's father. Gilthenin's father believed in an age old prophicy; that the Tier'dal, stolen from The Mother, would cast off the shackles of hate and return to Her waiting arms. Her children, long lost, come home. Gilthenin's father beleived this unpopular prophicy whole-heartedly. And after meeting Gilthenin's mother, his resolve would be strengthened ten-fold. This union was not accepted fully in Felwithe, but they were permitted to live within the city walls, under watchful eye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When his mother passed on during childbirth, it is said that the city did mourn her, that she finally recieved the redemption she sought. The birth of Gilthenin brought his father great joy, for the prophicy he beleived so passionatly in was true. And while his sadness at losing his love was overwhelming, he knew he did not lose her as he feared. She waited for him in the Grove. She had gone home. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Five years later, Gilthenin's father died in battle, against the Tier'dal.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This left Gilthenin alone. Those around him feared what would become of him. Would he follow the Koada'dal in him, and fight for the the Light? Or would he fall prey to the hate in his blood? His mother defeated that hate, but would he be strong enough? The Elders watched and the people cringed whenever Gilthenin got angry, in a fight, or in trouble, which was more often than not. When he displayed his arcane power is when there was real concern, for his mother was extremly powerful. So, he was alone. The curse that was given to him was not to belong to the Light or the Dark, but to linger in between accepted by neither. While his mother and father found a precious gift in each other, without them, he was simply left with the emptyness.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He was alone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gilthenin closed his eyes and listened to the wind in the trees; Tunare's Whisper, and said a silent prayer to The Mother. He asked for something, anything that would give him peace. He could not stand the stares of his fellow Dal. He could not live his life not being accepted by anyone. Not alone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sun was high in the sky when Gilthenin drifted to sleep under the ancient tree. His dreams were memories of the battle with  the Tier'dal, their faces, so twisted with hate. They were the only Tier'dal he had ever seen. He could not imagine a smile on their evil faces. How could he be made of such stuff? Then the dream changed. Through the haze he could make out a small room. It was of Koada'dal make, but he did not recognize it. He saw his father standing over him, so large, crying with a smile of purest joy. His view changed as he was moved, no, carried. Then above him was  a face he had never seen, a Tier'dal, his mother. Her dark blue skin was soaked in sweat and she was weary with fatigue, but still beautyful to behold. Her violet eyes looking down on him. And then he saw it. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her smile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Not the malicious, evil grin of her kind, but a genuine smile. She was beaming, those moments before her spirit left Norrath. She looked upon her son, half-Koada'dal, half-Tier'dal and he saw a look that had no judement, suspision or expectation. He saw his mother, a being born of hate, glow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She smiled at him with unconditional love.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As Gilthenin walked back to Felwithe, he felt more alive than he did all his life. He was his fathers prophicy. He was proud of who he was. He was honored to be the union of his noble father, and his mother, who was a hero. He no longer felt alone. Tunare had heard his prayers. She had not given him a vision, or comfort, or a miracle. She had given him a small memory of his first moments. A tiny drop in the ocean of time when his mother and father were alive.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was the smallest of gifts.<br>
