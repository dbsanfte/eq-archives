On this night, the goblins would put their surveillance and cunning to the test against the Kloks that vend their wares in the unsure frontier of the woods west of Cabilis. They had formed a precarious alliance with a battalion of rogue giants to have them storm the gates of the city to occupy the guards while the goblins assault and pillage the Kloks who will be taken undefended. One this night I would find myself tested to my limits for my loyalty to the empire and just how far I was willing to go to defend it.<br>
<br>
The storms were fierce this black and raging night. Gail winds and rain thundered through the skies blown in from the Overthere and from across the great sea that separates the continents. Some of the older, weaker trees could not hold up to the punishment and had fallen to the ground and broke free from their lodging. Cold clear rain as it pounded into the earth collected and ran down the hills into the valley’s making ground movement slow to a crawl. The very surface itself seemed to be writhing and creeping along like a bed of worms. Thick nearly impenetrable fog filled the lowlands and started to force the smaller creatures to the high ground out of fear for their lives. <br>
<br>
From underneath the shelter of an ancient pine I stare out into the dancing maze of trees. My quest seems to be going against me. Cazic-Thule has thrown the elements in my way as well as the beast I must battle to test my faith. The heat of my soul burned strong in my young 12 seasons keeping me warm under the bombardment of the chilling winds. I was here to hunt the orange beast that wanders the forests so that I could collect its jaw as proof of my strength. To return it to my masters in the Court of Pain would bring me great honor and show my development to the empire. Little did I know that more then any odds I could imagine would be thrown in my path this fateful night.<br>
<br>
With sure feet I scaled up the treacherous hills staying within the cover of the stronger trees. As I make a dash to a large stone in the earth I freeze in my tracks in a sudden feeling of danger. With a blinding flash of light and a deafening roar a bolt of lightening rips through a monolith of a evergreen to my right rumbling the ground under my feet and sending shards of burning bark and wood through my robe and into the scales above my eyes. As the heat and pain of the wood seers underneath my skin the salty blood seeping from my wounds starts to burn my eyes making seeing in what is an already impossible conditions even worse. <br>
<br>
Feverishly I wipe the blood from my face with the rain soaked sleeve on my silken but battle worn robes. I was not raised in my caste to be a quitter and I’m certainly not going to start now. Backing up against a rock for cover I remove a few rust covered hammers from my backpack that had slowly started to wear me down and drop them onto the mud. The 10 stone weapons sink several inches into the muck leaving tell tale signs of metal and a wooden handle jutting out into the rain. <br>
<br>
Having taken a few minutes to collect my strength and let my body heal from the shattered tree fragments thrust into my forehead I was ready to make another push even deeper into the woods and down what was certainly a very slippery and dangerous hill. As I break from my cover and hurdle over a fallen elm tree no longer strong enough to survive the force of a storm I catch a streak of orange fur that seemed to appear out of the belly of a gust of uprising fog. A second later I catch a blow from its buckler sized which fist lands cleanly on my shoulder. The power of the orange brute is awesome. One sold hit put me prone on my back and with certain damage. If it were not for my superior speed the blow from the beast’s second fist that came smashing into the ground penetrating nearly a foot into the earth would have killed me.<br>
<br>
Quickly I’m back on my feet and engaged in hand to hand combat with a far stronger foe. Years of training with the masters is all the separates me from just another meal for this mindless yet towering brute. But the battles lasts much longer then I’m comfortable with and the effects of our exchanging blow after blow upon each other are starting to wear on me. Having already exhausted my chance to mend my wounds I make the decision that I will fight to the death, the brutes or mine.<br>
<br>
A glimmer of hope shows its light in the midst of this growling fight as I land a fierce eagle claw squarely on the chest of the monster and it turns from facing me, seemingly giving in to it’s innate survival instincts to run away. As wounded as the beast is it is still far more adept at traversing this terrain then I am and as I swing at the fleeing creature I find myself loosing sight of it from time to time. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, as the beast is about to drop in its tracks a shriek of death billows over the roaring wind and thunder and my feet, as swift as the claws of an eagle, root firmly into the shifting mud below. I quickly turn around to see what is happening and a rift of frost cascades through my body. Jumping down on me from the branch of an overhanging tree is a dreaded hextracer. With madness in its eyes the goblin swings torridly at me with a rotted piece of wood so large it takes two hands to hold. Forced to abandon my battle with the creature I have sought for so long I defend myself with a never before felt rage. As I watch the brute from the corner of my eye slipping further and further away into the whipping branches of the woods my rage builds equally. Flurry after flurry of swift and accurate blows begin to crush the hextracer into submission, but still my feet remain fixed to the ground below. <br>
<br>
Giving up out if instinct the hextracer starts to flee at a brisk pace, but still my claws will not come free so all I can do is watch it fade into the distance. Just before the goblin leaves my sight the earth releases its hold on me though, and I bolt off after the black vapid eyed shaman bent solely on revenge for fouling my quest. <br>
<br>
As I begin to catch up with the hextracer I see hordes and hordes of goblin watchers and scouts running in the direction of the great gates of Cabilis. Quickly I dispatch the hextracer and make my way to the city to see what is going on. Something deep inside me pushed me to the limits of my speed over the flowing mud and even though I fell hard several times to the ground I would not yield haste.<br>
<br>
A shattered branch from overhead knocks me to the ground as I round the path to the city gates and my shoulder sinks deep into the mud and rock. With certainty I feel my shoulder give under my own weight and I let out a roar of pain. Pushing myself up out of the hole my shoulder dug with one arm I look to the city gates to see at least a dozen towering giants in furious combat with the city Troopers and Crusaders. Several of the dead, both sides, lay strewn on the ground and the corpses of the younger Iksar that were taken by surprise shed blood into the puddles forming on the paved road.<br>
<br>
When I finally manage to get to my feet the screams of a lonely Klok echo to my left. She is being assaulted my several goblins and is defending herself in vein. Bloodied and sore I quickly leap to her aid and begin pulling the goblins from her and crushing their skulls and throats with intent only to kill. As I battle on I come to realize that I have struck down so many goblins in fact that I’m standing in a pool ankle deep of blood and no longer able to feel my fists. Soon I find myself overwhelmed as they start to turn their attention to me instead of the Kloks.<br>
<br>
The battle tumbles out into the open parkway leading into the city, behind me, giants and guards entrenched in a life or death struggle fight with all their might. Heroic cries to Cazic-Thule bellowed from the defending guard’s strengthen my body and push me on. They are giving up their lives to defend the city gates; I can’t let them do it alone.<br>
<br>
Ripping the last goblin from my back and breaking its neck on the ground below I turn to see only two giants standing and some of the guards starting to dispatch the goblins that have attacked the Kloks. And then I feel it. The tip of a stone bladed spear tears through my back and out my stomach. As I grab it with my hands it is pulled back out and I turn to face my attacker who is no less then a goblin battlemaster. Its blood colored eyes gaze through me and seem to burn my scales like the rays of the sun. Again it strikes at me but I dodge the blow and land a sold strike on its face. But they are not called battlemasters for naught. For every attack it manages to miss me with it hits me with two more. <br>
<br>
Feeling that my fate is sealed I leap vengefully at my attacker and grasp its throat with my hands squeezing with all my strength. My victory is short lived however, and a final blow from the goblin spears drops me to my knees and then prone onto the blood soaked ground. I look up to the sky to see the rain pounding down upon the earth and the battlemaster hovering above me poised to land the killing blow, although I am dead already. <br>
<br>
A crack of lightning streaks across the wall of the city lighting up the area for a brief second. Chunks of stone rocket out into the air, but the light lasts just long enough to reflect a small bit of itself off the Troopers blade just as it is sent cleaving through the battlemaster. With a lifeless thud the beast that mortally wounded me falls to the ground and I watch the flicker of life ebb from its eyes. <br>
<br>
Cold overtakes my body and with my last bit a life I turn to face the trooper standing over me. Bloodied and worn himself he looks down and with a subtle nod of his head fills my body with warmth that I have served the empire well. My last breath leaves my body with pride.<br>
