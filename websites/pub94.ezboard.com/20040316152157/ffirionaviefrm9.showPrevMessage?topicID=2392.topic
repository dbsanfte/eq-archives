That and I need to pay for my gas. As I get to the counter to pay for these items (after about a three minute wait behind ONE person) I see the reason for the delay.<br>
<br>
The clerk is on the phone, and not the business phone mind you he's on a cell phone. Talking away like a happy little chatter box. I guess this is not the part that bothered me because you cant really control when the phone rings.<br>
<br>
The part that bothers me is - I need to pay for my items so he's chatting happily away and hasn't even said hello and ends up ringing up one of my items twice. And as the total amount doesn't add up, I say to him &quot;Seventeen fifty for a pack of gum, ten dollars in gas and a pop?&quot; Nope, sorry, this doesnt add up. He did something wrong.<br>
<br>
The clerk, instead of politely asking the person on the phone to hold on, glares at me, huffs and checks the journal tape and begins to talk in arabic to the person on the phone.<br>
<br>
Well, it doesnt take a genious to figure out that he considers me an interuption to his phone call and routine, does it? Now he's irritated me, and the half dozen people behind me in line.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me. Do you think you could take five minutes out of  your busy schedule to deal with your customers and maybe put the phone down?&quot; I didn't shout, I didn't curse and I was polite.<br>
<br>
I am the owner of a cell phone but I have never, ever gone up to a counter with the cell phone in my ear between my shoulder and tried to deal with a clerk while chatting away to my friends.<br>
<br>
I think it's positively rude on both ends.<br>
<br>

It also bugs the crap out of me when people are on the phone while driving, and are swerving everywhere, running stop lights and just generally being a dumbass. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I talk and drive every once in a while myself, but if I can manage to hold the phone, drive a manual transmission, use my turn signals, stay in my lane, and follow all traffic laws, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ALSO. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I almost got hit by some dumbass in an SUV that ran a stop light long after it turned red the other day who was running off at the mouth on a cell phone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kataliaarmourax>Katalia Armourax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/31/04 8:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2390.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cell phones - Rude or Right?</span><hr size=1> He's being paid to do a job, not to chat to friends.

There are better things to do than babble at your friends for hours, like help customers, the people that pay our paychecks in the end.<br>
<br>
So kudos to you for standing up for yourself, and saying something.  Maybe, just maybe, he'll think twice next time.  I would recommend you mention it to the manager, if you're near there again.  They don't always realize their clerks are doing A, B, or C and it never hurts to make sure someone is aware of the problem.<br>

They had to be shut off and put away once we were on the clock.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because someone did exactly what this guy did, and a customer complained.  <br>
<br>
When you work customer service, the people on the other side of the counter are your PRIMARY concern.  Anyone on the phone has to wait when someone is standing at the counter, or you hang up and call them back when customers are gone.  That's the reality of working in customer service.<br>
<br>
He was rude.  You were right to call him on it.  I'm sure his manager will be speaking with him when he views the tapes. <p><center><img src="http://www.dreamchaserz.net/crs/completed/sig_kerrib.jpg"><BR><i>~*High Priestess of Luclin, the Maiden of Shadows*~<br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><a href=http://pub60.ezboard.com/btheblessedshadowsembrace>Visit the Maiden's Temple</a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><br><br><a href=http://pub150.ezboard.com/bhamunaptra>Hamunaptra, City of Chaos</a><br>~~~~~~~~~~<BR><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=208851>Garb of a Priestess</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sexaydwarffv>SEXAYDwarfFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/1/04 2:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2390.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cell phones - Rude or Right?</span><hr size=1> My main problem would be that not that he talked on his cell phone, but that he couldn't do his job at the same time.  <br>

<br>
I work in guest service everyday and have done so for the past 4 years.  Of course our motto (and my personal one as well) is the guest always comes first.  <br>
<br>
No one in my department would even think twice about answering a ringing phone (our business phone, not personal phones) if there was someone there, in person who needed to be helped.<br>
<br>
Yet, I find it amazingly rude how people can come up to the counter with a cell phone in hand and point at me trying to halfassedly (is that a word?) indicate what they want, while carrying on a conversation with someone else.  When I try to greet the person with a smile and a hello half the time they just blurt what they want without making eye contact and continue on blabbering to whomever it is on the phone.<br>
<br>
I don't *have* to go out of my way to be nice in my job.  I don't work on commission and my job only requires me to greet and thank our guests.  I am nice because I like to be.  I think something as small as a genuine smile and hello can make someones shopping experience better.  All I ask is that when people come to the counter they at least show a small amount of respect to the people who are there, trying to make things pleasant for them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that was a bit of topic BUT I guess I should say I think that was *horrible* what the guy at the gas station did.  Cell phone or not, you don't have to be rude to your guests and YOU don't have to be a patron there ever again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
