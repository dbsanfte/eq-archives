She hurries to the back table and sits down and pulls her patchwork cloak closer around her.  Her blonde hair falls into her face and she casts her eyes down to stare at the table hoping no one would notice her.<br>
<br>
She senses someone approaching her and she looks up slowly and sees the barmaid standing there.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what can I get for you?&quot;  The barmaid seemed impatient with her and Chessie notices her looking over in the other darkened corner at some creepy looking guy in a dark cloak that seems to know that Chessie was glancing at him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I..I..would like a glass of water,&quot; Chessie stammered in a barely audible whisper.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that?&quot;  The barmaid leans closer to try to hear Chessie.<br>
<br>
&quot;Water...I..would like a glass of water,&quot; Chessie dropped her eyes to the table again, her voice wavering as she tried to speak louder.<br>
<br>
The barmaid pondered for a moment at what was wrong with this girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure thing&quot;  The barmaid walked off to get some water.  Chessie peaked again at the dark cloaked guy in the corner out of the corner of her eyes and she knew without a doubt he knew that she was looking at him again.  She shuddered and wished she could disappear.<br>
<br>
The barmaid returned with her water and placed it in front of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you okey?&quot; Chessie looked up and nodded slowly. &quot;Whats wrong?  The bar isn't too busy, if you need to talk let me know ok?&quot;  Chessie nodded again.  She watched the barmaid walk to another corner of the room and talk to a pale skinned person in a robe.<br>
<br>
She took a drink of water and it felt good on her throat.  She wished she had the nerve to be more social, for her life had been mostly solitary.  She thought back to her mother who had taken care of her for her father had passed away when she was very young.  Her mother was her only friend and only companion she had known.  She grew up in Everfrost Peaks, out on the plains.  She knew other barbarians lived in the town of Halas, but she had never been there until her mother sent her to the church.  Her mother was a missionary of sorts, and helped travelers who ventured into Everfrost with food, healing, money if needed.  Chessie had an argument with her mother once and ran away.  She planned on going to Halas, and approached the cave that lead to the town cautiously.  She ran into some young barbarians who were hanging outside of the cave.  She smiled at them as she walked towards them.  They continued to look at her without emotion on their face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you need more water?&quot;  Chessie gasped as she heard a voice.  She jumped a bit in her chair and bumped the table and knocked her glass over onto the floor where it broke into small pieces. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, I'm so sorry.&quot;  Chessie said.  She stood up and tried to pick up the pieces off the floor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey its ok!  A little broken glass is nothing!&quot; The good hearted barmaid smiled.  A broom was quickly produced and the glass swept up.<br>
<br>
&quot;You looked like you were in another world.&quot;  Chessie sat back down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I was thinking of ....well..I was thinking of something.&quot;  Chessie realized she had said too much.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, the Hero Heart Tavern is a good place to relax and meet new people.  Why don't you stay awhile, and maybe later we can talk more.&quot;  Chessie studied the barmaids face and saw nothing more than a friendly and somewhat concerned expression.<br>
<br>
Chessie nodded.  Suddenly the door opened and in walked some people.<br>

I'll place another on the bar for you to try as well with a nice glass of milk to wash it down with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chessie looks up, looking a bit like a frightened snow bunny.  Drixa gives her a reassuring smile and hopes the smell of the freshly baked muffins are enough to lure her over to the bar.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sadly she watched her muffin being eaten by someone else at the bar.  Several people have come and went and she had taken notice of them all, wishing she had enough courage to be more friendly, but she was tired.  Lonely, sad and tired; in her bones, in her heart, in her soul.<br>
<br>
She notices that the strange man in the dark robes suddenly stand up and a muffled cry came up out of her throat when she directed her eyes towards the door and saw another man enter.<br>
<br>
Suddenly an overwhelming sense of vertigo overtakes her and she falls out of her chair and onto the floor.  Her last thoughts were &quot;Maybe its time to join me mam.&quot;<br>

Perplexed with the newfound powers she was reborn into, her mind still clings to her former life of the Assassin. A small comfort is taken in knowing that least her instincts have remained with her as well as her swift refelexes; but for the betrayal of Bristlebane and knowing she may never touch a dagger's blade again, she will curse him a time to come.<br>
<br>
She noticed the young girl come into the tavern, and continued on with her thoughts; another local villager no doubt, trying to woo the local soldier with her giggles.  Why meddle in the affairs of fools?  A muffled cry from the cloaked female draws her attention again however, as instincts kick in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Surely there is more than I had thought to this girl&quot; she thinks after a moment of hesitation.<br>
<br>
Under the guise of drinking her ale, she shifts her weight so that her body turns to the girl, careful to appear focused elsewhere.  No sooner than she does, the female cries out as in pain, her glass shattering on the broken wood floor.  She watches the barmaid console the girl, trying in vain to make idle talk.  What could scare such a young soul?  A griffon?  Perhaps a close call with a Hill Giant? <br>
<br>
The hair on Robertz neck rise as she follows the frightened stares of the girl into the corner of the dark bar; to a cloaked person.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Male, obviously&quot; she thinks to herself somewhat scoffing under her breath. &quot;The boots are to wide for a female, and the cloak falls on shoulders much too broad. not to mention the stench of death on his neglected blade, sheathed yet encrusted with human blood....for abusing a blade like that alone is enough reason to kill him&quot;  She stops, startled, and quickly calms her face into a mask of nothingness again.  &quot;How...&quot; Her mind races to comprehend how she knew of the blade, still sheathed, forgetting the girl for a moment.  Then she relaxes, as it dawns on her. &quot;The new powers of course...&quot;   The cries from the girl startle Robertz from her throughts again as she falls to the floor, swooning with delerium.  Her eyes follow the girls terrified gaze as she falls, leading to the tavern's newest arrival.  The barmaid steps in catching the girl, and obscuring her view of the new patron.  The customers whisper among themselves, headless tales and gossip surely.   Seeing the girl carried through the doorway, Robertz decides to follow...after relieving the cloaked man of his sword and purse;  A child's task with the liquor he had consumed that night.  <br>
<br>
The door closes in the private room, and as it does, Robertz steps out from behind it, watching the girl quietly, and trying hard to remember why she seems so familiar...Then it dawns on her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=8.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=8.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
