I want to agree with Nakath, that we should have the same rules as the other server but it is too much like giving in. What they should do is reintsuite the alignment system but with the ability for everyone to pick whatever alignment they want to be with no restrictions in reguards to race or class, so you can have those good Darkelves or whatever but still keep the TLC and No No Drop systems from being exploited.<br>

Yes i came here from a blue server, yes i lost all my gear including my epic and 8th Shawl and 9th coldain ring, ask anyone these quests are not the easiest things to do.<br>
<br>
I moved here for serveral reasons, one being i was not enjoying a server with a population of 5000+, ever tried to xp in BoT with 60+ people in it?, or PoN with 80+? <br>
Its hard and the grief that comes with it is immense. I pay my money to enjoy this game and having to share a camp that is meant for 1 group, split between 3 is NOT fun. Another reason was, as i hit lvl 60ish I realised i loved this game alot so wanted to try the High end so to speak. Now let me give you an insight to AB's &quot;High End&quot;<br>
<br>
Darkwind, probably the 4th highest in the game, is in PoTime. Shadows of Doom,Magus Amicita and Odyssy are all in or just about in Elemental planes, Tight Underpants (Yes i know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) are in Ssra Temple, Wind of Tranquility, Reconquista, Forsaken Ambition and a few more ar in NToV. This means anything that pops has an estimated life expentancy of 1 hour...yes 1. Within that time 1-2 guilds will amass to kill it, what ensues is called a &quot;race&quot;. Where the first guild to prep and engage the mob gets the right to kill, if they wipe they forefit to the next one. Now sounds ideal, but durign this time, some (not all) guilds will /ooc or /shout insults or try to provoke the other guild, also some guilds will go as low as training a guild as they engage or turning the mob a wrong way, and will wipe they other guild. <br>
(Imagine 4 IB and 3 or 4 Named dragons being pulled to you by &quot;accident&quot; while you engage Klandicar)<br>
<br>
This leads to a game which is more hassle than skill, you run to a zone only to be KS'd or lose a target due to lack of people on, its not fun.Not saying you should get free rights to a mob, but comon..racing for Vindi a 8hour mob is a bit silly, or being forced to kill lower mobs (bottom feed) just because you lack things to kill and then sell loot because noone needs it, but that guild that arrived after you could of used.<br>
<br>
Another reason I moved is because i have RL friends here, are you saying I am not welcomed to play here with MY friends just because I choose a Euro server thinking it would be more suited?<br>
<br>
I lost alot moving here, friends, equipment, money, 64 levels and a year and a half amasses alot of these thigns =/ but i still moved, and so far love it, people are nice, its intresting to see people RP, though I myself do not partake of it, I woouldnt stop someone engaging in it, does what I do with my time really bother you, If i choose to raid, unless you decide to RP with say the Emp Ssra and pull his friends on me, then likely we would have no problems.<br>
<br>
 I have no reason to speak &quot;l33t&quot; even though after 1 1/2 years i have seen much of it, maybe as a joke to my friends i would after a big kill, but no i am not going to run up to you a say &quot;d00d sow plz&quot; why do it? it makes no sense and makes people look stupid, its funny...once.<br>
<br>
There are other reasons why I came here, I enjoy not being begged for Platinium every second of the day amognst others <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There, I have explained to you my reasons for transfer, as well as the reason alot do move to the nice server. I think some people have an innate fear of Blue servers, and class us all into 1 group of d00ds, please don't.<br>
<br>
Want to judge me, send me a tell, my game name is Kleth Rainshadow, and have a talk to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  if then you dislike me, then fine put me on ignore or refuse to rez me, but don't immediatly point the finger at me and say I am a pp hungry loot whore, there'd be an outcry here if i said;<br>
<br>
&quot;Firiona Vie are all Rp'ers!&quot; <br>
<br>
Ok well gonna stop rambling, probably not best to put my first post here but had to be said...if you still feel the need to be hateful and petition me please do, but do think of how when you do, you ruin someone elses fun to save your own <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

          To whomever else..I am one of those friends he mentioned. I have wanted Kleth to come here for a very long time. He is in no way a d00d, lootwhore, asshat or any of the other things people will immediately want to tag him as. I would ask that you give him the decency to get to know him before considering him unwelcomed. <br>
<br>
          I have played on other servers as well. And I would transfer them here if I had the RL money. Because this is my home and wuld love to have them all in one place. I know, unfortunately, that we will get alot of d00ds and such. But, we get enough of them just creating here. <br>
<br>
          I never post in Soapbox on controversial issues. For I feel everyone is entitled to their opinions and I see no good coming from mudslinging. But, this subject is a personal one for me, since I was one of the ones that asked him to pay his hard earned RL cash to join our friends here. Again, I ask you, please..If you run nito a transfer, please take the tme to speak with them and make your choices on a personal basis. Do not gruop them all into one group..They transferred, so the suck.<br>

          Thank you all for your time. And safe journies.<br>

<br>
So do we, and we pay it to enjoy the game on a server that we were told would allow no incoming transfers. It doesn't have anything to do with some sadistic desire to keep people away from their friends. (If the friendship was so tight, all of you people wouldn't have ended up on separate servers in the first place).<br>

When i dinged 45 aa and got my Hunter title was a great day, having to give that up as well as all my equipment is too much to ask someone to do.<br>
<br>
I understand you payed to play here, and i payed 50$ to transfer, not saying that i deserve anything more than a chance to be Kleth and not blue_twink_001. But why did you pay to play on a server with no transfers? For Rp reasons? Say i moved here to Rp (i didnt but just hypothetically) would you be bothered with me at lvl 64, or do i have to be FV born and bred to Rp? <br>
<br>
I still have all my skills and knowledge of a ranger who played for 64 levels, with no twinking and KEI only when cast in a group (I never had a huge amoutn of money at 30ish) I did my learning time, I sat 12 levels in EW fear kiting for 2 months on and off to ding 50. Must i be forced to do this again to be accepted here?<br>
<br>
And as Meccy said anyone who wants to be a blue twink d00d can just create a character here, just as you can create a character elsewhere if you want an alt, make no mistake this is my only character on this server I got no special treatment. <br>
<br>
Suppose it comes down to this. I've moved here, don't judge me on what my server does or what a blue server reputation has, talk to me and then if you dont like me /ignore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or if you don't want to talk, simply ignore me or stay away I have no need to interfear with anyone elses fun.<br>
<br>
And yes maybe SoE has changed policy, i was told not long ago that they have allowed transfers, but regardless I am here now and mean not to disterb anyone, I just wanna play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=klethrainshadow>KlethRainshadow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/15/03 11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3496.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.diepiggypiggy.freeservers.com/pig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Transfered</span><hr size=1> I came because my friends were here, and generally people on thsi server are of a higher maturaty or at least enjoy the game more than on my old server.<br>

<br>
Which is my question as well.  Yes, there are benefits here you don't find in other places, but those benefits are here to make the environment more conducive to roleplaying.  In my opinion, the attitude of I dont' mind roleplaying but don't expect me to do it, is a slap in the face to the server you've chosen to transfer to.<br>

Yes, the server is special.  No transfers is part of what keeps it that way.

Being with friends.  I have a character I'd love to transfer over here, becasue they are already level 50+, and to spend more time with some of the friends I have here, it takes a level close to that.  I am in agreeance with Rain here - leveling a character from 1 to wherever you need to get... is damn boring.  But I'm doing it - because I don't have the money IRL to do the transfer yet.<br>
<br>
He had the option and ability to transfer, and from what I've seen, I applaud him for doing so. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=689507"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/nahrissig.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Yes friends is the main one as i have said twice, let me give you (yes another) hyothetical situation:<br>
<br>
You and a friend go to a restaurant, neither of you smoke so you choose non-smoking (this is the equivelent of blue server in there is no RP) , now just as your starter arrives some friends of yours come in and say &quot;Hi&quot; and ask you to join them, but they smoke. Now niether of you smoke but do not mind it, just prefer not to sit in the smoking section if you have the choice. What would you do? (FV represents the smoking section in the sense that it allows smoking, but does not force one to do so to be there)<br>
<br>
The large majority would probably move to your friends table. The point is, the server is Rp preferred not Rp enforced, doesnt mean I'm against it, i simply choose not to Rp, but i DO choose to come to FV and have a good time with my friends, now if you were a customer in the smoking section would you ask for me to be moved out if i wasnt smoking...no, most likely not.<br>
<br>
I know /beat dead horse on the RP enforced bit, but it is the truth, I moved for friends and to enjoy my game more, will i affect you, most likely no. Will i interfer with you, no most likely no, will anyting I do really affect 90% of the FV population? most likely no. Will Kleth ever stop saying &quot;Most likely no&quot; most likely no.<br>

<br>
Many, many, many of the folks who come to Firiona Vie gave up high-level characters on other servers to play here. It's worth it to them to be a true member of the community who grew up here, created their character's story here, formed in-character relationships here. <br>
<br>
The person I hunted with for the first year and half of FV gave up a high-level ranger who had been given the title of &quot;the Fire Caller&quot; as his surname in a GM event. Very cool thing to have. Hard thing to give up. He did it in a heartbeat to have the opportunity to grow up on in a roleplaying environment. <br>
<br>
Lots of people paid a price to play here, and it wasn't a transfer fee. <br>

Now you don't know where to go if you want to beat the game while maintaining some sense of integrity. Not that you're bad, but transfers tend to come over and dump RL money into what's left of our play economy. That kinda skews thing away from honest players. Not to mention displacing folks who are leveling up and chomping at the bit for their own shot at end game glory. It's pretty much all bad. FV is probably well beyond salvation from the blue invasion from within. Enforcing the no transfer rule might slow the decay down ever so slightly though, so it's worth petitioning I think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eveningshadow>EveningShadow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/15/03 1:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3496.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:sooo</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know /beat dead horse on the RP enforced bit, but it is the truth, I moved for friends and to enjoy my game more, will i affect you, most likely no.

I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and from your post, you seem like a decent player... perhaps even responsable.<br>
<br>
Good for you.<br>
<br>
But...<br>
<br>
I still would fight to have your transfer revoked.  Why?  Not because its personal, but because the road to hell is paved in good intentions.  For every thoughtful, responsable, well meaning play who had the misfortune of obtaining lvl 65 on a blue server and transfering here, there 20+ unwashed dood masses waiting to storm the gates for phat n0-dr0p lewtz.<br>
<br>
If you want to take it personal, so be it, you dont really strike me as the type, but I cant say I wouldnt understand.<br>
<br>
To me, as an insider, your application to transfer is selfish, because it opens a pandora's box that people who have been here from the start dont want to deal with anymore then they have to.  Like I said, for every person who comes here with good intentions, I can promise you there will be several bad apples behind them.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, while I appreciate that youll &quot;stay out of the RP'ers way&quot; (gee, thanks!) I get a little nervous tick everytime someone comes here with your attitude.  Once again, you arent an isolated incident, and the more people that come here with no intentions to roleplay, the more the server gets diluted.<br>
<br>
Surely, there will always be those that roleplay, but I think as time goes on and things such as this are allowed to happen, we creep closer and closer to the minority.<br>
<br>
And that's just sad.  This is suppose to be a place for US.  We shouldnt be tolerated here, we should be supported, and Im sorry but Im not the type of person that will accept merely being &quot;tolerated.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course, Im going to be considered a xenophobic ass now, but its true.  This is OUR community.. it is the roleplay prefered server, not the roleplay-tolerated server.<br>
<br>
I wont say I wish you the best here, because I honestly wouldnt mean it, but I dont wish you any personal ill will. &lt;shrug&gt; That's about as best as I can do. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~Vabris Vy'Tok, of House Vy'Tok~<br>

Yet, another thing we can control and &quot;own&quot;  that being who we allow into our Story via roleplay.  If you really do avoid RP with most people, then thats a real shame, but... &lt;shrug&gt;  <br>

I dont believe you know me, or my character... and if this was indeed directed at me (as opposed to those whome you mentioned that you disliked their roleplay,) then I'll gladly replay with a Kiss my ass or a Fuck you.<br>

Yes, how did you know that I had low self esteem?! OMG it's like you've known me all my life and not through a handful of internet posts in a flame-a-rama zone! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

SoE doesn't have to enforce anything they don't want to. They can transfer over all the level 65 characters they want. It's their game, they'll do what they want. I'd also like to point out that a lot of these 'rules' are made up as unwritten things between players. Camps and camping are not supported nor official. It doesn't matter if you've been waiting for Lord Bakwaratar to spawn for the past six days, the first person that engages them is in the right, even if the community looks down upon it.<br>

<br>
And just who is 'we'? Just because you post a 'Soandso is a horrible KS bastard never group with him!' doesn't mean everyone's going to abandon them and so forth. Although from what I've seen a good hunk of people here seem to love these threads and blindly follow them rather than investigate and think on their own. If that's your community, enjoy.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Im not sure what you're so bitter about in regards to this, nor do I understand your confrontational tone.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because every other post of your's I've read on this subject is about how roleplayers have rights on this server and that you're going to make sure people who don't roleplay have a bad time here.<br>
<br>

<br>
So you don't buy and sell from people who don't roleplay, then? Or group with them? You must solo a lot and earn your own gear, since a majority of FVers don't roleplay.<br>

Not specifically, but I do consider it kind of dumb that you don't deal with people who roleplay and, from what I've read, are antagonistic to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table>
