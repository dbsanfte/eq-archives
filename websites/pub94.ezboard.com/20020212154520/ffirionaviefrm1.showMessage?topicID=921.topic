Put it back if server ever gets crowded enough that farmers are a problem. At a minimum, all quest items and all trade-skill items must be obtainable at any level.<br><br>Alignment -- let anyone group with anyone if neutral invites; ie. bless the bug (if it is a bug). Same with guilding. It is just plain pointless to have good&amp;evil if they can't interact directly. That's the fun of it. Good/good and evil/evil is boring. Keep the buffing restrictions.<br><br>Alignment change -- not with a /command. Force people that want to change to go into a city of predominately that alignment and talk to an NPC there to obtain a change; ie. you have to really live the alignment to change it. If you want to put the work in, you should be able to become just about any alignment you want.<br><br>Remove the forced /roleplay. It's a nice thought, but it makes it terribly hard to build groups; eg. need to find a cleric, which clerics are on now? You can only ask the ones that spring to mind by name. Grouping should be promoted in all ways and this inhibits grouping. If you don't see the problem now, you will see it when you reach 40+ and by 50+, it will be a severe hardship.<br><br>Languages -- I like the changes a lot, but I'd have capped them at 10*level, not 5*(level+1). Level 10 or so is when people start doing a lot of traveling and meeting new people. The language issue is a nice touch, but it's a bit too much of a barrier as is. Socializing is good and should be promoted.<br><br>Languages part II -- NPCs should only speak their native tongue, not &quot;universal&quot;. This provides another incentive to learn languages other than &quot;I can't talk to anyone&quot;. Same thing for quest notes and other written materiels. Native tongue (this one should go into all servers, not just FV).<br><br>Languages, the revenge -- NPC vendors should only work as they do now if you have mastered the language.  If you haven't, they should increase sale prices and decrease buy prices.  This would be another incentive other than a need to communicate with other PCs (pc-to-pc talk really should be a pretty basic ability).<br><br>Auction -- I'm of two minds here. With the huge down-times associated with solo'ing, /auc in every zone gives you something to do and also gives a much better chance of finding the merchant or buyer you need. 'Course, if you can setup a group, you won't have time for this nonsense. Maybe if this board was more popular, the trade sections here will eventually cover it (or if /vendorme goes live).<br><br>High-elf guards -- make some low-level pinkies for the darks to hunt in Faydwer. The dark races should be encouraged to attack and kill good race NPCs in just about every good NPC city or outpost. After all, they're evil. They should not only be able to go out and be evil, they should be rewarded in game for it. Good race folk should have extremely severe penalties for attacking other good race NPCs.<br><br>Evil quests -- slaving!  Evils should have a way to take prisoners back and sell them.  The game badly needs some good/evil interaction where each side is encouraged to do things appropriate for their alignment.<br><br>Good quests -- slaving part II.  Goods should have a way to rescue slaves (both combat/raid and stealth style).  PC slaves might be going a bit too far, but NPC would be quite fun for both sides. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ustormtower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormtower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Travelling Circus</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 1:44:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Here's my take on it:</span><hr size=1> I like Bjond's ideas on languages.

Now many may not aggree with her role-play choices, but it is not their character. I commend her for trying though and think it should be allowed. Now i know that many of you disagree with me but i think slight changes in alignment should be allowed for any race to almost any alignment. <br>how would we keep the balance? when a person makes a drastic alignment change, like DE to a neutral alignment, they become KOS to their respective race instantaineously and there they stand and must improve from there. if as drastic as evil to good, they become KOS to ALL evil races. The good still hate them also, so very careful work must be done to increase their faction. now i do not think that a Cleric or Druid should be allowed to cross their god for that would destroy their character's ability to perform their abilities being they come from 'their god' as i see it in role-play. If this could be allowed, then converting would be possible and full role-play possibilies would exist. Now what would stop all from doing this kind of change? Making good from KOS is a VERY tedious thing as i see it seems every town is split into 3 or more factions. For example, lets say this DE went to Crushbone to raise faction...killing orcs helps with guards...not the merchants. So i do think it should be possible as long as the class considered does not need to worship a god to function. This probably is only my dream because im sure the coding involved would probably be too much for the benefits given as Verant would see it.

Human warrior goes out and learns tell around level 14, then becomes a mage and learns tell past 14.  At which time he won't be able to wear normal armor, but if he focuses on all the different self buff spells like mirror image and iron skin combined with improved invisability and whatever other self defence spell a wizard in AD&amp;D has he can become a mean damage machine just with his swords.  Heck if he felt like it he could gather the stuff and smith his own magicaly enhanced weapons.  Plus there is enuff caster werable stuff in AD&amp;D that his armor class and saves wouldn't be hurting.<br><br>Anyway some of the rules might be able to use a little tweeking but I am fine with almost all of them.  I love TLC and like it the way it is.  Would be nice if languages were a little easier to learn, especialy for INTL casters sence they ARE book worms.<br><br>As to EXP bonus for grouping, there is one.  IF your group is all the same alighnment you can get a EXP bonus, can't remember all the details to it.  Oh and if your group is of to many opposing alighnments you can get an EXP penalty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/01 1:18:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'd do it backwards of that Grim ..</span><hr size=1>  .. penalty for same alignment, penalty for same guild, penalty for same race.

That's why there is no common tongue.<br><br>Verant wanted people to meet and form sub-communites based on the race of their home town to give the server a more interesting flavor. They wanted to see young trolls grouping with other young trolls and getting to know each other to give the community a more diverse flavor. I agree that diversity is the key fun roleplay, but you have to develop your own racial identity before you can be diverse from/to anyone else. The other blue servers are so cookie-cutter and lacking in roleplay that they only difference race makes is &quot;what your toon looks like dewd&quot;.<br><br>If you wanted a server full of diversity where dark elven shadow knights grouped with high elven paladins and if you think all the FV restrictions are far too narrow-minded and parochial...then I gotta ask...&quot;Why are you playing on this server at all when you don't like the ruleset?&quot; If you're just looking for low population, then there's always Antonius Bayle.<br><br>Anyway, my point is this: I liked the rule set and moved here because of it. I like all the restrictions and my creativity has not been stifled.<br><br>Now I see many people posting that they don't like the rule set and want to yell at Verant for changes. If you want to go back to the way other blue servers are handled, then move back to one of the twenty-some servers that have the normal rule set and leave this one alone.<br><br>If Verant feels they need to get the server population up, let them come up with incentives for people to come here.

There are some really good reasons for two religions to group up and bash something more threatening (as a good example: Erudite and Heretic should group up and eliminate the kobold threat).<br><br>Buffs should be somewhat religion dependent.  Or perhaps, have faction consequences.  A cleric takes his powers directly from his diety, so using those powers on someone of the opposing alignment should have dire consequences ... like reducing his native faction by a little bit.<br><br>On the other hand, Bards' buffs other int-based casters' buffs are not really related to religion.<br><br>I'm actually wondering how active the dieties are supposed to be.  If it's like Greek myths, then the gods will meddle in our day-to-day lives.  If it's Medieval, then its the religious institutions who actually determine how active they are involved in day-to-day lives.

Drop TLC.<br>Here is why, and remember its just my opinion.  <br>Its just to much of a problem. For one thing it does not add to roleplaying at all, in fact it forces players to &quot;plan&quot; out their characters with information they obtain from spoiler sites. Also, from what I've seen in-game and read on message boards even most of the people who think it should stay believe it needs to be modified in one way or another. I don't believe Verant will bother to modify it. Even if they do they won't come up with a solution that everyone thinks is good.<br><br><br>Second... Alignment changes - add more.<br>That is I think they should add more flexability at later levels. I'm not saying that a &quot;evil-only&quot; race or religion should ever be allowed to be good. But I could deffinently see a member growing more accustomed (neutral) to other ideas as they learn and advance.<br><br>And thats it. Everything else I would leave the same. Some things I don't particularly like, but I wouldn't change them. For example: I've gone to playing a couple hours a day on my old server just to play around with a Troll Beastlord. I would rather play a Troll Beastlord on FV, but I wouldn't want to add more character slots as doing so would probably screw things up.<br><br><br>Anyway, thats what I would change - but no matter what the players want I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Verant. Even if they wanted to change some things up they probably still have their handsfull with SOL issues.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=921.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessage?topicID=930.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessage?topicID=917.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.firiona-vie.com/images/arfv.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=921.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=921.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=921.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
