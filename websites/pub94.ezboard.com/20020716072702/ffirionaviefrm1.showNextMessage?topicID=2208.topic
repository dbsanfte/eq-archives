I thought it was pretty interesting. Changed my general outlook on All Things Norrathian. I found it on the menu bar of Alakazam's, under Game Lore.<br><br>~The War of the Broken Crown~<br><br>Of Caerthiel: <br><br>The Dragons had relinquished their hold over Norrath, and what are now known as the elder races, the Elves and the Dwarves, stepped out from under their gargantuan shadow. The Dwarves sprang forth from the earth, to hold dominion over their mountainous kingdoms. The elves took to the primeval forests of Norrath, creating a vast empire that spanned several continents. Ruling from the city of Caerthiel , the Elves lived in peace, under the guidance of Innoruk, the elven god. <br><br>Of the rebellion and the outpost of Wielle: <br><br>As the corruption in the empire grew, so did the unrest in many elves hearts. They wanted more and more power for themselves. They grew suspicious of the strength of Innoruk, choosing to destroy his works, and kill his servants. At first they were small in size, and weak in power. But as the years went by the rebels grew in leaps and bounds, using treacherous methods to slander the leaders of the Elven Empire. The first sign of the growing rebellion came at the Elven outpost of Wielle, located where the city of Freeport is today. Wielle was loyal to the empire, and therefore, enemies of the rebels. A rebel army under the captain Paetroen savagely attacked it. The citizens of the outpost were killed. <br><br>That action shattered centuries of relative peace. Suddenly the Empire had to face a new enemy, a darkness in its mist. The Emperor, Kel'anthinstion, called on all of the citizens of the Empire to fight for the cause of Innoruk. He sent his most trusted advisers, all disciples of Innoruk, to the far reaches of the empire. They were to gather support to fight the rebels and support the unity of the empire. The rebels had sent their own recruiters using underhanded tactics to undermine the populace’s faith in their God. The war droned on for countless years. <br><br>Of the battle of Aerignon and the wild elves: <br><br>The war was a stalemate. That changed with the battle of Aerignon, named after the province of the empire where it took place. The loyal forces of the empire thought to catch Paetroen and his rebels unprepared. They attacked him at his home base, just north of Elizerain Lake. Forces were massed and placed under the direct command of the Emperor himself. He was to lead the army of Innoruk to destroy the rebels once and for all. As the army encircled Peatroen's military headquarters, a victory for the blessed forces of Innoruk seemed assured. Out maneuvered and outnumbered, the Rebels could not get enough forces to turn back the impending assault, and escape by any means, was impossible. <br><br>But the imperial victory was denied that day, as a third player in the war, the wild elves, tipped there hand. The wild elf was a term used by citizens of the empire for the primitive elves the lived beyond the borders of the empire. They had remained neutral throughout the war, but had succumbed to the rebel’s promises of victory, and had joined the war on their side. What was supposed to be a day of victory for the Empire turned into its greatest defeat. The emperor himself was killed when an wild elf assassin slipped into his tent and killed him from behind. On that day the Empire was doomed. <br><br>Of the fall of the imperial city: <br><br>The war lasted for several years after the death of the emperor. In desperation, the remaining loyalists sent messengers to the Dwarven Kingdoms for aid against the rebels. They returned, saying the Dwarves were fighting their own war, and would send no help. With the help of new fiendish magic, the Rebels pushed the loyalists back to their capital, Caerthiel, which was in what is now known as the loping planes. Inside, the last of the loyalists huddled in their homes, holding on to the last remnants of their shattered empire. With out a leader to rally them, they were as good as dead. <br><br>Help came in the form of a priest of Innoruk, who rose up as leader. His name changes with every telling, but the fact remains that in the dark of the night, the day before the final assault on Caerthiel, the priest led the last of the loyalists in to the earth. Through a chasm that was opened and closed by Innoruk himself. When the Rebel army assaulted the city the next day, they found nothing but a ghost town, devoid of any life. <br><br>Of the elven schism (Dark Elves-High Elves-Forest Elves): <br><br>As the loyalists took refuge underground, the rebels thought themselves the winners of the War of the Broken crown. They took on the moniker &quot;High Elves&quot;, while the wild elves became more commonly known as wood elves. Without the loyalists to guide it, the Empire fell apart. The elves that remained on the surface, the high elves, could not stand the symbol of Caerthiel, and in a fit of rage they destroyed it. They created their capital of Felwithe on the very spot where the emperor was murdered, in the battle that destroyed the empire. The loyalists fled east to the wild and uncharted continent of Antonica. There they established the well guarded and underground city of Neriak, where they stayed for many years trying to rebuild their once great empire and all the while plotting for revenge against the rebels who forced them from Faydwer. Having been exposed to decades of low light in their underground kingdom and to harsh conditions, the skin of those elves still loyal to Innoruk has become darker and the elves themselves have been made into warriors guided by the power of their god. They are feared by the denizens of Antonica, who call the loyalists &quot;dark elves.&quot; <br><br> <p><Font color="#FF0033" link="#FF0033" vlink="#FF0033" alink="#000066"> <center><img src=http://members.shaw.ca/baddog117/anathema.gif><BR><B><I> Sisters of Myth<BR>Firiona Vie</B></I></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 10:06:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> news to me!<br><br>i always thought it was tunare that made the elves, and innoruuk who perverted the high king &amp; queen.<br><br>/shrugs  ohwell, i'm a halfbreed.  none of them like or accept me anyway.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://prod.bsis.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/15/15568/folders/6507/67125button-wolf-pawprint" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 333<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/02 10:25:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> This is another of those tales folks tell when they wanna tell something different.

Can you absolutely be sure that all the deeds of Washington or Napoleon are written absolutely correct in our history books? And there are much much more open questions than answers in the history of antiquity. If you still go further back to mythology, then we actually can only carefully 'guess' what might have happened at that time...<br><br>So, back to Norrath's history, I personally deal with it IC-ly as if it was something long ago, very far, very unclear, something people in the present only have myths to tell about, but nobody actually can be sure.<br>And, for example the history written in the booklet is just the tale of a single Iksar. There is no reason why everybody has to adopt it. Please don't misunderstand me: It's ok if you stick to the booklet. But it is not mandatory at all.<br><br>And Teiraa uses still another version of history, not from the booklet nor the story written above, she believes in the one 'she has been told by her parents'. I've told it some people already. Some were laughing, but some were impressed. As far as I know Teiraa is absolutely stand-alone concerning basic questions of philosophy and history. But fortunately she has many IC friends who give her encouragement and understanding, and give her the feeling that she is liked as she is, otherwise she'd be quite lonesome out there.<br><br>History and historiography is such an interesting and diverse field in RL, where many disputes are going on and will never finish; and my idea is to make Norrath's history as interesting and diverse as well.  The 'official lore of Norrath' is a good start, but it cannot be everything. <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>The Friendly(TM) Dark Elf Necromancer <br>@Firiona Vie <br></i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uteiraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teiraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/28/02 5:21:09 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 668<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/28/02 8:19:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> My issue wasn't with whatever folks want to roleplay ... feel feel to roleplay that you believe the Easter Bunny made your race if that suits you.<br><br>The point was that within the context of a campaign world, in any RPG, the Game Master decides what is true and what is propaganda. The second version is what is the actual history according to our GM, Verant. It also has the advantage of being part of the official release of the game, instead of being a beta artifact.<br><br>Does the other story have value? Sure. Makes for an interesting myth for the dark elves to spread around. But, as a player, one has to realize that one is playing a character who believes a lie.

I have a legendary warrior in the history of my campaign world (long story omitted here). Half the races in the world believe he was one of them. He was, in actuality, a half-orc.

Your character may fervently believe any number of untrue things. But don't fall into the trap of thinking that you, as a player, have to support the lies. Just roleplay them, don't defend them.<br><br>If everyone was roleplaying their little hearts out - please ignore the commentary. But it was starting to look alot like players (not characters) saying &quot;well, we don't know, really&quot; - and you do.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ellywig</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Reiterating that Rule #1 of all Role-Playing Games <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uteiraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teiraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Innoruuk also needs love</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/28/02 9:12:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/38/38498/pages/89050/teiraa3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> Ok, Ellywig, let's say Verant is the game master, and they decided what is wrong and what is true. <br>Thus Teiraa is believing in a lie. Absolutely correct. I agree with you OOC-ly. No doubt on that at all. Teiraa is crazy, and her main beliefs are a lie. (note: no sarcasm here!)<br>But IC-ly it doesn't matter at all, actually, since it is impossible for a small weak dark elfie to understand all the things around her. And she'll never see enough evidence to be convinced, that her beliefs are wrong. Therefore, if someone would tell her some bad things about dark elfies, she will start to laugh about it, or in severe cases to pout, to cry and to fret. But OOC-ly, I see this as fun. Ok, I assume you know that already.<br><br><br>Now, another point here is how  players in general are dealing with the background story IC-ly. The story actually is an OOC-ly made dogma. As I see in this thread and elsewhere, there are three basic approaches for a player:<br><br>First approach: The background story is absolute truth, and my character knows about it and acts accordingly. Thus an OOC-made dogma is transfered to an IC-truth for the character. In other words: Not only the player believes OOC-ly in the truth of the story, but the character does it as well, IC-ly.<br>Makes it a bit easier to play, since you can identify yourself with the character. And since the background story is a good one (in my opinion), it makes good roleplay.<br><br>Second approach: The background story is truth, but my character doesn't know it. But nevertheless he is behaving according to the storyline, even though he thinks different.<br>Best example here: Skathris Ven'sho. Really not easy to do, but yields very good roleplayers.<br><br>Third approach: Background story, so? What me worry! It's my character and I do what I want. In other words: Ok, OOC-ly I have that story, ok, IC-ly it might be the absolute truth in the world, but my character thinks different. Basta!<br>A bit more difficult, since you always have to think &quot;How would I behave if I believe in the basic principles of my characters thought, even though they are a lie?&quot; That's more spicy gameplay.<br><br>If I would be number one, I'd say: Yes, I am a perverted Fier'dal, and I am spreading hate.<br>If I would be number two, I'd say: No, I am not a perverted Fier'dal, but I'd still be spreading hate.<br>And I am number three, I say (for example): Innoruuk needs love. *bump*<br>And as a result, of course, I am alone with my belief, and not many people respect me (IC-ly). But that's the price for it. Just please don't say that I do this because I want to powerplay <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>But still, for me IC-ly it doesn't matter very much whether your character's story is a lie or is truth OOC-ly. Not a big difference. It doesn't make a character more 'worthy' if he/she reacts exactly like Verants (maybe) wants him/her to react.<br><br>We have many players from all types. And I think that we can coexist very well. I use the third approach, evidently, and actually don't feel any trouble when I meet players who think different. <p><i><b>Teiraa Shadowflower</b> <br>The Friendly(TM) Dark Elf Necromancer <br>@Firiona Vie <br></i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uteiraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teiraa</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/28/02 9:33:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 671<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/28/02 9:33:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2207.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and evil and all that jazz</span><hr size=1> Yep, know and understand. The point wasn't about whatever beliefs people choose to play IC - it was about the appearance that players were starting to say that the existence of this beta-era story meant there was no 'real' history for the game world.<br><br>I have played characters with very false beliefs before... it has led to some great storylines. The neutral necromancer who believed that the forces behind undeath were neither good nor evil, much like fire has no ethical alignment, in a world where that wasn't so (home campaign). In that world, undeath was inherently evil and corrupting.<br><br>He had a rather harsh awakening to the truth, and became quite a crusader against the undead, rather than the dispassionate scholar he had once been. But, I did know during the whole time that I was playing him that he was wrong in his theories.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ellywig</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Feel free to delude your characters...
