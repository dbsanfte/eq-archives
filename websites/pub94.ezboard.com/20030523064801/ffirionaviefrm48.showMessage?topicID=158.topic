Hamin, the guild's secretary, sat at his desk in the entryway of the Tinker's Pride building. Hearing the door slam open, the poor gnome's head leapt from the table that it was resting on and he flew into the air, knocking even more files from his already messy desk. <br>
<br>
A wood elf ducked and entered, turning slightly to notice the sign over the inside of the door. Mouthing silently to himself he read off the newly written missive: 'We will survive so quit your bitchin'. Shrugging he turned and examined the place, smiling broadly. Noticing the gnome in front of him he rushed forward and took his hand, shaking it vigorously. &quot;Good morning my man, I wish to speak to someone about membership in your fine guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
He examined the elf before him through tears of grief, as all the tinks were mourning the loss of one of their own. Red hair peeked out from under a large foppish hat (complete with a feather that was scraping the ceiling), sky blue eyes picking out details from every nook and cranny of the place. The elf had on what could only be described as a costume, silk pants of the greenest material Hamin had ever seen, and he wore a yellow and green silk shirt that was open in the middle. 'Definately a rich kid' Hamin thought, and sniffed away another tear.<br>
<br>
Hamin shook his head slowly, coming out of his shock of the grand enterance. &quot;I'm sorry Mr. Wood Elf Sir. We're a gnome only guild. And I'm afraid you caught us at a bad time. We're going through some reorganization... and we have lost a member to another guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wood elf nodded and pursed his lips, pretending to listen to the secretary. He scratched his chin thoughtfully, peering over the Gnome's head into the distance. A finger was thrust out and pointed to the hallway, past the stacks of papers and the clockworks that were putting the papers back into stacks. &quot;Say, what is down that hallway my good man?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hamin turned and examined the hallway in question, turning back to the elf. &quot;That hallway leads to all the offices. At the end is a common room, why?&quot; <br>
<br>
Nodding, the elf patted the gnome on the head and strode past him towards the hallway. Pulling the yarting strapped to his back forward he plucked it a few times and began singing loudly as he walked down the hallway.<br>
<br>
'Papa don't preach<br>
I'm in trouble deep<br>
Papa don't preach<br>
I've been losing sleep<br>
But I've made up my mind<br>
IIII'm keeping my baby..<br>
Gonna keep my baby.'<br>
<br>
As the elf strode towards the common room, protesting Hamin in tow, heads began to pop out of offices and watched the pair move away from the offices. Most felt too curious to stay in their offices and sniffed away tears to follow the odd pair.<br>
<br>
Exploding into the common room, the elf was greeted by a half dozen gnomes standing around a wreath of flowers with a picture in the middle. The were arguing about the roses that were in the wreath, pointing out the bad taste someone had had when making it for thier fallen comrad.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gather around, friend gnomes, for I have an announcement to make.&quot; The elf stood in the middle of the room, turning slightly so the 2 dozen gnomes around him could see him clearly. Not that they should have any trouble, as he towered over all gnomes present (except maybe Giraff) and his foppish hat and feather kept getting knocked sideways by the ceiling barely above his head. <br>
<br>
Temu crossed his arms, turning away from the memorial wreath to examine the elf. Whispering as quietly as he could to Zapoo next to him, a comment passed which brought a smile to Zapoo's face for the first time in many days.<br>
<br>
&quot;I come to you with a plea and a promise friends. What I am doing here today could very well save your lives, and more importantly, my life. I am a bard in the services of the Bards of Norrath, like my mother before me. You might know her, she stands outside your Library Mechamechanica for 12 hours a day handing out missives for our chapter here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sweeping a hand around, the elf continued. &quot;If you think I am where I am because of my mother, then you are wrong. For it is my father that is the problem, the cause for the plea. A weathly merchant, my father is a harsh man with little time for pleasantries. Dealing with adventurers coming to his shop continually from the faydarks he is always busy, and as such makes more money than any elf should. At least that is what my mother says. He cares little for the adventurers, and would rather charge them an exorbant rate for bandages and iron rations than see the threat of Crushbone eliminated from the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Several gnomes nodded to the comment of crushbone, a few nursing broken bones or scars from the vile place. Softly a metal clad gnome stepped forward, his bald pallate momentarily blinding the elf. &quot;I am Wastin Thymme, temporary high cleric of the Tinker's Pride. If I might be so bold, what exactly are you doing...&quot; The gnome trailed off as he noticed the elf paying no attention to him, instead was rummaging through a backpack of his. <br>
<br>
Pulling out a mace with little whisps of black light floating around it, the elf peered at it and held it forward in front of the gnome. &quot;It is my dutiable honor to ... no.. wait. It is my solemn honor and duty... that's not it.&quot; Reaching up into his hat the elf pulled out a small peice of paper, and held it before him. &quot;Ah. It is my solemn duty and honor to present to you, insert name here, this present and/or award on behalf of the Bards of Norrath.&quot; Thinking a moment the elf winced, then shrugged and stuffed the paper back into his hat. Wastin the gnome nodded and took the mace, smiling to himself as he melted back into the crowd. <br>
<br>
&quot;If I might continue. I grew up a normal life, well normal for the third richest family in Kelethin. I did things that all normal elves do, play on the lifts, taunt the Priest of Discord, and play on the lifts. When I turned 80, though, my apprentiship came. I was put under the care of the great Bard Madon'na, and it is from her that I learned all my songs. My father, however, was not pleased. He saw my calling as a waste of time, and tried to push me into the family business. Well, I protested. Outraged, he threw me onto the lift to the faydarks and out of his life.&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf lowered his head and removed his hat, red hair shining in the lights of the common room. Then, as quickly as the sad moment passed for the elf, it ended. Throwing his hat back on he peered around the room, as in anticipation of this most important part of his story. &quot;My god, Bristlebane, told me to strike out on my own, and I agreed. I could not, however, go at it alone. I figured I needed some good equipment and several hundred platnum to get me started. So, in the dark of night I snuck into my father's wares and picked out a few things for my journey. Making one last stop at my guild I headed out, leaving my past behind.&quot;<br>
<br>
The elf smiled, crossing his arms. The gnomes looked around confused for a moment, before one stepped forward. &quot;Uhm.. yeah. That's great and all, but what is the danger to us and your plea?&quot;<br>
<br>
Remembering his introduction, the bard 'ah'ed and nodded. &quot;What is your name friend?&quot; Eyes sparkling with greed, the gnome spoke quickly &quot;Gneen&quot;. It was the bard's eyes that sparkled, however. &quot;YOU'RE GNEEN? I LOVE your work! It is sung all over Kelethin! Your songs influenced me on my journeys&quot; Gneen nodded methodically, holding his hands out for a present. The bard reached forward and grabbed one and shook vigorously, then turned away completely leaving Gneen slightly unsettled.<br>
<br>
Making a full circle, the bard swept his hand out again. &quot;My father is a dangerous man. He would have me return home and take up the family business. Already his men track me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Elyta nodded and spoke up from the back. &quot;And? What does this have to do with our danger?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, the elf explained as if explaining to a child that the reason the wind blows is because the trees are sneezing. &quot;Beeecause... if I have to go back..... then the world will not have my music......duh.&quot; <br>
<br>
As a group the gnomes groaned, and turned to return to their mournings and work. One gnome stepped forward, however. Hair tight in a bun, the wizard held an imp in her arms, apparently her familiar. &quot;Xianya Lilboomer, officer of the pride. Your tale was... interesting. Might we know the name of the bard that has graced us with his presence?&quot;<br>
<br>
Slapping his hat, the elf rolled his eyes. Picking up his hat that fell during the slap, he turned it into a low bow. &quot;You may call me Kuladen.&quot;<br>
<br>
The room fell silent. A fork was dropped, and a small whimper could be heard down the hall. Only the droning of the clockworks around them proved that time had not, in fact, stood still.<br>
<br>
Deep in his bow, the elf held his position, glancing up at the crowd. Turning his head at a low growl, he looked just in time to see a darkly clad gnome run from across the room, leap onto the back of the couch and use it as a springboard, and tackle the bard at the chest. Falling with a pronounced 'oof' and a crash, Dalthan the gnome sat on the elf's chest with a fist poised over his face. &quot;How DARE you use that name!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raising his hands in front of him as if to surrender, the elf blinked. &quot;What? What is the problem? I honor your fallen hero by spreading his name across Norrath. I very well couldn't use my name. And when your friend drank at our taverns he used to always say there there should be more Kuladens in the world.. so I took his advice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaven, a bald mage in exquisite robes stepped forward, laying a calming hand on Dalthan's shoulder. &quot;Why can't you use your own name... bard?&quot; <br>
<br>
Kuladen the bard 'erm'ed, and looked away. &quot;Well... I can't very well use my own name, since I am hiding from my father and all. And, well.. my name doesn't fit a bard.&quot; Under his breath, a few could hear 'or an elf for that matter'. <br>
<br>
Grabbing Kuladen's shirt, Dalthan raised his fist again. &quot;What is your real name?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, the elf spoke softly. &quot;Eugene Quincey Barkhead the third&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again the room fell silent before the mass of gnomes broke out into uproarious laughter. Falling off of Kuladen, Dalthan grabbed his sides as he laughed at the bard.<br>
<br>
Standing up, Kuladen straightened his hat and pulled down his shirt trying to regain his dignity.He strode out of the room quickly, his embarssiment getting to him. &quot;You have my application, contact me if you need a bard.&quot; He told Hamin on the way out, but the poor secretary couldn't reply through the laughter. <br>
<br>
The door to the Tinker's Pride office closed with another slam, but the clockworks present in the office did not care.<br>
