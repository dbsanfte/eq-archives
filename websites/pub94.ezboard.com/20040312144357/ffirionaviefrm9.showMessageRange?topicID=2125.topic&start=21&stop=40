I mean come on, why did we have to go to bed when our parents got to stay up HOURS more?  We were missing out on FUN stuff surely!!!  Heh, now I know most parents are falling asleep in the chair while they veg in front of the TV.  We are young and nothing is impossible for us and nothing can hurt us and there is nothing that we don't know and we don't want to miss out on ANYTHING FUN!!!<br>
<br>
Ok, now we have to get a job to make our own living.  We get rejected multiple times for jobs we know we can do and we need the money.  We find out that certain decisions we made during our 'let's all have fun and feel good' have an impact long past the fun event.  We start to see that seemingly small things do add up to make an impact on what we think.<br>
<br>
Uh oh...now you are a parent.  YOU are the one the kid is going to look to on how to relate to a man/woman.  Your marriage is going to be the example for your child's marriage.  The things you say and do are going to be recorded permantly in your kid's mind.  You have the choice on how you are going to shape that child.  Are you going to place baggage upon the child that will take the rest of their lives to unload or are you going to give your child the tools necessary to make their way in a world that seems very cold at times?  It really makes it tough when all you got from your parents/guardians is baggage.<br>
<br>
Soon that child is going to be making their own decisions WITH or WITHOUT you!  This will be based on how well did you treat them as a person long before they hit the teen years.  Quite honestly, if your kids like every decision you make that affects their lives, you are not doing them any favors.  If you do not show a child how to handle themselves when they do not get what they want no matter how fair or unfair, then they are going to door poorly when they are out on their own.<br>
<br>
*looks back over this note and steps down off preaching stone*<br>
<br>
heh...sorry about that folks, but it struck a chord with me.  To me watching or not watching the cartoons is not the root issue.  I do not believe children should be exposed to so much at early ages.  I see what it does to adults that supposedly can handle it and I shudder what it does to kids watching who are looking at how to live their lives.  <br>
<br>
Do I think kids that watch violent shows will turn out to be violent kids?  Nope.  However, if the kid tends to be aggressive and the kid has not been taught how to handle those tendency, then I think watching those shows hours upon hours a week is not helping any.<br>
<br>
If the parents are loving their children by being active in their lives and paying attention to what the kid does and shows the kid that they are important, ticking them off by saying some things you can't do will not cause life damaging scars.  It is about balance and it is tough to maintain it.  It requires work and effort but the rewards are beyond measure.<br>

VenVenae something happens when we become parents, our views change. No doubt, yes, at some point your children will think similar thoughts about that you thought of your mother. Don't let that discourage you from what you feel is in their best interest.<br>
<br>
*My first encounter with Ren and Stimpy was from the kitchen, it was my last. I have always felt that it is important to know and monitor what my children are being exposed to. At the time my eldest child was of an age I felt he should be able to choose what he watched. That evening though his little brother and sister where watching the tv with him so I listened in.<br>
<br>
*I was horrified when I heard one of the voices telling the other that he could pull out all his teeth and the tooth fairy would pay him for them. upon hearing this I went and sat with my children to watch. the scenes that followed only grew more disturbing. So I took control of the remote and changed the channel, only to hear many arguements. I told my eldest that that show was hardly something designed for viewing by small children of which he countered that it was just harmless humor.<br>
<br>
*I did not let his arguement sway my decision. The next day when I was preparing dinner I hear my youngest son said to his little sister in a quite serious tone. &quot;Hey, I know how we can get some money. we can pull out all your teeth and put them under your pillow for the tooth fairy. After a few minutes of whispering from the other room, my younger son went past me into the garage and returned with a pair of plyers...<br>
<br>
*I think you see where this is going. Our children learn from the things they see and hear. It is up to us as their parents to help them grow up to be responsable caring adults. Sometimes it makes us out as the bad guy, hey if it isn't regulating what they are allowed to view on tv and vidios then it will be for not letting them say out past their curfew when they are 15, or any one of the many *sigh* stupid rule we as parents find it important to drag them down with. <br>
<br>
*A good parent learns to get over it, and continue to do the things we know are in our childrens best interest. As they grow up they will get over it too. *grins* I take great solace in the fact that it will be no different for my children, their children will someday be complaining how unfair they are being.<br>

The line for each child is different.  The same rules are not effective for each child.  Where is the line?  I wish I knew.  I have made mistakes aplenty with my kid.  I have been too strict and I have been too lenient.<br>
<br>
I can tell when I am too strict when my child starts to doubt themselves, when they feel like a failure that they cannot do anything right.  I know when I am too lenient when they expect things handed to them on a silver platter and they could care less what others have to go through.<br>
<br>
I make corrections.  I work at talking to my child not at her.  I try to treat her with respect.  I work at explaining why I do things.  This does not guarantee she will like a decision or go along with it, in fact I don't remember it ever helping.  But, she knows I care and that I am trying.  I do not expect her to understand and I try to make age appropriate explanations, but I do think she understands that what I do is motivated by the fact I care.  Not because I am trying to get her out of my hair which is how I felt by my parents.<br>
<br>
The fact that you are working at raising your children makes all the difference in the world.  Get to know them, their hearts.  My daughter is a unique individual who has taught me many things. <p>Xsasx Miasma<br>

She then spent the next couple minutes running around bare breasted. Being only 4 years old wasn't quite sure what to make of it.

The movie was great.  Many people take these as different stories, believing that Gainax changed the ending for the movie.  This really isn;t the case.<br>
<br>
The TV series ending was the conflict inside the characters' minds.  The movie was the external conflict.  They happened at the same time.  They are complementary to each other, and the true story is gleaned from watching both.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't bother with Death and Rebirth, though.  It's just a retelling of events leading up to End of Evangelion.  They crammed 20-something episodes of whacked-out TV shows into 2 hours.  It doesn't work well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madrain>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Priest of Rerolli Marr</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/1/03 5:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2125.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: tame</span><hr size=1> Skip the movie.

I loved the ending of NGE.. loved.  Then I watched the movie, excited of course to find out exactly what happened to all my beloved characters.<br>
<br>
While I'm glad I watched the movie now, at the time I wish I hadn't.  It took a feeling of wonder and awe out, and replaced it with horror, whether that's from masturbation next to a comatose girl, seeing an eva torn apart like vultures at a carcass, or the horrid screams of Shinji as he is crucified.. well.<br>
<br>
It was disturbing, and while it didn't really bother me, it took away the neat feeling I had after I saw the end of the series. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=syllestraefv>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/1/03 4:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2125.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: tame</span><hr size=1> I agree, the TV show ended it perfectly.
