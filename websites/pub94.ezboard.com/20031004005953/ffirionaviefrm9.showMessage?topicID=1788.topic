She's discovered that her cat, Sage, needs a very expensive surgery in order to survive, and there's no way she'll be able to come up with the finances for it in time on her own.  I've set up a page explaining the situation in more detail, and there's a PayPal link there for those of you that may be able to contribute to the cost of Sage's surgery.  For those of you that can't contribute (and I understand that completely) perhaps you could take a look at the page and then spread the word?  I know that a lot of you are probably members of pet-friendly forums or mailing lists, or have your own websites, and Elena and Sage could really use all of the help they can get...<br>
<br>
The 'Help Sage' page is at:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.grim-kitten.com/sage/">www.grim-kitten.com/sage/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Since that's hosted on my site, the main site contains some mature content, but Sage's page is totally separate and is suitable for all ages.  Thank you for your time, and I hope you can help out, or at least reserve some hopeful thoughts for Sage (and Elena) in this time of need.<br>

She didn't realize, though, that she would have to verify her PayPal account in order to accept the contributions, so it will take a day or two (maybe as long as Monday, because of the weekend) to get everything done with her bank and make that possible.  Speaking of her bank, she's going to see if they will set up an account for Sage, so that people who want to send checks or money orders can send them directly to the bank branch.  In the meantime she's also going to look into other veterinary clinics and see if she can find one that is more affordable, and she's also going to get the exact quote with specifics from the veterinarian that she's already seen (his verbal quote was one thousand dollars).  Sage is going to be on her antibiotics for two weeks, and the best time to do the surgery would be right after she's done with them (it has the best chance of success then), so that's going to be our goal if we can make it...  everyone has been so helpful so far that I'm hopeful that we will. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vampiricmuse>Vampiric Muse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Zsu - What?

When Dalion asked me to look at this it was kind of awkward.  But in the end he got me to use my paypal account to accept some cash and to transfer it to this fund for the cute kitty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kudos to Dalion on a hefty donation to the kitty kat fund. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205913" target="top">Zsuzsana Dracul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I thought that a few people might conribute a few dollars to help a cat they didn't personally know, but his contribution was exceedingly generous.  It was also crucial, as you'll see from the update below that we met the goal almost exactly, so without his help we wouldn't have made it.  Now there is only the possibility of complications to worry about, and my aunt still has enough auctions running that those should be covered as well.<br>
<br>
And now, the update.  This will likely be the last update that I post to this thread, since the post-surgery news will be a while from now:<br>
<br>
July 28: Thanks to the many kind and generous people that have chosen to help a little black cat that they didn't even know, Sage is now going to be able to have her surgery.  When I was finally able to catch up with Elena this evening (I had to take one of my cats to the vet as well, and our schedules just didn't mesh as conveniently as they could have...) she gave me the wonderful news that Sage's PayPal fund had reached $1076.11, so I am taking down the link for contributions.  The surgery itself is quoted at $1030, but complications could raise the price by as much as $200, and we're hoping that the auctions (which are still linked on Sage's page) will raise enough money to cover this.  If there is money left over after the operation, it will either be used to cover Sage's post-operative care or left in trust at the veterinarian's office for the next person who has an emergency and can't pay their bill.<br>
<br>
I will continue to post updates on Sage's page about her health and the progress of her surgery, so that everyone can see what their generosity helped to accomplish.  Don't forget to look at the auctions if you can, which are still running, and check the page when you can for the latest news.  I think it's remarkable that so many people from so many different places were able to band together and accomplish something like this... it makes me feel a little bit better about the times that I wished I could have helped a friend or loved one but just didn't have the means.  The internet may cause problems for some people, and for others it can be a nuisance, but for Sage it has meant the difference between life and death, and I'm sure if she knew what was going on she would be grateful.  As for me, it has restored much of my faith in the strangers that sit on the other side of that internet connection, and in humanity in general...<br>
