This game however was not with the ogre twins and Naelea, and was a serious game with a lot of coin at stake by all involved. Mortiferus, a Bard, whose real name was so hard to pronounce everyone called him Zimmy, a Northman warrior named Rhudnar, and a Teir'dal cleric named Renor.<br>
<br>
As always Brid watched silently, filling drinks as needed, but otherwise staying out of the way. She had long ago gotten used to the looks she was recieving, but the ones that Renor gave to her made her spine tingle with fear. The Teir'dal wanted her, and she knew, with every fiber of her being, that He was one that would be as bad as her first owner. As the men played, Brid prayed that she would never end up being the Cleric's possession.<br>
<br>
Hours passed, huge amounts of platnum passing back and fourth between the four men. While Mortiferus won a few games, he had lost far more then he had won. As the next hand was being dealt, Mortiferus antied all of his remaining coin, and Brid held her breath, knowing full well what he was about to do. As the elf and northman did not understand the language of the Teir'dal, Mortiferus used elven instead before the others could point out that with such an anti, he would have nothing to raise with.<br>
<br>
&quot;This will be my last bet, I will raise once but stay in the game through the hand with everyone's agreement. My raise, will be brid.&quot;<br>
<br>
The table was silent for a moment as the other three men looked over at Brid and considered. The bard and cleric smiled slowly, their thoughts already going to what pleasures they might find with the feir'dal female. The Northman scowled, then nodded. From his expression, it was apparent that if he was the winner, the odds were Brid would find herself free. As the men agreed Brid held her breath, terror racing through her for the first time in ages. She wanted to run, to flee, to go anywhere but stay here, yet stay she did. She had been trained so well that even now she couldn't run.<br>
<br>
Brid watched  in a daze as the cards were dealt, as the three men raised, were dealt their final cards, then raised again. Something inside her told her she would be leaving with a new Master, and already tears started to slowly fall down her cheeks.<br>
<br>
The cleric showed his cards first, two ladies and two fives. The Northman tossed his cards in without bothering to show them, giving Brid an almost apologetic look as he did so. . Zimmy paused a moment, then slowly laid down his hand, showing the five cards, three threes, and two fives. To brid's horror, Mortiferus tossed in his cards, never showing his hand. Renor scowled as he pushed away from the table glaring.<br>
<br>
&quot;L' rothe orn tlu usst uss tangi!&quot; &lt; The slave will be mine one day.&gt; <br>
<br>
Then the cleric stormed out, slamming the door behind him as he went.  The barbarian slowly rose to his feet, giving Brid another apologetic look as he spoke, &quot; Sorry lass, I did try fer ya.&quot; Then he too was gone.<br>
<br>
Brid barely heard them, she stared in shock at nothing, her face having lost all it's color, tears streaming down her cheeks as mentally she screamed in denial. Mortiferus gently unlocked the collar and kissed her before pulling her to her feet and pushing her towards Zimmy.<br>
<br>
&quot; Khaless uns'aa brid, ol zhaha whol l' alurl. Ol zhah draeval udos parted i'dollen.&quot; then Mortiferus left as well, waiting until he was well out of sight and hidden from all before he let a tear roll down his cheek. &lt; Trust me brid, it is for the best. It is time we parted ways.&gt;<br>
<br>
Brid would never hear the next words the assassin uttered. <br>
&quot;Ulu kyorl dos sreen'aur Usstan inbalus ulu ori'gato dos alu brid, p'los nindyn vel'uss nin tah uns'aa doerrus whol dos 'zil al. Usstan ssinssrigg dos lotha uss, lu' zuch orn. Usstan kestal fol tangi dos shlu'ta evagna uns'aa&quot; &lt; To see you safe I had to let you go brid, before those who now hunt me came for you as well. I love you little one, and always will.I hope some day you can forgive me.&gt;<br>
<br>
Brid looked at the elven bard who now owned her, her eyes cloudy with shock, tears openly falling down her cheeks. The bard walked over to the table and flipped over the cards that had been Mortiferus's hand. The bard stared in shock, and glancing at brid, he quickly fliped the 2 through 6, all marked with a diamond back over so she didn't see them. Zimmy lead the silently crying brid out of bar and to her new home, wondering why the Assassin would have thrown in the hand that would have ensured he had kept the feir'dal slave.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <p>&quot;all of existence is a delicate dance of balance, destroy the balance, and You destroy us all.&quot;<br>
