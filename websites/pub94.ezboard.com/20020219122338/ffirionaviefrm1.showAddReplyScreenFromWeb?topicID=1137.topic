Thank you for all the input. So far I have a middle aged High Elf Cleric, who thinks way to much. While doing this thinking, he realized he doesn't quite fit in to the norm in Felwithe and has decided to head out into the world and seek his<br>
answers. His first destination is Takish-Hiz.<br>
<br>
Backstory still in progress, but esentially Marrik is a wandering philosopher trying to answer the age old questions of why are we here and what does it all mean. I have yet to run into someone who seemed interested in debating theology (Heck, I have yet to really find someone to talk period) in game, so I thought I would post some of my first thoughts here. These are mostly rhetorical, meant to inspire comments, not real answers.  <br>
<br>
 --<br>
 Excerpt from Marrik's personal journal:<br>
 --<br>
It occured to me today that the Teir'dal and Koada'dal are RACIAL enemies, not IDEOLOGICAL or RELIGOUS enemies.  <br>
<br>
To be simplistic, Tier'dal are evil (I don't necessarily believe this, but I think most of my peers would agree with this statement without thought), they worship the god of hate. The opposite of hate is love, Erollisi Marr. The other 'evil' gods are Bertoxxulous, his opposite is Rodcet Nife. Cazic-Thule, his opposite is Mithaniel Marr. I don't know<br>
if Rallos Zek is 'evil', but even so his opposite is<br>
Quellious. [Penciled in the margin, &quot; Who is opposite the wheel from Tunare? Solusek? Perhaps nothing, Perhaps Tunare and Karana exist in the hub&quot;]<br>
<br>
Point being that Tunare is not against the evil gods. The only reason she became involved in our time is due to imbalance pushed on the world by Innoruuk and the current existance of Malevolence. Had Erollisi Marr created an 'Avatar of Love' and handed her the  &quot;LoveBringer&quot; (made<br>
that up) to bring death and destruction to Neriak and Ogguk, would not the fair Tunare jump in on the side of evil? [penciled in the margin, &quot;maybe not, consider the balance of order and chaos as well&quot;] <br>
<br>
Which makes you wonder why the Marr twins are not at the forefront of the recent events. <br>
<br>
Tunare is about nature and balance. What is the rule of the jungle but the strong live and the weak perish. This seems at odds with the 'good' nature of high elves and more in tune with our dark skinned brethren. There is nothing 'evil' about the wolf killing a lamb, it just is. <br>
<br>
I wonder if Tunare allowed the prince of hate to take her first born and corrupt them to evil, such that good could exist in the world. For without the existance of evil, there can be no good, or balance is lost. <br>
<br>
Ah but wait. I have not yet considered the implications of order vs. chaos. Throughout my youth I was told that Tunare and High Elves represent all that is good and orderly in the world. But yet, Tunare is the godess of Nature, and nature abhors a straight line. The jungles constantly strive to reclaim the 'order' we impose in our cities and castles. <br>
<br>
As a mere mortal, perhaps it is arrogant of me to presume I have the facilities to understand the motivations and goals of our dieties. <br>
<br>
I must think upon these matters more, it is unfortunate I cannot find anyone willing to parlay with me on these topics. <br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Marrik wondered these thoughts aloud and was subtley shunned from 'proper' society. He quietly closed down his shop and headed out into the woods to find his answers. <br>

To understand this, one must ponder the definition of what they stand for, and what they worship - hate.  <br>
<br>
To truly worship hate, one must by definition be constantly in disaccord with everything around them.  They despise all they come in contact with, seek to conquer or destroy that which will not bend to their will, and use whatever means necessary to accomplish this goal, be it power, money, or people.  Even the most devote follower would gladly destroy his/her god and take his place if possible.  The only thing that keeps them in-line is fear.  There can be no true respect among the denizens of hate, as respect grows from understanding and, if I'm not stepping too far, love.  If you despise all around you, you can not respect anything.  Rather, you tolerate until you can bend to your will.  As such, their society is built upon the knowledge of mutually assured destruction.  Order is imposed simply because they know that to step out of bounds is to be destroyed.  Unless, of course, you are the more powerful, in which case society's order will reflect your vision, until some more powerful yet supercedes you.  Such is the nature of hate.<br>
<br>
To this, you compare the Goddess of Love bringing about a &quot;Lovebringer&quot;, if such an object exists.  What would this item do, and what is the true goal of Love?  You seem to think it's to destroy and kill the evil races, which is a slap in the face of what love truly is.  Love seeks to guide, to show compassion, to nuture, not to destroy and maim.  A true disciple of the Goddess would seek by actions and words to show the Tier'dal the error of their ways, and the ultimate destructive nature of their &quot;God&quot;.  A lovebringer would change the hearts, not rend the flesh.  Compassion, tolerance, understanding, cooperation...these are the things that would be brought about by the kind of intervention you speak of the Goddess of Love making.<br>
<br>
Now, if that were to happen, what would Tunare's response be.  You seem to think she would take the side of evil, to correct the &quot;balance.&quot;  Again, I think you misinterpret her wishes, though I seek not to overstep my station by attempting to put words or thoughts into the mouth and mind of Tunare.  She is a goddess of balance and nature, true, but only goodness can achieve true balance.  A world touched by love would not be one of unbalance, just one devoid of chaos (though I do credit that you touch on this in the margin of your journal).  Though the races of Norrath would work together for the good of all, balance would still be maintained as all things age and die.  <br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, the initial problem at the creation was growth without decay.  With the introduction of death, balance was maintained and order restored.  This being the case, the only true thing that could truly disrupt the balance, and require Tunare to intervene, would be the ending of death, as this would clearly have world-ending effects, as anyone could clearly see.  A world that leaned toward love and goodness, True love, not the oppressive type often expounded by Paladins and Priests,  would not be a world unbalanced, as death remains.  And death is not evil, as it lifts us from this mortal coil to Tunare's gentle embrace.<br>
<br>
Now some may argue about the nature of Good/Evil, but that's a talk for another time.  But to compare the compassion of Good with the hate of Evil is not truly understand the definition and motivation of the two.<br>
<br>
/ooc If you want to wax philosophical, contact me in-game.  My character is firm in the belief of goodness and love being the only true ways, and is slowly pondering the relevance of the Gods when the only true being worthy of worship and following is the one who created even them.  Makes it a pain as she keeps trying to talk sense into the goblins and orcs she comes across...and they just don't seem very receptive to the Truth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I too have had some questions regarding my own faith in The Father, which seem to mirror your own, however much it galls me to admit that I have similar thoughts to a High Elf.<br>
As it is at this point, I would as likely attempt to slay you as talk to you...however, I feel you may have some knowledge that I would wish to discuss with you.<br>
If our paths cross, and I am able to understand the gibberish you pass off as a language, perhaps it might be worthwhile to stay my sword and listen to your thoughts, and perhaps engage in a conversation of sorts... <p>Kallee<BR>

<br>
I think the Dark Elves are Racial, Ideological, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> and</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Religious enemies to other elvenkind.  I may be talking nonsense, but this is how I see it:<br>
<br>
Racial-<br>
Dark Elves are Dark Elves.  The very antithesis of normal Elves.  If you want to go further, they are cruel and ruthless, and the Teir'Dal empire seeks to dominate the whole of Norrath, including the Elven territories.  Those who do not submit are to perish.<br>
<br>
Ideological-<br>
This does not fit the form for all Dark Elves, but for those who are either loyal to Neriak or Innoruuk, their beleif are either of conquest or hatred.  The Elves of Norrath seek neither, and the followers of Tunare seek balance, or so you say.  Personally I think they seek the preservation of life and Karana seek balance, but that is me.<br>
<br>
Religious-<br>
Lets not forget WHY there are Dark Elves.  It goes right back to quibling amongst the gods.  Innoruuk was jealous of being left out of the pack between Tunare, Zek, and Brell.  Instead of attacking the Neutral Brell, or his Ally (or atleast fellow tyrant) Zek, he instead seeks to punish the goodly Tunare by capturing the King and Queen of the Elven empire and torturing them for 300 years in the Plane of Hate.  After that, he deposited them back on Norrath and they returned to their empire, spreading the word of Innoruuk.  The story goes on, but I don't feel like summarizing it.  It can all be found at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.tomeofages.com">www.tomeofages.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.

I see the same petty bigotries, the same arrogance, the same narrowmindedness in all who focus their lives on good/evil.  They fail to see they are much the same and that the true battle is that of order vs chaos....  In your travels feel free to seek me out.  In my quest for balance I have so far learned to speak the Dark elven tongue and am working on Elvish, also I speak well  my native Northman and the more common Human.<br>
<br>
To others,  while it is true that many individual Dark Elves follow discord, the entire structure of their society is based on the rule of law.  In this sense they are much like the High elves.  If you compare the two, you see the same great achievements in architecture, society, and the mastery of the intellectual and religious arts, these are hallmarks of an orderly society.  A more appropriate opposing force to the Tier'dal is found in the wood elves.  While Dark elf society is Evil and ordered, the wood elves are disorderly and good. <p>Lorec <br>

Others are so full of hate even their own kind exile and hunt them -- witness the Teir'dal in Mistmoore.<br>

As for the Faer, they're just the other side of the same coin.  At the extreme, you have the do-gooder medling in everyone else's business on the assumption that she knows what's good and right for everyone (this is pretty much the same thing as the hate-mongering Tier that meddles for his own ends).  At the lesser extreme, there are the simple Faer that exist only to pursue knowledge.<br>

Laws are for the weak. <br>
<br>
Laws were created to protect those who cannot physically protect and defend themselves.  While it provides structure and strength to our race as a whole, it promotes weakness and submission to the hearts and minds of the individual. <br>
<br>
With the burden of these things called laws.... you bring weight upon the ambitions of our people, and you impose shackles and imprison their burning desires and the potential of their full talents. You suffocate the fate of those who are destined to become great among the Father's people.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;laws&quot; do nothing but cower the Teir'Dal to obey, they force us into mindless submission, they entice us to allow bureaucrats nobles and politicians to rule our lives! <br>
<br>
*snort* <br>
<br>
I will follow my own heart instead, that which drives me to my burning passions and destiny.  My heart is the only compass I need for guidance. My mind and wits are all I need to overcome the rabble of those who would plot against me. Let your seething hearts be naked and free! <br>

I can't count the number of weak and pathetic inky slaves I've gone through. Y'all wouldn't sell your own kind into slavery if you protected the weak, now, would you?  Tier'dal laws keep the strong from messing about with a good thing whenever they get a wild hair up their butt.<br>

No laws and next thing you know, Neriak will start to look a lot like Oggok. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/19/02 4:04:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1137.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LoL, Mo</span><hr size=1> Marriak:<br>

It seems that your thinking is becoming more and more Druidical as you ponder.<br>
<br>
The things you've come upon through deep philosophical thought are the things that the wolves will tell you, if you listen.  Nature cares not for matters of good nor evil, order nor discord.<br>
<br>
Your religious training has given you, and your people, an idealistic view of the Mother of All, and tends towards ignoring her more brutal aspect.  The wolf, after all, hunts for its food.  The great bear protects its territory, as well as its young.  The wolf organizes in packs, while the bear travels alone.  Both are the way of the Mother.<br>
