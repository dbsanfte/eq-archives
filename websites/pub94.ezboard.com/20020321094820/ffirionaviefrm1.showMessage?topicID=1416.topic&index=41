I, shaman, along with a warrior, rogue, and cleric hit the FM giant fort a few days ago. Those giants were no match for a well-equipped, fully buffed, hasted, regenerating warrior and rogue pair. The healing load was quite minimal. The cleric got a lot of evocation practice as well as taking far more than the traditional cleric's share of swings at the mob. He even got some haste too. A great time was had by all.<br>

Even though I love the aspects of FV I love my guild and friends more.  I wish though that FV would have entailed some form of alignment pvp to add some spice =).  I have found though some of the posting about bard quite amusing especially this one.  I even like the plug to how his server droped the bigger mobs first, which has nothing to do with his expertise on the subject as he seems to think.  Reminds me of something like &quot;Our server was the first server to get cooking over 100 and therefore you should listen to my advice as our cooking skills are obviously better&quot; LOL.  Here is the quote and regarless of his level his bardly knowledge is not up 2 par as I have been in the same shoes and have succeded as many others have at something that he says is not possible.  If he posted this on eqdiva, or the concerthall bard forums he would probably be laughed at.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>           <br>
I am a high lvl bard on The Nameless Server one of the biggest servers for be the first to take down big mobs on nay server. Hate the server every otehr person is a super dupper twink and tired of the same old saem so I am heading to FV server with my friends. But I will say a Bard wil never never heal good enought ot keep a group above lvl 25 healed fast enought of course hoping to see lest groups want nothing but chain pulling. I beleave I will be playing anopther Bard worried about the repetitivness of it may end up a rogue. Trust the cleric that siad Bards are a great addition to any group but never a core member he is correct. But I am lookign at this server and thinking a bard will be a heavy crowd control with low number of enchanters. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First off, a bard can replace a cleric way past 25 if he needs too.  We don't have to do heal songs, you can twist slows, aoe's whatever.  As long as your damage output of the group is more than what you are taking in you are fine.  I've been the main healer in many many groups as a bard and have done fine, it just takes a different strategy.  A group of mostly rogues and a bard never needs a healer.  Just twist that haste and combat buffs and mobs will drop in instants. This is just an example but the options are endless.  It is also dependent on your group and the players behind the keyboard.  I have been in groups 40+ and 50+ that I was the main healer (which I don't really consider myself a healer) and we have done fine, and some groups exceptional.  All it comes down to is strategy.  Any group can overcome most things if they use their noggins.   I'm also not just talking about bards.  Even without a bard in the group, with strategy any group can do anything.  The notion of a core group is one of the most put down things ever in EQ.  For high lvl raids, outside of a MA and a MC (main cleric) you can have any combination of things.  I've seen pallies do MA for raids.  Many raids even have a bard main mezzing instead of an enchanter, because the bard can take the hits, and has mana free mez.  The one class that is a core class in the only situation that a core class is required (raid) is a cleric and that is pretty much the only time anything core is needed.  In most regular experience getting for most of your lifetime, you will not find the core groups, and you don't need the core groups.  Even in a well structured guild like I am in, core groups are seldom and to be honest not even though about with us.  It's a challenege to have an oddball group and quite a few times we are plesantly surprised at how well the group is doing.  Sometimes it seems it is much better that a &quot;core notion&quot; group could ever be because we are perfectly complimenting each other.<br>
<br>
Once you hit higher levels it becomes more difficult. There are many options, you can fear kite, do different twists etc. At 53 I can do some uber 6 song twists like amp, BoH effect, Vah shir, VoV, damage shields, snare, without dropping a beat (amp is double duration and BoH song effect is instant cast making a 6 song twist easily doable). There is fear kiting, there is damage shielding tecniques u name it, there are tons of options. I have still been in groups where I am the only healer and we do fine.  On the big mobs or raiding of course there is no way but for normal grouping we do fine.   <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>           Also that core member comment is a load of BS as is the other post where they say bards only have a certain number of tasks.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->   On Terris-Thule every 50+ bard is quickly snatched up by a guild and groups, we are always a core member if they can find us.  We are a swiss army knife of everything and are rarer than any other class.  For raids a bard is always needed and can perform multiple roles.  Bards are one of the ultimate classes in the end game and the reason we are so powerful is that pre lvl 40 or so we are sub par characters, and the class is extremely difficult to play.  Once we hit about mid 30's and up we get exponentially more powerful.  Nearly every group I'm in I change twists around.  Ever group is different.  That's the beauty about the bard, we are by far the toughest class to play due to twisting, but we have so many options and when full blown twisting can add more to a full group than any other class can.  Most groups I am in say that they don't get to group with bards very often and are amazed at how good the group is doing right now.<br>
<br>
There are downsides of being a bard such as difficulty, responsibility and so such.  Not being a core member, not being powerful, and not being able to heal in a group are none of these.  If you know how to twist more than 3 songs at once you would know this also =).  All classes are dependent on the person who sits at the keyboard especially as a bard.  A good bard is one who complements his group structure.  Example: Being in a group with a mage and a druid, fire up amp and damage shields and throw a SS bracer damage shield on the tanks.  Ever swing the mob takes, it gets hit for over 100+ damage in the higher lvls.  This is utterly amazing, and does not even involve healing.  That night we were only casting sparse heals, the mob was doing so much damage to itself that we didn't have to do anything.  We didn't even have a warrior in our group in KC, the only tanks were myself a bard, and the monk which was MA'ing.  I don't think I saw the monk (my guildmember) get below 50% health.<br>
<br>
So if you are thinking about playing a bard don't listen to these fools here that make bogus statements about bards.  Our class takes a ton of skill and is very fun, and you will never have a problem getting into groups, especially on a server which so desperately needs &quot;jack of all trades&quot; because of the low population.  I'm not flaming saying that the bard class is better than XXXX class.  I play a cleric also for example here on my relaxation from TT server, although rare I love my cleric =).   I'm just saying that we have a great class and the limitations being illuded 2 by some of the other people don't hold water even in the slightest.   For real information check out www.eqdiva.com and the bard forums in the concert hall.  <br>
<br>
Don't trust people who boast about how big and bad their server is, and they dropped XXXX mob first.  That's something out of junior high school.  I love TT but also on FV the atmosephere is awesome and everyone should be proud of the atmosephere they have created, and I wish that that would flow onto the server that I play on mainly.  Servers arn't more uber than another server.  On the &quot;nameless server&quot; man's server some people on there may be able to whack the big mobs faster, but that does not neccisarily mean that they are better players, that just means that their server has been around longer or any combination of things.  One could argue that the FV server is more difficult and that the players because of attitute, and quality are better than on other servers. Anyway rambling now.<br>
<br>
Don't let anyone ever get your goat about this core group junk, trinity junk.  High lvl raiding is about the only time that it comes into play, and it's only dependent on a main cleric pretty much.  It's been disproven time and time again.  Any combination of any classes in a group can be great if you stick your heads together. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        A player who goes only by the &quot;core group idea&quot; will never realize the true potential of a group and his class</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Some of the most powerful groups I have been in have been so far off the beaten path of a &quot;core group&quot; that it isn't even funny.  One of the best I was ever in was 2 bards, 3 rogues, and a shammy.  With the shammy slowing, and throwing dot's, us bards twisting up the yinyang and the rogues backstabbin like mad all buffed to the max, we went through 2 levels in our high 40's in around 3 - 4 hours.  That's amazing exp.  I was getting a yellow about every 15 min or so.  Non stop whackin.<br>
<br>
btw here is the cut &amp; paste of the post that I find just utterly amusing and isn't even the slightest bit true.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Tirga006 - I will withhold my comments on your posting due to your current level. Your tune will change in a few levels my friend. No pun intended  <br>
<br>
A bards BEST healing song cannot keep up with mobs crushing your butt for 150+ per hit. For now, I agree with you on your current level and the mobs which you are fighting. A cleric is not ;needed;... but there will come a day very very soon in your EQ career when you will then realize that a bard is good for the following:<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
I won't go into detail here but I can easily break even in a group that the mobs are hitting for 150 a pop.  Just twisting heal, nivs, amp and damageshields or a variety will easly make the mark at 50+, or a vareity on that.  Less healers means more damage outputers.   If you kill it faster you take less damage, simple fact.  With damage shields this even makes it even faster.  Maybe you should heed your own advice, maybe you will change your opinion in a few levels.  If you want a show stop by TT anytime and give me a tell I'll be happy to demonstrate.  Last level I was standing foot to foot solo with mobs that were hiting for 100+ or so nearly ever swing, and thats not even in a group.  I wasn't even fear kiting, I've never been twinked, and my gear is nice but nothing exceptional.  With damage shields, slows and so such you can easily decrease the mobs damage output while yours keeps trucking along.  Instead of the mob hiting me ever second for 100+, it hit every so often for 100+, with me waxing it and regening at the same time.  All it takes is some brainwork.  In an emergency, slap on a non mana taking mez and twist in some regen.  Get your whole group back to full health while the mob sits there wallowing.<br>

We have way more than just this too many to even list.  We can fill any slot there is, just some you have left off are charming, dot'ing, buffing, runeing, damage shielding.  <br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     <br>
and that my friend... is about it... Bards are one of the most highly sought after classes in the end game of EQ, but alas a guild needs no more then 4-5 bards TOPS (and thats if your a monster sized guild og zergling masters)... so many are left hanging with d*cks in the wind looking for a 'good guild'... Bards are not 'melee' artists. They are WONDERFUL in groups and raids. They do pretty well soloing and are usually some of the nicest folks you will meet in EQ (because for some reason the Roleplayers flock to the Bard Class...)<br>
<br>
The reasoning above is the #1 Reason bards are a very VERY low population of the end game of EQ. Most get to the top, find out they have no where to go and end up either quitting EQ or making a new character (Like a Rogue... cant have too many rogues.... ever.... hehe)<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This statement makes me just laugh.  There are so few high bards because our class is just hard to play.  In the top lvls we shine very bright and are one of the top classes for a group.  4 - 5 bard thing isn't true, with aoe's ever single bard you get is better.  Most guilds can only find a few bards, on my server we are extremely rare and most guilds have just 1 or 2.  And no so many are not left hanging in the wind.  Most get to the top and stay there because we are so much greater at higher lvls than we were at younger ones.  And we can solo literally anything through many different ways, check out the &quot;dropping tantor in 4 minutes or less&quot; thread in the concert hall for a good example.  Again I'm not saying that we are the most uber class at all or that we are better than other classes. IMO all classes are valuable.   I'm just pointing out how misinformed this person is when it comes to bards.  I'd just hate to see someone not play a bard that they wanted too due to someone's absurd post such as this.  Every class can be a benifit to any group.  If you want to play, play a class you would like.  In my guild we have some truly excellent druids that add alot to any group.  Druids are frowned upon in most circumstances at 50+.   Not with our druids =).  It just depends on how well they play their class and we were fortunate to get some shinning lights. <p>Zervun Zings [Divine Legend] (Bard Officer)<BR>

Bards have great potential in the right hands, same with every class.
