whore</span><hr size=1> I personnaly wasnt going to post on this matter  but it just seems to keep coming back to the  top of the FV board.I was not there During the Naggy Raid  so i can not persoannly say what happend as i was not there in the first person to witness it. what i can say is this,In the Guild there was a younger member who was having issues getting his body back in HHP .Knor who is always willing to help was probably getting  multiple tells from him. I have know Knor Through EQ for many years now and i can say the following He is Not a Loot Whore in fact the exact opposite ive seen him help out guildies multiple times in Fact he equiped me and has help many others get equipment in and outside of Clan twisted !<br>
     I myself have  rolled on items and then  realized that i didnt need them either through pressuer from Raid member s friends etc saying its a mage item roll  and have your screen plaster with tells .this a type of peer presure that will even make the  strogest person fold at times in attempts to shut people up .<br>
    Now knor said  the he said on raid channel that they should reroll on piece or give it  to second highest roller i can garentee u that that is the truth (im sure we all have raid expierence and can pretty much say that on open raids that how people listen is generally the equivillant to about a room of 40 4 year olds so it was probably missed) <br>
   Guys give it a break its a crap shield (besides the 10 casts of instant  ruin )he offered to give it back during the raid he has given it back to what is suppose to be the appropriate winner.<br>
  I came to this server to get away from this nonsense concerning arguments over loot This is suppose to be a roleplaying server the joy of hunt should be that of killing Naggy. Secondly if your not big into roleplaying im just curious how many of peeps went on the raid for this shield ?  how many that are complaining  where even there? what about the person who started the post was he there ?in Retrospect how many people that are on the log that rolled for this item really needed it ?imo probably 80 percent of that list decided it was a consolidation prize since niether scale or book dropped . (just stop and think about it for a sec)<br>
From what i can tell this whole string of posts has been nothing But  Greed SIU enjoy the game. flaming people on boards is not only inappropriate but cowrdly as it dosent give the person your flaming about a chance to defend himself in real time<br>
<br>
This has been nothing more in an attempt to ruin sombodies reputaion in a game that is suppose to be that a game !<br>

<br>
But folks, he is right. I haven't been a member of Clan Twisted for long, but if I know one thing about Knor is that he will drop everything to help out his friends. If he says he was in tell hell I can certainly believe it. He is the one people turn to when things go wrong... and he will do everything in his power to help them resolve any issues they might have. I also know that this is just a game. To the person who posted that if you go on to sell something you won in a raid only days before you should know by now that you are going to get flamed here... that is only relevant if you visit these boards regularly. I know I don't. And I don't believe Knor does. Some of us have lives outside of Everquest. Knor is a good man. He probably lost his temper when he responded to these posts as I imagine I would if I came to a board to see myself flamed by people where NOONE had the balls to come to me and actually ASK me what had happened before they proceeded to try and destroy my reputation. He probably should have given the shield back to Medite when he realised he wasn't going to use it. He didn't. He screwed up. He has subsequently given the shield to the &quot;wrong&quot; person?? Whatever. Get over it. It's done. It's resolved. And I shall think less of most all of you as a result of this whole thread. <br>
<br>
As a side note Blight, Hammer of the Scourge was for sale this morning on a naked human vendor. So, it's okay if you are EQ obsessed enough to buy another account simply for screwing people over anonymously?? Whatever. <br>

<br>
A quick note to say I received word from Ledbane that Knor turned over the Bladestopper to him.  For whatever reason, Knor did not send me a tell about it and did not respond to my tells.  Knor, if you are out there, I believe that I have been honest about the situation and gave you the benefit of the doubt from the very beginning.  You returned the Bladestopper and I'm glad that you did.<br>
<br>
As to the issue of who should get the shield, the roll at issue was the roll that was seen in the log Knor posted.  For whatever reason, Marika chose not to roll on the second Bladestopper.  If Marika was confused about the way in which the items were being rolled; if she thought that we were rolling once and that I'd take the highest of the two rolls; she did not mention anything to me during or after the roll.<br>
<br>
Ledbane, according to the way the items were rolled, I believe you are the rightful possessor of the shield.  If you do not feel the same, you are free to award the Bladestopper to Marika if you choose.  <br>
<br>
Marika, if you are out there, what are your thoughts on this.<br>
<br>
Must go,<br>

<br>
I am a 47 rogue, I often group with lower level members and end up tanking for them. I rolled on the shield because I thought the boost in AC and a little bit less aggro would work  for the light tanking I do.<br>

That's the point in tanking. And getting less aggro as a rogue is easy - evade. When I tank for lower levels, I do just that. Get the aggro, evade once, and backstab immediately - most times you'll get the aggro right back, before the mob even landed a hit on anyone else.<br>
Another issue is of course, you're giving up DPS by wearing the shield, making the fight that much longer. Assuming you have good dual wield/double attack skills, and a decent off-hand weapon(I know you do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), you'll be giving up , let's say... one third of your damage output or so? The fight will last longer as a result, and you will suffer more hits accordingly. Not sure you'll take any less damage with the shield, I'd actually guess the opposite.<br>
Look at warriors - I know of no warrior wearing a shield when tanking.<br>
As a rogue, I'd avoid rolling on any shield (except Lodizal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p>Bippin Tenderfoot <BR>

<br>
My thought was I could absorb a lot more abuse and still get in an occasional Backstab when using evade but not having to back way off.<br>

It was just a thought and I would like to test it but it would have to be a damn good shield to make it worth while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1029<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 1:20:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Let's put it this way</span><hr size=1> For anyone but a pal or sk, this will be at best a rare situational piece of gear.

And the fact I am trying to find out how it well it would work should pretty much be a huge sign with flashing lights and sirens that I want to know wether or not it was worth while or not to roll on this.<br>
<br>
25 AC is higher than any piece of armor I wear (BP or tunic is only 22) so it would be significant not including any bonuses.<br>
<br>
So some thing I would use approximatly 50% of the time something that would significantly improve my performance and survivability. And some thing that I am researching to find out if it is viable.<br>

For instance, I've yet to hear you say that shield in your hands would be used at least as often, for as many levels, or for as much tanking as a pal or sk.  You're saying you'd barely use it at all and only in situations where you don't even need more AC, but you'd still use it.  Just because you're asking doesn't make it not greedy.

1) Asking how well using the sheild would work to see if it is some thing I should roll on = &lt;rationalizing a want and having trouble doing so, but still working at it.&gt; <br>
<br>
2) Using it approximatly 50% of the time = &lt;You're saying you'd barely use it at all&gt;<br>
<br>
3)  Having an additional AC item higher than my highest AC piece of armor = &lt;only in situations where you don't even need more AC&gt;(lowering damage is stricly an AC, Agi issue)<br>

   So why don't you take the rolling out of it completely?  Why don't you analyze each character on the raid's equipment, bank accounts, alternate characters, combat styles, etc, and then just derive for yourself who would get the most use out of it?<br>
<br>
   I mean really, you're saying &quot;You need the shield, but not as much as some other guy, so you're greedy for saying you need it.&quot;<br>
<br>
   If you only want paladins or Shadowknights to have a shot at the shield, just lay that out in the treasure rules.  It's what we did when we raided Nagafen w/ Saurix and it worked fine.  For every item that had the potential of dropping, we listed the classes that were allowed to roll on it.  Beyond that, it was can and will wear/wield the item. (ie: Only Bards, Monks, and Enchanters are allowed to roll on the crown of King Tranixx (even though it's all/all).  You can only roll on it if you would wear it over existing gear).<br>
<br>
   Everyone knew the rules going in, and it worked out fine (except for that damn bronze breastplate, but Saurix forgot to include it in the loot list).<br>

I don't know you, but let me assure you, Siffo is far from greedy.  <br>
<br>
He didn't come here with his question about whether or not it would be an effective shield for a rogue and and admit that he rolled on the shield so that you could take it upon yourself to attack him as being greedy.   <br>
<br>
He did it because he genuinely wanted to learn whether or not he was justified in rolling on the shield and to get feedback on whether or not his thoughts on how he might use it have any merit.<br>
<br>
Trust me, if Siffo had won the roll and discovered that it was worthless to him, he WOULD NOT have put it up for sell in the bazaar.  He would have immediately done what was right.<br>

<br>
If the only restriction set on items is &quot;NBG&quot;, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> yes</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, a rogue can roll on a high AC shield if he keeps a set of AC armor in a weight reducing bag for the times when he has to act as tank in his cleric/druid heavy guild... and a warrior is entitled to roll on a high int item if he considers himself a professional blacksmith who's tradeskilling would be greatly helped by the boost.  They're not greedy for asking, they can actually use the item in question (even if not as much as someone else could).<br>
<br>
If you don't want the warrior to end up w/ a piece of hybrid armor, or a rogue to end up with a high AC shield, just lay that out in the rules before you start.<br>
<br>
Someone else said it in a different thread, but the best thing you can do is be clear about the loot rules from the start.<br>

On the other hand I was starting to have fun with him seeing how far he would go into who should have what and what he considers loot whore or greedy.<br>

And besides that if I dont get enough titles I will never qualify for the epic (sound of drums) &quot;UBER L337&quot; (Trumpets sound) title.<br>
<br>
Edity Bit: Syllestrae I agree, I was trying to stay far away from the other bits like needing Wis items because a lot of others wouldn't understand how important they are to tradeskillers. I have two backpacks in the bank that have nothing but Wisdom items I can wear so I stand a better chance of learning when I practice my tradeskills. Does this mean I would roll on Wisdom items? No. I leave those for others who need them for combat. I will however collect them when I can and use them with out guilt that there is some Wis user out there that could use them more. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usiffo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siffo</A> at: 10/1/02 3:54:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1034<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 8:54:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   From what you said, Siffo, you don't ..</span><hr size=1> .. even own a bad shield right now.  That tells me right there that since you are unwilling to spend a wee bit o' cash on a bad one, the only reason you're rolling on a good one is because it's free and the loot team said it was OK.  I'd bet every pal/sk at that raid not only had a good 20+AC shield, but was likely using it during the fight.  Does that perhaps clue you in as to the meaning behind need versus greed and which side you were on?  At least Knorr had the class to admit wrong and undo it.  That's cool.<br>
<br>
Syll, need is always determined by utility over time for the character or class.  That shield may have all/all written on it, but as far as rolling goes, it should be pal/sk only.  Just like dragon bags are all/all, but are really monk-only as far as awarding (anyone else will just sell it to a monk and buy two tinks).  I've heard every song&amp;dance under the sun about how some character has some particular use that makes them special and thus deserving of rolling on an item that has obvious vastly greater utility for another class or character.  But, that's all it is.  Just singing dancing greed in sheep's clothing.  Well, maybe lamb's clothing.  It's a minor greed.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
BTW, I thought of an amusing way to do open raid loot the other day: put it all in one big pile and permit people to BUY it.  Then distribute the cash amongst all present at the raid; eg. CoF drops.  If you want it, pay the typical 75K market value.  Same for all the loot.  Subtract 'dot costs and then hand out the cash to all raiders.  Every raider would likely walk out with about 3-5k.  Can't afford it?  Do lots of raids, raise cash, buy it then.<br>
<br>
It would sure cut down on greed, too.  It's like a DKP system.  Suddenly you see that all those people whining about being restricted from looting incidental seldom used items better suited for another class are not spending any DKP on those and looting them.  It's &quot;Siffo'ism&quot; all over.  Unwilling to spend his own cash on a nice shield, but if there's a chance at a free one, he's all over it!  Why?  Because it doesn't provide enough utility to him to be worth buying and he knows it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usiffo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siffo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Silly old Rogue</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/1/02 10:55:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1475.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: From what you said, Siffo, you don't ..</span><hr size=1> Oh of course you are so right Bjond!<br>

I am so greedy that I didn't buy a shield I never even thought about using till then.

Need Before Greed means that you should not roll on an item that you will have only extremely situational use for when there are others present who would use it often or full time.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can put restrictions on which classes are eligible for an item, but the problem with that is that there might not be anyone present of the eligible classes who wants it, and in that case, I think it's great if it goes to someone who has a rare/tertiary use for it gets it... like using Bladestopper for the Rune clicks, or the torque for tradeskills.<br>
<br>
Of course, I guess it's not realistic to expect everyone to be considerate of other peoples' needs in light of their own need/greed.<br>
<br>
If you aren't sure if you would use the item in question very often, don't roll against people you know really want and would use it.  It's pretty simple.  At least that's how I feel. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

In that situation, if I grouped a lot, it wouldn't be &quot;extremely situational use&quot;.  It'd be pretty damn often.<br>
<br>
   Bladestopper is AC 25, +50 HP, +15 STA.<br>
<br>
   Clay Guardian shield is AC 25, +55 HP (costs about 600 plat)<br>
<br>
   The stamina on Bladestopper makes it a better shield than clay guardian, but a rogue can't use Clay Guardian due to the class limitations.<br>
<br>
   If a rogue said &quot;Hey, speaking for myself, I tank an awful lot in my guild because we only have a couple warriors and 500 clerics&quot;, I don't think that's being greedy.<br>
<br>
   A Paladin would get better use out of it for sure.  They'd use it more often, and they'd benefit from the stamina more.   I suppose I'm disagreeing with your characterization of anyone asking for an item that doesn't fit your idea of the optimal character to receive the item being &quot;greedy&quot;.<br>
<br>
   Speaking personally, I haven't ever had a problem w/ loot distribution here on FV.  In the one open raid I joined (/cheer Saurix) the loot rules were clear and concise.  Everything else has been grouping w/ friends and NBG and worked out fine.<br>

I am not interested in what your opinions are as to how well the raid leaders loot systems work. I am also not interseted in what your opinion is as to wether or not you have decided I am greedy for wanting to make use of the shield in question.<br>
<br>
What I am and was interested in was wether or not a shield with high enough AC would let me be a more effective light tank for working with lower level adventurers. And the reasoning why or why not. As I had never seen a shield with this level of AC that I could equip it had never occured to me that it might be effective till now. <br>
