Whores have always found refuge in the inns and taverns of East and West Freeport. There are even a few hidden away in North Freeport, though not as many now as there were a few years ago.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elenya Vanya'Quendi was one of the few whores living in North Freeport. Being the only high elf whore in Freeport at the time, she was quite popular. She did her business quietly from the Jade Tiger, and supplied many a warrior and paladin with the comforts of a woman’s touch. While she lived in near poverty, she was actually quite rich. Most of this money she stashed away in the bank; just saving it for a rainy day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roquen Lindelorendor was a paladin slowly falling away from the graces of Erollisi Marr. After the death of his sister by the hands of one of the Freeport Militia, he had lost faith in himself and in his goddess. Each day he would wander from tavern to tavern, drinking himself into a dazed stupor. Many members of his guild in the Hall of Truth feared that he would snap, and try to single handedly destroy the Freeport Militia; however, this fear was stilled after about his third week of tavern wondering.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It had been months since Roquen had been in North Freeport. He had stayed away from the area because he felt like he was dying inside every time he saw the yard of the Office of the Peace where Lannie had died. But the bars in West and East Freeport did not have a sweet a swill as the Jade Panther, and it was to this tavern that Roquen was headed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a heavy heart, and down-turned eye-lids, Roquen wondered into the Jade Panther. He pulled up a seat at the bar and looked up at the barkeep. After ordering several types of drinks, he lay his head down against the bar, and waited for the order to be filled. His armor had long since tarnished, and his beard was starting to grow in thick. The sad, pale eyes peeked out from beneath heavy lids, and stared off into space.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elenya looked over at the sad figure at the bar. Something in her heart told her that this was not one that she needed to turn tricks for; this was someone who needed something that she didn’t quite understand. Her thoughts turned away from passionate nights with men whose faces blurred into on another to a cheery home, with a bright fire and days spent curled up before it. The man wasn’t even that attractive, at least, not in the state that he was in.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shaking herself, Elenya left the tavern for home. All the while back to her small house she thought of the strange man in the bar who seemed beyond the realm of this world. By the time she reached her door, she was shaking so hard, she could not get the key in properly. Once she was inside, she collapsed in a little heap in her bed, and fell into a dreamless sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Later that night, Roquen stumbled upstairs to a room in the Jade Tiger and fell to sleep. It was a peaceful, but very eventful sleep to say the least. Though he would feel refreshed in the morning, he tossed and turned as events unfolded in his head.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A woman, with short light blonde hair stood before him. Her white dress was cut low about the chest, and the skirt of it was at about the middle of her thighs. She wore tall white boots, though how they stayed up above her knees was beyond Roquen. Her slender arms were encased in a pair of long white gloves, and a sliver charm hung around her neck.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She turned towards him slowly, the light of the stars dancing off of her hair. Deep blue eyes stared out intensely from behind long lashes – the power beneath them undeniable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do you k now who I am, Roquen?” She asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roquen nodded slowly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Good. I was afraid you would have forgotten the Goddess you follow in your drunken stupor. You seem to have forgotten everything else…or you are remembering things that you need to let go of…” her voice trailed off as she began to walk towards Roquen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He collapsed onto her, and the Goddess of Love held him close.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have found someone to take away your pain, Roquen. She will love and care for you as no other can. But she is not someone that you can keep, as my enemies have already sworn to destroy her.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nodding dumbly, Roquen pulled away from Erollisi.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a deft move of her hand, Erollisi summoned up a great mirror. Its glass was foggy, and the mists inside of it swirled with a pink tint. As she moved her hand over the glass, the mists drifted off to the sides of the mirror, framing the sleeping Elenya.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through a vague haze, Roquen remembered the woman from the bar. He stared at her intently, trying to memorize every feature.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She was still dressed from the day. Her long, red hair was pulled up upon the crown of her head, and cascaded about the pillow that she lay on. Snow white skin graced her, and lips the color of the reddest rose parted in sighs while she slept.  The same amulet that Erollisi wore was about her slender neck, and slowly crept down her shoulders towards the bed.  She was short, for a high elf, but she was beautifully proportioned. Elenya was the kind of woman who would make angels weep for lack of words to describe her beauty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve seen here, I think…” Roquen said.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You will find her,” Erollisi replied, “I promise you that. Now awaken, Roquen.”<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roquen sat up in bed. It was daylight outside, though just barely so. He stood up and dressed quickly, then immediately undressed and bathed. He sent word down to the innkeeper to have a tailor sent up.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After the tailor had made him a fine set of underclothes, Roquen rushed to the Hall of Truth and procured help cleaning his Armor of Ro. Three hours later, the sparkling Roquen left the Hall and headed back to the Jade Tiger. He stopped by a friend’s garden to get some pretty flowers, and found a baker to buy some chocolates from.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He went into the Jade Tiger and noted immediately that Elenya was not there. He had the barkeeper hide his presents behind the bar, and told the innkeeper to send word to him the moment Elenya arrived.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now, the two knew that Elenya was a whore, but they had not seen her with Roquen before, so his behavior seemed strange to them. They were a bit leary about doing anything for him until another one of the Knighs of Truth came in babbling about Roquen and his message from Erollisi. Putting two and two together, the barkeeper and the innkeeper cleared the place out and prepared a fine candlelight dinner for two.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elenya awoke slowly. She bathed, and found that the only clean thing she owned was a bridesmaid dress. It was a deep blue velvet, and not as revealing as a prostitute’s dress should be. However, it was quite low cut, and the rest could be made up for with good converstation and hand placement. So she dressed, and swept back her hair with diamond combs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When she arrived at the Jade Tiger, she knew something was amiss. The bar had a sign reading CLOSED on it, yet when she tried the handle, the door opened. Confused, she headed back for the main area of the bar, and gasp at what she saw.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All the tables save one had been moved out. There was a dark red cloth draped over it, with a center piece of white and pink flowers and two crystal goblets on it. Fine white china trimmed in gold was laid out, and gilded silverware – goldware really – lay next to it. On one side was an empty chair, and on the other…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The man with the sad eyes sat. He was wearing finely tailored clothing beneath the Armor of Ro, though he seemed to be wearing only the breastplate and boots. His dark brown hair was pulled back away from his face, but left to freely hang down his back. He stood, smiling at Elenya with a bouquet of red roses held out to her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Lady Elenya, I am Roquen Lindelorendor, Knight of Erollisi Marr,” he motioned to the other chair, “Please take these, and have a seat. The cook has prepared a wonderful dinner for us, and it is ready to serve now.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Blinking, thouroughly confused, Elenya sat down at the table. This man was not the one she had seen the night before. Something burned inside him that swept over her like a wild fire.  Her earlier thoughts returned, and she forced them down as best she could. No matter how hard she tried to put them aside, they burned rapidly though her mind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For the next several hours, they talked and ate what the cooks had made for them. Inspite of her head telling her that there was no such thing as love at first site, Elenya’s heart felt different, and she quickly fell in love with the paladin before her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Roquen went home with her that night, and within days they were stading before a cleric friend of Elenya’s. The ceremony was small, and only a few people attended. After the ceremony, Roquen and Elenya returned to her home city of Felwithe and remained there for a few years. Only the call of the Hall of Truth brought them back to Freeport, and by that time, Elenya was pregnant. A trusted family doctor returned with them, and cared for Elenya while Roquen continued his word as a paladin.<br>
