Now, I hardly even know who you are, but you're privy to EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT ever received by an officer of AS?<br>
<br>
Have we ever guildremoved someone because of complaints by people outside of guild?  Not to my knowledge.  But I'd be -very- surprised if FnF or Reso ever removed someone because Random_lvl51_Shadowknight accused them of KSing their spider in Velk's or training them in Chardok.<br>
<br>
You're probably talking about Taiil/Strete.  Did they follow the rules much on the server? No, probably not..in fact much less than anyone I know. :P  But those two are still some of the best friends I've made in EQ.  They were good guys, they never went out of their way to cause other people trouble.  So, when someone told me that Taiil had trained them intentionally in Chardok, I knew the truth was that it was an accident.  The way he, uh, levelled involved pulling mass amounts of MOBs.  If someone got in the way there's no way he could explain it without getting reported.<br>
<br>
As far as stupidity in Velks.  Who gives a fuck?  Jesus, the zone's a shithole, do you expect it not to be retarded?<br>
<br>
BTW, the real Taiil/Strete no longer play so I can disclose this information. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 1075<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 3:41:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1596.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wow now..</span><hr size=1> Holy cow Fuvi.. talk about the pot calling the kettle black!

Appropriate seeing as my reply to those references is what I believe Xethux was referring to.<br>
<br>
When I talk about EBay and refer to you &lt;Edit out things the player of Kzan did, personal actions deemed reprehensible to the balance of the server making it in-appropriate to post&gt;, seems you saw the light and &lt;Edit : Player of Kzan's subsequent actions reveal the initial act and is therefore also in-appropriate to reveal&gt;, it's a very pertinent example.  <br>
<br>
Go ahead and find an example of when I use an analogy designed to inflame, Xethux thought Oliver North was, or atleast posted to that effect, I think he was just trolling, much like you are.  Of course you can just post &quot;I don't have the time to find all the hundreds of times he's done this but I can assure you with my vast credibility that it does indeed exist.&quot;  Ya you're right Kzan, can I get KEI please?  People lying to the liar, how fitting.<br>
<br>
Bottom line you're just lying again, grasping at straws, padding your post count, trying to stir up a pot of stew you didn't like the taste of last time.<br>
<br>
Thank god Sydia came and saved you from actually being counted on in CT handling those big bad slimes, heaven forbid you actually would have to perform well on a raid, might as well just have everyone take off EB items and drown, faster than waiting for you to fail at a game your &lt;Edit : delete personal information about how many toons Kzan can play at once and how he aquired those toons&gt; doesn't really help at all, in fact hinders, when all that's really required is someone with a basic understanding of a class who can focus on the task at hand for a relatively short span of time.<br>

I saw the sleeper.  I saw him in SS after Coinfist got us all a port there from outside ST, I mean Reso did go out of their way to make sure anyone who wanted to see him or be involved in could be. <br>

Shazzy<br>
Exxy (both of these are their own, obviously)<br>
Ramel (bought, ex-FnF)<br>

Taiil (bought, ex-AS)<br>
Strete (bought, ex-AS) (Both of these chars were sold by the same person, btw)<br>

They probably have more, too. <br>

You sure you want to stand by the implication that it has something to do with AS?<br>

I mean the stigma and all. I got over it pretty quick. It got easier and easier as I went along and by the time I bought my 5th I didnt even think twice. (I started with 2 on this server, bought 5 for a total of 7)<br>
<br>
Lorii - not a cash based transaction, Faira, Eldread - stripped and re-sold, Ramel/Bimm, Tasker, Taiil/Strete, Rohal<br>
<br>
FaF - 5 (2 in hall of fame), Reso - 3, AS/SA - 2<br>
<br>
Wait, this is more than 5, so the quote isn't from Shazzy or Exxy.  Of course the quote begs the question is EBay the problem or is Shazzy/Exxy the problem.  Note of you pick Shazzy/Exxy you have to establish a reason not related to buying characters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=witherweaver>Witherweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/23/02 12:11:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1596.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kzan is still clueless</span><hr size=1> &quot;Thank god Sydia came and saved you from actually being counted on in CT handling those big bad slimes, heaven forbid you actually would have to perform well on a raid, might as well just have everyone take off EB items and drown, faster than waiting for you to fail at a game your &lt;Edit : delete personal information about how many toons Kzan can play at once and how he aquired those toons&gt; doesn't really help at all, in fact hinders, when all that's really required is someone with a basic understanding of a class who can focus on the task at hand for a relatively short span of time.&quot;<br>
<br>
What has Kzan done to merit your claims?<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgot, you don't like long posts, just read the bottom line then.<br>
<br>
KZAN IS A LIAR.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your last examples weren't very good (at least, I wasn't convinced), and the post you made had nothing to do with Kzan's lying, but rather his lack of skillfull play (or perceived lack thereof).  So this seems off topic and doesn't summarize the post in the way you'd think the &quot;bottom line&quot; would.<br>
