I just love peoeple who start of there posts with things like:<br>
<br>
&quot;If you don't see that by now, you are blind.&quot; In other words I am right you are wrong. . . <br>
<br>
Sorry had to say that :-)<br>
<br>
As to the server dieing. Strange, I spend time giving away things to newbies and well ya know I am seeing a lot of newbies a coming up in the world.<br>
<br>
I certainly am not seeing the empty deserted newbie zones that would indicate death from bellow as well as from above.<br>
<br>
What I am seeing is a good few people deleting characters and starting again. You might find that a lot of the folks who vanished from your friends lists are not actually gone but are re born.<br>
<br>
Of course there is a constant attrition as people grow / get bored / have things happen in there life. This is a natural cycle in EQ, one I would guess many of us have been through.<br>
<br>
In terms of grouping, there are definetly 2 pools of people, those under 30 and those over 50. In between those 2 areas is a more quiet period BUT if you get to know lots of people you can get groups. Might mean you have to travel but you can.<br>
<br>
Thought I say you can get groups there is a key alas here to getting a group, that key is being social and out going. The world is sparsley populated, if you do not have a guild for getting groups then you better know a lot of people by name so you can send em tells and see what they are up to.<br>
<br>
Normaly if I want to group I can find folks in a short period of time, in playing with them and their friends I get to know more people and so on.<br>
<br>
Wandering to a dungeon lfg in this server does not work. Karnors is not full of 50+ people with a few looks for more players, last time I looked there where 6. Does kind a make this place BYOG (bring your own group). In that way it seems more like adventure novels where you pick who you are grouping with before you head out in to the unkown.<br>
<br>
To be fair, if you are not obsesively social and not in a guild that has folks your own age then life is going to be rather lonely <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  my advice is to find a guild that fits your age and play with them. Even in a guild you will have to make an effort to get folks to play together but it is worth it.<br>
<br>
As to the folks on your friends list. My list is fully poped with 30 folks and has been since I started, I think only 3 people have really left the game. A few re started but . . .<br>
<br>
So all in all I would say that the server is not dieing, it is lean but damn do I love it the way it is :-) Still I probably have a bias as I play 2 or 3 chars (if my partner is on then I only play 2 chars) and so have access to a default group that can go to most places on its own (druid, monk, enchantress).<br>
<br>
Good luck to you feneant.<br>
<br>

<br>
I am a recent arrival on the FV. (I should say re-arrival... I leveled up an enchanter here back in the Fall of 2001 and then went back to blue-bie land).<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I have returned to FV! I haven't gotten around to making a new ez board account yet...<br>
<br>
Well, I'd like to say I am looking forward to being back here. I do not stress the population issues. There is nothing to stress. People come. People will go. Others will come. <br>
<br>
Planning is the key when finding a group sometimes. In the high-end of the game, as many know, &quot;pick up&quot; groups are usually lousy and many zones there are no pick up groups. So, if you are finding troubles getting groups, set a time and place with your friends and guild mates for the next hunt. Even if you get two or three to show up the next day, that is a solid beginning to any group.<br>
<br>
I love FV and the rule set. I find the bind rule annoying (hehe), but I can live with it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE no /ooc. A totally abused chat channel.<br>
<br>
Well, folks, I don't know if the server population is going down, or going up or moving left or right.. I don't care.. but I do care that there seems to be some really nice and cool people here and I am glad to be here again.<br>
<br>
Starting off as a &quot;newb&quot; is hard, but I embrace the challenge! See you all in game hopefully <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The people who state that the 30-40's population is small are exactly right.....those are some of the more brutal hell levels and people get frustrated.<br>
<br>
I myself would be 50 now save for the fact Scratchy and I have researched MANY zones and have been raiding 1-2 new ones per week.  We are hitting the zones we can raid as a duo.  I have solo raided zones.  We are doing quests for our level and concentrating on things like that. <br>
<br>
Your right though, that level range is small on this server and I think it will always be....but damn its nice.  No crowded areas.  No doods, no spam no BS.  I only have gotten hot under the collar 2x since coming to this server....and that is rare eheh.  On the old server people constantly ticked me off.<br>
<br>
I notice luclin being rather desolate but ya know what....I can spawn named mobs and they dont get KSd.  We can actually hold camps without getting trained.  There are so many other things that everyone has mentioned that are positives.<br>
<br>
If we change one thing here I would have to say only the LFG/unanon suggestion.  That would be good enough and not affect things too much.  Leave the rest alone.<br>
<br>
Keep the server small.  If you want more people to hang with join a guild or go to one of the other 30+servers.  <br>
<br>
This server is a gem.  We, you included Fen, are lucky to experience it now before others start to figure out how much fun it really is.  <br>
<br>
Scratchy and I are making new friends and planning on grouping much more so Everyone! look for us, send us a tell and maybe we can hook up.<br>

Don't be too happy about a small server. If one day VI decides to get rid off most unprofitable servers, SZ and FV will be on top list.<br>
Small populatiton doesn't mean everyone here will be your friends. Jerks will still be around. Bigger population will give us more options to make friends.

If I could just offer my two cents as an outsider about why I don't play on FV.<br>
<br>
First of all, I was a big supporter of it. But Verant's nonsense about cancelling the RP aspect, then putting it back sort of, really turned me off. It seemed to me that I was being played by VI to keep me in the game and once they had done that for as long as they could, they pulled the rug out. That combined with a lot of anti-RPers on this board before server release really turned me off of the whole thing. When the server came up, I decided to wait until it got a little less crowded. DAOC came out with a real RP ruleset and I went there, but DAOC once again proved the rule that PVP=Griefers and I came back to EQ. But I never got around to actually joining FV.<br>
<br>
Looking at it now, first and foremost, I'm already frustrated on a regular server with my ability to get groups. I don't have that long on a given day to play and I play some odd hours. The population on FV is very small with the languages and inability to do zonewides, and the forced anon making LFG pretty useless, and the grouping restrictions, it just seems like it would be a nightmare to get groups. <br>
<br>
The rules are the rules. I still don't see how any of them promote roleplaying at all. Mostly they just seem to introduce more frustration into a game that already has a lot of frustration elements. Languages may be a RP thing, but that seems like something to be powergamed over -- and I see suggestions on making learning multiple languages a priority. If that's the solution, what's the point anyway? Tho I suppose this would be a harmless enough rule to keep the d00dieheads off the server.<br>
<br>
And I can tell you that from the outside, it sure looks like the server is dying. And it makes me think, gee, why do I want to create a character there and never find a group and watch my friends drift away to other servers.<br>
<br>
What would it take for me to move to the server? Well, if they made more than a token overture to RPers it would improve my mood towards the server--I still entertain notions that VI created an unplayable server ruleset in order to demonstrate that RPers are not a real market. If they got rid of the stupid RP/anon tag, which serves no purpose other than to force people to ask OOC questions and make it harder to find groups, that would actually do a lot to make me think it was a viable server.<br>
<br>
But I guess that's the big issue. I don't see FV as a viable server.<br>
<br>
Remember this is an outsider's view, so please don't shoot the messenger. I've never played on FV, other than logging in to reserve my name when the thing first came up. My perceptions may not be accurate, but they are my perceptions and if we're talking about why people don't play on the server, that's the real issue. <p><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src="http://home.tampabay.rr.com/legolaas/images/numtini-100.jpg" width="52" height="100"></td><td><table style="font-family:verdana,arial;" border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;"><A HREF="http://pub94.ezboard.com/unumtini.showPublicProfile?language=EN" title="<insert popup caption here>" style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:700;">Numtini Lightheart</A></td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">45th Season Gnome of Death</td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">Member, <A HREF="http://pub96.ezboard.com/beqcivismacto" title="Civis Macto Website" style="color:#ff0000;">Civis Macto</A></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

<br>
     I have seen your posts on other boards and I usually agree with what you have to say. But as you say, you do not play on FV and are only looking at it from the outside, so you what not really know what is going on. Even looking at posts will not help you much as people will post bad experiences a lot quicker than good. You would have to play here to know. Now my rebuttal.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;and the forced anon making LFG pretty useless&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I see this as a good thing as it makes you interact with other players.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;and the grouping restrictions, it just seems like it would be a nightmare to get groups.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
The only real group restriction is good cannot group with evil, that is just good roleplaying to me. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The rules are the rules. I still don't see how any of them promote roleplaying at all. Mostly they just seem to introduce more frustration into a game that already has a lot of frustration elements. Languages may be a RP thing, but that seems like something to be powergamed over -- and I see suggestions on making learning multiple languages a priority. If that's the solution, what's the point anyway? Tho I suppose this would be a harmless enough rule to keep the d00dieheads off the server.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Lets take all this at once. The rules do work. TLC keeps the 50 somethings from blowing thru a zone my 25th level cleric's is patiently trying to work our way to a mob that has the magic item we would like but that the 50th level character just walks up to and takes. The language barrier makes you make friends with others of your same race first, then later others of different races. Yes, but if you are power learning languages, why come to a RP server?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If they got rid of the stupid RP/anon tag, which serves no purpose other than to force people to ask OOC questions and make it harder to find groups, that would actually do a lot to make me think it was a viable server.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
If you are roleplaying why would you want to automatically know what level and class everyone on the server is? And it does not force you to ask OOC questions at all.<br>
<br>
     I actually see all of this as an improvement, on what other server do see a group take whatever class that walks up, instead of waiting to get that perfect mix. On my old server, you never saw a group with 4 clerics and a caster or 2. Or a group of all melee. Everybody wanted balanced groups. I love this server, it is friendly, like a small town where everybody knows everyone else. The only reason that you cannot find groups is if you are the anti-social type. If you are that type, play a druid or necro. I can walk in to any zone in my level range and if there is a group there, I walk up to them and if the group is not full voila, I am invited. They do not even ask what class until I am in the group. Sure it is small, but it is new and growing and I have seen it move up (or down) in the population lists lately meaning that it is getting bigger. The only problem I see is that there are alot of power gamers who leveled to 50+ very quick and now are wondering why alot more people did not level almost as quickly as they were accustomed to on blue servers.<br>

I've been told that EQ numbers are UP higher than pre-Luclin.<br>
<br>
As to the server dying, you are pretty much wrong.  Sorry.  Just as some people say the earth is overpopulated, its the same principle.  It's not population, it's population density that is of concern.  As the server ages, the server becomes striated in different PC level ranges, and with all the expansions, people in level ranges are distributed much thinner than in the lower levels.  <br>
<br>
I am fairly new to the server, I came here AFTER luclin launched.  I have met many other people that also came to FV after Luclin, as I group with them almost daily.  Okay, so some of your friends left, I'm sorry to hear it.  But why the doomsaying?  The server isn't dying, and it is certianly far from dead.  Keep in mind some players left this server to try out Vah Shir or Beastlords on other servers.  They are, or will likely be, back.  If you count the server opening, which was high-population hell, then sure, the server is quite dead.  But let's look at the server population from a more steady-state population level, and I would say it's probably nearly the same.<br>
<br>
Also, I heard that Brad Mcquaid plays on this server.  As such, I'm sure there are probably other (current) employees that play here also.  If you really want your petitions heard, post on the official websites, rather than ranting here.  &lt;- not a flame, just a suggestion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/02 6:42:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I think ..</span><hr size=1> .. we want our suggestions listened to, not just heard.

He didn't say it was.  He said the population density makes it seem as if the earth is overpopulated.<br>

It's like if you take a trip to the busiest city in China.  It may seem REALLY crowded to you, especially if you've lived there all your life.<br>

Then ker-plunk yourself into the middle of a rainforest.  Look around.  See anyone?  Not too likely.

<br>
1- TLC.  This needs to go for quest items only.  It is very hard when you are low level (1-10) and don't know much about the game and are still making friends to find out that you missed out on nice little quests.  It is also frustrating that by just doing some of the newer quests from the start you out level them and cant finish.  This IS after all EverQUEST, so why make quests harder or more frustrating.  My idea of fun is not trolling Alacahoweveryouspellit or EQstratics or Everlore to find out exactly when I can do what and where I need to do it.  I do like TLC for things like stopping high level farms and things of that nature.  But for Christ sake lay off killing some of these quests with TLC.<br>
<br>
2- Language Barriar.  This is perfect.  There is no reason a Troll should be able to speak to a Halfling without lots and lots of learning.  Why should they.<br>
<br>
3- Shout/Auction/OOC.  All shout shout work just like it is now.  Do you really think if you yelled at one end of SK someone should be able to hear it at the other?  Auction should only work in cities as it does now.  OOC I always hated, glad its gone.  <br>
<br>
4- About finding groups and anon.  I sort of like that.  You should have to wander about to find people to ask for a group.  As far as anon goes, you should not be able to do a /who and get class and level.  You should however be able to get just level.  Or if someone is /LFG when you do a /who LFG you get their name and level.  Who cares what class they are, if they need a group, you need more and their the same level then let them play (unless your all OG and they are OE or something).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Get rid of the QUEST TLC and make it a tad easier to find someone LFG your level and that would help the most I think while still keeping the 133T d00d2 ()()f |&lt;|_|z j00 50&gt;&lt;0X0R2<br>

On the contrary, I'll look around and see &quot;developers&quot; cutting all the trees down.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the number of zones per server does increase, however jerkily, which is rather my point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubrutinvitellius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brutin Vitellius </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/25/02 1:49:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is dying... slowly but surely</span><hr size=1> I think that this post shows that everyone has a little bit of disatisfaction with the server the way it is set up.  It doesn't mean that it is bad, but it is in fact dying.  This dying is accomplished when more leave than arrive and I have been around long enough to see them come and see them go.  It doesn't change the fact that FV is a great server and that I left my Blue Server without saying goodbye.<br>
<br>
The problem is that frustrations run high with the restrictions, when you have a language barrier, shout limitations and Anon on all at the same time, it becomes impossible to organize.  We also have to remember that Verant sits around all day long and thinks of ways of making this game challenging to people, and what might be good for the 30 other servers might not work well with the specialized few.  <br>
<br>
If Shout were enabled blue and you could reach the whole zone, grouping would be easier, the language barrier is tiresome and frustrating but realistic and I wouldn't change it (Plus my character has really used it to his advantage).  The Anon was to keep us from reverting, something we are going to do anyway but I think it is an open ended question not easily answered, but with at least Shout fixed, we could survive easier without affecting gameplay.  <br>
<br>
We can all pat ourselves on the backs as say FV is doing okay, or we can grab Kleenex and lament the sad loss of our server, either way, until Verant pulls it, it is here and so am I.  The fact remains that player dissatisfaction is high and the turn over rate is high.  I see lots of people cheating on language learning to get by part of the problems and they are destroying the RPing part to make life easier.  That is the crime.<br>

As for grouping.  I mentioned in the other post, you just have to make friends here that are your level, and keep making friends...  <p><html><DIV>

Unless I login at -really- late EST/PST hours (say after 3am weekday) there's usually a person or two in my level range to group with---in popular zones. Not sure what makes a zone popular, but Lake of Ill Omen is a good example I guess. I never, ever had a difficulty getting a group here. As a mage I'd probably be better soloing, but after hitting the hotkeys for /pet guard here /cast 2 and /pet attack for a few hours, it finally gets to you.<br>
<br>
In any case I've met so many great roleplayers on Kunark that my entire FV venture was worth it just for this past week or spent there. Even had a regular group of 3 mages and a wizard going there each night. Were we getting the best experience possible for our level range? Heck no. Were we getting filthy rich? Not really. But it sure was fun. Lots of fun in fact. Then I finally made it into the great Sarnak Fortress with a remarkable group (mage, rogue, paladin, cleric...was something straight out of my AD&amp;D days =)) and well that was great fun as well. <br>
<br>
If FV's dying, I fail to see it. It's really what you make of it after all--I'm not going to judge this server's success by the number of raids done, gods killed, or whatever there is to in the &quot;end-game.&quot; I'm having loads of fun developing my character and so are many others according to what I've seen so far.<br>
