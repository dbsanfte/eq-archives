<br>
Basic rule: Any damge not assosiated to a player will cause you exp loss in a duel.<br>
<br>
Dots - All dots cause exp loss because the dot is assosiated to the victim not the caster.<br>
For instance a 30+dd and dot spell, if the 30dd killed somone then no exp loss would be taken, if the dot killed them EXP loss would work.<br>
<br>
Falling - if you fall and die you loose exp, Gflux type spells or pushing somone off a ledge will both get you exp loss<br>
<br>
Bleeding to death - bleeding to death is not assosisated to any player and this hits me the most, i got knocked unconsiouse by a friend and before he could run to me i died of a dot + bleeding to death... This is the worste one, where casters cannot finish you off in melee hence you bleed to death. Bleeding to death also breaks all status modification type spells, Feign, invis etc etc each pulse.. keep that in mind when Feigned and you go uncionsiouse and mobs agro you.<br>
<br>
LD pets - if a pet owner LD's you can 'taunt' the pet onto yourself but it only lasts around 30 seconds before it poofs, mage pets at that time become slightly altered so they just dont do very well. If this pet kills you it will make you loose exp it's turned from a pet into NPC to takes on new rules.<br>
<br>
DD (direct damage spells) all direct damage spells, aoe and rain will assosiate damage properly, basicaly you get the &quot;soandso has hit you&quot; message, these will never make you loose exp even right clicked items will not make you loose exp, pet procs will not make you loose exp etc etc.<br>
<br>
The 'Arena' the zone has no special codeing for EXP loss at all.. that is just hype, i have lost exp there for:<br>
Dots<br>
Bleeding to death<br>
Falling<br>
<br>
All resently, it has always been that way and will not change - the problem is because the exp loss methods i describe dont assosiate a person dealing the damage... any damage you take not assosiated to a player will loose you exp.<br>
<br>
NOTE: However - they did make a change to make 'arena' or 'pvp' zones never take exp loss (except dots/bleed/fall) BUT within a few hours people were exploiting this in certain zones.. any zone with an pvp arena basicaly... what you would do is lure mobs into the pvp arena and kill them, bind yourself there... and fight, no worrie of exp loss, mana back when you die and bound there... what more can you want?<br>
<br>
In places like Kael Drakkel just think, lure all the hard mobs into arena bind everyone there and just zerg wave after wave after wave....after wave after wave... So they took all the patch back to stop that.<br>

We fought as individuals and as teams. We even created our own games such as &quot;Favor of Innoruuk&quot; where one member on each team had either the &quot;favor&quot; or the &quot;Hate&quot; of innoruuk and special rules applied for killing these key holders of the &quot;forces&quot;. A great deal of fun I assure you.<br>
<br>
As a predominantly evil guild we always had at least a dozen SK's or Necros involved casting DoTs and using pets. The level ranges for these monthly events ran the gambit from the mid 20's all the way up to the mid 50's.<br>
<br>
No one lost experience unless they did something foolish, like ran out of the arena. I think, as the event coordinator and guild leader, I would have known if people, including myself, were losing exp. More to the point, the guild would not have continued the practice for well over a year, happily, gladly, and with great enthusiasm and enjoyment and without complaint, if people, especially in their 40's - 50's were losing XP in the process. It simply didnt happen. Someone would have noticed and said something. Including myself.<br>
<br>
So unless something has changed in the last 6mo or unless you have experienced some sort of isolated bug (which does happen I suppose) I do not see how you could be losing exp. <br>
<br>
Btw, I am looking for the link where Smedly stated clearly there was no exp loss inside an arena... I'll post it when I find it.<br>

Abashi, <br>
<br>
I play a shaman, and I’d love to be able to participate in PvP combat. However, because the shaman has both pets, and DoTs, I can’t /dual someone without the possibility of causing them an experience loss death. Apparently, the system scores a DoT or pet death the same as a fall or drown death, and forces experience loss. Although I think Verant should address this issue, and dedicate the resources needed to fix this bug, you have stated in the past that this is not a priority for Verant. Since this is the case, I was wondering if it would be possible to at leas turn off ALL experience loss in the Arena? There are no MOBs in this zone, and the only way to die is through PvP combat or a fall death. I can’t see how allowing people to fall to their death with no experience loss in one zone would cause any problems, and it would allow people to participate in ‘safe’ PvP combat. So, is there any reason why this can’t be done?<br>
<br>
(Abashi) There's no XP loss for any death encountered while in the PK region of the Arena. Feel free to battle to your hearts content inside there. <br>
<br>
(And later - after many players claimed this was incorrect...)<br>
<br>
Ok, let me clarify then, you *can't* lose experience if you die in the PvP section of the Arena. This is not an accident, *but how it was setup specifically in code to allow battles in this area to take place without that risk*. I did go in and do some tests prior to posting, and *nothing* I was able to do caused experience loss, including:<br>
<br>
1. Death by NPC<br>
2. Death by DOT<br>
3. Death by DD<br>
4. Death by own spell (causes experience loss on ALL servers)<br>
5. Death by bleeding to death<br>
6. Death by falling <br>
<br>
Death by pet still needs to be checked, but it all uses the same code. Perhaps Monday I'll log in and see if someone is willing to have their pet beat me to death there. <br>
