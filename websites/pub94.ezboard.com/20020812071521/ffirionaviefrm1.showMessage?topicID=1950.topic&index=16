<br>
With my alt I used shout to announce  4 quest I was giving out for younger players. The shouts were totally in character, not spamed over and over, and in the end most everyone had a good time and some of new FV players got a few nice items. All they had to do to get those items was pay attention, have shout ON, stay in character, and have fun.<br>
<br>
I had 1 person send me a tell attempting to be the &quot;shout police&quot;, turns out they came in half way through the quest announcement and didn't quite understand what was going on. After some time they got the point, and went from trying to police the shout channel, to actually doing the quest and taking part in some RP.<br>
<br>
So I think it really depends on how shouts used.Sure I don't wanna hear &quot;woot ding! level 12!!&quot; over shout, but train warnings, LFG announcements, and in character comments here and there seem like a good thing to me.<br>
<br>
If things get out of control and shout degrades to endless woots dings, trash talk, and ooc conversations then I'll no doubt be forced to turn it off, but for now I'm giving it a chance, so far it hasn't been to bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utatterdmalion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatter DMalion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/16/02 10:31:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1950.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shout</span><hr size=1> I currently reside in the G Fay/Crushbone area.  I haven't seen alot of /shout abuse; but then again, I've only been here about two months now.<br>
<br>
What seems odd to me is that you have folks /shout LFG, but don't turn on their LFG flag; and also have folks /shout to fill group holes, but don't contact those with LFG turned on.<br>
<br>
To bad we can't come with a standard for forming/joining pick-up groups.  Turn you lfg on and turn off roleplay when you are lfg.  Then turn on /roleplay when grouped.  Have folks trying to fill spots look at those who are lfg.  This would really reduce the grouping shouts alot.<br>

<br>
When I was on my blue server levelling up my druid, I would turn LFG on and take off anon if I wanted to find a group. <br>
<br>
So, there I am, in Overthere, with LFG on, anon off, and soloing some mobs while I wait for a group. <br>
<br>
Sidebar: When I played my druid and necro I grouped as often as I could. It wasn't a matter of experience (I typically got less while grouped) it was a matter of fun, and meeting new people. Invariably, whenever I shouted &quot;level XX necro LFG&quot; or &quot;level XX druid LFG&quot; I would be greeted with at least 5 /shouts of &quot;Necros don't need to group&quot;, or tells of &quot;Druids can solo great, why do you want a group?&quot;. But, alas, that is another thread/rant for another day... <br>
<br>
So, back to the story: I'm sitting in Overthere, with LFG tag on, anon off, and soloing some blue mobs. For 30 minutes an iksar monk is shouting, &quot;Need Sower for group for great experience!&quot;<br>
<br>
I thought, after 5 minutes of that, he'd eventually try /who all LFG, or /who druid, or something... <br>
<br>
After 30 minutes I logged out.<br>
<br>
LFG is a great idea. Unfortunately, people aren't always smart enough to take full advantage of it... <br>

(LOL) I was in High Keep a couple of weeks ago, looking for a group as usual.  I had my lfg tag on, and wandered down to the basement.  There were four others sitting there with their tag on, just looking around.  I looked at them...they looked at me.  I finally asked what class/level they all were.  Turns out we were all within 3 seasons, so I invited them all to group.<br>
<br>
I was amazed that they were all just sitting around looking for a group, but didn't try to group with each other, when the main room in the basement was uncamped.  I could understand if every room was camped and they were waiting for group spots to open up, but to just sit there while spawns were going to waste?  Go figure.<br>

<br>
Someone talks to you in a normal tone of voice and you hear them, but they shout and you're deaf to it?<br>
<br>
I like shout, and for the life of me I can't think of any good reason that they returned shout to zone wide (people on Norrath must have very good lungs). For example, I've got an &quot;avenge&quot; hotkey with a variety of emotes and such, and one of the actions is shouting, &quot;Curse 'em all! I'll avenge yer untimely death, %t!&quot;  In the good old days, it was a nice way to RP extreme emotion. On occasion I've gotten into loud arguments with people, and naturally we shouted at one another.<br>
<br>
Now, though, are all the old RP opportunities nothing but spam? *sigh* I don't want to give up my old ways, but there is no reason that someone WAY on the other side of the zone should be inflicted with my curses at whatever foul creature has just ambushed me and my friends.<br>

I abuse auction all the time ... but usually only in scaracely populated areas to say hello to friends with a /auction WTB Kuroneko or something.   I try not to do it when there are more than like 3 ppl in the zone as I wouldn't want to see it happen all the time.<br>
