*chuckle* ...who, for the record, wasn't me...  Never been married in game as either sex.  It's a touchy subject that brings up complicated issues.  Either it's strictly roleplay in which case it's hollow and meaningless, which I don't like the feeling of, or it's NOT strictly roleplay and ohhhh my god that's way more trouble.  A few years ago when I first started playing it was just creepy, to me... now it's dangerous.<br>

I don't think it's funny, either.  I think it's bizarre yet touching that people react like that to an image, though I'm right there in that category.  When my real life eyes see a female avatar, I get real life reactions to it.  Doesn't matter who's hitting the keys, the rendered female image has an effect on me.  It doesn't make me DO anything,  but I do notice my response to it.<br>
<br>
As for my choice, it was pure pragmatism... if certain folks get more gifts, then that's the kind I want to be.  No humor about it.  Whatever line gets the most hugs and attention, that's the line I'll go stand in.<br>

When someone gives me IC grief my character would get angry.<br>
<br>
When somebody trains me or otherwise breaks the rules of the game then yes, I might get annoyed out of game.  Not because of what their character did but because of what their player did.  Of course, I try to never get angry about EQ stuff.  I don't always succeed but I have never, as a player, gotten angry about something someone's character did to my character.  Another LARP example, when a player set up a plot to kill my wife and child I took them out to dinner to congratulate them on great plot.<br>

<br>
It is very hard to make a character that does not reflect on you in some way.  But that reflection can be the opposite of yourself, an idea you've always found interesting, or a reflection of another character from another source you enjoyed.  I've based a few characters on TV characters etc. and then let the character develop on its own once it hit play.<br>

You've lost me.  I've created many characters for fiction.  I don't get angry or sad when bad things happen to them.  I take pleasure in knowing a great story is unfolding.  If nothing bad happened to them I'd be very dissapointed because it would be a terrible story.<br>

That's a major fucking insult (I assume is aimed at me, and perhaps others) that you had better be able to back up.  And it's aimed at me, not my character.  If you wanted to call my current character a hypocrite you might have some call, though much of his hypocricy springs from multiple personality disorder.   And I wouldn't be insulted by you calling my character a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
At the core of this issue you seem to be thinking that a role-played romance somehow represents a real romance.  That's a VERY dangerous attitude to hold and I think you have already seen that the majority of players here disagree with you.  I've role-played plenty of romances with people I have no romantic interest in.  I've played romantic roles opposite people I would never date in a million years.  If you can't tell the difference...I again question if playing is the best plan for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dessirra>dessirra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/24/03 1:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3921.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: In the eyes of the FV Community...Id like to know</span><hr size=1> My char Poyson doesn't accept gifts and I know several other female characters that don't.  <br>

Listening to the number of men in this thread and on other threads that make female characters just to get loot, makes me wonder how many characters that actually accept gifts are really female in RL or just the men who do this.  I am sure some are female but. . .does make one wonder.<br>

I find the statement curious... what is it about &quot;accepting a gift&quot; that is a real life male trait?  Maybe I'm just misreading it, which isn't unlikely...  Is it that males are unconcerned with a hidden agenda behind a gift being given?  I confess that I'm clueless.<br>
<br>
I have given many gifts to many players in the form of time, money, assistance, and items.  I have no idea what percentage of them were male and female, since both I and my character respond to a perceived need rather than an avatar image.<br>
<br>
But of those, I can recall only a single one who summarily refused a gift, saying in effect that they wanted to make their own way in the world without help.  That one was a male avatar.<br>
<br>
In real life, interestingly enough, I MUCH prefer to avoid receiving gifts and attention for good things that I might do.  It makes me uncomfortable.  I am happiest when good deeds are pleasantly but quietly received, and when people show their appreciation for me in ways other than the presentation of things.  So for me, at least, having a character set up to receive things... is a pretty far cry from the person I really am.<br>

You've asked for advise a few times now.  Here's some free advise unasked for.  And believe me, I'm very fucking serious.  Learn this lesson fast or you are going to regret it.<br>
<br>
*Never* ask a serious question of a mixed group of people, when inevitably some or all of them have opinions, and then say &quot;Oh, and I don't want the opinions of you all over there, because you don't count.&quot;  Maybe in your little mind you only want the opinions of men to see what they think.  Maybe we are all guilty of that sometimes, in various ways, when we imagine one group's opinions are more interesting in a given circumstance than anyone else's.  But for fuck's sake never admit that!  Just let whoever wants to talk talk and sort out the opinions you really want on your own time.<br>
<br>
I pity you in advance for what's going to happen to you the first time you try talking like that when it isn't over a message board.  Dude, get out into the real world, because you are not learning the lessons you need to learn here.<br>

<br>
Oh I was curious because so many males freely admit to creating a female character because they get more gifts.  Not saying that all do or that is it a RL male trait.  Had a few in game tell me they where really males and that is why they created females and have seen males say the same in threads.  <br>
Poyson doesn't accept gifts for two reasons.  One she does want to make it in the world on her own and two she doesnt trust anyone enough to want to feel that she might owe them anything.  Even if the reason for the gift wouldn't be for favors it is part of her personality and mindset.<br>
My other character is Dessirra a young girl.  She will accept gifts and tends to trust everyone like a child does.  She isn't old enough to understand that not everyone is nice.<br>
My comments weren't meant as a slam or flame or even a critism, it just brought up one of the hmmmm moments.<br>

I rationalise it ingame in the obvious way. Unless things are specifically given to me OOC I regard them as in character gifts and therefore, several of my items have their own history and significance attached to them. <br>

Do you accept gifts in exchange for doing something? (no not like that all you dirty minded folk)<br>
<br>
Like that night in Nek when Des gave me a hand. I wasnt really giving her a gift. I was giving her an item in exchange for the time she spent running into Neriak for me. <br>

No Poyson doesn't.  If she does something for someone it is because she wants to and would have refused the item.  Only on the rarest of occasions will she even charge the cost of a coffin for a summons (usually when she is to broke to be able to afford one).  Poyson has some trust issues *grins*.  <br>
<br>
Now Dess thinks your just the cutiest kitty and was happy to do that for you, the shoulder item was a nice surprise for her.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dididaryth>Didi D Aryth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Worshipping Tallonar since 3160</span><br>  Posts: 1338<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/24/03 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3921.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well he was doing what anyone would do for a woman in EQ, shower the hell outta her with gifts, Right after the wedding she(he) sent him a tell, stateing that she (he) was really a male RL.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well, (a) if he CARED whether she was a he in RL, then he's an idiot for showering 'her' with gifts before finding out.

Heck ... I auctioned in guildchat to find a father to my child (a RL ex-boyfriend who wanted to play too) ... the person who answered had been in the guild all of one week ... would I have cared if Tallonar had been a girl IRL?

Like you say sometimes the line gets blurred ... but the bottom line is, if your friend cared if the guy was male, he should have asked first.
