The reason that I do not use www.everquestraids.com, is because the firewall here at the office does not allow me access to it.  Secondly, I had not heard of it until your mention.  We come here, because for the last 2 years that I have played on this server this is where one comes to post, as an FYI.  I will how ever check out the site when I get home and see if the rest of the community would like to start using that as a way to cross reference events.  Thanks for bringing another tool to our attention that we did not have before. <p>The not so silent monk from the House Valiant</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bjond>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/5/03 5:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> It's not as widespread as ..</span><hr size=1> .. you seem to think.  Neither of the two other servers I've played on use the site (Tunare or Storm Hammer).  The site didn't even exist back when I was playing on Tunare.  FV doesn't use it either -- not much point.  We're pretty much FiF on FV.  I know that I only consider 3 things when calling a raid: is the target up, do we have the force online to do it, and is anyone else there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>right now</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?  Raids scheduled by folks not even logged on don't enter into the equation.<br>
<br>
I do cruise the raid section here on the FV boards now and then.  Considering that there seems to be only maybe 1 or 2 new threads a week in there, I don't think our vast volume of open raids warrants a new dedicated web site.  'Course, I don't do open raids, so it's really up to the open raiders on what they want to do.  This forum here is primarly for recruiting.  Any schedule will mostly be ignored (ie. have alternate targets in mind).  This isn't as bad as it sounds; the FiF guilds barely bump into each other, much less the open raiders.  I think I can only recall one time when we happened to bump into an open raid -- a hate raid that came up a couple hours after us and we just moved in deeper to give them room.<br>

<br>
As you said on that thread, all the people on this thread upset, but the people upset are you, Medika and another one of your guild members. <br>
<br>
You say on that thread:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Stav i think you should read the post on this message board that is called Raids..people are really upset at the harassment you and your guild members have done to Elysuim Elite..this time we will let you have your raid..however since there are posts that state we should have done ours you will not be so lucky next time..your harassment form you and your guild members was uncalled for and you have given your guild a big black eye for that harassment..this site is for raids yes..but not to reserve the dragon like you think..it is a FIF server which means anyone can raid without posting here!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And here is my reply:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Pondwater, if anyone has blackened their guilds name, it is you. Your guild was not harassed at all, nor where you.<br>
<br>
Friday, your guildmembers contacted Skrag, a shadowknight in my guild for corpse summoning from a wipe in Permafrost.. During which, they told him they are going to be raiding Nagafen the next day (the 9th) and may well need corpses summoned, if he was going to be around.<br>
<br>
Based on your post, where you spoke for you guild, saying they had agreed to postpone their raid in favor of mine, I asked you if you guild had changed it's mind and decided to go ahead with the raid. Your answer was, I don't know, I don't control them, they can do whatever they want. <br>
<br>
And I said, I wasn't asking you to control them, only if they had planned to raid anyway. You then got rude with me and said:<br>
<br>
Quote: Listen if don't leave me out of it...you go on ignore and reported for harassment how about that? I stated what was true at the time and no things maybe different and I can not control that. (verbatim)<br>
<br>
You then went on to say how SOE and does not recognize camps or pre planned raids, and how you and Medika no longer think I'm cool.<br>
<br>
Then a few minutes later, you asked if I sent any other tells since you were zoning.<br>
<br>
But at your request, I left you out of it. I did not send you any other tells. But I did talk to your leader, to let her know the way you talked to me, when I was just trying to find out if your guild was raiding there or not. And if you don't understand why, it's simple, I had to know if we should have a backup plan in case your guild succeeded. Your posts came across as you speaking for your guild, since you said they had agreed not to raid in favor of our raid. <br>
<br>
Not once did I try an claim that your guild had no right. Nor have I ever said that your guild couldn't raid Nagafen Saturday. In your past post on this thread, you claim that your guild had a posted raid on it's own site long before we ever posted our second attempt. Which comes across as though your raid should get first dibs. You also post on EverQuestRaids.com your raid, and suggest everyone use that site to co-ordinate raids to prevent this very thing from happening. Clearly, at some point you felt that who ever's guild had the longer standing plan to raid something should come first.<br>
<br>
But now you say, it's FiF, these posts don't mean anything. So which is it? Posted raids first, or who ever gets there first? Because you can't have it both ways.<br>
<br>
And if anyone from my guild has contacted you AFTER I stopped talking to you, let me know, because I specifically told them to NOT say or do anything to you or your guild. I will look into that myself as well.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
And for the record, no one can declare a server FCFS, or FiF. That is a guilds choice. No one has to respect what another guild plans, but House Valiant will respect anything they see on this MB in the Battlefield section. Like I said, you're guild did not post here. And when I talked to your guild leader, I was told they never knew about the FV message board, which is why they don't post here. <br>
<br>
Had your guild gone and done Nagafen, there would have been nothing we could have done, nor would we have posted anything negative about your guild. But, as you posted and spoke for your guild, Your guild decided to cancel the raid. So I went ahead with mine. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stavehamvaliant@firionavie>StavehamValiant</A> at: 8/10/03 8:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pondwatertrollhater>Pondwater Trollhater</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 3:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm59.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=691.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raids</span><hr size=1> Ask Aer for the list of names..i am sure she wrote them done...ohh yeah the vox raid hmm funny there was 3 of us on that raid..not sure how that can be are raid..or you mean Nellen's raid..once we wiped he camped and said &quot;Fu@# all of you get your own bodies&quot; .

<br>
If Aereona has a list of names written down, and has issues or if they talked to her in anyway that was disrespectful, she can contact me. But if people were harassing you, your last post would have been the perfect time to give me those names.<br>
<br>
I don't see what Nellen has to do with any of this. He's not on my guild, as you know, and I have never met the person. If he did something crappy, like leave you all to get your own corpses, that stinks. Still has nothing to do with me.<br>
<br>
You and Medika where in the Plane of Innovation at the time, so you don't even have first hand knowledge of what Thrakkul and Perelik where saying to Skrag when they asked for a corpse summoning in Permafrost.<br>
<br>
For someone that wants to be left out of this, you sure are keeping it alive. Not once have I attacked you, or accused you of anything or your guild. I'm only responding to your posts. <br>
<br>
You ask me to leave you out of it in game, and I do. I haven't sent you a single tell since you said leave me out. But you sent me more tells, even one asking if I had sent anything, because you were zoning and might have missed it. Generally, when someone wants to be left out of something, they also stop talking it about it, they don't ask people to repeat anything they think they might have missed or post on the same subject 2 days later.<br>

I talked to Aereona today, in the morning, to find out about this list of hers. Well, she did recieve some tells asking why she was trying to raid the same time I was raiding, but that none of them were harassing her or threatening her guild. And that she replied to them and said that they had rescheduled their plans. <br>
<br>
She also didn't write down any names. I do know that I have now talked to everyone in House Valiant and everyone says they the same, they never spoke to anyone in your guid. I've never known anyone in my guild to go behind my back, or not follow any request made of them.<br>
<br>
I do know that many of the people that signed up for the raid knew about the conflict of interest from the posts on the site, as I did not go around telling anyone that was not in my guild about it. I was asked about whether it was still a go by them. <br>
<br>
So, with no list, and Aereona's own words that she wasn't harassed or threatened, just asked why they were planning to raid the same time as my raid, I think saying that I sent people to harass your guild is a distortion of the turth.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, you came here, and made your posts, speaking for you guild and started this. If anyone gave people the impression that your guild was trying to fource it's will on others, to the point where people started sending your guild leader tells, asking why, it was you. Not your guild, but you.<br>
