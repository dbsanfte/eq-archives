Whether that member is too low (mob super red) or too high (mob green) makes no difference.  If the TLC kicks in on the mob you've killed, you will see, in red:<br>
<br>
A_Insert_mob_here_01 was a Trivial Challenge to your party!<br>
<br>
This is how you know the TLC got ya.  And whatever magic or lore item that normally would have dropped, did not.<br>
<br>
Simple really.  The way the TLC changes the game dynamics is that you must conduct certain quests before they are too easy for you, and the harder quests and some raids now have what's called a &quot;TLC Team&quot; of lower-level PC's whose job it is to specifically kill the mob from which the drop is needed.<br>
<br>
My first experience with this was in Castle Mistmoore, where I was on the TLC team.  We had 3 teams of higher season (a level on Firona Vie is usually called a &quot;season&quot; for warriors and wisdom casters, a &quot;circle&quot; for intelligence casters, and a &quot;symphony&quot; or &quot;song&quot; for Bards...but it's really up to your imagination what you want to call your levels, just as long as you can be understood and you don't use the word &quot;level&quot; which is just SO d00d. ugh.) players running &quot;air cover&quot; for the TLC team, which had its own healer, nuker, and tank team.  It worked.  We integrated well and got what we needed.<br>
<br>
It also makes the young ones more valuable to the old ones.  On other servers, once you hit the high end game, you don't have much use for &quot;newbies&quot; anymore.  On Firiona Vie, it's common practice to hire lower level people to do quests, or to assist in quests that you have become too high for.  On a positive side, the TLC promotes cooperation and the use of real people skills to get what you want.<br>
<br>
You want Jboots?  You can't just level up to 60 and camp the AC anymore...he'll TLC out and you'll never get them.  So you have to make a deal with someone younger who can still get EXP from that AC...or you must do it yourself when there is still quite an element of risk.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the TLC brought back into line a lot of the original intents for the quests and the drops that the &quot;no drop&quot; code was intended to fix but didn't.<br>
<br>
Yes, it can be a hassle.<br>
<br>
Yes, it takes some getting used to.<br>
<br>
But it makes sure that those who are SUPPOSED to kill the proper mobs at the proper levels...do.  And pharming becomes just another dangerous way to make money...but you can still do it.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1) Is my idea that Shamans are a nice compromise between the 2 for groups and solo? It appears they are offensive which I like.<br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Shamans can be seriously offensive, especially when they overpull.  Just kidding.  Shamans have a place in the game just like every other.  If you like it, go for it.  Keep in mind, though: <br>
1) Druids get port and snare and track, Shamans don't.  <br>
2) Shamans get a kickass pet at 34  <br>
3) Clerics are the only pure caster class that can rez and they will always have the best and most mana-efficient heals, AND they are a &quot;plate&quot; class, meaning they can wear PLATE ARMOR, which has the highest AC.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2) Regarding this server, should I start here or some other server?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Honestly, I always recommend that a true newbie (not meant to be derogatory...I just mean someone new to the game and its mechanics) try out a regular blue server first, to learn the mechanics, where /ooc exists, you can ask game mechanics questions without getting dirty looks, and you can find groups and learn things from other players.  I've found that two kinds of people flocked to Firiona Vie:  The experienced veterans who have 50+ characters on one or more servers, and true newbies, who run around saying &quot;How do I do this?  What's this thing mean?  I pay my money to play this game how come you all are being mean to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
We're not being mean, we're playing In Character, because that's what we came here to do.  Learn the game on a server where it is easier to learn the game, THEN come to Firiona Vie and experience a real role-playing experience.  It still exists, though many of us are disillusioned with it because of many of the &quot;Lewt D00ds&quot; who have come here to take advantage of the server rules.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3) If I pick a race for a Shaman, I am torn between Barbarian (tried him but I hate their zones and I can't see), Troll (I like the looks but big) or an Iksar (smallest which I like but I looked in their zone and got lost and died ALOT). Any pros and cons are appreciated.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You will find that playing the &quot;evil&quot; races are more difficult here, because in character, the &quot;lighty&quot; race PC's may shun you merely because you are of an evil race, and you can't raise faction with THEM.  You may find yourself refused groups for In Character reasons (Like a Paladin refusing to fight alongside a Shadowknight of ANY race, for instance)<br>
<br>
Playing an &quot;evil&quot; character is harder on almost every server, but this one has a few more handicaps than others, and you should seriously consider this when you roll up your one and only character to play here.  Keep in mind also that this will be the only character you have, so you cannot escape to an Alt if you screw up.  All you can do is rename (which is expensive) or re-roll (which is frustrating).  So it is important to know these things before you take the plunge.  Another reason to try out all the races on a blue server before coming here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4) I will play later and need to be versatile.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Versatility is good.  When you say &quot;Later&quot; what do you mean?  There are EQ players worldwide, across almost every time zone on Earth.  Of course the most populous times will be US Prime Time, but you could conceivably find a group just about anytime...I know I have.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5) Any recommendations on what to put points. I thought I would put all my points into wisdom.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If you're a Wisdom caster, such as a Shaman, a Druid, a Cleric, a Ranger, a Paladin, or a Beastlord (did I miss anyone?) Then Wisdom is your most important trait, as not only does it determine how much mana you have, it also determines how quickly your skills advance. (Technically it will be either Intelligence or Wisdom, whichever is higher, but not both).<br>
<br>
If you're an intelligence caster, such as an Enchanter, a Necromancer, a Magician, or a Wizard, then putting your points into Wisdom is a complete waste.<br>
<br>
If you're not a caster at all...then you should put those points somewhere where they will do some good.  Stamina is an all around good place to put points, because that determines the number of hit points you will have.<br>
<br>
But really, there are guides for basic character creation on sony's website, as well as many other places on the Net...which have much better data than I can provide here on the nuances of what points put where, do.  Better off to go there and read up on whatever class you are choosing.<br>
<br>
I wish you good luck, and welcome to EverQuest.  If you decide that Firiona Vie is where you wish to be, then by all means roll up your character and start your reputation.<br>
<br>
Remember that your reputation is much more critical here because you only have ONE character.  You will see people on blue servers acting in a rude, belligerent, or downright nasty manner;  This is known as &quot;blue trash&quot; and that, in part, is what we have come here to get away from.  So guard your reputation, for that is how ye shall be known in this Realm.<br>
<br>
Good hunting!<br>

<br>
Other tips:<br>
learn how to make hotkeys and remap keys (like auto-attack.. I think that's not on &quot;a&quot; anymore, but just in case)<br>
<br>
Ask LOTS of questions. Most folks will be very willing to help out a genuinely new player (there aren't too many around) and we all remember how hard the game is to start out in.<br>

That's a good website for class information for newbies and veterans alike.  Scroll down to where it says Class Areas, click on the class you want to read about.  Click the Creation Guide to see some good information on the character's role, strengths and weaknesses, and if you're a caster, check the spells area to see what sort of spells you'll be getting.<br>
