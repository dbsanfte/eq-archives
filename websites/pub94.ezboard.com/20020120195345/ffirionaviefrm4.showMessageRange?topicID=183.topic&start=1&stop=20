Headed to Highpass Hold, which I've never really explored before, but just ran through in Camoflage hoping no gnolls or orcs found me (back when I was Tenth Season).<br><br>I logged on very late last night and found Dyllin.  There was a PC human monk standing nearby, but not doing anything.  I thought maybe the monk was after him, but s/he wasn't attacking him and s/he /conned yellow to me.  I don't speak human very well, so asking him/her was problematic.  So, after a few moments, I started setting up my 'Elven Pincushion' tactic (Shield of Brambles on myself, followed by a Stinging Swarm, although in this case, a Grasping Roots before the Stinging Swarm).  Then I go into melee with him, killing him but the smugglers killed me.  Not before I got the page and the Bayle List III letter, though.  Before I die, the monk /rudes me.<br><br>So, when I get back to my corpse, the monk's still there with a guildmate, a halfling druid.  I sent a /tell to the monk apologizing and asking if s/he was after Dyllin, but I'm sure it was garbled.  I got a /tell that I could decipher as &quot;You are awful...  &lt;garble&gt;&quot;.  So, feeling very guilty about stealing a seven-hour camp, I give the halfling druid guildmate the page and give the human monk the Bayle List, and say &quot;I'll come back later&quot;.  The halfling, it appears, understood me, thanked me profusely, said things were squared away and that I was an honorable man.<br><br>So, feeling good about myself, I log off, figuring I'll relog when the patch is done and see if he's there, which is exactly what I do.<br><br>Who do I find there?  The human monk.  And another guildmate.  I'm starting to suspect (okay, more than suspect) that the human monk may be 'farming' Dyllin for his/her guild.<br><br>Now I feel like I was played for a sucker.<br><br>Any good suggestions for what I should do?<br><br>Lasgalen, Sixteenth Autumn Initiate of Tunare <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ustormtower.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormtower</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Travelling Circus</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/20/01 11:15:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nice guy or sucker?</span><hr size=1> *shrug*<br><br>You died for it.

If the mob is standing there and the person doesnt take it down in a reasonable amount of time then you have to assume that they arent there for the mob.  I think making every attempt to communicate with them is necessary.  I mean if you hail the person, /tell the person, yell in there ear, jump up and down in front of them, /bonk them and /poke them and they dont do anything then I say that negates their call to the camp.  If its a timed spawn ie it dies and then repops 7.5 hours later, that time wasted while they are afk/sleeping for an hour or 3 puts everyone else behind for that pop, so they are in fact using your time while sitting their not dropping the mob.  Look at it the same way we did about Nagy on the old servers.  You dont kill nagy and Rage doesnt pop.  If it was your guilds turn to take nagy down you had better git it done or people got kinda pissy.<br><br>Just my 2cp though.<br><br>Ichi <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/20/01 11:41:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=183.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nice guy or sucker?</span><hr size=1> /agree<br>No guilt if they were camping it and didn't take it in a good amount of time then it's yours.

I am very proud of my testament, I stayed and watched for Dylin for over 6 hours. The smugglers killed me before I killed him, but I managed to get back on and kill Dylin before any oppurtunists could (and they tried but he was in the water and I got to him first). It took me a week for my turn, but I stayed and got him, but I will never hold the spot for someone else.
