It's not about what works, what does the most damage per mana or what beats which best.  It's about creating a character, and finding some way of working that character into the world.  If that means playing a bad cleric, someone who is constantly screwing up but is fun to be around, simply for the reason they make those stupid mistakes, so be it.  Of course, I can understand if you're really trying to kill something big, then yeah, play it properly, but if it's part of your character...<br>

Later we get group Rune, for about 40 Points while healing for 40 a tick, this often keeps the group at full health ( or neer it).<br>
<br>
I have nothing against clerics, I just like to break the &quot;holy trinity&quot;. One nice thing about clerics that I like is it allowed me to bring my mele skills up for a while... Using my 2 dmg song and healsong I could not use my weapon in 3 levels and frankly I like to keep my skillz up to par... when the cleric got low on mana I just switched back to all Instrument again.<br>
<br>
If you don't beleive me just post the question on www.eqdiva.com webpage in the discussion section... see what responces you get. Perhaps you haven't grouped with only &quot;good bard&quot;.<br>
<br>
A good bard is defined by one that can twist 3 songs, a really good bard is one that choses the one based on experience and recomendations. A GREAT bard is one that does both of these and used techniques that no one else has, and gets away with it. *sight*<br>
<br>
I may not have &quot;a really high level character&quot; but I listen to my elders and experiment.<br>
<br>
Of course I hope no one is offended... just my views and experience. I have found myself very usefull in groups of people at least 20 levels higher...<br>

Cleric CH + Warrior HP == great group.  You can get away with a shaman as main healer for xp groups and (rarely) a druid, but that's about it.  Group rune can keep you alive long enough for the cleric to med up for another heal or to limp along for some gimpy xp, especially if your tank can self-heal.  Odd groups can work, they just don't work as well as groups with a real healer (cleric or shaman).  Don't get me wrong, I love bards to bits.  I've grouped with some amazing bards.  But, bards are not combat healers -- not even close.<br>
<br>
However, bards are wonderful additions to just about any group.  I disagree about the 4-5 bards tops comment.  We had about 6 or so high level bards.  People would fight over who got the bard in their group at raids.  Get a bard on a dragon raid and it means your group will live (resist song, mana song, rune song).  Any time a bard logged on and said, &quot;any groups need me?&quot;, the reply was instant.  Bard AE groups are amazing.  A 5 person group (bard, monk, sham, sk, cleric) completely cleared disco 1&amp;2 of old-seb in about 3 pulls using the bard AE damage song.  We had to sit about waiting for the area to respawn.  By comparison, wizard AE is pathetic -- you end up waiting on the wizard/s to med and if you don't have an enchanter to AE stun/mez, you can't do it.<br>
<br>
BTW, good clerics are nice, too.  Hell, a skilled player of any class is nice.  FV has a ton of first time players.  A lot of them will become highly skilled, but it takes some time and they need folks like you to help them get there, Steeltoe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/21/02 7:02:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1416.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Actually, Tirga, ..</span><hr size=1> Take it from me.  Druids are HORRIBLE healers.  I was often forced to be a healer back on the old server.  Absolutely horrible job, used up my mana like nothing else, for so little regen.  I was always glad for a cleric nearby.  It meant I could use my mana for easier things like buffs, damage shields, harmony and nuking.  Also, I was sort of an emergency damage absorber if the first tank was really badly hurt (if we only had one tank) I'd melee the gimp for a couple of seconds trying to draw him off.  Being clad in full leather armour helped me take damage much better than the pure casters, giving the good old cleric some time to get our tank back into the fight.

Bards are needed, but are not needed in great numbers like Clerics/Warriors/Rogues and Wizards. So when your guild tends to have a 'cap' on how many people it would like in the guild you have to trim numbers somewhere and that somewhere is usually in the Magician and Bard area... you really do not need 10 bards in a guild to make encounters successful. Thats all I was saying...<br>
<br>
Bards kick ass, but they have there place and many play them well...<br>
<br>
An example would be Crip... twisting 5 songs... he is a manimal....<br>
<br>
Bards a GREAT addition to any group... but if I want mana and crowd control Im going for an Enchanter (*IF* I had to choose...)<br>

<br>
Healing song (all based on high level with decent instruments) - 35Hp a tick regen<br>
Rune - starts at 40 dmg with lute at level 45 goes to 60 at higher<br>
<br>
One pulse of healing 2 of Rune<br>
Over 15 second duration<br>
<br>
healing will do 105 healing Tops<br>
Rune will absorb 80 dmg tops... but the boon is it does it to everyone... with a few tanks bouncing the agro... that potentialy does 185 dmg at level 49 ith basic (non magic) instruments to everyone in the group ... right?<br>
<br>
take 3 tanks  and that's 555dmg per 18 seconds prevented ( not that attacker will always hit either....)<br>
<br>
Seems like enough for me (for experience) as long as there is only one attacker... this is easy with many single pull techniques or have another bard simply charm the other and send it against the one you are fighting and mez if there are more (too many and it get's tricky .. but that still happens with a cleric) . <br>
<br>
Ok ... since this is a RP server I am giving this topic up (unless you start saying something provocative but you won't will you ?) Back to the fun of RPing ...<br>

While this is very different from playing a cleric, I think I have a pretty good idea of how to play one because of the experience of playing the shaman and noting the differences between myuself and my cleric friends. I hope that made sense. I have every intention of playing this cleric for a very long time and seeing 60 and beyond with him. I have several RL friends I am playing with so it makes it a lot easier to play a cleric on this server though. Just letting you know you are not the only one out there.<br>

Everquest is very fun in the lower levels, enjoy them.  And Tira, I have no problem you breaking the holy trinity...there are *no* holy trinities at lower levels.  At higher levels they are, dare I say, a necessity, even on regular experience grinds and not just big raids.  Monsters regularly harm touch, hit for a gazillion pts (ok I'm exaggerating on the gazillion), and are all around just nasty.  I'm sure you will find this out for yourself the higher you go.<br>

[EDIT] Also, I love that fact that you play the healing song in battle, tis very brave of you.  But personally, in higher levels, you play your heal song *in battle* and I will yell at you.  Because that 555 damage per 18 seconds, is now 555 damage per 18 seconds of agro on YOU. I can't remember how many more hitpoints bard have over rangers, but when rangers get agro they usually die quick.<br>

One of my really close friends played a bard.  We were a bard, rogue and 2 cleric quad group.  He used to go with us in rathe mts to solo 3 giants at once.  He'd charm 2 and let them beat one etc etc.  Later on he did the same in the pool room in SS.<br>
<br>
Us clerics just twiddled our thumbs and tossed a heal now and again, and played cards with the rogue. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwynfred.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wynfred </A> at: 2/21/02 8:08:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaronder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aronder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/21/02 8:40:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1416.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Actually, Tirga, ..</span><hr size=1>  Bards are great to have around.

 Although do not discredit clerics. High levels of the game and in places like Kunark and Velious you will need a cleric. Mobs hit way to hard and to fast. Most clerics that are good do not cast CH anymore because of agro. Res is always nice. Being blind and running to your corpse in the middle of the night can really stink. <br>

A darn fine one at that  *winks*<br>
<br>
Through a twist of fate I became a cleric here...  I enjoy it, but I do miss the carefree life of the rogue.   Healing is a stressfull job.  I have several mentors who teach me strategies, but I also experiment on my own.  <br>
<br>
Coming from a rogue's background, a cleric can hunt alone anytime he wants.  I never really could when a rogue.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I've reached 35th level, and keep me tinker's healed as best I can.  It's tough sometimes when I'm the only cleric and there are about 10 of us hunting in a dungeon.  I am proud to say though that we had no deaths the last time we ran through runnyeye.   The other day we were using stalking probes to scout within the dungeon of solsek's eye safely.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for groups... I think sucess can be had with any diverse combination of players.  Healing prevents downtime at a minimum... or allows you to take on something much tougher.  A rogue is like a pet that won't get attacked... free, fast damage.  Bards make the group fight stronger in my experience.  Another good example was a group I was in in sebilis... Shaman, Rogue, Bard, Necromancer, Cleric, Enchanter.  At one point we had no less than 15 frogloks in the room, and the Bard, Necro, and Enchanter managed to keep them all under control.  It was a sight to see.<br>
 <br>
As a rogue, I played in an amazingly diverse set of situations.  Many of them arose from just trying to make something work with who we had available.  Some places can be done without clerics, shamen, enchanters, bards, and other classes... some favor one class over another... to me it depends on your tactics and the skill of the players.  People never would let me pull or scout much, Even though I loved to be the scout... Most folks &quot;knew&quot; how to hunt a zone and would take no chances, do no dungeon crawls, would setup tents and camp.  Boring heh.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, in the end my transformation to a gnome of the cloth has been rough, but I feel I play the healer adequately.  I've finally stopped trying to circle around the backside of the monsters.  People send me /tells all night long for groups... almost too much.  I suppose we are a rare breed, or stay lower profile. <p><b><i>Sabbik Silvertongue</i></b>, Cleric of the Tinker's Pride<br>Linguist, Master of Tinkering and Pottery

From about 14th on, I have ended up being the primary healer in the group.  Understand, I do not say that this is ideal, or that it will work at higher levels, but I have noticed that I end up being the healer because I am willing to do it right.<br>
<br>
Specifically, I meditate constantly, keep the messages on to show me what's going on, and watch the health bar, standing up only to heal, usually the tank, and pacing the healing to manage agro.  In an orc group in highpass, I was the 'backup' healer and I stood to heal and noticed the cleric in melee! Sigh.<br>
<br>
It may be boring, but 'medding to heal' means more pulls which means more xp, loot, and general success for all of us.  When I have been in a group with a well played cleric, I have enjoyed doing some direct damage and helping with crowd control, but even then I hold back about m20 for 'emergency back up heals'.  And my groups rarely have had wipe outs.<br>
<br>
Still, I expect this to change once I get the nice ae damage spells. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Proverbs 27 Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.<BR>
