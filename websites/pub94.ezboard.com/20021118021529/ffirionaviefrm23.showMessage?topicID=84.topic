<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> From the Darkness, a blade came flying... severing the person standing on the Podium's head from his sholders, dropping him dead on one slash. Shintou emerged from the darkness, standing behind the Podium.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;You have said enought.&quot; ((~TM Zanis Manaduke.))<br>
<br>
&quot;I offer my services to you in Balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I seek to balance the world.. balance will rule over all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I come, offering myself in Balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Spare me your nonsence. You aren't balancing anything, you damned Tunarian Trash. Evil is Legion, evil is strong. Their are many evil hearted fighters in Norrath.. but how many good hearted ones still exist in this land?<br>
<br>
I can probably count them all on my fingers.<br>
<br>
Where is their share of this 'Balance'. Your scale has been tipped in the side of evil little Druids, you fools. Do you not see how these bastards are lying and using you? Druids don't want balance..<br>
<br>
They want to use the power that is evil. If they wanted balance, they would give that Holy Warrior, the Paladin a Helping hand. But they don't care about their Tunarian Cousins. Their Mithanel Marrian Soliders. The ones that serve and defend all that is good, Nature, and the like. They care about those that destroy, why?<br>
<br>
Because those that destroy have power. They want that power, so they make this little weak story to try to draw us in.<br>
<br>
Don't be used.<br>
<br>
~'I'm just using this Ranger for my own purposes, Bwhaha.~<br>
<br>
/smack<br>
<br>
&quot;You have said enought. Already you are a fool. Sit down, shut up, and that will be all.&quot;<br>
<br>
In that party, your Ranger is gaining Experence too. He's gaining fighting as well. He's gaining your trust, and he WILL betray you the moment he can find someone else to give him Money and Loot. Using someone means they get NOTHING from the Deal. But this Ranger gets Training, Trust of that Cute little Tier'dal female healing him, maybe even pleasured in extreme cases, as well as maybe a bit of Cash and a nice little going away gift.<br>
<br>
Come on, don't be a fool! Evil will lose for sure if this continues.<br>
<br>
Why do you think no one wishes to be good? We are too STRONG for them. In my entire life, only ONE person that followed the path of Good ever stopped me. Only one.<br>
<br>
And their Neutralic friends don't like them. Everyone wants to be on the winning side.<br>
<br>
Tell me everyone, how many Paladins have you ever seen in Norrath?<br>
I've seen five, maybe 7. Where is their help? No where to be found. Paladins die a lonely death at a very young age, they don't even get to fight! You Neutralic bastards will never fool me with your lies, Balance.. Yeah, whatever.<br>
<br>
Evil doesn't win in Balance. No one wins in balance. Balance will only weaken us, and strenghten the Paladin, for we are strong, and they are weak.<br>
<br>
Do you want to be as weak as a Paladin? No, of course not.<br>
<br>
Why are you serving Balance then? Using the Druid? Bull$%^#. You're the one getting used.<br>
<br>
How do you not get used? What is the Key?<br>
<br>
Look to the Iksar Legions. They are strong. Why? Because of one simple thing that maybe we would need to learn.<br>
<br>
They don't trust, rely on, and befriend Druids. They trust, rely on, and befriend themselves. Those that are allied with their path to kill all and rule Norrath under an Iksar only society. As evil ones, we need to stop looking to weak ass slaves and Druid toys and see our dark bothers and sisters around us. Its time to stop playing happy go lucky woodelf, because if we ever truely banded together, we'd crush all of those that stood before us, and their could be nothing that could stop us nothing at all.<br>
<br>
And you know what? Sprit of Wolf isn't that fidsking great anyhow.<br>
<br>
Neutrality comes in many forms. Some preach of balance. Some preach  that they are truely evil, but only cannot change their ways. Lies, all of them.<br>
<br>
For if they were truely evil... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He pointed his weapon into the croud, pointing to a one 'Sarhea', a Halfelven Warrioress</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
They would make the same exact sacrifice that she has made. She was once a Rangeress.. when she discovered that in her heart was truely evil. So what did she do? She allowed her flesh to be destroyed, and rose up once again as a Half Tier'dal Warrioress of the Dark Father of Hate Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Ok Sarhea, stop waving, stop smiling.. sit down.. Ok.<br>
<br>
..Dont look at me like that Gore, do you want me to kick your arse like I couldnt do the last 16 times? I throught not.<br>
<br>
Ahem. If they were truely evil, they would be in an Evil Guild. But since they are with Neutralic ones, they are not truely evil, Syllastrae, Gore. Shut up, you have said enought.<br>
<br>
Oh, and WHY aren't they in an evil Guild? The Reasoning is simple. Because they are afraid to make the Same sacrifice that Sarhea made. Because they do not have the backbone to do it. Why?<br>
<br>
Because they are not truely Evil.<br>
<br>
..That is all. Consider my words. Disagree with them, shout at them, do as you wish. But I'll still never fight along side a Neutralic one. Be it on a Dragon Assult, a raid of an alter plane, or even a common Hunting Party. Find someone else to use, Thanks. I'm not the one.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>
<br>
In fact, I shall stay here and open the floor up to anyone that has questions about my path. I will gladly answer you, even if you are Neutralic or Good. Within these walls I cannot kill you anyhow, so be it.<br>
<br>
So, any questions? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/6/02 11:16:32 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie Mod!<br>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 775<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/5/02 9:00:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/zorosar.gif width=100 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Balance is Bull$*%$.

<br>
I do not promote natural balance, I am not a druid. I am not fighting my hidden evil nature, but unable to overcome it. I merely am what I am. The fact that you haven't met this sort of neutrality, or have chosen to disbelieve it, doesn't make it nonexistent. It merely makes you blind.<br>
<br>
I believe in the freedom of Discord, for unless my path is freely chosen, I cannot be truly judged for what I make of myself. I believe in the clarity of Neutrality, that allows me to view others without the blinders of preconception. And I believe in the power of Neutrality, that requires no false mercies from me for those who choose to become my enemies - but demands no arbitrary cruelties, either.<br>
<br>
You wear the blinders of hatred with panache, dark elf. But they are blinders. It is far easier to follow a shepherd, even if he is a vicious one, than to make one's own path in the world, isn't it?<br>

Paladins, you are getting screwed.</span><hr size=1> You &quot;evil&quot; ones have no hope of ever attainting what we Iksar have. Your pathetic god, your foolish beliefs, your very nature contradicts it. An army is somthing based on organazation, obdience, and the ability to realize that you are nothing more then a worthless pawn in the big picture of things, and your life is forfiet when those above you deem it fit. An army that consists of followers of chaos and destruction is a self destructive army, because the very thing it fights for contradicts what is needed to become a powerful army in the first place. Fighting in a battle effectively requires you follow your orders and never let your emotions control you. By the fact you worship, and indulge &quot;hatred&quot;, this is impossible for you, for your life is based on indulging emotion, and therefore you will always lose against we Iksar. <br>
<br>
All soft skins natures make it impossible for them to ever have a truly powerful army. The greed and desire for &quot;freedom&quot; you creatures possess makes your armies full of individuals fighting for their own goals and purposes, rather then for a unified cause which all are willing to die for. You all have different beliefs, different goals, and different religions. That causes war, infighting, and disobdience. Soft skins will never be able to mount anything other then large amounts of numbers to swarm over their enemies with, and they'll be killing eachother half the time as well.<br>
<br>
Refusing to associate with &quot;druids&quot; won't solve your problem. You hatelings are all the same, blame everything else for your own corrupt nature and weakness. The problem lies not in others, blueskin, but in the fact your own people are weaklings.  I would much sooner associate with druids then hatelings. They are far more tolerable. Of course I'd prefer neither.<br>
<br>
I will agree with you on one thing, your kind are evil.

Trying to convert us to your weak ways by trying to tell me that I am blind? <br>
<br>
I am blind? No, I see freely. I see the leeches, scrambing about those that are evil that have strenght.<br>
<br>
Because lets be honest here, how many Paladins do you see in Norrath?<br>
<br>
Zildrax, you must know that the &quot;Druids&quot;, (Which if you've noticed by now, I group pretty much all of Neutrality by callin them 'Druid'.) are only around your Iksarian Empire because they see the strenght of it, and wish to have a chip off of the block. Spineless Cowards they are, needing others to do the work for them.<br>
Weak bastards they are, not being able to fight without someone pampering them.<br>
<br>
Its time to stop letting these Leeches feed. The more they feed, the stronger they get..<br>
<br>
Untill the Druid begins to try to Dominate us. I won't let that happen.<br>
<br>
Yeah, you heard me. I won't let that happen. I'm no toy for a 'druid'.<br>
<br>
In short, if their is a form of Neutrality that is out there that is not a 'Leech', so be it. They will be destroyed anyhow, because its just fun to kill others. <p><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/sageofthehalo/"><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif"></A></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uellywig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellywig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/6/02 3:48:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blind?</span><hr size=1> Elf?<br>

Elf? OK, guess you need glasses to go with those blinders.<br>
<br>
I doubt you will find your victory as simple and one-sided as you expect. In fact, I doubt you will find it - we have endured worse than your rants and petty hatred already. While many of you people seem to revel in fratricidal feuds, us gnomes place our kinship above philosophical differences. Those necromancers and paladins will be fighting side-by-side should you ever be a real threat to Ak'Anon.<br>
<br>
I am not even vaguely interested in converting you. You are too monochromatic to bother - you are just a raging ball of blind hatred, and you'd have nothing left if you ever lost that. You are a twisted and broken caricature of a thinking creature, but you are a sterling example of Innoruuk's ideals, I am sure.<br>
<br>
Your hatred is a convenient and obvious weakness. It is also an incredibly ineffective weapon to use to start a rift between paladins and those they live with, but since you have no other options in your arsenal, I suppose you have to make do. I don't think Goodkin will take your advice over his sacred calling from Brell - no matter how many times you try to get him to declare himself my enemy.<br>

<br>
Besides, it's pretty clear to me that Shintou doesn't hate &quot;neutrality&quot; so much as he fears it. He's scared that more folks might choose their own path without jumping into the good/evil/chaos/hate bloodlusty war he's hoping to consume the world with. He just can't sow total destruction in a field of peace.  <br>
<br>
And as Kenyon told me once, it's pretty hard to get someone to understand something when their whole way of life depends on them not understanding it...  Anyways, if someone wants to know more about what I think about strength, ask me later -- this is about Shintou's preaching, not mine!<br>

And Shintou, you have more to worry about than the Paladins.  We clerics may not be as physically daunting as Paladins, but we have our power, too, and are often more dedicated to our purpose.<br>

The shadowy figure quickly slipped out through the door, only revealing his gleaming armour once entering the light of the torches around the tavern.  The paladin had heard enough, and slowly walked into the depths of the streets.  A passer-by, running errands under the flickering lights of a city at night, overheard the muscled, armour clad figure muttering to his weapon about the supposed weakness of the paladin kin.  A small cart was cleaved in half by the blade of the holy knight, not unwilling to demonstrate his rage in a physical sense.  The passer-by quickly disappeared into the shadows himself, unwilling to be caught as a dastardly rogue by the enraged righteous warrior.<br>
<br>
Baka watched the errand boy scuttle off into the darkness, and smiled inwardly.  While inspiring fear was not his intention, rattling a few cages here and there, ensuring that the paladins were never forgotten as the equal and opposite of the shadow knights, not some weak, kind hearted farce of a shadow knight with clerical abilities, was a necessary part of a life of service.  'Still,' he thought, 'we do share a sense of honour on the most part..  Their code is perverted beyond all belief, but it does exist, and I would much rather do honourable battle with a shadow knight than any other form of combat you could possibily name.'<br>
'You know that I will aid you at every step of the way, Baka.'<br>
Baka sighed at his sword.  'Yes, I know, you are a good friend..  However, we must plan for tomorrow, the forces of corruption do not wait for the forces of righteousness.' <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A> at: 5/7/02 6:12:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie Mod!<br>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 805<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/8/02 7:41:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/zorosar.gif width=100 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins Bane.</span><hr size=1> Shintou and I don't always agree on most things...<br>

But, let me explain something to you people, and to Shin.....the people I mean when I speak of neutrality are not those of you who follow discord, or even quite so much,those of you who follow order.....I don't get the need to have everything structured, myself, I never have.<br>
<br>
But discord.....chaos....*nod*....it's a dance of beauty, of insanity, of life, of death...all at one time, untethered, unbound, and free....<br>
<br>
The difference between who I was and who i am is simple to explain, and something for those of you who call yourselves neutral, while following the ways of chaos to think on for a bit.<br>
<br>
Now, I have no guilt.  Right or wrong...I was never very concerned with that...the storms arent right or wrong...they just are...<br>
<br>
But take away your society's idea of what's right and what's wrong, and you have nothing left but chaos...and the freedom to do exactly what you want, when you want, how you want.<br>
<br>
I don't believe Shintou to be blinded by hate....he was ...dimsited for awhile, but not by Hate, and not any longer.  Shintou is completely cognizent of his choices, and his words and his beliefs.<br>

How someone can want to live in such chaos is beyond me. Only a creature of extreme selfish intrest would seek a world where they can do whatever they want with no consequence, or one of sheer laziness. Either way, they both deserve to be slain. Chaos merely brings hatred, pointless war, distrust, and greed. Norrath is already engulfed in enough of that, all soft skins seem to revel in such anarchy, and I'll not let it spread any further. <br>
<br>
And someone like this blueskin who seeks to destroy the world it's my peoples destiny to rule? I think it is about time I give him another lesson in fear and remind him that his entire race is nothing but slaves for mine.<br>

<br>
Is the storm neutral?  Are lions and tigers and bears neutral?  Good and neutral and evil are games that the gods and their minions play.  And mostly word games at that.<br>
<br>
If someone slays a rabid wolf is that good?  If someone slaughters a rabbit for its pelt, or just to hear its<br>
death squeal is that evil? Good and evil and even &quot;neutral&quot; belong to the worlds of perspective, of point of view, of motivation.<br>
<br>
I am the Winnower.  I test things in battle, and I cull the weak and the undeserving.  In death I find harmony and peace.  In extreme beauty and ugliness I find appreciation of the Grand Aesthetic.  My heart beats alive within my chest and I value the life I have, all the more so because I do not fear Death.  I am born and reborn to the struggle, as the bard said &quot;we live, we die, and death not ends it&quot;.<br>
<br>
My goals and my sense of religion are at most personal.  I don't ask that others join my perspective, nor to I want to join with theirs.  I don't mind actual Druids because I see them, as I see most other folk, as natural predators.  Predation is the way of nature - living and dying.  Those who claim to follow Tunare in stating that as the All Mother that she is the way of tree-huggers and happy pixies and rabbits and lions all living in global harmony are fools (as well as those who allow themselves to be distracted by the flawed perspective).  Tunare is most manifest when one animal slays another.  Tunare is the Great Food Chain.  Why bother to worship that? <br>
<br>
Most of the those who claim to act for &quot;good&quot; don't do any less killing, harvesting, or hunting than anyone who claims to be &quot;evil&quot;.  In their actions lie their beliefs, not in their words.  <br>
<br>
I respect some Iksar, even if they sneer at me, because I respect their self-awareness of their position in the world.  Kill or be killed.  Dominate or submit.  Rule or be ruled.  Their primary flaw is their racial egocentricity to belief that all Iksar understand this, or that others (softskins) cannot.<br>
<br>
Show me a total pacifist and I'll have something to discuss about 'philosophy' and 'good and evil'.  Most people just fail to acknowledge the burning within them, the thrill of the hunt, the joy of the kill.  In their weakness, they imagine that their words represent them, rather than that which they do to survive and grow.<br>
<br>
There is the structure that grows, and the structure that wanes. Stagnation maybe, there is an enemy, but true continuing stagnation is so rare.<br>
<br>
So talk your talk, whoever you are.  I'll be over here, killing.<br>

&quot;I am not a prophet.  I am not an evangelist.  I will not try to convert you.  If my master seeks your soul, he will send me to kill you.  If you are lucky, you will rise again, as have I, a Litch in his service.  Your soul intact, your memories, your desires.<br>
&quot;If he wills it, you will rise a simple mindless zombie to fight in his battles. No will of your own.  An empty husk, a tool.<br>
&quot;I serve Sauroh, the Lord of Tears.  The manifestation of death.<br>
I serve him because I chose to. Had I chose not to, I would be as I have said, just another empty husk, walking.  Killing.<br>
&quot;I chose to serve him... because I could not tolerate Thule's hypocracy.  Such a strong race he created.  Such a strong army they built.  Why then, does this army not simply sweep across Norrath, conquer and kill?  Why does this army, this race, this God, rely on fear?  Fear to make its enemies submit.  Fear to make its warriors and servants loyal.  Fear to drive it, to rationalize why it exists.<br>
&quot;Fear is weakness.  An army, a culture, a race, a god built on fear is built on weakness.  As I have often said, I don't give a damn if you fear me.  Just die for me...<br>
&quot;My master is the Taker of life.  The Keeper of the Abyss.  We breathe because our existence serves his purpose.  We die so that he may feed on our souls.  He is the God of Death.<br>
&quot;Sauroh despises the Lifegiver, Tunare.  My master seeks to strangle the life from her throat.  Her existence vexes him, for her world is green and the color of spring.  Sauroh is the fall of the year, the winter when food is scarce and creatures turn on each other for what little sustenence there is to find.<br>
&quot;I am Death's immortal hand.  I clutch at the throat of the lifebringer.  I take pleasure in my work.  I have great power.  I can enjoy the rewards of it.  I foremost enjoy the thrill of the hunt.  The rush of the kill.  I am better than you.  Your corpse lies at my feet.  This empowers me.  I revel in it.<br>
&quot;Sauroh is the corrupter of life.  He has great respect for the Plaguebringer and his minions, whose rampant spreading of disease and malevolence bring many souls into the abyss to feed him.  He does not need to seek an alliance with Bertoxollous, for the Plaguebringer is the herald of death, and Sauroh IS death.  He does encourage me to aid and empower his minions.<br>
&quot;In all things, I am Death's Hand.  I am the servant of the Lord of Tears.  I do his bidding and have no other desire before this.  That is all...&quot;<br>
&lt;The last words he spoke did not sound sincere.  Notuanot stares off into the darkness.  His bonfire eyes make the scales on his face glow red&gt;<br>
&quot;However, Ayida, your last words do sound like a damn good plan..&quot;<br>
&lt;Notuanot lunges to his feet, upturning the table.  He draws Iceflame from over his back and swings it in a wide arc and begins to cut through the mindless babbling sheep.  He motions for Ayida to do the same.&gt;<br>
&lt;He sees Shintou in the corner and howls &quot;What you waiting for??&quot; as bodies begin to fall around him...<br>
