You and syr are such hypocrites... how's the shoe feel on the other foot, not that it's YOUR guild getting drug through the mud?  you feel defensive?  you feel the need to defend guild members wronged?  Huh... probably so... amazing isn't it... amazing that we might feel the same way.<br>

Check your facts before posting friend, check your wife's facts, and check your wife... she's psychotic when it comes to interpersonal relationships.  And you defending her blindly just makes you look bad.  Sorry for swearing at you... but your post just pissed me off... Imasu left the server for more reasons than this (mainly LD issues based on his physical location)... you don't quite rate high enough to drive him away alone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know Imasu will tackle me and tickled me to death for posting, but well I couldn't help myself because you people are so dense....<br>
<br>
Imasu and I are comfortable happy on another server, as a matter of fact more so than I ever thought possible.  Both our other persona's on FV are still there, in a state of endless sleep as neither of us have the heart, to delete our characters.  Imasu worked extremely hard to get his roguish skills to where they were, and my gods he was a wonder.  I cannot even imagine him deleting/rerolling AND if you ask a member of Orthae, or hell join Orthae on the sly you'll see the name Imasu in the guild roster...hmm Zek how is THAT possible if he rerolled, so just go crawl under the rock you call Syrienne and shut the hell up already.  <br>
In all honesty as the one who spends the MOST time with this man, he's much happier on the other server, because of what Tae mention,  the LDing was terrible on FV, and that made him extremely frustrated.  Dealing with all these assholes was just the excuse he needed, the push to move on to somewhere more stable, connectivity and emotionally wise.  And with his loved ones by his side, there is no way he'd fail there, and he hasn't, cause Imasu never fails at anything.

I think this quote you're taking is from an early post by syr... who has admitted she never heard any such thing from achsia... no such thing ever occured in or out of my guild.  Syr just can't bother herself to verify facts... as you'll see if you read the rest of the thread she even admits she has no proof and &quot;doesn't need any as she's done what she came here to do&quot; which was stir up trouble.<br>

I said at the beginning... and the whole crux of this issue is:<br>
<br>
I got all my information from Imasu amd the other guild.  Achsia and I talked about the situation LONG after the fact.  Otherwise all the information came from the guild with the unpronouncible name, and Imasu.<br>
<br>
People think I am wacked?<br>
<br>
LOL I have had TWO STRINGS in which I have posted on of any consequence.  One I posted to get Imasu and his guild to leave ME, foremost, and Achsia secondly alone.  The other string was from a disgruntled ex-guildine who guildremoved and was not allowed back in, and decided to flame the guild rather than me... hardly me seeking attention at all.<br>
<br>
I am not the one crawling back into this thread constantly keeping the hate and the rage burning.  I have not been back to it until my husband pointed out that it was still on page one.  And then I still ignored it.. until I saw you were still posting.  Count your posts on it... look at the name calling and crap you have posted.. would you read it outloud to your mother? No.. I woud hope not, because it shows exactly what type of character you have.. and what kind of obsessive AND stalking behaviours your guild has exibited.  Even when the thread gets hijacked into another topic.. you have to drag it kicking and screaming .. beating this thing til it is dead.. pulpy and pretty much unrecognizable.<br>

Wow. That doesn't seem normal to me, and seems to certainly support my first claim now doesn't it? You cannot seem to leave things be.<br>

Hmmm... think about that... sounds like YOU are keeping it going... and no, I'm not that anon poster, I post with my own name as I could care less what either you or Zek thinks of me.  I already apologized for losing control and swearing at him, but the sentiment behind it stands as is.  As does my sentiments towards you.<br>
<br>
I find it amusing though that the same people that post in support of you here post in support of you on the other thread.  How many EZ Board accounts do you each have?  Supporting yourself?  Doesn't really matter, though it hardly makes sense that you have &quot;60 people in guild&quot; and yet only a handful come to your support and the majority of the rest of the people who read this and the other thread actually have some common sense.<br>
<br>
Dalliance pretty much summed you up in a non insulting way and I couldn't say it more succinctly myself.  I will say this though... learn to take a breath before you post idiotic crap as you end up looking stupid... and also... play EQ more and read the boards less... maybe then you'd be a happier person and in game more than once a week or whatever someone said in that thread.<br>
<br>
And Zek?  No one cares what you think except Syr, so tug on your leash twice to make sure she's still there then lay down and go to sleep like a good boy. <p>Taedarian Rah`d`Vharc<br>

Nope... as I said... I post with my own name, I have no shame of what I say... I do feel bad about losing my temper as I don't usually do so, so yeah... I guess you did hit a nerve.  You and your bitch wife were the final straw in driving a good friend from this server... which led to several other friends leaving the server so we could all be together without your bullshit.  Hmmm... Go figure... friends wanting to stay with friends... hard concept for you?  Twist it anyway you want, this thread was still a childish attack that was unwarranted and unnecessary, but you continue to support it.  It's no wonder the other thread is making you and archons look bad... you keep opening your mouths.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And if I remember correctly, Imasu posted that he was leaving because &quot;I can't stand it when people don't like me in real life or the game&quot;. So he left.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Aye, he did... this was the final straw for him... he stayed on the server through all the LD problems because he cared about the guild (ours) and the people (including archons until this you idiotic mook) on this server... after this he had NO REASON to want to ever be on this server again, even if it meant losing some friends because it just isn't worth it to log in to bullshit every day... especially when you're just gonna LD anyway and have to log back in again and again... so yeah... he probably coulda been convinced to stay on the server through the LD problems if NOT for this BS... but you and your mistress just can't quit telling lies and can't back up what you say, so of course he doesn't want to deal with the drama... nor does anyone in Orthae.

It's obvious that someone in yer guild is the one who made the anon-flame message...er someone who used to be in your guild...for some reason you JUST CAN'T KEEP PEOPLE there can you?<br>

The only postings I see are people saying, &quot;I used to be in Qu`ellar d`Orthae`Chath&quot;...by the way..can I point out that there are no &quot;drow&quot; in Everquest..as close as Dark Elves may appear..they aren't...that term is owned by Hasbro....<br>
<br>
Anyway..it shows me that you don't have the ability to Take care of your own guild...how can I expect you to show a little respect for someone who asked you to stop obsessing over someone leaving the guild?<br>
<br>
Anyway...I play as Holis and Orth...you can try to contact me any time heh...AAAAANNNNNNNDDDDDD don't go demanding proof for her getting repeated tells from Imasu and then going and Defending what Damascuis said...by the way...wierdo...I have recently talked with Damascuis in game and I must say we were civil...so let's compare the two...You still hold a grudge because someone left your guild because he was a saaaaaaaaaddddd panda...so now your worried about the next guild delete for guilds with membership below 10 and this grudge...no obsession has gone on for HOW long.<br>
<br>
I post knowingly flaming Dama and we are civil within a few days to discuss a topic I felt was important for him to know.  Not only that...he and Syr may talk in the near future...I know how to drop something and, personally, MUST applaud Damascuis on his civility<br>

Actually Holis, neither Taedarian or Sebraei posted again until Rebelle From LfB posted concerns here.  At that time they both responded several days apart, to answer his questions specifically.  And in rereading the last two pages of this thread, the responses they both made were not intended to rehash, but to clarify.  Not until you posted again did Taedarian get heated, and rude.  <br>
I'll say it again, as I said on the Archon's thread.  There is a fine line between critizism and cruelty...and especially regarding this topic, never ever should anyone post half truths or assumptions regarding something as serious as stalking or sexual harassment.  And plainly Syrienne and yourself did so, with little facts.  That was cruelty.  Punishment beyond justice, and not an act I'd ever forgive or forget if directed towards me.  <br>
Perhaps someone could show SOME maturity and NOT respond...and someone has. /applauds Imasu<br>

That isn't continuing the thing?  read closely there...yup it brought Syrienne back into it. Not only that, bringing Imsu back into the picture rekindled it.  I tried to be nice but they kept bringing Imasu's name into it...my post merely said to stop talking about it all together... <br>
<br>
AND IT WASN'T SEXUAL HARASSMENT...there are other forms or harassment (getting non-stop tells even at the request to stop comes to mind)  We never said sexual harassment...do NOT put those words into my mouth or try to assume we accused anyone of it.  <br>

And as I pointed out before people are going to not believe what they don't want to believe reguardless or Logs..so what's the point.

I made no pleas for attention... I have only responded to your and Syr's psychotic posts.  AND FOR THE RECORD:  we left Achsia alone months ago when she left the guild!  I've stated that from the beginning, and I still state it.  It's a fact.  The problems Achsia may be experiencing NOW are caused by exactly one thing:  The fact that your psycho girl Syr bothered to post here in the first place.  Ever occur to you that if she hadn't bothered to, had just /ignored whoever you claim was sending her tells that none of us would be having problems?  Seems like you're the one trying to get on a pedastal.<br>
<br>
There is another point to note here though.  Achsia contacted ME to find out what was going on as she'd not heard of this post till that time.  She claimed at the time she would post here and clear all this up... at least put it all to rest.  She has not done so... why?  Because she says she cannot post on this board.  I find that odd since she can post on YOUR board, Zek... if she can post on your ezboard she can post on this one.  Why doesn't she?  Why NOT put this matter to rest?  I honestly don't know why anyone directly involved in this would not want to clear the air and stop all the rumors spread here, but it's obvious she's ABLE to post here just chooses not to.<br>
<br>
As far as us leaving syr alone... hell, no one in my guild BUT imasu has ever met her, nor ever sent her a tell.  You either for that matter, Zek.  Quit trying to promote us as a bunch of stalkers.  No one in Qu'ellar CARES about you two, other than the shit you both posted here.  If you're so willing to &quot;drop it&quot; then do so.  You obviously have nothing of value to add to the thread, and the only persons who do either left the server (Imasu) or refuse to post (Achsia).<br>
<br>
Tempestra?  Thank you.  Least someone has some sense on the soapbox (there's a few others of you out there too).  I know you don't applaud me... I didn't handle myself well on that post swearing as I did... but he pissed me off by posting at all, let alone what he said.  But what you said was quite succinct and cut through to the heart of the matter currently under the scope.

An other thing..if you look at the first page of the &quot;stalking in EQ thread&quot;...no where did Syrienne talk about your guild there. She kept it sort of vague on purpose...it was a post trying to get folks to leave her alone.  I would place a safe bet in saying that no one knew what guild was involved or even guild leader until you posted.  In fact nothing really got personal until Sebraei posted:<br>
