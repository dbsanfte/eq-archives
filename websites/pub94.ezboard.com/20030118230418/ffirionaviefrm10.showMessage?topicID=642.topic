Across the table sat Hamin, his Coldain Dwarf friend, and Kali, a fan local to the area who did not know when an elf wants to be left alone. <br>
<br>
Kali, a human of about 14 years, sat at the table with her chin on the palms of her hands, elbows resting on the hard plank of a dining surface, staring dreamily at the red-headed elf. Hamin was busy looking about for the waitress, his stein nearing an appalling state of emptyness. <br>
<br>
&quot;This city chomps. I have to find a better place to hang out. Humans are too... hairy.&quot; The bard sneered while staring at his lute, then looked up at a slightly crest-fallen Kali, before adding under his breath &quot;Present company excepted, of course&quot;. Kuladen forced a smile and the human relaxed, and returned to her staring. <br>
<br>
Hamin stood abruptly, growling something about the service in this 'hole' and stomped off. Kuladen shook his head and lowered his feet from the table, setting his lute aside. Since he was saddled with this girl for the day, he figured he should make the best of it. He would have to have words with Hamin about his idea for 'win-a-day-with-the-bard' contest, and how out of the hundreds of attractive of-age women who entered, the dwarf picked this waif of a sewer-rat girl who obviously has never seen a brush in her life. Standing slightly shorter than the elf, Kali sported a mop of raven hair, mangled into a hairstyle that the humans found attractive that week. Wearing nothing but a two sizes too big tunic and slippers, the potato sack grey dress was tied off at the waist with a brown leather belt, apparently this girl's prize posession. <br>
<br>
Kuladen looked around again, then his eyes settled on the girl. Head raised in anticipation, the girl leaned forward to listen to anything the elf might say. <br>
<br>
&quot;So.. uhm.. do you like to do.. stuff?&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl's eyes grew even larger than before, and instantly her mouth opened up and words came forth like the rains of karana. Wincing, the elf unconciously leaned back to protect himself from the onslaught of words from this girl, describing her days then her life then her best friend 'Jemolaa' who was 'NEVERgoingtobelievethis!'. After a moment of listening Kuladen spied Hamin walking towards the table, only to make a small circle and walk away from the table after spotting the look of contempt in the elf's eyes. <br>
<br>
'SoandthisonetimeIwasatyourconcerthereinFreeportandmyfriendYahnnsaidthatthemilitiahadsomething againstyouandthisonetime themilitacaughtmyfriendthagglookingat....'<br>
<br>
Kuladen leaned back and tuned the girl out again. Several minutes passed as the bard watched people enter and leave the tavern, a couple people going so far as to approach his table for an interview or an autograph before leaving, unable to get a word in edgewise. Sighing, Kuladen removed his feet from the table again. Softly he said &quot;If you shut up I'll sing a song&quot;<br>
<br>
'aremeanttokillyoubutIhavenevermetanyonewhodiedbyeatingfirebeetleeyesbutthisonetimemyfriend Jemolaa,thesameonewholikesBobbyFisher,remember?,tookabiteofoneandyouknowwhatstartedto glow?THAT'SRight!Her....'<br>
<br>
The girl paused, and looked at the elf dumbfounded, and nodded eagerly. Mentally stopclocking the time it took for her brain to register what he said, the elf forced another sweet smile and stood, picking up his lute. The bar hushed as he walked towards the stage, not even pausing to grab a certain Coldain Dwarf's ear as he walked by a group trying to hide Hamin from the elf. 'Ow'ing the dwarf followed, and climbed up onto the stage next to the elf. <br>
<br>
Leaning into the gnomish voice amplifier and attention getter Kuladen cleared his throat. &quot;This is a song I just thought of. I would like to dedicate it to the winner of 'Spend a day with the bard' contest put on by this Tavern and The Emerald Shop. The Emerald Shop.. if you have the honey we have the money.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kuladen stepped back and tuned his lute for a minute. Hamin beside him crossed his arm and grumped, not even knowing why he had to stand on stage for a song he didn't even know. <br>
<br>
&quot;This song is called 'Shut the Hell up' &quot;<br>
<br>
Two musical notes escaped the lute before a resounding chord of dissonance ripped through the tavern, the bard dropping his lute and leaping backwards. A crossbow bolt protruded from the wood, and the strings had snapped and raked the elf across the face. Standing hunched over, hands covering a bloodied face, the elf heard the distinct sound of around a dozen Crossbows being cocked. A small scream erupted from a nearby table, and Kuladen didn't have to look up to know that Kali was the one responsible for the totally off-key wail. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are under arrest for the attempted murder of Sir Lucan, brave protector and stalwart member of the Freeport Militia.&quot;<br>
<br>
Groaning, the elf stood up straight, suddenly remembering why he hated the city so much. Ignoring the blood running down his face, he raised two hands in front of him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Can't we talk about this fellas?&quot;<br>
<br>
The sound of several more crossbows.<br>
<br>
&quot;This chomps.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kuladen>kuladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Greatest<br>

The elf picked himself off the floor, and turned quickly to see if he could bolt out of the cell but realized too late that the door was shut. A hulking brute of a jailer smiled at the duo, as the dwarf muttered and picked himself up off the floor as well. Kuladen took an unconscious step backwards at the visage of the jailer. Standing around 6'6&quot; and weighing in at about 275, the man had more keys on his ring than teeth, and Kuladen only counted 10 keys on the ring spinning around the man's finger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yous attack Sir Lucan. Yous die in here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kuladen puffed out his chest, and crossed his arms. &quot;I await my trail. A jury of my peers will vindicate me.&quot; <br>
<br>
The jailer paused for a second, and the keys stopped spinning in his shock. He then bust out laughing, and as he closed the jail block door behind him the sounds of him laughing resounded across the stone room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer an idiot&quot; <br>
<br>
Kuladen looked over to see Hamin had pulled himself onto the lower of the two bunks, and say with his arms crossed, staring at the red-headed elf. &quot;You ain't gettin' no fair trial&quot;<br>
<br>
Peering at his surroundings, Kuladen answered off-handedly &quot;You're the one who is an idiot for booking a gig in Freeport when you knew I was wanted&quot;. Picking up a rock, Kuladen squeezed it and realized that it was in fact a sponge, and probably was the only way he would attempt to stay clean. The room was sparse, three stone walls and a wall of bars, with a single barred window in the back of the cell to allow some light in. The place was dark, though, and damp. The place smelled too much like mildew, and the floor was covered with a thin layer of slime. Being the spring time, a wind was coming into the window bringing what would be a fresh supply of air, if the city planners had not placed the jail house next to the city's stables. <br>
<br>
Flies roamed everywhere, and with a sneer the elf swatted them away from himself. <br>
<br>
Leaning against the bars, the bard winced as he slid a bit, the same slime that coated the walls and floor had also attached itself to the metal. &quot;Well. I guess it couldn't get any worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hamin's eyes grew wide and he mouthed 'no' when the sudden sound of thunder struck in the distance, and as the sound died down they heard a high pitched drone coming towards the cell block. The door opened up and the jailer re-emerged, ducking to get into such a small area. Walking towards their cell the duo could see that he carried Kali, who was talking non-stop as she was being tossed into the cell next to the two. <br>
<br>
&quot;..goingtoappealthisasIknowafriendwhooncestolefromalawyerandgotthatlawyertodefendtheminthecourtsystemwhichis corruptasyouknowandOHMYGODI'minacellnexttoKuladenandwaituntilJemolaahearabout…&quot;<br>
<br>
The dwarf stood, walked over to the elf, who was busy staring in shock as the jailer exited the cell block, in a fowler temper than before. The bard felt a tugging sensation and turned to find Hamin progressively pulling himself closer and closer to the dwarf's face. Stopping mere inches away, the dwarf sneered through his beard. &quot;I told you never to say things couldn't get worse&quot;<br>
<br>
(*oof*) The bard doubled over from the fist in his stomach, and collapsed again to the slime-coated floor. As he prayed for unconsciousness to overtake him, all he could hear was Kali.<br>

<br>
The gavel hit the desk with enough force to knock over the Judicar's Quill, and the second (*Bang*) crushed the frail feather into the wood. <br>
<br>
Ignorant of the ruined writing impliment, the human sneered at the courtroom, commanding silence from the mob that had recently grown unruly. Bargin Truthblade still had a lot of cases to get through today, and he was not going to let this one Bard ruin his whole day. <br>
<br>
&quot;Guards, have the elf gagged&quot;<br>
<br>
Bargin smiled as the bard's eyes grew large, and he raised a finger to protest but was quickly subdued. A flurry of activity later and the red headed elf was lifted to his feet, his nose bleeding down into the rag that had been tied around his mouth.<br>
<br>
All too often had a bard come in and try to sway the opinions of those in the court with their magics, and Bargin tired of it easily. Fiddling with the ring that granted him a certain resistance to such charms, he watched the jury as their looks of empathy for the bard returned to the looks of contempt he had chosen these jurors for. <br>
<br>
Eyes swinging back towards the proceedings, he studied the two sides. The three defendants, the elf, an albino dwarf, and a waif human girl, stood behind one podium, while the prosecutor, a sharply dressed militia guard, stood behind the other. A smug grin played about the prosecutor's face, as he also glanced over at the defendant's table. Moving from behind his podium, he approached the jury.<br>
<br>
&quot;As I was saying, before I was interrupted by such rude and callious remarks, was that on the day in question the defendants did willingly and with prior malace attack and kill our local hero, the Gallant Sir Lucan!&quot; With this the lawyer pointed towards the witness stand, to a well dressed militia officer. The man sat smug, cleaning some dirt that had appeared under his fingernail. <br>
<br>
The jury gasped at this accusation, despite having heard and gasped at it three times before. Kuladen rolled his eyes, and strugged against the handcuffs that bound his hands behind his back. <br>
<br>
Bargin ignored the defendants for a moment, and studied the jurors. All on the payroll of the Militia, he had personally worked with several before, and found them to be fair and impartial, as long as they sided with the Freeport Militia. <br>
<br>
A sound, though, broke his concentration, and he turned his head quickly to see the bard's hands free, pulling the gag from his mouth. Quickly grabbing up a parchment, he rolled it into a tube and started to blow through it. <br>
<br>
Lights began playing off the three defendants as the waif girl grabbed both the elf and the dwarf, drawing the three close together. The guards lept at the three, only to grab empty air. With a slight WOOOSH sound the three disappeared, only to reappear in three different locations. <br>
<br>
The elf appeared inside the jury box, landing on a sweet old man and breaking the chair beneath the two. The albino dwarf appeared a mere two feet from his previous location, and was quickly subdued. The girl, however, vanished from sight, and after a quick search was nowhere to be found. <br>
<br>
(*BANG*) <br>
<br>
&quot;ORDER IN THIS COURTROOM. Guards, please bring the two defendents into order with whatever force is necessary&quot;<br>
<br>
Several action packed minutes later the Elf and Dwarf were standing behind the defendent table again, bloodied, and hunched over from all the chains about them. <br>
<br>
Bargin smiled as he heard the dwarf comment to the elf 'Ye could have picked a better song than that, dunderhead.'<br>
<br>
The elf remained silent, perhaps due to the two gags and sword at the base of his neck.<br>
<br>
This would be a good day, Bargin thought.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=642.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=642.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=642.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=642.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=642.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=642.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
