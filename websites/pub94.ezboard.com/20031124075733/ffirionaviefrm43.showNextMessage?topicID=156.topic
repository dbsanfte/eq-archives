When you were (or even if you currently are) in your late 30s, what kind of armor were you wearing?  More specifically, I guess: how was your AC?<br>
<br>
I'm around 784 AC right now (while wielding a shield) with my self buffs of Daring and Guard, which I didn't think was too bad, but I've heard it said once that &quot;good&quot; AC for a paladin/warrior/SK means it's higher than your ATK, which isn't the case with me.  I also seem to be finding myself grouped with other tanks of similar level that have 800+ AC when they aren't buffed.<br>
<br>
The biggest trouble is that armor upgrades are no where in sight for me.  I don't have any Ro armor yet, but all of its pieces are the same AC as the pieces I'm already wearing -- and sometimes less.  (I'm in a mixture of things: lightcrawler, enameled black BP, fine plate, skull-sharped barbute.)  What I see ahead of me is Acrylia, Deepwater, and Dwarven Plate, all of which are *way* out of my price range.  (A single bracer or pair of boots would clean out my bank.)<br>
<br>
Should I be really scrimping and saving to upgrade my armor?  Is there some armor I'm missing that is a nice medium between between Ro-type armor and the higher crafted armor that I can quest/hunt for, or reasonably purchase?  I'd like to save for some sort of Haste item, too, but I don't know if I need to get better armor first.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I'm not yet so bad that a group asks if I'll let someone else tank, but maybe they fear the wrath of a gnome. /chuckle <p> <div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/sigv2-5.jpg"><BR><a href="http://www.byteoart.com/ledenyetz/">Ledenyetz Troupe</a></div></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udaliondveldrin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalion DVeldrin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I put the inky in kinky</span><br>  Posts: 540<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 4:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.animationlibrary.com/Animation11/Animals/Rabbits/Realistic_bunny_2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What kind of armor did you have?</span><hr size=1> I believe at this season, it would be best to quest your Ro armor, or perhaps purchase some crustacean shell armor. I basically got my darkforge armor at about 35, then went on to fill certain spots with crustacean shell armor, bypassed Shadowknight Fear planar and went straight for PoG/Thurgadin armor.<br>
<br>
Thats usually how most hybrids do it. Ro armor, some in between like crusty, planar armor then Velious armors. Crustacean shell armor may not have the best ac, but the stam more than makes up for it. I also do not believe it is terribly expensive compared to Acrylia/kunark armors (depending on the piece anywhere from 200-500?).<br>
<br>
As for haste, that should be your first priority. More haste means you kill each mob faster. The faster they die, the less hits you take. I'd suggest saving up for a haste item first (e.g. Silver chitin handwraps, Fbss etc) then further along the line fill your lesser spots with crustacean shelled armor.<br>
<br>

I recall warriors that wore mostly crafted at 60 and didn't bother to upgrade until they were doing raids.  In general, if you're wanting to make your character stronger, there is nothing you can do that is better than leveling up.  Leveling will not only give you access to better gear, it will make it easier to acquire, too.<br>
<br>
If you see a good deal on an upgrade as you level up, go ahead and buy it.  Same thing with a fun quest or other item desire.  For instance, collecting a full suit of a particularly snazzy armor set can be a lot of fun.  It is a game to play for fun after all (and endless xp grinding can feel like work).<br>
<br>
The bazaar and recent increased trading pace on FV has put a lot of focus on buying up armor, too (eg. your bogglement on how to save up to buy armor).  Don't forget that the best armor always comes from MOB drops and the easiest way by far to get those is to go out and hunt them down.  It's fun, it's free, and you get xp doing it, too.<br>
<br>
BTW, in case you didn't decipher my ramblings, the net answer is &quot;don't worry, your AC is doing just fine.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 10:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The quested sol-ro temple armor ..</span><hr size=1> Ro armour in general is pretty decent, but it IS hard as hell to deal with (especially for you, getting melatite for it will cause you enormous faction losses back at home), although some of it is really worth it.  I haven't seen anything yet that could replace my Ro Greaves for under 2K (+6 STA, +10 CR, 13AC, a bit more AC than crustacean and the resists and lack of stats losses are great).  The bracers are definitely worth it (basically +10MR over fine plate) and the faction will do you good for your epic.  Ro Breastplate will last you a looong time (or if not, get a Netherbian chitin - resists) but you lose 5AC over your current breastplate.  Boots probably aren't worth it, but if you want 35 extra HP, it's better than wearing fine plate into your 40s.  Never found a use for the Gauntlets unless you're really wanting to feel good about your DEX.  Helm is very, very, very good for WIS.  The rest IMO is give or take, although the vambraces are again good for your WIS.<br>
<br>
If it means anything, my unbuffed AC is 879 at 51.  I'm only now coming up to upgrading my armour to Deepwater and so on, and it still cleans out my bank *grins*  You're damned lucky if you can buy them at your stage. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakanome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bakanome</A> at: 10/21/02 10:28:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usevlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sevlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 1:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The quested sol-ro temple armor ..</span><hr size=1> Thanks for all the replies!  Looking at some of the stats on the Ro armor, I wonder where I originally got the idea the AC wasn't higher than most of my armor -- it's certainly higher than the lightcrawler arms, legs, and bracer I'm wearing!<br>
<br>
I've definitely been planning to get the Helm of Ro.  (RP wise it's fun playing a gnome; stat-wise, 83 WIS with items is pretty sad.)  Conveniently enough, I've obtained most of what's required for Ro armor even without consciously working on the quest!  (Had all I need for helm and boots, save for the Sand of Ro -- some of which, I bought off Bakanome as early as yesterday morning. *grins*)<br>
<br>
Crustacean is also something I've been looking at.  Although the stat decreases scare me, most of it's -CHA.  I suppose travelling with an enchantress makes that less of an issue.  And even the -DEX shouldn't be too bad, as it's already fairly high -- around 116 right now, I think.  The trade off would be reaking of fish...<br>
<br>
Ro armor costs about 200pp per piece for the plat bars, and maybe some more since I'll probably want to buy the melatite in the Bazaar (rather than take faction hits), but I could probably afford to throw out my lightcrawler, and replace it with some Ro, and maybe a piece of Crustacean or two.<br>
<br>
Might set me back from getting a haste item for a while, but hell, I've spent the last two nights in Mistmoore, trying to help guild members get the maid and butler fangs.  If the maid keeps holding out like she has -- one buter sighting, one butler fang; eight maid sightings, no maid fang -- I may find my coffers overflowing!  After last night alone, the four of us left with a good 150+pp each and almost two Nightshade Wreaths per person.  Maybe those'll fetch a good price... <p> <div align="center"><center><img src="http://www.members.shaw.ca/vae/sigv2-5.jpg"><BR><a href="http://www.byteoart.com/ledenyetz/">Ledenyetz Troupe</a></div></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slave to Dvara<br>Tits of Steel Admin</span><br>  Posts: 1951<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/21/02 3:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The quested sol-ro temple armor ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Crustacean is also something I've been looking at.

Kind of fallen by the wayside in smithing but in pure ac it might be better than Ro, and easier to get as well, since it is used for skilling up.  By the time you can collect the materials for a full set of RO you will be ready to get planar armor, or buy the Kunark dropped armor.<br>
<br>
One mistake that Hybrids can make is going for caster stats.  If you focus on caster stats, particularly in non visible armor items (silver ruby veil instead of cougarskin mask on face), for example.  You will be well served in filling all your armor spots with gear that has AC, HP, Stamina, and then in descending order Strength/agility/dexterity.  Take what wisdom you get by accident and you will generally be in good shape mana wise as a hybrid.  <br>

Most bang for plat, has to be the goranga idol now.. Range item 8 ac plus melee stats including hitpoints... less than 200 pp in bazaar on twenty different sellers.<br>

Many dwarven smiths will give very significant discounts in the armour price if you bring them lots of lava rocks - because on this server, those go trivial, and the smiths aren't able to collect them in person.  Might be worth investigating.<br>

<br>
If you compare to others tank, look at there gear, see your inate AGI and don't forget that if they are iksar, they have AC natural bonus.*<br>
<br>
At lvl 50, most tank AC (without planar armor) is between 900 and 950.<br>
<br>
Hope that can help. <p>&lt;br&gt;<br>
