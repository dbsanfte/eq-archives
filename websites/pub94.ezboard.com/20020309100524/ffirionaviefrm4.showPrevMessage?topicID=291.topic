<br>
This is not really a rant.<br>
I saw a wood elf druid kill halfling deputies in Misty Thicket.  The same one I saw not that long ago hunt hunt gnome merchants in Lesser Faydark.  Now, I have some personal issues with the halfling deputies for stealing these kodiaks from me.  I also know hunting guards was common on the other server I tried.  But It still makes me sad to see them slaughtered that way.  My little gnome heart weeps for the deputies :-(<br>
<br>
But maybe it's just me.<br>
I'm kinda new to Firiona Vie and EQ.<br>
Hence my question:<br>
Do you consider it proper or improper for a wood elf druid, who belongs to a guild, to hunt gnome merchants and halfling deputies?<br>
<br>
Best of luck to all,<br>

I've grouped with a halfling slaver with height issues, who would be more that happy to take her folk and sell them to the highest bidder. I infact began to set up a long term contract for slaves of the short folk. Negotiantions will prolly continue a year or so but .. *shrug*<br>

I like to call them &quot;God Killer&quot;.<br>
<br>
The were made nearly immune to all spells (werent many 60's around so maybe). They have IMMENSE HP and natural Regen. They hit for UnGodly amounts of damage. Their AC is off the scale. Ect, Ect......<br>
<br>
A skeleton Guard in Painel was conned at around 4th lvl. I needed a key to Painel..... I was in the mid 40's.  I attacked. <br>
<br>
When I zoned (with about 5 hp)  the last health bar on the skeleton was still unchanged. I had done at least 2k HP damage to it. It was hitting for as much as 200 HP. (but wasnt hitting all the time)<br>
<br>
Why were these changes made? Because people complained about others hunting Guards in so called Newbie Areas. I personally dont agree with them.... BUT I do understand why they were done. If Guard hunters would have taken the time (as I did when doing it) to protect the occasional Newbie that ran up for protection.......<br>
<br>
There is NO ban or rule against killing Newbie Guards. First..... who decides what a newbie guard is?  Second...... some quests require killing some guards (though dont try in a true newbie zone at a gate). Third........ Anyone ever hear of Faction? Some quests require massive amounts of faction and killing Guards gives that faction. Fourth.......You will , I REPEAT will get experience if the guard cons in the right level for such.... Try killing a merchant, you get ZERO experience AND the merchant poofs, so no loot. If we werent supposed to kill Guards... that would help.<br>
<br>
However I must temper this with the following..........<br>
<br>
Guides and even GM's can and do act beyond the scope of the rules we know about. What do I mean? A guide may decide (for any number of reasons , good or bad) that what you are doing is disruptive and take action. Guides and GM's are human (or at least I hope they are) and can and do make errors or choices that may not be the best in a situation. But what is best is VERY subjective, what I think is best and what you think is best.... well they may be so far apart as to be uncomprehesible. With out written policy (and to hamstring GM's with a player known absolute list could be bad) for us, the player base to look at,  sometimes what happens by a GM (or even a guide) may seem unresonable or harsh.<br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, I know GM's and Guides can and in a few instances that I know of, will make bad choices. But over all, when the health of a game with 400000 or more people playing is at stake, I would say they try hard.<br>
<br>
They (Guides) do have policy and written rules, and a chain of command. We just dont get to see it , if we arent at some point a guide. Same with GM's.<br>
<br>
SO my assertion that killing Newbie Guards isnt an offense, doesnt mean that if your killing them you cant or wont be told to stop by a Guide or GM. <br>

I just wanted to know what people thought of wood elves hunting halflings and gnomes.  I mean, that's something I would expect from ogres for exemple.  I know I've been used as &quot;ogre bait&quot; in Butcherblock mountains to lure two misbehaving ogres into a trap.  Gnome flesh seems appealing to ogres.  But to wood elves? O.o<br>
<br>
I thought about it some more though and I think I finally understand what was happening.  The wood elf druid I saw was not really hunting halfling deputies or gnome merchants.  Oh nooo.  I think she must have been protecting bears.  It's a well known fact halflings and gnomes eat a lot of bear steaks.  That wood elf was acting on behalf of those poor bears, it seems obvious now.<br>
<br>
Of course, none of this would have ever happened in the first place of Turane had not made her children's flesh (the bears) so tasty.  So in the spirit of racial harmony between halflings, gnomes and wood elves, I suggest we blame all this on Tunare.  Let the deities take responsibility for once!<br>

<br>
I have a character named....... Twotribes....... here. A half elf Ranger (level 4, I believe). I just dont play here much at all. Havent been in game on FV for quite a while. When I do play I tend to play Twotribes( ack, no really) on Karana.<br>
<br>
I started playing on April 6th, 1999, TT was made on April 7. My Dwarf Paladin was to far from my 2 real life friends ( they made an Erud Enchanter and a Human cleric) so TT came to exsist.<br>
<br>
He is my MAIN character, I have 14 alts on Karana ( 15th is a bard my son sometimes plays). I have 5 to 6 other characters scattered around on maybe 3 other servers (not counting FV) that I seldom play.<br>
<br>
Twotribes is level 54 and a Ranger. I have over 220 days played as him. His Diety is Tunare.<br>
<br>
I love the &quot;idea&quot; of this server. I just cant bring myself to abandon TT on Karana. I also dont like solo and well, the fact is solo is a BIG part of FV.<br>
<br>
I am a yapper. Thus my chosen tag ......<br>
<br>
I am VERY opininated, but I like a good arguement so control that sometimes ). I do enjoy knowing rules, I am an OLD board game player of war games. And one of those Arse holes that A DM hates in Pen and Paper AD &amp; D... When I played I knew most every monster and usually what they could do and how to hurt them. Ohh did I mention I am VERY opininated?<br>
<br>
I lust after loot sometimes and experience, but I also am SO easily distracted by an OOC or shout with a question or help in it. Lost several hunting partners in my time because I would take an hour to run from NRO to Lavastorm......<br>
<br>
Until a year ago I lost most of my original &quot;friends&quot; and hunting partners because they out leveled me... I am a slow leveler ( I have had spurts, but 220 days, level 54.... well )<br>

Personally, I don't see how anyone could bring themselves to kill those little deputies.  I find them extremely entertaining myself  -- not to kill, but to watch.<br>
<br>
I have never been a big fan of killing guards, any of them. Some can be a source of experience, I've just always found other prey more rewarding. <br>
<br>
Of course the only way you'll ever really know is to RP with the elf in question.  You'll either get a RP response or a &quot;u nd exp 2? k thx la&quot;.

The building of the giant stone wall in Misty Thicket might be causing the extinction of the black bears, who can no longer feed upon the berries which grow so much better closer to Rivervale.  Or perhaps the green light emitted by the gnome merchant huts is disturbing the birdlife of the lesser faydark and they're flying smack into the buildings.<br>

The weapons et al that drop are about 4-5p when sold and killing them gives exp up to level 45-46.  <br>
<br>
They are fun to kill and say little sayings.  I usually wack um and then leave them lying there for some young character to find.   Got to admit at level 5-10 the stuff on them...incl. the +5cha ring is pretty cool.<br>
<br>
As far as RP goes....&quot;Keel da shorties!&quot;<br>
<br>
As far as killing guards in a newb zone I think they fixed all the ones they had a problem with that as stated about by making them VERY tough to kill.  I still like to kill guards though...and druids....and....well you get the picture eheh.<br>
