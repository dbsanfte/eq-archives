He stood on that stage and looked about his peers.<br>
And he began speaking.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I am evil.<br>
<br>
Evil? What is evil?<br>
<br>
Never have I seen the combined force of Rallos Zek, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Lanys, and The Plaugebringer summed up in one single word.<br>
Evil. It is the force that pawns all of those forementioned gods, it controls their hearts and owns their desires, for it is above them, and it controls them, this forse only known as 'Evil'.<br>
Hate, Death, Decay, Fear, War, Malice. Are they not deemed 'Evil Deeds, Evil Feelings, Evil things?'<br>
These among other things make up this force, which is deemed 'Evil'.<br>
Along side Evil, their is another force.<br>
Mithanel Marr, E. Marr, Tunare, Quellos, Rodcet Nife<br>
This force, is 'Good'.<br>
Love, Peace, Nature, Life, And Valor.<br>
Things that are Good. Feelings that are good, no?<br>
Just like evil, Good is the force that controls those forementioned beings.<br>
Naturally, Evil Fights Good.<br>
For it is the Nature of Evil and Good to do battle.<br>
Like Light and Dark. <br>
All of that, is pretty straight foward. Untill at least, you toss in the third faction.<br>
<br>
Who is to call Good, 'Good'?<br>
Who is to call Evil, 'Evil'?<br>
<br>
The meaningless beings that make up the population of Indifference.<br>
Neutrality some call it.<br>
These beings are neither Good nor Evil. They live for only one thing.<br>
Preservation of Self. They cannot even begin to understand the great conflict between Good and Evil.<br>
They are the untainted and unconverted wildcard. They are 'Common Man'.<br>
They see evil, thus they call it, evil.<br>
They see good, thus they deem it good.<br>
<br>
But why do they call evil, evil?<br>
Because Evil kills their Mothers.<br>
Evil kills their Fathers.<br>
Evil Kills their sons, daughters, and grandchildren.<br>
Evil causes them grief, thus, evil must be bad.<br>
And what is Bad, is evil.<br>
<br>
Why do they call good, good?<br>
Because Good heals their wounds.<br>
It gives them bread. It schools their Children.<br>
It comforts them with Song, it bonds them together in love.<br>
It helps and assists them in any way it can.<br>
All in the Nature of Good.<br>
Good causes them happyness, thus, Good must be nice.<br>
And what is nice, is good.<br>
<br>
Neutrality then sets out on its course of life, living for whatever worthless existance it leads, Good helping it survive, and evil killing it at every turn. Naturally Good defends Neutrality, Thus, Evil and Good Fight.<br>
Without this Assistance from Good, Neutrality could never survive.<br>
So Neutrality is a Leech. A Leech onto Good, using them for their kindness to gain for themselves.<br>
<br>
So, what seperates Neutrality from Good then?<br>
Neutrality has no Moral Sprit.<br>
<br>
If Neutrality sees Evil, it will try to use them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, do you need a Druid to heal your wounds? How about a Barbarian Shaman to assist you? A Gnome Enchantress, a Halfling Rogue.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neutrality feasts on the Arogance of Evil, just as it feasts on the Kindness of Good.<br>
<br>
Evil, Arogant? Yes, of course.<br>
<br>
How many times have you said..<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm just using this Druid lolz&quot;<br>
&quot;This Shaman is just mah bich rofllolz&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me open you into the Mind of Neutrality. <br>
What do you think the Neutrals think of you?<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at this Inkie bastard. Fighting for me. Getting beat around, for me. Taking the hits from monsters and allowing me to gain in training and maybe some pieces of armor if I allow him to continue. All I have to do is cast my Silly Sprit of Wolf spell and heal him every now and again, and he's my pet.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nice going, Jobarn. You really showed that Druid who's boss, huh? And it even works the other way around.<br>
<br>
That same Human Warrior, that believes in nothing is simply saying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look at this Inkie Priest Bastard. Healing me. Blasting for me. Protecting me. I gain in Training, and I get to have some fun! Even gain some loot for myself, while this stupid Inkie thinks he's running the Show.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good work, he's really on a short leash.<br>
<br>
Thats why I do not group with Neutrals. I'm not the one to be used by them, nor will I assist them in training.<br>
<br>
I kill Neutrals. Why? Because I am Evil.<br>
<br>
And who deems evil, evil?<br>
The Neutrals. Why? Because We kill them.<br>
<br>
But, you may want to help the Neutrals. By all means, go for it.<br>
<br>
Assist the Neutrals.<br>
And what do the Neutrals deem this?<br>
Good.<br>
<br>
Good.<br>
<br>
Good.<br>
<br>
And what is good? ((Look up there ^))<br>
You poor Darkelf, by helping the Neutrals, you have just tossed aside 'Evil' and become as good as the Paladin you tried to kill yesterday.<br>
<br>
Helping the Neutrals is and will always be 'Good'.<br>
And who deems good, Good? The Neutrals.<br>
Why do they deem good, Good? Because Good helps them.<br>
<br>
I am not Good. I am evil.<br>
<br>
So I kill Neutrals.<br>
<br>
Another thing. I have to say Neutrality, you really have done a job on the forces of 'Evil'. The a Testiment to your success so far is all wrapped up in a Guild called &quot;Fire and Fury&quot; no?<br>
<br>
That ends now. The Darkelves are not for sale anymore. Go get your own damn loot.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>

Halfway through, she even stopped giggling and whispering.  By the end of it, she had stopped smiling.  As Shintou finished his speech, she climbed up to stand on her stool so she could see him clearly over the crowd.  With an uncharacteristic somberness, almost coldness, she turned to address him back.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And that's how evil defines neutrality.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, Shintou, you are evil.  <br>
<br>
You are quite clearly evil, with all the self-congratulating and angst-absorbed warmth you evil folks wrap around yourselves seeking comfort in the dark and cold world you work to create.  And like other evil folks, you pretend that evil is some great, living force that is powerful enough to exist outside mere gods or mortals.  You wave your evil label like a banner to advertise and even justify your actions, just like all the ruthless warlords, the rampaging armies and heartless merchants that have gone on before you.  <br>
<br>
People like you always say you hurt, maim or kill because you are evil, as though there were some outside force controlling you and you simply have no other recourse.  The fact is that what you call evil is simply the choices you make, and you make those choices for various reasons -- apparently because you are shortsighted, selfish and mean.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, and what about good?  <br>
<br>
Oh, those that run around calling themselves good make the same kind of claims that evil folks do.  They pretend what they do is dictated to them by a higher purpose grander than their own gods themselves, just like you do.  And, like evil, they wave their label like a banner as they do things from handing out bread to the hungry to trying to kill off entire populations they call evil.<br>
<br>
They also pretend they have no choice but to heal people and feed people, just like they say that good requires for them to go out and hurt, maim or kill people.  The fact is that what they call good is simply the choices they make, and they make those choices for various reasons -- they may be generous and giving, or they might just be shortsighted and bigoted.<br>
<br>
And what about neutral?  <br>
<br>
Well, the problem with good and evil defining neutral is that being good and being evil is all about picking sides to justify themselves and define everyone else.  And since you're evil, and all about being selfish, you make the assumption that neutrals are just out there to be selfish too.  <br>
<br>
The fact is that most neutrals don't believe in picking sides, they're too busy trying to make their own choices to try to blame those choices on banners and labels.  Beyond that, there are as many different kinds of neutral as there are wolves in the woods, so I can't define neutrality for you and I won't even try.  But I will tell you what I see about good and evil, and why I think your speech about what neutrals think is a load of gnoll spittle.<br>
<br>
I am a child of Nature.<br>
I am a child of Tunare.<br>
Whether you like it or not, Tunare is still YOUR mother, Shintou.  Even as much as he twisted, the Hateful one couldn't take that away.<br>
Whether you like it or not, Tunare still loves your race, and the race of the trolls, and the race of the humans, all as much as she loves our siblings the wolves and the fay.<br>
Whether you like it or not, it is the gifts of Tunare and the gifts of our grandmother that grow the wheat to bake your bread.  She feeds you and clothes you, as she feeds and clothes us all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Her voice grows stronger and harsher, a firey glow smouldering in her eyes.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So when I see good and evil go to attack and kill her children without need for food or safety<br>
When I see wolves dead in the woods with their skin and their meat left to rot in the sun<br>
I think of how the murderers call themselves evil<br>
I think of how the murderers call themselves good<br>
And I fail to see the difference.<br>
<br>
So go, call yourself evil.  Use your label as an excuse to hurt or kill anyone you like.  It doesn't make any difference.  Your choices are your own, and it is you, yourself, who will answer for them when we all return to meet the Nameless.<br>

So, things shall begin this way.  With the foolishness of this dark elf.  Will they never understand?  Will they never get that they are all simply pawns?  He thinks that the neutrals use him, while he is being used by this 'evil' that he speaks of.<br>
<br>
And what is this of neutrals knowing not of good and evil, and of having no morals?  Neutral being nothing more than a leech?  What foolishness has he been contaminated by?  A neutral person has morality, they have a reason for existence.  It is not simply for self preservation, it is for preservation of all.  For if either good or evil were to become too powerful, then existence would soon cease to be.  No, neutral is there to keep the balance, to ensure the future.  But, obviously you are too consumed by emotion to reason with logic.<br>

..... I also am order neutral. As order neutral I percieve myself as seeking balance in all things and this balance is much easier achieved through an  adherence to order. Both good and evil have their place in the world, but both strive to form the world into a place of extremes, I consider a haughty High  elf follower of Tunare(OG), and a Haughty Dark elf follower of Innoruk (OE) in the same light, both believe in order, but neither follows a path that can  succeed in bringing order to the world. These followers of good or evil necessarily sow discord in their interactions with the world through their efforts  to enforce one particular form of order, and are in truth doing more service to discord. For your particular case as a  dissafected priest,  the infighting and politics of your clerical order have tainted the cause of good in your eyes, you have  traveled some, and in these travels you have seen that there is a lack of balance in the world. Good acts can result in evil outcomes, evil acts can result  in good. Things, people, are not 2 dimensional, a Shadowknight is capable of good, a Palladin can do evil, though of course they lack the impartiality to  see their actions in this way..... Only the measured response of an impartial judge can truly determine the best course of action. After all, as a follower  of good, you cannot possibly provide medical services for an ogre Shadowknight of Cazic thule, such as my friend Ichi, and as misguided as he is, he provides balance for the equally misguided Erudite Palladins of the world, and may in fact provide a net balance of order (or even goodness) to the world  as a result of his career, if he spends time battling Innoruk in the Plane of Hate, and the dragons and other races of the world that seek to bring disorder  and chaos to Norrath.<br>
<br>
 No, Marrik, you are right to seek the middle path, pass not judgement on those who follow order, as good and evil are two sides of the same coin. Rather in your travels seek not to succor those who promote discord, no matter how noble or evil are their intentions in doing so....<br>

<br>
Light and Darkness cannot exist without each other.  In a sense they define one another.  The light breaks up the darkness and shines forth.  The darkness fills the corners and creates boundaries for the light. <br>
<br>
But in total Light or total Darkness, one still cannot see.  What do light and darkness create together?  Shadow.<br>
<br>
I stand in the middle.  Some call me &quot;neutral&quot;.  In my right hand is darkness, in my left is light.  I wield them together, and separately.<br>
<br>
************<br>
It is said: <br>
<br>
...ever desireless, one can see the mystery, ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.  These two spring from the same source, but differ in name...<br>
<br>
Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.  All can know good as good only because there is evil.  Therefore having and not having arise together....<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage goes about appearing to do nothing, teaching but not talking.  Creating, yet not possessing, working, yet not taking credit.  Work is done, then forgotten.  Therefore it lasts forever.<br>
<br>
So speak the sages.<br>
<br>
**********<br>
I reject the concepts of Evil and Good in themselves.  I embrace a different scale, in this world of Samsara, of eternal Dreaming.  I support the great Aesthetic, and make my judgements accordingly.  I support Tolerance above all, saving my own Intolerance for those who are themselves Fanatics, of any cause.  Balance in all things.<br>
<br>
Some people revile the Tier'dal and their culture and their code.  Some people revile the Erudians, with their gruesome &quot;purging&quot; rituals of that which *they* consider to be unclean.  I find worth in the Individuals of those cultures, even when I disapprove of general tendancies or other individuals.<br>
<br>
I deny worship to the Gods because I judge them unworthy of that worship.  They play games with us mortals, not even granting us the True Death in most cases, but causing us to be refabricated over and over.<br>
<br>
I admire the Love of Sarhea, and I watch her with interest, to see how she grows as she learns Hate.<br>
<br>
I admire Shintou when he acts from the Heart, when he is pure and his light shines forth, no matter its color.  But it is clear that he continues to seek self-justification, that there is doubt in that heart of his as to the worthiness of his chosen path.  He has stumbled, as do we all from time to time, and is trapped in the quagmire shaped for him by others.  I hope that he will learn, with time, to see more clearly from within, and stop changing his loyalties according to the master or mistress of the day.<br>
<br>
I have offered him my Emnity, as he hopes to become strong, and it is the only way he can apparently accept my assistance.  Where are you Shintou?  We have 99 duels left to our mutual task.  I have yet to learn correctness from the edge of your blade, or from will of your mind.....  It is time for another Lesson.<br>

Neutrality. They stand in the middle ground simply because they are afraid of Conflict. They won't stand with the so called 'Extremes' because they do not want to fight. They want to sit about, praise Tunare, get Fat and Leech off of the Fighting Between Good and Evil.<br>
<br>
Making Choices for yourself? Yes, and you called Me Selfish, right? Selfish, looking out for self?<br>
<br>
I look out for my Cause and my purpose, something that is much bigger then my 'self'. Neutrality is the one that is Near sighted and blind, they cannot even see past their own bodies to see the Larger picture of Conflict and War that is waged day in and day out on Norrath.<br>
<br>
They have 'better' things to do. Like use those Poor Trolls to gain their loot, or Darkelven fighters to bust in Alter Planes and gather their armor. Thats all fine for now, soon Neutrality will have no choice but pick a side or die for..<br>
<br>
Die for nothing. The Death of a Dog.<br>

The most righteous cleric of Tunare and the most despicable thief in the service of Innoruuk can both be brought low by a sword through their abdomen, or their neck or mouth if a quick kill is desired.<br>
<br>
“Some of you, you have the choice of whom to serve, of what cause you choose to defend with your life. But there are others of us who do not have such luxuries.

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> At this, the elf was brought up short by the sounds of fighting off in the fields. His interest aroused, he ducked low among the tall grass and sneaked quietly up to the combatants. It seemed that a young wood elf, far away from home, had fallen afoul of a troll lurking in the swamps nearby. Aradil watched the fight with interest, observing the skill with which the elf avoided the heavy blows from the troll’s club. But the elf tripped on the root of a nearby tree, and went down to the ground. Seizing the moment, the troll swung his club down toward the elf’s head…<br>
<br>
…and the elf saw Aradil, hiding in the grass. Though his fate was already decided, a plea for help went out from the young elf’s eyes. A brief sigh escaped Aradil’s lips…<br>
<br>
 …and the club crushed the elf’s skull, and the eyes were no more. The troll raised his head and howled to the sky, proclaiming his victory to whatever vile god he worshipped.  He bent down to feast upon his fallen foe.<br>
<br>
But Aradil had crept up behind the troll while the monster gloated, and within moments, the troll slumped down on top of the elf’s corpse. The warrior wiped the green blood off on the troll’s rags, and then sheathed it.<br>

&quot;Quite an amusing conversation. Atleast Shintou has honor and a cause, even though its the wrong path.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Societies, families, and individuals alike should be willing to do what is right, and to set what is right down as law. Some might be asked to make sacrifices for the good of others. Those unwilling to do so, those who say that rules are too constraining and are unwilling to abide by them because it discomforts them to do so, are selfish. Selfishness often leads to evil.

<br>
Do you not see the corpse of the lone tier'dal within your woods?  Did your people not hunt him down and slay him?  Why?  You call us evil for doing the exact same thing.  Its hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
And you druids and rangers who say we are evil for killing your wolves and bears... what are they for attacking our children for no just cause?  They are fit to live and our children are not?  You would hold a wolf or bear's life in higher regard than a person?  You cry out when you see the corpse of those beasts rotting in the sun yet you buy armor made from their pelts.  I call you a hypocrit.  <br>
<br>
Innoruuk is our Father, yes.  He fuels our hearts with hatred, yes.  Is this hatred unjust?  I think not.<br>
<br>
I am not a pawn of evil, I am not evil.  This is not a child's game.  This is survival.  Kill or be killed.  Fight or die.  You hunt mine and I hunt yours.  Survival of the fittest.  The meek shall inherit nothing.  Hypocrisy is the true evil. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/6/02 7:15:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *sad sigh*</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kimaya just looks at Anrae with a short, sad sigh.

Oh sweetie, you listened to my voice but I don't think you understood a word I said.  I don't know if you even can, but since you asked questions I'll answer them.<br>
<br>
Are your children hunted and slain by my people?  <br>
<br>
I have seen other elves who have fallen in the woods.  I have also seen tall elves, tree elves, humans and all sorts of other people in the same state.  And I am as sad when I see them as I am when I see the unskinned wolves and bears, because they weren't killed because someone needed food.  They may not even have been killed because someone needed to defend themselves.  They may just have been killed because of fear or of hate.  But whether I like it or not, both the murderers and the murdered are still my family, still my people.<br>
<br>
And your next question... Is a wolf's life more valuable than a person's?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She tilts her chin and pauses for a moment.  Her brow is slightly furrowed as she looks into Anrae's eyes as if searching for something.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I value all life.  Norrath holds the city you grew up in as close to her heart as she holds the city of the dwarves.  Tunare gives growth to the trees of your forest as surely as she does those of the Feerot, and of Toxxulia.  And if my Mother and my Grandmother find worth in anything enough to feed and protect, who am I to question them?  Who am I to love anyone any less than they?  Who am I to hate…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She suddenly blinks and breaks her eyes away from Anrae's, her eyes a little shiny.  She almost seems to shake a moment, then returns her gaze again with all the fire and passion she showed in her first speech to Shintou.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
And even though I know you already have your own answer to your last question, I’ll answer it just the same.  The hate that Innoruuk inflicts you with IS unjust.  But the injustice is to you, not me.  He forces this hate on you with constant attacks, constant pain.  He needs you and your people so desperately that he fights every moment to keep you in as much torture and torment as he forced on your ancestors.  And like them, you’re not strong enough to fight the endless onslaught.  Maybe someday you will be, and maybe someday you’ll come home again…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kimaya realizes she’s trailing off, and that her speech isn’t going to do much good.

<br>
It’s okay if you don’t, I understand.  It’s hard to be strong.  So instead I’ll be strong for you.  And maybe if you wear this, and see how lovely it is on your beautiful blue skin, it will remind you of me.  And maybe, for just a moment, knowing there’s someone who cares will help you hurt just a little less.<br>

I am the only daughter of the granddaughter of the second brother  to the King of Neriak. I grew up well cared for, but not spoiled or drowned in opulence. My needs were met, but not grandly, if you gather my meaning. My mother was a cleric of Innoruuk, fanatic in her motions to please her god. My father fell when i was very young, and my memories few of him. As I grew, my mother brought me with her to the temple in the third gate, to bring me to Innoruuk.. i was 10, the time of decisions. When i looked at the way my mother changed in this place, at the way everyone looked, I decided No god would affect me this way. Gods use man to satisfy their own ends. You label me &quot;neutral&quot;, but i was Free to rule my own destiny, my own future.<br>

Then came the day you betrayed me, the day I brought you low. The day my eyes glazed over, my will became stronger, and a voice thundered in my head, &quot; Kill Him!&quot;  I am now in service to Innoruuk, yes, I am still &quot;neutral&quot; by nature of who i am, but follow a god by my choosing. Yesterday you asked me, How fares Sel'quar, in response i answered, We prosper. Your next question was &quot;on the backs of neutrals?&quot; I speak for Sel'quar, and I am neutral, Am i weak? no, do i use others to aid my house in it's growth? Nau, I do not. I do not understand you anymore Shin...and given your hostility toward me, I'm not sure i want to. <br>

Daughter of Tunare, you are right in saying we are all children of Tunare. Long past is that fact, and no teir'dal would openly admit that. We are proud of who we are, we hold our traditions tightly in our fist.  Innorruuk made us thus, he planted his seed in the new &quot;king and queen&quot; of Neriak.  But as bloodlines continue the link to Tunare is diluted with each teir'dal child's birth. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> shakes her hair back, holding her head high as her lavender eyes sparkle</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Okay, I've got a riddle for you then!<br>
<br>
A coupla weeks ago, I took a bunch of clay.  I slipped it up with some water and molded into the cutest little doll!  Then I put in a pretty stone so that my doll was holding it, and then stuck it in the kiln so it would be in the fire until it was as hardened as it could be.  It's been out of the fire a long time now, and I've carried it all over the place since then.<br>
<br>
So here's the riddle: What is my doll made of?<br>
