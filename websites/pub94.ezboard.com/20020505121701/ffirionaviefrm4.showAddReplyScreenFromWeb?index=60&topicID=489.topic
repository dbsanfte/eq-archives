class=title>   Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> Another note on loot and such.  If you want to think of it from a role-playing/in character perspective, then it does make sense for good items to bring with them a notion of status.  I.e:<br>
<br>
Galtron walks into the bar with a grim face and orders an ale.  <br>
A novice adventurer looks upon Galtron and whispers to his friend: &quot;By Tunare!  That is the great warrior Galtron.  And look at that breastplate he has donned.  It is rumored he had to kill the great Dragon Trakenon himself for such a prize!  And that sword.  Rumor has it that it was wielded by a horrid snakeman in the Temple of Ssraeshza, the legendary enslavers of the Iksar race.  This is a powerful and great man indeed, my friend&quot;<br>
<br>
(by the way I made up the name &quot;Galtron&quot; so I'm not referring to anyone, and I'm not trying to imply that Trakanon or Ssra mobs are &quot;uber&quot; or anything)<br>
<br>
You have to take that with a grain of salt, but you have to take all of Everquest with a grain of salt if you're trying to roleplay.  <br>
<br>
At any rate, if I was roleplaying in D&amp;D and I was a level 3 warrior in leather armor with a long sword, and then a warrior walked in with plate armor, some ornate shield, a fiery sword, etc I'd automatically give him a little respect and awe.  I'd look at my crappy long sword with dried orc blood on it and think: &quot;Someday I will be a champion of the realms like he is&quot;.   Or if I was a wizard and cast detect magic and a robed figure lit up like a Christmas tree -)<br>

<br>
We had a similar incident with DA and Lodi. We popped into the zone with our group to gank him and we very quickly received a tell from some DA explaining that they were building up the forces to take him and were wondering if we were here to take a shot at him (Lodi).<br>
<br>
We quickly realized that DA was setting up and explained we were here to take a shot at Lodi but now realize that DA was here first and deserved the oppourunity to take Lodi down.<br>
<br>
Pretty simple. Pretty reasonable. Absolutely no grey area.<br>
<br>
Now I dont know exactly what happened that day between DA and Reso but I would find it difficult to believe no one in DA sent a tell to someone in the Reso raiding party trying to reason with them. Maybe it really was a mistake. Maybe it was just a few folks in Reso that jumped the gun because they really believed they were right. But once again, just like the fear incident, there were alot of folks in DA that were left with a bad taste in their mouths over it. <br>
<br>
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt though Cori. I mean I have had the pleasure of playing with a lot of reso and I would like to think the people I got to know wouldnt go out and intentionally try to screw another guild over. But if Reso is as honorable as you believe it is I would suggest you make very clear to your leadership that mistakes / miscommunications like the Fear / Lodi incidents don't happen again. People will start to talk.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Sorry, didnt really answer your question did I?<br>
<br>
This might be considered dishonorable because <br>
<br>
a) Poor communication can lead to misunderstanding which can be interpreted as dishonor. For example the majority of tells/chat I received about these incidente were, &quot;Reso came in and took Lodi from us!&quot; or &quot;We agreed to let Reso have a chance at the mob they wanted in fear, but we were supposed to clear the stuff to there. They just came in and took over!&quot;<br>
<br>
b) Your team(s) did engage Lodi and looted Lodi. Since there was a dispute over who deserved the chance to take Lodi there are some folks out there that question wether all the loot was turned over or just some of it. &quot;They came in and took him from us, how do we know they turned everything over?&quot;<br>
<br>
See what I mean about people talking? Its really easy to paint someone or another group as &quot;the bad guys&quot; isn't it?<br>

But poor communication isn't in any way dishonorable, it is simply what it is, poor communication. And that does lead to people making mistakes. Probably our druidess when she saw him pop should have told DA that we were taking him, but she didn't.  But in the long run, the end result was A) they were offered free loot (they had one cleric there, it's not like they COULD have cleared to the golem, we had to do it) and turned it down for whatever reason, and B) they got the loot. (And it was all the loot, and if I find out different, I will be very pissed off at whoever held something back.)<br>
<br>
But if ya wanna talk about lame-ass things people do, that don't involve any miscommunication, HERE is an example of utter and complete black-and-white lack of decency. Me and Lysanthes and Nothsa were on the middle garg ledge in VL tonight, there for about six hours. During that time, there were people doing upper spiders and people down below, and we had no probs, just went about our business. Then Qixx comes in and says we should move downstairs, and if we don't, he's just gonna train stuff thru us. In other words, a threat to train us in an attempt to force us to move where we have been FINE for SIX HOURS. And did he ever! 10 mobs, 20? I don't know, but we definitely had to zone after the first batch or two he pulled onto us. (He didn't get anyone but my pet spider killed, fortunately.)<br>
<br>
No ambiguities there, no miscommunications. One person in your guild said they were intending on going to Legends to use it to transfer stuff from another server to this one. And now another one intentionally and blatantly trains people. This leads me to conclude two  things: 1) Either your vetting procedure for applicants sucks or you actually seek these kind of people out, and 2) your leader lacks the balls to actually enforce any standards of decency.<br>

<br>
We were almost going to camp didnt worry about it.<br>
First was Qixx pulling past us, then we managed to deal with the trained pull. Then again he did it with another 3 or 4, and Sinjo came shortly with his own train.<br>
<br>
They all were in the same group. That clearcut effort to train us outta the way. Ledge group probably cant kill enough at the upper camp and needed that middle gargs but theres no need to triple train us to get us out of our camp spot for 6hours just so they can have more mobs to keel for xp.<br>
<br>
So what if your camp spot is uptop and lack of mobs to kill per cycle because you cant pull from our middle gargs camp spot. That justify you to train us out?<br>
<br>
Pretty much a simple tell would do, and compromise be reached. A tell like *Shift your camp downstairs or I will train pass you* Think thats going to work?<br>

<br>
the response was &quot;weve been here for 6 hours&quot;<br>
<br>
my response &quot;ok well im gonna pull the unclaimed mobs below you&quot;<br>
<br>
and i will every single time.<br>
<br>
im friends with lysanthes and nothsa, and im sorry you guys didnt hear the full story about what happened. I will give you a tell next time to try to work something out rather than that ass of a guildmate you call coriolis. Im sure we could have reasonably worked it out if i had not given him the tell first.<br>
<br>
I gave my spot up in the group so that nothsa could have a group after the incident.<br>

that is all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uqixxfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QixxFV</A> at: 4/8/02 3:37:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uguanofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GuanoFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guano the GnOgre</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/02 5:47:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> TRAIN? thats wasnt a train that was my pull, so it was 6 mobs...<br>

Nothing like a group with a pair of pullers like that to keep the ol exp bar heading in the right direction. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry if the pulling caused any grief, I know it was not intentional, we were just trying to speed up the exp flow a little with a few extra mobs.<br>

<br>
I dont know what happened in Velks, but I hope you guys get it worked out. One thing I do know though is that the more animosity and tension that builds up between folks the more likely they will do stupid things. Once people get it in their heads that another group is &quot;the enemy&quot;, &quot;the bad guys&quot; or &quot;dishonorable&quot; the more likely they will treat that group as such.<br>
<br>
Self full filling prophecy and all that sort of stuff.<br>
<br>
Our guilds rarely interact now. We seem to be staying out of each others way and generally just don't bother each other except on these boards. Thats going to change as both guilds start migrating towards the same encounters (until PoP is released anyway). HoT is gonna be ugly if we can't learn to play in the same zone with each other so instead of folks stirring up stuff and causing tension between the guilds on these boards I would like to suggest this...<br>
<br>
If someone in your guild has an issue with someone in my guild they discuss it with your leadership and if the leadership feels its necessary they send bako an e-mail and vice versa for coinfist. These boards are really not the place to work out disagreements because the discussions quickly degenerate into ugly name calling and finger pointing. That turns into tension and hard feelings in the game and then people start acting on those feelings and go and do stupid stuff.<br>
<br>
As for someone going to legends and coming back I have this to say. How in the world are you coming to the conclusion that this action is dishonourable? Seems to me that if someone was willing to go through all that trouble, jump through all the hoops and rules verant put out (and they did go through the rules) then thats their choice. You may not approve of their actions but just because YOU disapprove doesn't make it &quot;dishonourable&quot;. Especially since they did nothing illegal and broke no rules. <br>
<br>
If your arguement is that they are upsetting the balance and sanctity of this server well I got a newsflash for ya. The balance and sanctity of this server went out the window the second folks discovered and started using the alignment bug. The balance and sanctity of this server was flushed down the toilet when we saw level 10 folks with planar gear.<br>
<br>
If you ask me those two issues will do more damage to this server than a few folks bringing over items from legends.<br>

Why not try working together... Sounds CRAZY? well i have grouped with ALOT of reso and neary Every FF you both have  many skilled players. Why not try grouping  with  each other more often, helping with epics, doing some raids together. With the odd times we all play,  you know how easy it would be to get epics done working together. Doing some coop would be good for us all i think, And possible help ease some of the tention... I think if yea all got to know each other alittle better there wouldnt be as much tention... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Didn't we already help F&amp;F get a Rogue epic? You want more? <br>
Why is everyone afraid of the tension between F&amp;F and Reso? There is no corpse camping, not exp losing between guild war. How is possible to hurt anyone on this server? <br>

It keeps everyone on their toes.<br>
<br>
Finger pointing and name calling on these boards can lead to hard feelings which turn into actions in game that only escalate the tensions. For example, I am sure that the situation with Qixx would have been handled much differently if Qixx and Cori thought highly of each other. I am betting that since they might not see ach other in the best of lights that they both wound up treating each other differntly. Wether they knew they were or not just because its human nature.<br>
<br>
As for working with each other... I am not oppossed to it. In fact we were with a reso group on (friday?) and got asked to join reso in a raid through Akheva. Unfortunately I had to log soon so I passed, but its gestures like that that make me think there is stilla chance for us to play on this server togethor and not be constantly at each others throats.<br>
<br>
The thing is, I think both guilds see each other as competition (which is fine) so I don't know if folks will want to make a habit of &quot;joint raids&quot; etc. On the other hand I do know that reso and FF folks do alot of pick up groups with each other all the time. I also have suchi, pizza and beer (not at the same time) with some folks from reso everynow and then too. =)<br>

I said I wouldn't help with reso epics. Look, we have our own raids to do, our own members to help with improvement. FaF didn't invite me to their guild and help me get nice equipment so I could go twink complete strangers in other guilds.<br>
<br>
After that, coinfist, the guildleader of reso, wouldn't group with me and talked smack about me to other reso members. He would barely talk to me. I honestly can't remember much that coin did for me besides being in my exp groups, but I can remember going an extra mile for him plenty of times. Hell, I sent Samm his direction because I knew the two of them were similar level while I was 10 levels higher already. I said go talk to coin , he's in paw. His common sucks, but he's a good guy. I would dare say alot of people met each other that way through me...<br>
<br>
anyway, my point is, I've done alot for people, I don't care what you come here and lie and say. IF you can't tell a friend, &quot;no&quot;, and they won't be your friend after, there is a serious problem. The issue mushroomed. <br>
<br>
Now, I'm disgusted. I'm disgusted with coinfist the most and some random and asundry reso members next. This is how these people are, and there is not going to be any changing them. They will grow up to be level 60's just like this.<br>
<br>
man, I'll tell you. God forbid, in the future faf is no more, I wouldn't join reso. If reso is dying of thirst in the desert, they can have the sweat off my rigomortous buttocks post mortem.  I'd rather give up EQ all together than support coinfist.<br>
<br>
That's my opinion, and that's the reason. Take it to the bank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umezzmorizerr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mezzmorizerr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/8/02 7:54:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> Just like to get something off my chest,<br>
Cori you've been evading me for quite some time now.  You claim i have been stealing your Jewelcraft customers and spreading negative propoganda about me.  I'm not that mad considering i have no jewelcrafting skill and i have fixed things with those peeps u have told i steal their customers from.  What makes me somewhat frustrated with is you refuse to talk to me about this &quot;problem&quot;.  Also about me not paying you 500platnum and a BD for the 5th shawl combo, sorry I did not think that was a good deal so i took my buisness elsewhere...everyone is not going to pay what you demand.  If you want to discuss this i'd love to, but as i stated earlier you've been hiding for quite some time.<br>
