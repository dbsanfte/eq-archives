She closes her eyes tightly, listening to the lulling sound, trying to calm her mind.<br>
<br>
She had wanted to get away.  It was really that simple.  Sitting in the Keep kicking herself wasn't going to accomplish anything at all, certainly.  Packing a small bag, she had removed herself to Freeport, deep beneath the city.  Her friends there were always quite happy to see her, and at the news that she planned to stay for a while, more than happy to keep her there with them.  After arranging for a clean room in one of the district's nicer inns, she set to lessons, instructing the Rage's young initiate's in the languages of their allies.  The Humans had trouble with some of the finer points of Teir'dal, but the Rage did not tolerate weaklings, and her students would sit with her until well into the night mastering the tongue.<br>
<br>
It had been one such night that she had returned to her room quite late, her imp flapping along behind wearily. The voices in her head whirled together, that of her student now on his way home, that of a friend looking for some acquaintance, and the deep voice of one of the Rage's most respected Knights, one she had heard a great deal about but had never met in person.  She had bumped into his servant in the marketplace, and it would seem that the girl had said something to her Master that had caused him to find her in her thoughts.  In her haze, she turned the latch and pushed open the door only to find herself face to face with an imposing Human male dressed in only his nightshirt.  Her face flushed a furious hue as she stumbled backwards into the hall, realizing she had opened the wrong door.  Nervously fumbling for her key, she quickly opened her door and bolted inside.  A quiet chuckle followed her from the room next door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lady Rose I presume?&quot; the man intoned, drawing the woman's attention sharply back towards her door.  &quot;Oh dear Innoruuk...&quot; she murmured to herself as she pressed back against the wall.  She had tripped over the Knight who's voice had filled her thoughts that night. So much for proper introductions, etiquette, or at that rate, composure.  Dropping her satchel and staff by the dresser, she slipped out of her robe and dove beneath the covers, wrapping herself up tightly.  The imp followed with great protest as she plucked him off of the bedpost, wrapping her arms around him.  The voice, once in her head, came easily through the wall from the room beside her. Why she had felt she could talk to him about such things... Why she had permitted him to enter... Why he had seen her as not just another woman who needed mending...<br>
<br>
She lets her eyes slip open, looking around the small room.  So much had changed as three years had passed on Norrath.  Her thoughts drift back to an evening in Nektulos, standing atop the spire with Nereida, as he spoke to them over the winds.  It had to have been the cold.  Velious had a horrid effect on him, numbing the body as well as the mind.  He was certain he had asked, and she was quite certain he was delusional.  Finding him in the grass set away from the bustle in the Plane of Knowledge, he made certain that she didn't miss it this time, and that he was most certainly not delusional.  Exhaling deeply, she stands from the edge of the bed, stepping to the long dresser.  How very much their lives had changed.  Her slaves rested in the room next door with many of their belongings.  Her manservant, Dhonnal, eternally loyal, come with her from Neriak.  Hildi, a companion for him, a gift from a kind ally.  Pome stayed in the room with them, keeping an eye on them, and they her.  The Rage knew that Gnome well enough as she had come to Freeport after leaving Ak'anon, but since she had attached herself to Rose, they were more than happy to deliver her home when she was caught streaking in the district.  The boxes and crates where stacked from floor to ceiling, all of her and Morgrist's personal effects packed away, awaiting a new home.  A home.  They had left the Keep once it had been made perfectly clear that their union was not welcome there.  O'Donner had opened up what storage he had for their furnishings and larger boxes, determined he owed them a debt of gratitude for their continued business and long history of kindness to he and his daughters.  When the Rage and the Militia heard the news, and that they were looking for a home there in the east district, a murmur spread through the underbelly of the city.  It was a rare Teir'dal who called Freeport home, and the prospect of moving a large brewery within the bounds of their district, as well as offspring for one of their most prized Knights... they saw that arrangements were made post haste.  It would be six months until they had been together some four years... and they had arranged for their wedding high above the waters in the land of eternal twilight.<br>
<br>
Standing at the side of the dresser, she flips open a small wooden box, a soft smile crossing her lips as she looked inside.  An odd assortment of precious gems, golden rings, medallions... trinkets they had come across as they hunted, toys to be played with as she rested beside him on stacks of thick bear skins.  She kept each and every one of them as a reminder of places they had been, people they had killed together...<br>
<br>
The knock comes at the door, a soft rapping, bringing her out of her lingering thoughts.  Snapping the lid closed, she retrieves her cloak and staff from the bed and turns to the door.  The man standing on the other side was younger than she expected, one of the clerks for the Rage come to show her homes for sale in the district.  They were determined to show her &quot;condemned&quot; warehouses as well, buildings large enough for the brewery operations.  Surrounded by Humans, the commonlands and forest between she and her troubled House in Neriak, she pauses a moment and looks around the packed room before turning a smile to the man awaiting her in the hall.  Pulling the door closed behind her, she follows him out into the bright sun of the midday, fading into the hustle and bustle of Freeport.  Home. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rosfuil>rosfuil</A> at: 4/22/03 7:04:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daonwolf>Daon Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/27/03 8:22:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=914.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Long Night in Freeport...</span><hr size=1> OOC: I'm glad to see your writing again!
