<br>
However Fuvi has been banned for mentioning 3 RL names in the thread (his own, Bako's and Gwenlynn's).<br>
<br>
Regardless of my disagreements with Fuvi, I personally don't feel this is fair, given that Fuvi has tried to abide by the rules of the Soapbox (and board in general), although he walks the line - as do a lot of us.<br>
<br>
The posted rules are as follows:<br>
<br>
&quot;This board will not tolerate the following:<br>
Racism<br>
Sexism/sexual preference slander/bigitory<br>
Bigitory<br>
Personal attacks ( admin will make final call on this )<br>
Any slurs related to the persons creed, religion, origin<br>
<br>
Any ebay/real money sites<br>
Any inter server trading<br>
Any eq to any other game trading<br>
Any selling for real money<br>
<br>
All decisions made by the Admin is final<br>
<br>
Admins/Mods will try and post when something has been moved/altered/deleted.<br>
We are human to so mistakes will be made.<br>
<br>
*subject to change as I think of more*&quot;<br>
<br>
I personally wasn't aware of the Mod's stance on RL names, although the disclosure of RL info regarding people should be governed by common sense, only first names were used, not addresses etc...<br>
<br>
As I've stated a long time ago, I respect the Mod's decisions and rules governing this board, because they keep these forums relatively clean of the garbage that pollutes most EQ server forums.<br>
<br>
However, I'm pretty confident that if &quot;RL names and info&quot; had been included in the forum rules, Fuvi wouldn't have disclosed that information.<br>
<br>
As suprising as it may seem, I'll be the first to state that a number of Fuvi's posts on this board are actually beneficial to the population.  That, and because the stated reason for his banning was not clearly listed in the rules, I *personally* don't think banning him was warranted - a warning could have been issued.<br>
<br>
Regardless, would the Mod's please &quot;flesh-out&quot; the rules to include &quot;RL info&quot;, given that violation of this rule is sufficient for insta-banning.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this is just my opinion.<br>

<br>
Releasing just the first name and your going to ban?  Fuvi's intent WASN'T to release RL info, I can guaruntee you that.  He just put in the *first* name as he saw fit(Notice the first emphasized, as in, ONLY the first?).  And its EXTREMELY funny Jaxy how you jumped the gun on that, but when Kajinn said he'd release any RL info about Nexen, you kept your mouth shut, the only mod who spoke up was Apep.  All I ask, was this ban about Fuvi releasing &quot;REAL LIFE INFORMATION&quot; or you trying to stop your friends getting bashed?  You want to treat us like little kids here, fine.. But don't expect me to not to do the same right back to you, and ask if that was the true intent of that ban.<br>

<br>
   Done.<br>
<br>
   It's not necessarily resulting of an &quot;insta-ban&quot;.  Fuvi was more or less on probation.  He holds the dubious honor of being the first poster to be banned from FV forums by Jaxy just shortly after server opened <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   His ban was removed a couple months back, etc.<br>

<br>
If all the board mods constantly repeated eachother in the same thread, it would get kinda crowded/boring.  Apep dealt with the situation you mentioned, and you're getting on Jaxy's case for not jumping in and saying &quot;I agree!&quot;?<br>

Maybe Lacus agrees with this, but I don't.  Most of the mods troll these boards at work, during the day, and whenever thing *THEY* don't agree with comes up, the bannings/thread lockings take place immediatly.  So yes, I'm calling your BS out on this, and I still want Jaxy to answer my question.. Was the banning done because of LIMITED real life info(First names), or to stop her friends from getting bashed?  And btw Syll, yes, if someone is threatening to post RL info, more than one tiny response from a mod is required.. If you all sit back and dont care because it'd be funny to see someone who you all &quot;don't like&quot; get flamed and real life brought into the flame, but when friends of the mods are getting trashed WITHIN guidelines action is taken, that's complete BS.<br>

I think in that case the RL first names weren't listed as part of a personal attack, but just to clarify who was selling which acct, since that whole thread was about people selling their accounts to other players, then calling Verant and having them reinstated in their name, etc.<br>

<br>
As far as Fuvi goes, I actually like him quite a bit.  I have no idea how the other mods/admins feel about him save that he already caused enough ruckuss to get himself banned near server launch.  <br>
<br>
As far as Bako/Gwen, even if I knew the answer to this I couldn't really give it, because if they had e-mailed then it would seem like they went out to get Fuvi banned or something if I said they e-mailed about it.<br>

For starters, you over-estimate the amount of time we spend here.  I was on for a bit yesterday morning, then I was offline all day visiting Mount Rainier.  I was on for a few mins this morning, then headed off to play some Neverwinter nights.  NWN got boring so I shut it down, and came here to scan the boards for a bit.<br>
<br>
For seconds, Fuvi was re-banned for posting the RL names.  His original ban was for personal attacks, and it was felt that he was posting RL names in the most recent thread to lash out at them on a more personal level.<br>
<br>
Not to jump all over Fuvi, but he's not some innocent poster victimized by lack of knowledge of board rules.  His original ban was supposed to be permanent, but it was reduced to 6 months to give him a chance.  He knew he was walking a thin rope w/ the admins as far as his behaviour was concerned, etc.<br>
<br>
In any event, I've pointed this thread out to Jaxy.  She can post some further comments when she's online again.<br>

he was accusing Ogah of STEALING HIS ACCOUNT..and I don't think he was just letting people know about it, he was pretty pissed about it............<br>
<br>
and where did Fuvi use the names of the people in the thread as personal attacks? /How/ do you use first names as personal attacks?<br>
<br>
there's absolute no foundation for this.. you can say this wasn't his first offense, but does that mean it's OK to ban him for something that was neither made clear as a rule nor previously enforced?  how in the world was Fuvi supposed to know he wasn't supposed to use RL first names in this manner? <p>--Lacus<br>Grandmaster<br>

<br>
Please point out where he said it wasn't a flame.  In fact he says he made the post as long as it is because he didn't want to &quot;just say Ogah is a liar and a thief&quot; (or something along those lines), which would imply that is what he thinks and was the point he was trying to make.<br>
<br>
Why couldn't Zokof use in-game names?  Why couldn't he say Ogah instead of Joe? Or Shoug instead of Charles?<br>
<br>
And do you think Ogah and Shoug wanted people to know their RL names?  Any more than Bako or Gwenlynn would?<br>
<br>
Also, where did Fuvi use the RL names in a way that would suggest he was trying to piss off people by using them?  He said &quot;Tommy (the player of Gwenlynn)&quot; ........ yea that's a -really- volatile phrase.<br>
<br>
Give us ONE example of where Fuvi used a RL name in a manner that was unquestionably an attempt to aggravate Bako or Gwenlynn.<br>

Read the question I wrote to Jaxy and things should become more clear to you.  Double standards, simply put.. To their friends, RL names used=ban .. To people they dont like .. RL names used=more flame's for enjoyment.  It's all about the double standards, and who's nose is stuck up who's ass.  Be it the poster up the mods, or the mods up the person.<br>
