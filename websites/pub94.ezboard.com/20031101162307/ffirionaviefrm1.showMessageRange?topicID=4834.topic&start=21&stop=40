Anti-kill stealing: when you engage a mob, it becomes &quot;yours&quot;, and no one else can touch it. Yeah, no more random saves from higher levels at the last minute, but still ... <br>
<br>
To have a house, you don't PAY, you perform &quot;community acts&quot;, and maintain your community status in a city. You do this by participating in events, etc. <br>
<br>
It's a lot different, and *that's* what has me excited. What I *really* hope, though, is that they add content similar to that of LDoN where rogues will have to unlock chests and doors, disarm traps and all that. THEN I'll be absolutely beside myself about this. Rogues were my first love, and will remain my favorites. They need more content, damn it! &lt;grin&gt;<br>

I'd also like to add abou the AO comment.....These graphics look WAAAAY better then anything I ever saw on AO. And I'm not sure what PC you used to play AO when it first came out, but anytime I walked into a city, my PC basically has a ceasure and died. The graphics engine on release was crap and it was one of the biggest MMO release fiasco's to date. I stopped playing about 1 months after release.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
player-crafted items and dropped loot: There are some basic misunderstandings in the community about our tradeskill system and the role of dropped loot in EQ2. This is understandable given the minimal amount of information that has so far been presented, especially regarding the infamous quote that &quot;the best items in game will be made by players.&quot;That is an oversimplification of how loot works, so I will provide more detail on the subject.<br>
<br>
The fear invoked by the above statement is that loot will become trivial. The assumption is that since players make the best items in the game, the best items will be easily obtainable, making loot all but worthless.<br>
<br>
This is not the way we're designing our game. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Just like in EverQuest, loot matters. A lot.<br>
<br>
As I'm discussing these concepts at length, I will post the information in two separate parts, which follow below.<br>
<br>
Item Drops vs. Component Drops <br>
<br>
Let me first dismiss the fear that mobs won't drop loot. They will. As in EverQuest, mobs have drop tables, and those possible drops include complete items. And as in EverQuest, the quality of those items varies depending on the challenge of the encounter. In other words, killing the big bad dragon will net you complete items. So will hunting in a regular zone.<br>
<br>
In addition to the chance for loot drops, mobs can also drop components. That nasty dragon might drop a hide, for instance. So say you kill Jimmy the Dragon and he drops a Cloak of Fiery Hotness and a purple dragon hide. Why would a player prefer to get the hide over the cloak? This is where tradeskills come in.<br>
<br>
(Please note: The following examples are purely hypothetical and are not specifics of what will actually happen in game. These are merely to help you understand the concepts behind the system.)<br>
<br>
You take that purple dragon hide to an Artisan of the appropriate ability who can, through effort and skill on his part, make you an uber item that is usable by your class. Some components will make specific types of items: an orc captain might drop a component that can be made into leather armor, a gnoll commander might drop something that can be made into chain armor, etc. Rare components from uber mobs will probably have a larger variety of things they can be made into. The purple dragon hide could be made into boots or a tunic or sleeves-whatever the player needs most. In any case, the purple dragon hide will make an uber item that will be every bit as rare and desirable as standard drops.<br>
<br>
The advantage to this type of system should be obvious. Instead of having a mob drop an item that is specific to a certain slot and class (and could therefore be unusable by the players who are present), the component will be desired by everyone. There is less chance that an item will be sold off or be given to an alt, because anyone there can have something made from the component that will benefit their class.<br>
<br>
This doesn't take away from the uber factor of the loot. Just as loot from the hardest mobs in EQ is rare and lusted after, so will it be in EQ2. We're just allowing the players more variety in what form that loot will ultimately take. Instead of being on a dragon raid where only one item might be of use to you (and if it doesn't drop, you feel let down), you instead have a shot at a component that you know will benefit your character.<br>
<br>
In the case of uber loot, the player-crafted item is not more powerful than the dropped item. Dropped loot simply has a predetermined function, whereas the component allows you flexibility in what you end up with. Also, the enchantments present on dropped loot will already be in place, whereas crafted items can have customized enchantments. But since this is really the first time we're mentioning the concept of enchantments, I'll save further discussion on the topic for another time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: although the &quot;mini game&quot; may be fun at first, how fun is it going to be after you have played it 800 times.. it will become a burden eventually.<br>
<br>
I can see your point, but let me make a counterpoint.<br>
<br>
In EverQuest, tradeskills can be quite redundant, but thousands upon thousands of players use the system anyway.<br>
<br>
In EverQuest, killing the same camp of mobs over and over and over for hours is repetitive, but tens of thousand of people do it every day.<br>
<br>
Why? Because the results are deemed worth it.<br>
<br>
How much better would it be if the process was also fun and challenging?<br>
<br>
Almost anything in life becomes tedious if you have to do it enough times. The challenge to us as designers is to vary the process enough that it's not just doing the same thing over and over, but instead mixes things up a bit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: Hardcore artisans will flood the market making items, leaving casual players little chance at making money.<br>
<br>
If making items is as fast and easy as it is in EQ, then you are correct. But we can control how many steps items take to make.<br>
<br>
Artisans won't be making dozens of basically useless items just to get skill increases. Artisans will earn experience (and hence more skill) through many steps of the creation process. The final combine is only one part of that.<br>
<br>
The idea is that you will produce less finished items because each takes more steps to craft. Making really good items can be a somewhat lengthy process, although it can be broken down into phases that the player can do in relatively small chunks of game time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: The second wave of artisans will need money to buy items they need to craft, but won't be able to make money to buy them because they only make money by selling items.<br>
<br>
<br>
Artisans can also make money by performing tasks (essentially quests) for NPCs in the cities. These will be limited in the number that you can complete per day to prevent players from only interacting with NPCs. The money gained from this process can be invested in creating more lucrative items for players.<br>
<br>
We can also control the market by varying the contributions to the city that Artisans are required to make. These will also be along the lines of quests, which reward the Artisan with experience while not adding to the saturation of the market.<br>
<br>
Please keep in mind that we do not intend to have a 100% player-controlled economy. We have mechanisms in place like those above that allow us a strong measure of control over the flow of goods into the marketplace.<br>

Well from the screenshots I have seen, they seem reasonable yes, much to my surprise. Happily so I might add.<br>

As for Iksar.... I swear if they give them breasts I'm going to cry. Sooo what do you all think of this? <br>

Our guild has been discussing it for a while. A female yes? What are those suspicious shadows on her armor?Should I start crying now? *snicker*<br>
<br>
Though if the char creation is as customizable as in SWG, that will be wonderful. I've spent HOURS creating some at my friend's house. There are 3-4 sliders for the nose only. Me a happy player if EQ2 is that customizable. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

And that is grinding.<br>
<br>
After everything the devs in SWG said about how important it was to having someone use your goods, the best way to skill up was still to grind and destroy.  I went from no crafting xp to Engineering IV and Business IV in a few hours of constant bofa treat grinding.<br>
<br>
This meant that items flooded the market very quickly.  And given the horrendous excuse for a Bazaar tool they have in SWG (which was limited to showing only 100 items at a time), this meant the market for some items went way down just so people could sell them.  Hardly a way to make a stable economy, right?<br>
<br>
But it seems as if the EQ team is putting more emphasis on the process rather than putting out a finished product.  It sounds like a great idea to me, and I'm looking to make my second character a tradesperson.<br>
<br>
My first will, of course, be a wizard. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/thewok/jarasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
