She stumbled with bandages trying to stem the flow, but there was too much. The river of her life was pouring out of her and spilling into the soil of Nektulos Forest. The Teir'dal strike force had come upon them quickly and savagely, slaying many. Only the relative youth of the Teir'dal prevented total victory. Now, the remnants of the force sent from Felwithe to secure the Nektulos pyramid and slow the Teir'dal¹s spreading influence lay wounded and dying. Reinforcements would no doubt arrive soon, she just needed to hold on a bit longer.<br>
<br>
As her blood filled the soil, something beneath it stirred. Bones lost and discarded soaked in the blood. Sinew and ligament tightened. With every drop that found the corpse, a bit of decay and rot peeled away, as long dead flesh found new life. Suddenly the earth around the dying Koada exploded and the rotting remains of a Teir'dal sneered and drug itself closer toward her.<br>
<br>
Desperately she tried to get away, tried to crawl to safety, but it was on her in seconds. The last thing she heard as bony claws ripped into the flesh of her neck, was a raspy unnatural voice beckoning in Teir'dal: &quot;Scream for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Through the course of the night it prayed on them, the Koada that guarded the teleportation point. With every kill the death faded away. Dry bones were wrapped in rippling muscle. The remnants of flesh grew and expanded, covering the whole of the body again. Hair and nails were the last things to return. When at last his work was done the warrior stumbled through the forest, southward until at last he collapsed at the river. <br>
<br>
The sharp sting of the cold water filled him with long lost sensation. Dipping his hands in again, he felt a stinging pain as teeth tore flesh. In a second his other hand had a hold of the piranah and was slamming it against rocks on the<br>
shore. <br>
<br>
After a meal of fresh fish, he made his way back to the teleport, avoiding anything and everything along the way. Quickly he stripped the bodies, tearing the robes and rearranging them, making them look less Koada. When at last he was done he stumbled toward Neriak.<br>
<br>
He had no trouble entering the city. As far as the guards and citizens knew, he did not exist. In the foreign quarter he found it, a stash of weapons and armor he had hidden there long ago. They weren't¹t the best but they would do.<br>
<br>
Armed and armored, it was time to begin his training. It had been a long time, his body needed to remember itself, what it could do, how far it could be pushed. Before he could begin though, he needed a drink. Sitting at the bar, an inquisitive patron approached him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ain¹t seen you about,&quot; he said, obviously looking the warrior up and down. &quot;New about these parts?&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior did not look up from his drink. &quot;I have been gone a very long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Curiosity peeked the inquisitor continued, &quot;Oh? And what brings you here now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly the warrior turned his gaze on the patron, steel like eyes drilling into the inquisitor's soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;I seek the one known as Talastius, a minion of Prime Nightmare last I saw him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The patron chuckled. &quot;A minion? Hah, you have been gone long. Talastius Anathema sits as Minister of House Affairs from what I hear.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the warrior plunked coin on the counter and got up to head out of the tavern. The patron however had more questions and was not yet prepared to let him go.<br>
<br>
&quot;So what do you seek him for anyway? He isn¹t often about these parts.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior stopped in his footsteps and turned slowly, a twisted smile contorting his face. In a voice both raspy and distant he spoke, &quot;I seek to kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The patron burst out laughing. &quot;You? Kill Anathema? By the gods man who do you think you are?&quot;<br>
<br>
A flash of steel and the patron stumbled back, a knife buried in his throat. The warrior turned and walked toward the door calling back to the dying man, and the barkeep.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Pherrizt. And he is my son.&quot;<br>

The poster takes no blame for nightmares.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis entered the darkened Nektulos forest quietly, it was late but she still had more arrows to complete for Banjok, and Spehk had wished to meet her shortly, she would have to hurry. Stalking silently in the foreboding forest she made her way towards Neriak.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Out of my way girl!&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>An old Teir'dal snarled, He shoved her as he passed. She barely moved</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
&quot;You would do well to watch your tongue,&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> She said coldly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;Lest someone remove it for you.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She turned to face the Teir'dal.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pherrizt saw her for the first time, noticing her guild badge he grinned wickedly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot; Oh forgive me my lady, I did not know that Terris Thule's lackeys were still allowed to walk on two feet.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He laughed mockingly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. &quot;Beg girl, beg that I not sever your nose and lock you in a room of mirrors. Now go and run to your masters like a good dog.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis's eyes widened at his verbal attack, the only emotion allowed to combat the extent her blood simmered</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. &quot;Oh do forgive ussta, I beg of you.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis pleaded, moving foreword to kneel.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Her sword moved like lightning as she twisted sideways. She lept, shoving him off balance as her left hand brought a dagger into his thigh. Pherrizt grunted, staggering back he wrenched the dagger from his leg and returned it with similar haste. A dull thud in the darkness announced its narrow miss.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Have it your way then, pretty.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pherrizt jeered, bringing up his blade as he lunged for her.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The clash of steel shattered the dark forest, as the two warriors engaged.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Spehk lounged against the wall near the Nektulos portal in New Taanan. He knew he was early, but his hunt had gone well, and he had finished early</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I wonder how long she will take. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He thought, as he toyed with the idea of going into Neriak to look for her.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis cursed herself silently as she ducked the incoming dagger, rolling into the safety of a tree. She lept to her feet, running in the shadow of that tree, and ducking behind a second, and then a third. The close encounter had gone badly for both, and her arms bled heavily, her left leg weakened from the deep gash it bore.<br>
<br>
They had both faltered, once begun she had been shocked at his strength, narrowly avoiding fatal blows, yet he had made even the simplest of mistakes, as if one had forgotten much, he had shown openings that she had instantly taken, yet he seemed to still of held the strength of years.<br>
<br>
Pherrizt's mad cackles floated through the forest.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;Where are you little pretty?&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He taunted.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis stilled her breathing and listened to the darkness. Quickly she moved from her stance and turned, kneeling instantly with fletchings to cheek. Pherrizt eyed her and turned with dagger in hand as she let the steel arrow fly. It found its mark, sending him slamming into the nearby dead oak, piercing his armor and pinning his arm to the tree. He grunted as the arrow hit, almost instantly breaking the shaft and continuing foreword</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Once more she retreated into the twisted beams of moonlight that streaked the dark ground of the forest. It had been the third arrow to land, and the third time he had broken it, as he continued to advance with sadistic taunts.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Once I have removed your skin I will take your bones next, one by one as I watch you squirm.....&quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis's blood ran cold as she planned her next attack. It had been the least of his brutal promises, but she had barely heard, mind focused on the task at hand</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The forest became eerily silent, and she paused. Leaning against the thick trunk of a tree. She silently drew her swords as she closed her eyes, listening for any movement.<br>
<br>
It came from the left, the slight change in wind her only warning has his blade went for her throat. The steel he hit must have shocked him but still slammed her to the ground as well. She rolled away attempting to stand. He was on her in a moment, as they tumbled down a steep bank. <br>
<br>
Sylexis tried to stand, disoriented in the full darkness and the fall. Her heart almost stopped as an icy grip encircled her throat. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Your mine now, pretty.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pherrizt growled as he dragged her to her knees.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;I am going to skin you and keep your flesh for a coat.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>He promised as he brought his face down to hers, eyes dancing with madness as he reveled in her horrified features, struggling to breathe.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Pherrizt grinned wickedly, mind racing with things he was about to do, reveling in her fear. Darkness threatened to creep on her as she struggled to...... her body relaxed, eyes closing. Pherrizt moved closer, bringing his dagger up to her face, admiring his catch. <br>
<br>
A blood curdling howl broke the silence as Pherrizt staggered to his knees, looking at the dagger in his ribs as she twisted it up, ripping it through his lung.<br>
<br>
 A wry smile danced across Sylexis's face, the hidden sheath hung from her boot that he hadn't noticed fell silently to the ground. He looked up to see her silver eyes brighten to a brilliant red, her body shaking visibly as the berserk fury of Rallos took over.<br>
<br>
Cold, bloody, murder.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis stood over the mangled body as her eyes softened to their silver tint, muscles spasming to relax from the unnatural fury. Blood dripped down her arms, landing on the corpse as she spit.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Death is nau pretty, but this was quite pleasing.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And she turned to leave.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A sickening gargle whispered behind her from the undistinguished heap</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. &quot;That may be true pretty, but that which even death loathes, may not die.&quot; <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis turned, the sight as shocking as the battle she had just taken part of. Bones and tendons mended together before her eyes, the blood she had just lost soaked into the creatures form as he began to crawl near.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;What In the Fathers name are you?!&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> She stood, eyes wide in pure shock.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I am Pherrizt, I hunt the Prime Nightmare, tell Talastius I am coming for him.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The creature smiled sadistically.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis fled.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis tensed as she stumbled through the portal into New Taanan, fully expecting to hit the ground, she was shocked to find herself inches from the ground as Spehk caught her.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Sylexis! What happened!&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Spehk demanded, his brow creased with worry as he looked at her battered form and began inspecting her for any fatal injury</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
&quot;Spehk..&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>She said weakly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. &quot;Spehk you must go, I can nau go on further, go to Talastius, tell him Pherrizt is coming, you must go.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis struggled to stand</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like hell I will, where is he, I will kill him.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Spehk looked quickly at the portal.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I already have, but it did nau work, he came to life again as i watched, you must go!&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis trembled from the attempt, her wounds still bleeding heavily.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;You are speaking nonsense Sylexis, thats not possible.&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Spehk calmly retrieved a cloth from his pouch.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I am nau joking! you must warn them, do nau worry on me, go to Talastiu.......s&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sylexis Shuddered as he placed the cloth over her mouth, frowning for a moment, she tried to speak, but her lips would not work.<br>

Darkness surrounded her as the potion took her from the waking world.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:maroon;font-family:vivaldi;font-size:medium;"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Sylexis<br>

There would be a run, a hard and long one, already the Qeynos portal had been chosen and the optimal use of strength and stamina gear decided upon.<br>
 <br>
  Running with long, easy strides, his breathing measured and regular he completed the journey's requirements, intending to bring a towering hill giant thundering along right behind him to occupy the human guards of the bridge to southern Karana. His face crinkles in a flash of amusement, there would be no time for the law enforcing pests to inquire about his cargo..He muses off-topic, even in so dire and pressured of a situation, thinking how Prime ought to have these guards on the payroll.<br>
<br>
  The gruesome nature of young Sylexis' wounds now took prominence in his thoughts. They are savage, vicious, serrated. Not precise strikes, like those a fighter still learning their craft might leave. However, the lady was no novice, on the verge of claiming true mastery of the arts of combat herself. The strikes scream of rage and pain, leading to the conclusion these harms were inflicted with raw malice, meant to cause suffering.<br>
<br>
  Dropping the loose hood of his cloak gains unhindered access to the Keep. Despite searing pains from exertion the pace continues unabated directly into the infirmary. Attendants jump into action, one off to find the most senior cleric on site, the others accepting Sylexis' limp body. Face flushed with sweat and pale, the rogue can do little but gulp air desperately, arms and legs shaking with fatigue. The adepts quickly usher the gasping savage from the room without resistance, he realizes he can only be a distraction now.<br>
<br>
  His eyes narrow with murderous intent, they seem to throb visibly, matching the pulse now infused with fury. A new energy ignites movements returned to their normal smooth efficiency. Even though it is a man that moves among the halls, visible in dim lighting, most servants describe his passing as that of a phantom. The eerie silence without an awkward gate, the fluid motions of avoiding obstructions with no loss of pace , this usually followed by mute shrugs of disbelief.<br>
<br>
  The two trolls take interest at the rapidly approaching darker spot, then relaxing to an actual slouch of ease seeing who approaches. Spehk had stepped into the light as he neared, he smelled the foul brew before the whisper met his ear from right troll. Right troll was very quick, in a panicky scared of repercussions sort of way, to inform the most easy going of the old timers &quot;da Minista's rea*urp*d ding&quot;.<br>
<br>
  Presenting a little knife , wet with something, to right troll's face the quiet man lifted that hand up. When eyes followed and head tilted back, the darkness struck. An overhand left punch connected squarely with the troll's throat, cutting off air and silencing it instantly. Bringing his knife hand down across his body clips the grasping hand of troll number two as predicted, not the wound but the shock of being cut by a Minion causing the lumbering guard to draw back a moment. That was all it got before the convulsing spasms took it, shaking it to it's knees. &quot;He reads too much anyway&quot; he grinds out, turning toward his target.<br>
<br>
  A flick of the wrist produces a small, oddly notched device. Teeth clenched in hate or rage were a strange companion to the calm manner in which the trolls are stepped around as they writhe in silence. A single fluid motion feeds the lock's keyhole and registers a distinct *click*. That same continuing motion gains the rogue the chambers of the Minister of House Affairs. Lifting that same knife, the stamped plate that labels the door is pried right out. Spehk takes the plate and throws it , with vicious force into the desk of Talastius, skipping it off papers right into his chest. <br>
<br>
  Had maybe an eyebrow lifted at this violent intrusion ? &quot;and what the hell does this mean anyway ? &quot; the shadows at the doorway shouted. &quot;Minister of everyone else's affairs, but stay the hell out of my own personal business, is what it should say, isn't that right ?&quot; <br>
<br>
  Chambers suited to a Teir'dal were crossed in two long steps, the now overbearing human leaning forward, fists planted flat on the fine, ornate desktop. Still Talastius would not so much as flinch, as much as he leaned back and to the side easily. &quot;You arrogant, aloof, self-absorbed, haughty sonuvabitch ! &quot; he spouted in ascending volume, finishing by wiping over half of the writing table's contents across the room. <br>
<br>
  &quot;You've compromised this Keep, *and* put it's younger Minions into mortal danger ! AND without so much as a 'hey, watch out , out there you guys' !&quot; <br>
<br>
  Exasperation wins, &quot;Whatever, look whatever the hell, do what you want&quot; the shadow stalker has no real understanding of how incoherent he sounds. This is about where some form of rationale is starting to seep in, somewhere underneath all these frayed emotions truths still exist. Things such as his known respect for the Knight's literacy and library. Starting to feel like a bit of an ass he plans a hasty exit. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh, I didn't kill the boys on purpose, maybe you could worry more about business than killing them. I wanted in, they had no chance&quot; <br>
<br>
  Stopping at the door, he looks squarely into Talastius' eyes, &quot;if you want in, for whatever reason. To interrogate, to say 'goodbye' *lips makes a quick jump toward a half-smile*. My objective is not sub-dual. You have ten minutes to get outta that and into field gear.&quot; Not completing a step, the rogue backs up, the tilt of Tal's head indicating he's ready .<br>
<br>
  The human was playful, despite any misery, any despair. He waited four slow, pounding heartbeats, then in a flat and direct voice &quot;Our target's name is Pherizzt&quot; .<br>
