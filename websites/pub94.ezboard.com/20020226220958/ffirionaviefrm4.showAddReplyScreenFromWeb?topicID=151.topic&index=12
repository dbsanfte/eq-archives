align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> Brother it has nothing to do with alignment it has to do with choices. You chose a Dwarf Cleric of Brell - following ANY history of the Dwarven Conflicts with Evils or their building of Elven Cities or wars with humans and Ogres all from Lore on the EQ page would show you which direction your path would have lead. You looked at it more as I wanna group with anyone like you just said so that was your priority it WASNT Roleplay by any means at all. Like I said before it was your choice so was the choosing of Evoc as your specialty. Myself and others mentioned what the true calling of a celric is especially in the chosing of Specialization skills and you didnt even know what the skills were for. I can't blame you for not roleplaying esp when you dont know what your class limits and uses are so I wont. In a world where BRELL would truely control your spell ability, the first time you grouped with an Ogre, created by Rallos - Brells enemy, you'd LOSE your casting ability as a Cleric. Stormwind is true neutral forced by Verant since all druids are this but I follow Tunare. To group with DEs or Ogres or Iksars is just ludicrous from a roleplay perspective so I dont do it. You made your bed, you chose your style of play and the need for gear or groups far over any roleplay sense and thats how you want it , fine no biggie. Still boggles me how you wanted to join Covenant of Truth a purely N/G aligned guild, note the GOOD in that, but didnt see how we would have issues of you grouping with evils or supporting dwarven killers or such beasts, which was fine by you. Either you dont know what roleplay is, you dont care or just dont care what other ppl's style of RP is. So be it brother, no sweat really. You made the choices and avoided all insight anyone suggested to you as truth or near truth and joined an N/E guild so dont expect us to aid you. Sorry but we as roleplayers of good, reguardless of the added alignment by Verant, dont help those who aid evils in any way ...... THATS ROLEPLAY, thanks  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukarlithas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karlithas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/5/01 12:04:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> I don't get it.  Alot of people are talking how the TLC, language barrier, difficulty in finding groups in general ARE hampering the RP opportunities.  I want to know what do all these have to do with your capability to Roleplay?  Don't get me wrong, I am not accusing anybody here.  I am just curious to why people think these factors would affect the Roleplaying atmosphere in the game.<br>
<br>
-Does TLC, Language barrier, and lack of grouping opportunities make FV a harder server to play and enjoy?<br>
<br>
* Definitely a yes.  These rules make FV one of the hardest servers to play AND enjoy the entire game other than the PvP servers.<br>
<br>
-Does TLC, language barrier, and lack of grouping makes people on FV unable to roleplay or lessen the RP opportunity?<br>
<br>
* I don't know.  Does the server rules actually limit people's ability to interact in an IN-character fashion?  Does the server rules affects how a good aligned should react to an evil aligned?  Does the server rules demand how a dwarf should react at the sight of an ogre (taking into their racial history in consideration)?  <br>
All the answers are NO.  It is the P-E-O-P-L-E that is responsible for that part, not the server rules.  <br>
<br>
Hate FV for being a harder server and possible less enjoyment o the ENTIRE ASPECT of the game (but come on, let's face it, when is the last time we get to enjoy EVERYTHING in life?) , don't complain about FV limiting your so called &quot;RP&quot; capabilities.<br>
It is you who determine what RP is and not server rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugiordanaeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GiordanaEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/5/01 7:23:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Uhm thought this was a roleplay server...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Does TLC, language barrier, and lack of grouping makes people on FV unable to roleplay or lessen the RP opportunity?&quot;<br>
<br>
TLC is unrealistic in a roleplay sense, I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's no reason why a seasoned warrior couldn't kill a much weaker foe and take all its belongings.  And as for Verant's excuse that it's not realistic that you'd know what it dropped in the first place, well what if you can actually see the weapon that it's hitting you with and then you kill it and the weapon disappears just because you were so much stronger than it was?  And that's supposed to make sense on an in-character level??  /boggle<br>
<br>
Language barrier hampers roleplay by making it much harder to communicate with others, and how can you roleplay if you can't communicate?  In real life if you don't speak someone else's language you can use gestures, point to things, learn specific key words that you can use to help you.  In the game you can't do that except for certain fixed emotes.  You can point at another character or NPC, but not at a thing, and you can't ask &quot;how do I say 'sand giant' in Ogre?&quot; so you can warn the ogre you're fighting with if you happen to see one approaching.  Besides, it's not realistic to think that people who live so close to each other would know nothing of each other's language.  And so on.<br>
<br>
Lack of grouping doesn't in itself have to hamper roleplay, it's just what I've observed.  If you spend all your time soloing, while it's true you might be roleplaying and have a finely developed concept of your character and their history and beliefs and everything else, if you're not interacting with anyone else, what is the point?<br>
<br>
&quot;Does the server rules actually limit people's ability to interact in an IN-character fashion?&quot;<br>
<br>
The rules limit people's ability to interact in ANY fashion, in or out of character.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does the server rules affects how a good aligned should react to an evil aligned?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, to a certain extent, yes.  Suppose a good aligned cleric of Nife wants to heal the wounds of an evil warrior of Zek, because she believes it is her duty to heal all wounds, but she can't because of alignment?  Some say this is enforcing roleplaying because a good aligned character shouldn't want to assist an evil aligned character; others say it's limiting roleplay by forcing characters to behave in a certain faction.  I don't have as much of a problem with the alignment rules as I do some of the others.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does the server rules demand how a dwarf should react at the sight of an ogre (taking into their racial history in consideration)?&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually?  If the dwarf were stronger, he'd probably kill the ogre.  But unless the ogre agrees to a duel, he couldn't do that here.  About the only way he could react that the ogre would understand, would be /rude<br>
 <br>
&quot;All the answers are NO. It is the P-E-O-P-L-E that is responsible for that part, not the server rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
True... my main complaint is that the server rules foster isolation, which isn't conducive to roleplay.<br>
