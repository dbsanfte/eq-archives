<br>
The indignation comes from those with a sense of fair play and dignity. Honesty and Honor are sacrificed upon the alter of the rule book by those that choose to operate outside the agreed upon ruleset. <br>
<br>
Each of us entered the game thinking that the playing field was leveled, each of us had equal chance of earning plat, raising tradeskills, and completing quests/epics. Enter in people that disobey the rules for (even though it is in game) personal gain, and that playing field is no longer level.<br>
<br>
Frankly it no longer becomes a matter of &quot;why should you care what someone does with their money&quot; because at its base level, it could be any infraction of the rules. How would you feel if you realized the other team in pictionary was using sign language to communicate the answer, while drawing jibberish on the board? As the banker in Monopoly would you offer to loan a player a sizable amount of cash at 30% intrest compounded at each passing of GO? Or as a player would you condone it?<br>
<br>
The parable of the automobile speeder was not a bad one, only in that it did not spell it out for the knee-jerk morons who haunt these boards to merely flame posters. <br>
Do people knowingly choose to speed down the road? =Yes<br>
Do they perform this unlawful act cognizant of the possible reppercussions? =Yes<br>
<br>
So what is the difference? Speed and seatbelt laws are enforced. Buying plat and characters, utilizing exploits, and taking unfair advantage of in game bugs ~may or may not~ be enforced. We as isolated individuals behind a mulitutde of computers are not aware of any enforcement of the ruleset.<br>
<br>
You cannot drive down the intersate for more than an hour and not see someone pulled over. The very presence and visibility of the Highway Patrol is in itself a deterrent, and reminder of the consequences.<br>
<br>
Until Sony posts publically that they have shut down people that we all suspect are performing gross misconduct, we will never know. The honest folk continue to feel neglected and impotent, and the dishonest have no evidence that what they are doing will get them caught.<br>
<br>
There is a key word involved here that I have not seen used.<br>

It is not within our pervue to correct it, that lies with Sony. They have not done enough to police this, and the responsibilty lies with them to do so. To ostrasize or fellow gamers and guild mates only targets the symptom, not the ailment and it the end is futile.<br>

It is Sony's responsibility to fix this, we either have to suffer through it, or not click on the ACCEPT button.<br>

I can not accept that a lack of ethics is tolerated simply because the offenders aren't caught. If drinking and driving was legal tommorrow, I still would not do it because I could kill somebody. Right and wrong are simply that. If you choose wrong, it doesn't matter if the police come and slap handcuffs on you. You won't go to jail for cheating on your girlfriend, but it is still wrong. Many people do it every day. Many don't get caught. None are arrested for it. I still condemn them as cheaters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caillougna>Caillou GNA</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/dot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pebble with a bow</span><br>  Posts: 2204<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/03 6:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4286.topic&index=126>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.tshrew.net/caillou/sigs/smile.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buying Platinum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you are breaking the rules, any of the rules, then you are not an ethical person.

<br>
I agree with most of what you are saying -except- it is also the community who gives consequences not just an outside entity.  <br>
<br>
Let's take the driving example.  If  you know some one who recklessly speeds all the time but does not get into accidents yet gives the other drivers around him and his passengers strife because of his driving, would you willingly choose that person over another who is also driving to the same destination?  How about if it is a person who drinks a shot or two before driving, never gotten into an accident and never gotten pulled over for it, but is that a person you would -choose- to ride with?  So, we as a commuity take the laws of the road one step further, we don't just say &quot;okay whatever&quot; we do, to some extent, ostracise a person who breaks speeding laws, especially blatantly.<br>
<br>
So... yes, it is Sony's responsibility to do something about those &quot;services&quot; which buy and sell in-game characters, items, and money for RL money and those who deal with them as well.    But, if you are not condemning it, you -are- condoning it and accepting it and making it possible to do it without any repercussions (there has been said many times on many places those that petition or report the known buyers and sellers are jsut tattle-tales and should be ostracised for that).<br>
<br>
I think the choice of breaking the rules in -any- game is wrong.  Does it mean the person is entirely shit?  no.  The person could be a decent person, but he is still wrong for buying or selling.  The -action- is wrong. <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">

I've hunted greenies, I've farmed trade skill goodies for others, i've farmed items to sell so i can get a better item.  I guess i'm miffed that the time i've spent doing all this has made those stupid pixels pretty much worthless.

Yes and by staying in the United States you are agreeing to abide by the rules established by the government that resides here.  You agree to the system.<br>

<br>
As for people who buy or sell being shitty players ... it all depends on the player.  I have botted clerics, warriors, monks, sks, wizards, and while I'm not the best I'm sure the hell better than some people I have met that &quot;earned&quot; it.  Would I buy a character?  The only time that was even a consideration was when I was trying to buy Zsu back.<br>
<br>
As for the EULA ... oh god its been explained quite a few times as to why thats there.  You know why?  Because Sony didn't want to have to deal with the results of people scamming other people.  <br>
<br>
THAT'S RIGHT ITS TO SAVE SONY'S LEGAL ASS, ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE EVERY OTHER EULA YOU WILL EVER SEE.<br>

In game there is damn little you can do.<br>
Out of game there is not much more.<br>
<br>
To condone it, is to sacrifice your own moral standards.<br>
To condemn it (outside of your own emotional responses), without an effective means to correct it, is futile and only leads to unenjoyment of the game and high blood pressure.<br>
<br>
By all means, take up the banner of your rightousness. Just be certain you are waving it in the faces of those that can fix this. Otherwise you are a petulant preaching griefer who would have nothing to say if there were no soapbox to stand upon.<br>
<br>
I invite you to buy a table at the next Fan Faire.<br>
Set up a petition, make it on legal form.<br>
Get your signatures, make them known to Sony through the avenues that they understand, and will respond to. Waste not your time and efforts here where the combined intellectual level seems lower than my kneecap.<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with your take on this travesty. It just seems you are shouting the injustice of not being able to run a mile, to a room full of the blind and paralyzed.<br>

If someone buying plat is able to &quot;ruin&quot; your EQ playing experience then you are a very shallow person and should prolly find another hobby. Politics would prolly be a good choice for someone w/ this mentality<br>

I see no difference in a character twinked by a high end character, and someone who bought plat to twink a character. And on that note how many of you have kicked someone from your group for being a super twink?...prolly none because that person is helping you at the time, and how do you know they didnt pay for that char w/ RL cash?<br>
<br>
And for all the people that are mad cause some people choose to bend the rules on a video game. I would REALLY love to follow you around for a day or 2 and point out every rule/law that you choose to ignore. My guess is that you would break far more than you would imagine and they are prolly alot more serious than someone having better pixels on their stickman than you have. (IE you neglect to use your blinker and cause a traffic accident which either injures or kills innocent people in the process)<br>
<br>
So instead of ranting and raving about someone doing something you dont agree with but causes no real damage to you or anyone around you, Go and rant and rave about something important like tougher penaltitys for people who neglect to use their blinker...atleast you might get some satisfaction out of that one, cause Sony isnt gonna lift a finger to track down the plat sellers.<br>

The depth and complexity of the arguments presented makes it obvious that &quot;shallow&quot; is the wrong adjective to use in describing people concerned about the integrity of the game sue to rampant rule-breaking.  If anything, the more cavalier ideal of ignoring wrongdoing until it affects <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>you directly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> seems more shallow to me.<br>

I've already run in one election, thanks.  Maybe I'll go back to it later.  But that wouldn't be a hobby, that would be civil service and possibly a career.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I see no difference in a character twinked by a high end character, and someone who bought plat to twink a character.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I do.  For starters a person twinked by a high level character gets some instructions passed on along the way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And on that note how many of you have kicked someone from your group for being a super twink?...prolly none because that person is helping you at the time, and how do you know they didnt pay for that char w/ RL cash?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have.  On more than one occasion. Why?  Because they had no clue how to play the character properly and they were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> helping the group.  They were hindering it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And for all the people that are mad cause some people choose to bend the rules on a video game.

<br>
I keep aware of the laws I break.  It doesn't mean I don't break laws.  But I have a reason when I do and I consider the impact on those around me.  <br>
<br>
See there are laws, but then there is also something called the social contract.  The social contract is not an official, codified system like law.  It's a collection of customs and beliefs designed to make daily life manageable for a society.  There is no law, for example, that enforces standing in line at the restaurant.  It's just that society fails to fuction correctly if people don't line up.  So people do it.  In theory, a restaurant owner can choose to eject people who ignore lines, and the police will enforce their right to eject people but how often does that happen?  Almost never.  Because the social contract is self-perpetuating and self-enforcing.<br>
<br>
So when people buy platinum I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>far</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->less concerned that they've broken the rules than I am that they have violated the social contract.  Thus it doesn't matter what Sony does to discourage buying, what matters is what we, the members of the community, can do to bring about and maintain the environment we wish to spend our leisure time in.<br>
<br>

<br>
One or two people buying some platinum doesn't really affect us.  One or two people making billions from exploits, flooding the market and devaluing the currency to the point where honest players can no longer play the game as it was intended for them to play, does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erivthedrow>ErivTheDrow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/03 10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4286.topic&index=132>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buying Platinum</span><hr size=1> ok but you still havent shown me how someone can ruin your fun by buying or selling plat...is it because market prices arent where &quot;you&quot; think they should be or what?.../shrug<br>
<br>
And congrats you kicked a twinked moron out of your group. However you did not just kick them out for being a twink. Now if they were to have played their class to the T would you still haved kicked them out? Idiots come from everywhere, you cant just label the ppl who bought plat as the idiots..Ive met far more morons in newbie gear than in twink gear<br>
<br>
Im willing to bet that most of the ppl buying plat are ppl that DO know how to play the game and prolly have been playing for some time on another server and decided to switch and didnt wanna start from scratch again. Or its someone here who sees something on the famous Shananna or Boog (who is the MAIN source of plat for sale on this server. Buy char strip gear sell char and gear for plat sell plat for cash) and wants it bad enuff to spare some of their hard earned RL money for it.<br>
<br>
And I am against Exploits just as much as the next person. But this thread isnt about Exploiters its about bashing ppl who buy plat not bashing exploiters<br>
<br>
Even if all these so-called-exploits got fixed do you think that will end plat for sale...sorry but it wont, a skilled high lvl player who wants to make a lil extra cash could easily farm 100k or more a day and sell it for RL cash.<br>

He outfitted me in a nearly full set of Split Paw gear, and a completely uber Validus Custodus Axe (it was +magic! I could kill wisps!).<br>

I am not opposed to buying plat because that means I dont have to spend all those retarded hours in Lake Rathe with all the other KS farming plat freaks. Just saves alot of stress and time. I did however do all the crap the hard way. Hunted, saved money for ages, went out bought nice armor and a new horse. Then went planar. Have you any idea how shitty the loot is in the planes? How the hell is anyone supposed to GM a skill selling goo, feathers, and bolts? Lets face it farming Crushbone is more profitable. HOWEVER, on the other hand there are those ceratin people who also seem to have all the plat that also have all that really UBER gear. They price the crap so high you basically have to buy plat to get the gear. This seems to have a weird effect on the bazaar economy-TRUE.So my solution to this problem? Take yer lazy butts out and do a quest for gear, use plat you bought for trade skills, or buying gear at normal prices, and use the planes for fab xp and dont suffer the shitty loot part. Just a thought.

When I was in Highpass Hold a long time ago, I grouped with a twinked rogue who had more AC and HP than  I did as a warrior of the same level.  He trivialized all our encounters that day and my guildmates who were with me generally agreed that he did spoil much of our fun.  <br>
<br>
A lot of EQ is about winning.  While FV is a player-vs-environment server, it spoils everyone's fun when a hard-won victory is trivialized by someone who bought their way to success. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ansurfv>AnsurFV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.vampyra.com/demons/images/demonicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 644<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/03 1:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4286.topic&index=138>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.vampyra.com/demons/images/demonicon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Buying Platinum</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>ok but you still havent shown me how someone can ruin your fun by buying or selling plat...is it because market prices arent where &quot;you&quot; think they should be or what?.../shrug<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Haha. I think that quote was from someone before Platgate macro scandle. <br>
<br>
I guess one could still argue that the purchased platinum does not spoil the game. It's ethics (or lack of them) of the people buying and selling plat that have a negative effect on those who don't cheat. I'm not sure I could justify following such a person once I knew. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4286.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4286.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4286.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4286.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4286.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=4286.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=4286.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=4286.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4286.topic&index=138><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=4286.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4286.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4286.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
