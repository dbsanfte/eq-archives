src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Rare mobs and decency...</span><hr size=1> My old server started out trying a calendar.  We even had one set up on EQVault for a time.  It fell apart because the top tier guilds refused to acknowledge it and many mid tier guilds took their leads from them.<br>
<br>
The top two guilds had a rotation system, you see.  Basically every time one of the top guilds became capable of killing a mob, they farmed the hell out of that mob as often as they possibly could before they had competition.  When the second guild to kill the mob finally was able to, that second guild pretty much always tried to farm that mob non-stop as well.  They figured hey...guild 01 got the mob for the last 2 months non-stop, now we should.<br>
<br>
That's when guild 01 pounded them into the ground until guild 02 came to them and worked out a deal.  Pretty much every single major mob went that way.  (Pounded them into the ground as in...raced them for every single spawn, regardless of timezone...if they were second to the mob, following directly behind during the raid lagging the hell out of everyone...jumping over corpses after a wipeout...pulling past a raid that was buffing...etc)<br>
<br>
So what happened when a third or fourth guild became capable?  Well, they obviously didn't fit into the rotation, and so that mob became a free for all.<br>
<br>
Basically that's how our server worked.  If you were buffed and ready, and the mob hadn't been pulled, you pull him and kill him.  If the guild racing you wasn't ready...too bad.  There were times when the difference between getting a mob and not getting one was literally seconds.  I remember a time when a guild pulled Severillious as the other guild was giving the pull order.  15 seconds later you could see the second guild shouting...he's gone...who pulled him???<br>
<br>
This happened unless you had worked out an arrangement with another guild.  Arrangements worked out between two guilds never extended to anyone else, and working out arrangements didn't guarantee you a mob...only that the guild you were working with wouldn't compete for that mob during alternating spawns.  There were times when two guilds who agreed to rotate spawns actually would work together when a third guild started gathering to take that mob to ensure that those two guilds got that loot and that noone lost their turn in the rotation.<br>
<br>
In my mind, that's the only way a non-calendar system can work.  You cannot say...well, we'll respect the people who are in the zone and trying for the mob.  The bottom line is, your guild cares about your guild members more than you care about someone else.  When that someone else is level 52 and trying to scrape together a pickup raid...well it's very easy to think to yourself, &quot;I'll be damned if I'm gonna let some level 52 newbie scrape together a pickup raid and deny OUR cleric who is level 60 and has done yadda yadda yadda for MY guild HIS epic.&quot;  The dominant guilds will always underestimate the capabilities of the guilds under them.  They will always justify reasons for moving past people who are already there.  They will even get to the point of ignoring others in the zone and just going about their business in &quot;retaliation&quot; for some triviality in which they feel wronged by the other guild.  (We actually had one guild charge past another guild to kill Sontalak because months before the two guilds had raced for a miniboss in Hate and felt disrespected.)<br>
<br>
FnF and Reso can work out all the arrangements they want, but that's not going to help anyone else in any way, shape, or form.  In fact, top guilds working out arrangements amongst themselves even be detrimental to smaller guilds, as walking away from a spawn for a smaller guild can mean that you give up your turn in any rotation you've worked out.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for Blayze.  I feel bad for his guild.  I know what having even one epic in guild can mean for a guild.  Wipe recovery time goes from over an hour down to under a half hour.  It can mean the difference between being able to make only a single attempt at a mob in a night, to being able to make two or three attempts at a mob.  That can be a huge help towards learning how to place, pull, and fight a mob without having to resort to just surfing the web for the spoiler on how other guilds kill it.  I also know that cleric epics provide diminishing returns and not every cleric in a guild needs one, yet every single cleric in a guild feels compelled to have one.<br>
<br>
The people of Firiona Vie make it what it is, but unfortunatly when the top flight guilds declare the server first come, first serve, that's what it becomes.  The guild that was in Skyfire with lethal force buffed and ready to go first, was the first to get served.<br>
<br>
Blayze, if you were actually able to get a pickup raid together within 20 minutes of Ragefire poping, you'll get your epic.  It's just a matter of time.  Best of luck to you and hopefully the pain of camping that son of a bitch will be over for you soon.<br>
<br>
This server isn't special.  This server isn't a delicate snowflake.  Get together and figure out how you want it to be, or the greediest, most selfish, most ignorant players will make the decisions for you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=farnoak>Farnoak</A> at: 7/14/02 12:21:39 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
