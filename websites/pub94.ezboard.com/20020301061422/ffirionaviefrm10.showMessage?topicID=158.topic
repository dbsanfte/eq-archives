Care for a batwing crunchy? No? Hmmm… too bad, they’re quite delicious. Anyhow, glad to meet you. My name is Snout. Yes, an unusual name, but it’s more of a nickname than anything. Well, I’m a servant of Tunare and I hail from the Surefall Glade north of Qeynos City. I did not choose to serve the Mother of All, she chose me. It happened near fifteen years ago now… but I will get to that later…<br>
<br>
I was but a youth, my first season away from hearth and home. I found work with the Atonican Bards. My job? Running mail and messages from Qeynos to Surefall Glade and back. It was not an exciting job, but it paid well enough! Aye, when my friends were toiling away on the Qeynos docks for mere silvers and coppers, I was coming home each night with GOLD in my pockets!<br>
<br>
Despite my affiliation with the good bards, they showed no real interest in allowing me to join their ranks. I couldn’t carry a tune (and still can’t!). I know two songs, but forget them both…(maybe Happy Birthday and some other one…) Sigh. I had no future with the song weavers, but I remained a messenger none the less (as the gold was good!).<br>
<br>
I remember the fateful day well… I was heading north on the stone road connecting Qeynos to Surefall Glade through Qeynos Hills. It was early morning and the rain was coming in buckets, the fog was so thick you couldn’t see your hand two inches from your own face! Lighting flashed, thunder crashed. Karana was unleashing his fury upon the hills. <br>
<br>
As I passed the stone marker just south of the Sayer’s store, I hailed Guard Nash. He is a quiet sort, but a loyal and good protector. A true knight of Qeynos. We talked briefly and he bid me farewell (he saw a fire beetle and you know the story… Halt! Halt! Prepare to die a firebeetle_001). Anyway, I continued on my way… <br>
<br>
Up the way just a bit, not even a mile, I came nose to nose, snout to Snout with … with… a Gnoll Scout! Oh, in all my travels, I had never encountered such a creature. Guard Nash and his partner Guard Leopold did well to keep the highway clear of danger! And here I was, alone. I was helpless … and the gnoll… “Yap Yap Yap Filthy Half Elves like you have ruined your own lands, you will not ruin mine! Prepare to die!” Well, I did just that… I prepared to die… <br>
<br>
At that second, a dark shadow blanketed the both of us, the dog-faced killer and me… as a bear … a mighty grizzly … towered over us… and roared… I just dropped to my knees and awaited the inevitable.<br>
<br>
I didn’t see it, but I heard it. No words can describe what I heard… but it was horrible… and beautiful… when I looked up, there was no gnoll. Just bloody, mangled pieces of flesh, fur, meat, bone… cloth… of what used to be a gnoll scout. Sitting in the mess, and looking rather content, was this bear. Oh, I knew I was next. <br>
<br>
I quietly prayed that when Guard Nash arrived, he would be able to identify some of the pink pudding that was me, to give some word to my family of my fate. But the bear just looked at me. And it spoke! (yes, bears do speak (to druids and rangers, of course))<br>
<br>
“Snout, I have spared your life this day so that you will serve me, Tunare, the Mother of All. From this day forward, you are now my servant and will do my will. When you arrive in Surefall Glade, bring this note to the Te’Anara. She will guide you in the way of the priest of nature. This is your calling, and you are to obey.”<br>
<br>
At that, the bear simply walked off. Leaving me alone, in the mud. Soggy, shaking, and splattered with gnoll parts. Stuffing the note into my mail bag, I did not delay. Hours later I arrived at the glade. Exhausted, drenched, filthy, alive.<br>
<br>
Thus, my first day as a druid, a servant of Tunare. I continue on the path selected for me by the Mother and I do not look back. It is the way for me until it is time for me to reside through eternity with her. <br>
<br>
Fare thee well, and good day to you! Thanks for listening to my tale and too bad you don’t want a batwing crunchy. They’re quite good, really.<br>
