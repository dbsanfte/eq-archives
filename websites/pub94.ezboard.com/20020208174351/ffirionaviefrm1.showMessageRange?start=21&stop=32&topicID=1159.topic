<br>
They are right though, this isn't your every day server.  Most times when I find someone to group with, if I like them, they get added to my friends list.  And if they're on, they're welcome to come group with me.  But then, I don't care how fast the experience bar goes up.  I see people all the time who haven't made it past 30, but have developed their characters more than most probably ever will...<br>
<br>
Granted, no one wants to run around as a level 1 character...but then, if you're only here to get to 60...it's probably the wrong server for you.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie will be the server where Epics are Epic.  Where dragons aren't paltry.  Where fights are won by the skin of your teeth.  And where heroes and legends are made from your character's actions and personality more than what mobs they've killed and gear they've gained...  it's not a server for everyone.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think had I started EverQuest on Firiona Vie, I'd have left it for a different server.  But I've played on those other servers.  I've been through the low levels, twinks, high levels, the high level game (tm), and now I'm here.  I like Firiona Vie for the people and for the game.  It's not the same game on any other server and it never will be...  so anyone who comes here looking to play EverQuest is probably in for a shock.  On Firiona Vie, you play FVQuest ;-)<br>
<br>
But then, when I came, I brought my crew with me.  And I made enough friends here that I'm never at a loss for company or grouping...people just have to decide what they want out of the game.  Some will come, some will go.  We'll always be a server with a low population and that's good.  When you go into the rough icy wastelands you shouldn't see a thousand people taming it, otherwise it's not much of a rough icy wasteland.  <br>
<br>
But if that's not what you want, you're not bad or wrong for not wanting the same as me.  Or as anyone for that matter.  We're all allowed our different opinions, to each his own...  like I said, some will go, more will come...that's EverQuest for ya ;-) <p><html><DIV>

<br>
Hmm, I like that. WHAOMP! Takes off Wessley's head and puts it in his bag...Think I'll keep it...<br>
<br>
Anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , is there anyone besides Bjond who is upper thirties on this thread? Reason I ask is the reading I have done indicates that folks under 30 say there is no problem finding groups, those over say it is quite tough. <br>
<br>
I, for one, can attest to the fact that the lower levels 12 and under are well stocked. Just rerolled my two chars (not a power gamer, just like playing different chars), and there seems to be an influx. Whether others are rerolling or these are new folk is uncertain, but there is no way to know peoples frame of reference without knowing the level range they are in. Sooo, I'm going to ask. If you are in the 40s range, what is your opinion?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is my concern is not only with roleplay, but with advancement. I weigh both equally. I like leveling, but I also like he interaction, trades (just hit master smith in Qeynos area if anyone needs banded or forged weapons btw). I don't want to get to that level and find that the system (as has been indicated) tosses a wrench in the works that is causing people to throw up their hands and quit.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I love this server-great folks on it, but to me its not ONLY about roleplay, its about eventually getting to the level to do raids, getting my epics, doing the plains, slaying the gods etc. My reason for being here is to play the game the way I always thought it should be played: in char, limited twinkage, and getting to the top eventually. It all maters to me and I don't want to forgo raiding anymore then I want to deal with dewds anymore. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
If I were to just wander around and visit some high level zones, in an attempt to find a group, I would have no luck.  I've tried it myself, actually, and it just won't work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> However</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, as part of a guild, I don't have any trouble finding a group when I'm in the mood for one (despite the majority of the guild being out of grouping range).  It's just a matter of asking on guildchat if anyone wants to group up and fight someplace.<br>
<br>
Likewise, I have a few people on my friends list who I know are in something approximating the same level range who I can throw a /tell to from time to time and ask where they're hunting, etc.<br>
<br>
If someone's having difficulties finding groups on FV in the higher levels, it's because they've been too busy power levelling and haven't taken the time to make any friends.  This happened to me, so I speak from experience <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I outlevelled all the friends I had made, so I had to make an effort to find some new ones.  Now, not only have I found some friends of similar level, a lot of my friends from early on have started to catch up (or is it just that I've started to slow down?).  Whatever the case, it's not at all difficult for me to find a group anymore, even at level 43, but I do have to usually get a group together (ie, tell a few people, everyone port/jog/spire hop to the location, etc).  Finding a pick-up group is still pretty much impossible.<br>
<br>
Also, planning on the web helps a lot.  We've been setting up groups in advance on our guild website a lot (ie Does anyone want to go to such-n-such a place this weekend with me?).  That way we don't have to lose a lot of playtime getting everyone out to the place we'll be hunting.<br>

I think this thread and the other thread are spawns of, and reaction to, short term frustration.  Which I have had my share of as well (but that's because I am a Ninja looting, chain nuking, &quot;Hey, let me pull!&quot;, enchanter.  And my only real goal in game is to Kill Shintou(sp).  He must be running from me since I never see him.)<br>

All said, FV is home to many of EQ's finest citizens.<br>
Verant has shown tremendous patience with letting unique servers develop without mucking with them much.  I don't see FV being on the chopping blocks anytime soon.<br>

Because off all of the stated things above. Oh and you can solo as a cleric it's not that hard *grin*. The big thing about this server is that pickup grouping is a thing of the past, the popluation is so small that you tend to know how alot more of the folks are. And the population is so low that you don't see large static zones with just pickup groups. Zones that you would expect to see 100+ folks in are now empty exept for a few folks with there friends, it more of a community. As for getting to 60 we have our share of powergamers it very possible that if 60 is your goal you can acheive it on this server. I'm not takeing that part of the game very seriously on this server, but there are those out there that are.<br>

BTW, Lexxi, I think the ruleset and the RP issues are somewhat orthogonal.  The reason they intersect isn't because the rules support RP, but because the rules were introduced and remain in place on the RP server.  The rules that do impact RP are of a coercive and limitting nature rather than of a creativity supporting nature.<br>
<br>
I've seen some high level folk complain about friends leaving, but I'm not there yet, so I don't know.  The only time it makes sense to PL (which is just a subset of PG, btw) is when you already have more than enough friends at upper levels or also PL'ing.  Personally, I like the game at all levels, so I play through it.  Well, I do like the 30-55 range a bit more than the others.  Those are the levels where you have many choices in what you can do for fun and your class really differentiates.<br>
<br>
I'm really impressed with the dedication of some of the RP'ers on this server.  I like to stay in character, but actually acting it all out is pretty amazing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usulig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sulig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/24/02 4:13:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1159.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server health=Excellent</span><hr size=1> Not that this means that the server population isn't declining, since I don't really see how any of us could really tell anyway, but I wanted to let everyone know I am moving to FV, and I'm bringing friends with me!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Currently there are 4 of us coming and we expect to have a gnome rogue, dwarf cleric, and 2 dwarven warriors.
